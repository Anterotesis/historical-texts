            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Virtuous and Religious
Gentlewoman, Mrs. M. P.</head>
            <p>IT is not the excellency of the Gift,
but your Goodness that must render
this small <hi>Manual</hi> acceptable to
you, of which having had so great
experience, I cannot doubt its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
            <p>And knowing your devout Inclinations
towards books of this nature, I could not
think of a more pleasing return for your
many Favours, than this <hi>Jacobs Ladder,</hi>
whereby your Soul may Ascend to Heaven,
and make known all your wants, and (by
Faith accompanying your Prayers) may
receive answers to all your holy Desires, and
Petitions.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but many have done Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
yea, much excelled in this kind;
but I have found, though there are many
<pb facs="tcp:93068:4"/>
Manuals of private Devotion; yet there
are very few for Families, which Want, I
have heard complained of; and therefore
though I could not better employ my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
hours, than to make a Collection of
some dayly Prayers, that might be both
plain, and pertinent: and indeed, the
<hi>Family-Devotions</hi> were my first design;
only I thought that to make it compleat
and conformable to others of this nature,
it will be convenient to add some <hi>Private</hi>
and <hi>Occasional Devotions,</hi> together
with some brief <hi>Meditations</hi> of the vanity
of mans life, and certainty of his death,
which we can never too much think of, nor
too soon prepare for.</p>
            <p>If you, or any other, reap any benefit
by it, I have my desire; If it be not well,
it is because I could not help it; however,
I doubt not but you will accept the will
for the deed, because it is from</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>DEvotion</hi> is the hearts warmth, or
rather the life-blood of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
It is a sacred <hi>bond</hi> knitting the
Soul unto God: It is a Spiritual
<hi>Muscle</hi> moving only upward, and
lifting the heart, eyes, and hands
continually to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Whosoever desires to make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

frame in his mind,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> the <hi>Form</hi> which must be,</p>

that in me, that is, in my flesh
dwelleth no good; that I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to think, nor have will to desire, nor
grace to will any good: O Lord let
me consider, that my comforts in this

crosses and troubles many and great;
my pleasures here are momentary

my wants and infirmities are great,
my helps are weak, my assaults and

deeds are few, and they tainted with
Imperfections, but my ill deeds are
infinite. Let these considerations, O

Christ may raise me; and wound
me in my self, that Christ may heal
me. And O Lord, who this day ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest

               <p>LOrd teach us to Pray, that
we may call upon thy
Name: Prepare our
hearts to seek, and open
thou thy ears Mercifully
to hear us. O Eternal and Everliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lord God, Creator and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Preserver of all things, both
in Heaven and in Earth, by whose
gracious Providence, as we were
at the first wonderfully and fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Made; so we are no less preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and kept unto this present: We
the Workmanship of thy own
hands, desire to humble both Soul
and Body before thee. And now,
O Lord, we being here in thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93068:30"/>
cannot but acknowledg and
confess against our selves, our own
unworthiness to come before thee
to call upon thee, or to perform
even the least Duty that shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
thy Worship and Glory. Our
hearts alas, are no better then the
sink of sin, and a mass of all Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and uncleanness. Wheresore O
dear God, most meek and Merciful
Father, we poor Wretches, heartily
beseech thee, to be Gracious unto
us, for Jesus Christ thy Sons sake,
for his Death sake, for thy Promise,
Truth, and Mercies sake, have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon us; Pardon us and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us all our Sins, Iniquities, and
Trespasses, whatsoever we have
committed against thee, in thought,
Word, or Deed, Ever, or at any
time hitherto, by any meanes. Dear
Father have mercy upon us, though
we be poor, yet our Christ is Rich,
though we be sinners, he is Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
though we be impure, yet
he is Pure and Holy; for his sake
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93068:30"/>
therefore, O Lord, have mercy
upon us, and Write thy Law in our
Hearts; engrave it in our Minds,
we heartily beseech thee. And let
us this Morning of thy Holy Day,
wholly turn unto thee, with all
our Hearts, Minds, Thoughts,
Deeds, and Meditations, that we
may joyn in Praises to thy holy
Name, for thy preservation of us
the night past, and refreshing us
with sweet sleep; and let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
thy loving kindness in the
Morning, on thy Holy and Blessed
Sabbath-Day; for it is thy Will
and Commandement that we should
Sanctifie this thy Day unto thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and in Praise unto thee, and
offer up unto thee a morning Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Praises, and Thanksgiving,
and to hear what thy Spirit, by the
preaching of thy Word, shall speak
unto us thy Servants: O let not
our sins stand as a cloud to stop
our Prayers from Ascending up
unto thee, or to keep back thy
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93068:31"/>
Grace from Descending, by thy
Word, into our hearts, that we
may cease from the works of sin,
as well as from the works of our
ordinary calling; and that we may
feel in our hearts the beginning of
that Eternal Sabbath, which brings
unspeakable Joy and Glory, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us with the Spirit of Prayer,
make us diligent and ready in the
performance of thy will. And take
us, O Lord, into thy custody and
governance for ever, both our
Souls and Bodies, yea our Lives,
and all that ever we have, so that
our Lives may please thee, and our
Deaths may praise thee, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ our Lord: for whose sake
we heartily Pray thee to grant these
things thus asked, and all other
things necessary for soul and body,
and that not only to us, but to all
others also, for whom thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
we should pray. Grant unto us
all true &amp; hearty Repentance, that
we may turn from our evil <hi>ways,</hi> that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93068:31"/>
thou mayest turn from us the evils
that we have so highly deserved.</p>
               <p>And with us, O Lord, bless thy
whole Church, especially that part
of it in these Kingdomes; Be Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to thy servant and our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign

to all such as are any other way
Related to us; and we beseech
thee to grant us all thy Blessings,
and thy holy Spirit to sanctifie us,
and to keep us this day and for
Evermore from all Evil, to thy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

comfort, through Jesus Christ, our

               <p>O Eternal God, our most loving
and merciful Father in Jesus
Christ, it is thine own command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that we should call upon thy
name, and it is thy gracious and
merciful promise, that where two
or three are gathered together in
thy name, there thou wilt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
among them; we thy poor
and unworthy servants, Dust and
Ashes, yet the Workmanship of
thine own Hand, are more bold to
come before thee, to offer unto
thee this Evening sacrifice of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Thanksgiving: O Lord,
we beseech thee, to sanctifie unto
us thy word which we have heard,
and read this day; make it the seed
of life unto our souls, that it may
fructifie, grow, and increase, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93068:33"/>
get such strength by thy good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that neither the burning
heat of affliction, or persecution,
cause it to wither, but that as seed
sown in good ground, it may bring
forth thirty, sixty, and a hundred
fold, as thy heavenly wisdom hath
appointed. And now, O Lord,
being here before thee, we cannot
but acknowledg, and confess, ever
from the bottom of our Hearts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our selves, our own Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,
that we are greivous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Conceived in sin, and born in
iniquity, whereof we have brought
forth most vile fruits in our lives
to the great dishonour, of thy Name
the utter dismaying of our own
Consciences, and the evil example
of our Brethren, by which we have
deserved likewise thy wrath and
heavy indignation, to be poured
upon us, both in this life, and that
which is to come, in such sort that
no creature in heaven, or earth, is
able to reconcile us again to thy
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93068:34"/>
Majesty, but only thy Son Jesus
Christ; we intreat thee therefore
O Lord, to be merciful unto us;
and as we acknowledg our sins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, so be thou faithful, and
just, to forgive us our sins, and
cleanse us from all unrighteousness;
wash us thorowly from our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and cleanse us from our sins;
for we acknowledg, O Lord, against
thee we have sinned, and done evil
in thy sight: To thee therefore, O
Lord, do we come to crave the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of our sins, both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from time to time bestowed

&amp; continual Preservation,
and the assurance thou hast given

in, and out, before us, and freed us
from many dangers of soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and hast brought us with peace

by thy Spitit, and Presence; give
us a holy and sanctified use of our
rest and sleep, and fit us for the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

Lord fit us for that day, which shall
never give place to night. And
grant unto us all good things, that
thou in thy Wisdome knowest
more expedient to give, than we to
ask; and all we beg for Jesus Christ

               <p>MOst Merciful and Gracious
Lord God, we do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
our selves here before thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
trusting in our own merits, or
worthiness, but in thy manifold
Mercies; which hast Promised, to
hear our Prayers and grant our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
which we shall make unto
thee, in the Name of thy Dear Son
Jesus Christ our Lord; who hath
also commanded us to assemble our
selves together in his Name, with
full assurance, that He will not only
be amongst us, but also be our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
and Advocate toward thy
Majesty, that we may obtain all
things, which shall seem expedient
to thy blessed Will, for our neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities:
Therefore we beseech thee
(most Merciful Father) to turn thy
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93068:35"/>
loving Countenance toward us, and
impute not unto us our manifold
sins and offences, whereby we just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deserve thy Wrath, and sharp pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
but rather, receive us to
thy Mercy for Jesus Christ his sake,
accepting his Death and Passion, as
a just recompence for all our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in whom only thou art Pleased,
and through whom thou canst not
be offended with us. And seeing
that of thy great Mercy, we have
quietly passed this night, Grant O
Heavenly Father, that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
this day wholly in thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
so that all our thoughts,
words, and deeds, may redound to
the Glory of thy Name, and good
examples to all men, who seeing
our good works, may Glorifie thee
our Heavenly Father. And because
thou hast commanded us, to pray
one for another, we do not only
make request O Lord for our selves,
and them that thou hast already
called, for the true understanding
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93068:36"/>
of thine heavenly Will; but for all
People and Nations of the World,
who as they know by thy wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Works, that thou art God over
all; so they may be instructed, by
thine own Spirit, to believe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their only Saviour and Redeemer.
And the Lord be merciful to us,
and let not our sins, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
be a hinderance to thy Mercy:
We are now come before thee, to
bewail our sins, and miscarriages,
heartily desiring thee, to cause us
to turn unto thee, to seek and love
thee; that our hearts may cleave
fast unto thee, diligently following
thee, all the residue of our days;
and that thou wilt be pleased, to
guide us with thy holy Spirit, that
we may make Conscience of all
that we do; never accounting any
sin little, because thy Son died for

to live: and further, good Lord,
settle every one of us in such a
constant course of obedience to
thee, that we may serve thee, as thy

and not as the World, the flesh,

charge our negligence, nor our
unthankfulness, that we have not
worthily esteemed, nor in our lives

But do thou rather Accept the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

Christ, who by offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
a Sacrifice once for all, hath
made a sufficient recompence for

Heart, the sorrowful Mind, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
Oppressed, Hungring and

now O Lord, though we are but
Dust and Worms, yet thou art our
Creator, and we are the work of
thine Hands; yea, thou art our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and we are thy Children; thou
art our Shepheard, and we are thy
Flock; thou art our Redeemer, and
we are thy People, whom thou hast
bought; thou art our God, and we

Lord, neither according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts

us, with a Fatherly affection,
that all the World may know, that
if a sinner repent him of his sins,

wilt put away his wickedness out

we have tasted of thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Thou thoughtest of Saving
us, before we began to serve
thee; thou hadst an eye upon us,
when we were yet unborn; and

notwithstanding our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

so careless of thee; surely O Lord,
in that thou affordest us health to
our bodyes, liberty to our persons,
prosperity to this Family, in which
we live, we can give no reason, but
because thou art Merciful. The
Heavens are within a Spain, the
Earth within a Circle, the Waters
within thy fist, mountains upon the

measure, or bounds can we set to
thy Goodness and Mercy O God?
O let the Ocean of this thy Mercy,

thee upon us, and take away from
us, whatsoever there is within us,

Mercy, kept us this Night past,
from all Perils and Dangers of the

hurtful to us, and give us what is
necessary for us. And now, O Lord,
Watch over us this night, give us

the comming of the Lord Jesus

thine Image, we have cast off our
first Covering; we have thrust our
selves out of that pleasant place;
we ran away from thee, and were
not obedient to thy Voice. And
we do still shut our Eyes, O Lord,
that we might not see, and we have

lyeth hidden in us, doth every day
put forth new branches; all the
parts, and faculties, of our bodies,
and souls, are as so many Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of unrighteousness, to fight
against thy Divine Majesty. Our
hearts imagine wicked things;
our mouths utter them, and our
hands put them in practise; Thy
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93068:46"/>
Mercys are every day renewed unto
us, and our sins are every day mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed

in the day of sickness, and adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
Thy benefits heaped upon us,
do not allure us to obey thee; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do thy Judgments inflicted

our nature upon him, to fulfil thy
Law for us, and to be Crucified for

the example of his Holy Life, but
have every day afresh, Crucified
him by our sins; and now O Lord,
if we should become our own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
we cannot but confess, that,
we have deserved everlasting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Hell fire; but there is
mercy with thee, O Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93068:46"/>
will we not despair; our sins

our sins press us down to hell,
but thy mercy in Christ Jesus, rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us up; by Satan we are accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but by Jesus Christ we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
By our own Consciences,
we are condemned, but by Jesus
Christ, we are absolved and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
in us there is nothing but Sin,
Death, and Damnation; in him
there is treasured up for us,
Righteousness, Life and Salvation;
we are poor, Christ is our Riches;
we are naked, he is our covering;
We are exposed to thy fury pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of us, he is the buckler of our
defence, and our refuge; he is the
Rock of our Salvation, and in him
do we trust; Guide us, O Lord,
by thy holy Spirit, to amend what
is amiss in us, increase all gifts and
graces, which thou hast already giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,

those that are ready to depart out
of this life, and when the house of

and praise thy Name, for our

for preserving us ever since we

Mothers Wombs, thy Providence
hath hitherto watched over us, and
preserved us, to this present time;
O stay not the course of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and loving kindness toward us;
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, for
thy dear Son Jesus Christ his sake,
who is the way, the truth, and the
Life; In him, O Lord, we appeal
from thy Justice, to thy Mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
thee in his Name, and for
his sake only, that thou wilt be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
pleased freely to pardon us
all our sins, and disobedience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in thought, word, or deed,
committed against thy divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and in his precious Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheding

free us from all the guilt, the

of all our sins, and cloth us
with his perfect Righteousness;
there is mercy with thee, O Lord,
that thou mayest be feared; yea
thy mercyes swallow up the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

our souls and consciences, make us

our sins, and be reconciled to thy

not the works of thine own Hands
to Perish, thou art not delighted
in the death of sinners, but in their
Conversion; turn our hearts, and
we shall be turned; convert us, and
we shall be converted: Illuminate
the eyes of our minds, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
with the bright beams
of thy holy Spirit, that we may day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grow in the saving knowledg of
the heavenly mystery of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,

in sins and brought forth in

but a small matter, we have heaped
up our Actuall transgressions, as the
sand upon the sea-shore, and as the

we have broken thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we have prophaned thy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
we have dishonour thy name,
we have abused thy creatures, we
have neglected the day of our Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

of great Goodness, who pardonest
Sinnes, and passest by the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

beseech therefore, for Jesus Christ
his sake, to be merciful unto us, in
the free pardon and forgiveness of
all our sins that we have ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

obedience, for our disobedience;
of his righteousness, for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness;
of his Sufferings,
for all our sins; wash them away in

hide them in his wounds, and bury
them in his grave, that they may
never rise up for our confusion
here, or for our condemnation
hereafter; O Lord, be unto us a

Father of Mercy, and a God of
Consolation; Speak peace unto our

thine, for thou art our Creator and

Armies of thy holy Angels in our
habitations, do thou, O God, assist
us, that we may peaceably sleep and
rest in thee; hide us in thy Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and we will fear no evil, for thou
that keepest us dost neither slumber
nor sleep; let thy rod and thy staff
comfort and defend us, and let thy
mercies, O God, prevent and follow
us all the days of our lives, that at last
we may dwell with thee, praising thee
for evermore: and to that end re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh

days, when our Fathers were in the
condition of those Worthies of old
who were tortured, not accepting
deliverance, that they might obtain
a better resurrection, who wandred
about in sheep-skins and goat-skins,
being destitute, afflicted, tormented
in desarts, in mountains, in dens and
caves of the Earth, and the sound of
the Turtle was not heard in the land,
This, O Lord, was our miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93068:67"/>
under that <hi>Romish</hi> Tyranny
under which we groaned; but thou
our most merciful Father in the midst
of judgment didst remember mercy,
and didst bring back our captivity, as
the rivers in the South; thou brought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thy servant Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from
prison to reign, and with her did the
glorious Sun of thy Gospel arise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these late dark lands, and the word
of the Lord went throughout the
Nation, thou quenchest those flames
that destroyed so many of thy blessed
Saints and servants, and didst at once
restore to us religion, peace, plenty,
and Victory over all our and thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
O what shall we render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

him the sacrifice of praise and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,

               <p>MOst high and mighty Lord
God Almighty, who workest
wonders in the Heavens, in the Earth

to all that call upon thee; we the

intended to have tyrannized over our

blast of thy mouth, and they were
scattered like chaff before the wind,
and they perished at thy presence;
thou didst put fear into their hearts,
and they fled, thou didst confound all
their projects and devices, and they
were all brought to nought. O Lord
let us never forget this mercy of thine
and the multitude of thy mercies
that we have recieved since that time
which thou knowest, O Lord, we
have not improved as we ought, and

               <head>Of the Powder Treason.</head>
               <p>THe Plot was to undermine the
Parliament-house, and with
Pouder to blow up the King, Prince
Clergy, Nobles, Knights, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses,
the very confluence of all the
flower of Glory, Piety, Learning,
Prudence and Authority in the
Land, Fathers, Sons, Brothers, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
Friends, Foes, Papists and
Protestants all at one blast.</p>
               <p>This damnable design was cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
by some Priests, Jesuits and
other Papists, to which end they
took lodgings near the Parliament
house, and then all the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
took an oath of secresy in
these words.</p>
               <p>You shall swear by the blessed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and by the Sacrament you now pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to receive never to disclose directly
or indirectly, by word or circumstance

the matter that shall be proposed to you
to keep secret, nor desist from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof till the rest shall give you
leave.</p>
               <p>And now the business went on
apace, and all things being ready,
the 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1605. was the
day designed for the execution,
but about ten days before a letter
directed to my Ld. <hi>Monteagle</hi> was
delivered by an unknown person to
his footman in the street with a
strict charge to give it to his Lords
own hand which accordingly he
did, and the Lord being troubled
at the contents presently imparted
it to the Secretary of State, who
soon presented it the King, which
was in these Words</p>
               <p>My LORD,</p>
               <p>Out of the love I bear to some of your
friends, I have a care of your preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

contemned, because it may do you good,

is past so soon as you have burnt the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and I hope God will give you the
grace to make use of it, to whose holy
protection I commend you.</p>
               <p>The King reading this letter, did
conclude by several dark passages in
it, that it contained in it some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
design, and therefore
by the <hi>Blow</hi> did suppose was
meant some blast of Gun-pouder.
And after strict search made under
the Parliament house about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
the very night before the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93068:75"/>
Parliament was to set, at the door
of the entrance of the cellar was
found one <hi>Guy Fauks</hi> clothed and
booted, he was apprehended, and
then removing some billets that
were laid to prevent discovery, they
found the serpents nest stored with
thirty six barrels of pouder, and
searching the Villain, there was
found about him a dark lanthorn
three matches, and other instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for blowing up the pouder.</p>
               <p>And thus was this horrible plot
discovered, and we saved, and the

               <p>O Blessed Lord God, who by thy
wisdome not only guidest,
and orderest all things most sutable
to thine own Justice, but also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formest
thy pleasure, in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that we cannot but acknowledg
thee to be righteous in all thy ways,
and holy in all thy works; We thy
sinful people fall down before thee,
confessing that thy Judgments were
right, in permitting wicked men,
this day to Imb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93068:79"/>
the Blood of thine Anointed: we
having drawn down the same upon
our selves, by the great and long
provocation of our sins against thee,
for which we do therefore, here
humble our selves before thee, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
thy mercy for the pardon
of them all, and that thou wouldest
deliver this Nation from blood
guiltiness, (that of this day especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
and turn from us, and our
Posterity, all those Judgments,
which we by our sins have deserved.</p>
               <p>And now, O Lord, thou whose
righteousness is like the strong
mountains, and thy Judgments like
the great deep, and who by the
Martyrdom of thine Anointed, our
Soveraign this day, hast taught us
that neither the greatest Kings, nor
the best of men are more secure
from violent, then from natural
death. Teach us also hereby, so to
number our days, that we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our hearts unto wisdom, and
grant, that neither the splendour
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93068:80"/>
of any thing that is great, nor the
conceit of any thing that is good in
us, may any way withdraw our eyes
from looking upon our selves, as
sinful dust, and ashes, but that (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the example of this thy
blessed Martyr) we may press for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
toward the price of the high
calling, that is before us, in faith,
and patience, humility, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
mortification, and self-denial,
charity, and constant perseverance,
unto the end; and we desire to
bless thee, O Lord, that thou didst
not leave us for ever, as sheep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a shephard, but by thy gracious
providence, didst miraculously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the undoubted Heir of his
Crown, our most gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
KING CHARLES the
Second, from his bloody enemies,
hiding him under the shadow of
thy wings, until their Tyranny was
overpast, and bringing him back
in thy good appointed time, to sit
in peace upon the throne of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

to let thine anger cease, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93068:86"/>
to bow down thine ear to thy sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
servants; we turn unto
thee our weeping eyes, our deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
countenances, our wringing
hands, our bended Knees, our
mournful voices, and our groaning
hearts; O Merciful God, behold
our tears, and view our countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and look upon our hands, and
strengthen our Knees, and hearken
to our voices, and comfort our
hearts; Give us a fight of our sins,
O Lord which have thus provoked
thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to enter into Judgment with
thy Servants; and make us more
to loath, and tremble, at our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
then at these Messengers of
death; wean us from the love of
sin, from the consideration both
of thy displeasure, and our own
mortality; and speak peace and
health, unto our souls, which do
every moment expect our dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

God, who canst not abide to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
unrighteousness; look not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93068:86"/>
therefore with thy wrathful eye
upon us, who are full of sin, and
pollution; but look upon thy
Son, and his righteousness; or, if
thou wilt look upon us, first cloth
us with the righteousness of that
immaculate Lamb, and so shalt thou
see us, with love and delight, and
we shall behold thee with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
joy: Seal unto our souls
the remission of our offences, and
then make us willing to resigne
our bodies to thy disposing, yet
we know, O Lord, if thou dost but
Speak the word, we shall be made
whole; &amp; if thou say'st, the Plague
shall not come near our habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we then know we shall be safe;
if it be thy blessed will, O Lord,
let us praise thee in the land of the
living; cleanse us from our sin, and
take away our iniquities, and then
we need not question, but thou
wilt take away thy hand from off
us. Hear us, O Lord, for our selves,
and also for thy distressed people;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93068:87"/>
and hear them for us, and hear thy
Christ for us all; that to him and
thee, and thy blessed Spirit, we
may render, as is most due, all
praise and glory, and Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and obedience, for evermore.

thou hast found out the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

our nakedness and pollution in a

our grievous crying sin: our pride,

thee leave us not to our selves,

to thee it is all one, to save by
many or by few, thou canst make
one to chase a thousand; thou canst
cause the hearts, even of the most
valiant to melt; their hands to be
weak, their minds to faint, and
their knees to fall a way like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
if thou fight for us, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
miscarry; if thou favour us
not, we must needs be discomfited:
O be gracious unto us, and be on
our side, now that men are risen
up against us; Go out, O Lord,
with our Navys, and Armies, give
wisdom and courage to our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
gird them with strength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the battel; be with our Sea-men,
and Souldiers, teaching their hands
to war and their fingers to fight:
Assist their consultations, prosper
their policies, crown their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
with good success, which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93068:93"/>
are undertaken for the common
good, and comfort of the State:
Doubtless, O Lord, we deserved
thine anger, and our Sins do cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud
in thine ears for vengeance, &amp;
it were but just with thee, it thou
shouldst make us a prey, and spoil
unto our enemies; but, O graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
God, let us now fall into thy
hands; for thy mercies are great,
and let us not fall into the hands
of men; let it appear that thou art
in the midst of us, and that we shall
not be moved; that thou wilt help
us, and that very early? and in thy
due time set thou peace in our
borders, and make strong the bars
of our Gates; especially let the
Gospel of thy Son sound yet lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Souls may be gathered unto thee;
So we thy people, and the sheep of

that are weary and heavy laden with
their sins to come unto thee, and hast
promised to ease and refresh them;
thou hast invited all those that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst after thy Kingdom and
the righteousness thereof to come to

hast promised that thou wilt satisfy

promises I come to thee, blessed Lord

refresh me, to satisfy me with thy
mercy, for my Soul hungers and thirsts
after thee &amp; thy Salvation. I confess

to thee, thou, O God, be merciful unto
me, and though I cannot bring with
me a clean heart, (for who can say
his heart is clean?) yet behold, O
Lord, I bring with me a contrite heart
and a broken spirit, despise not, O
God, this Sacrifice. As for the sins
that I have committed against thee,
bind them up into one bundle, and
cast them into the bottomless Sea of
thy mercy, bury them in thy wounds,
and wash them away in the blood of
that immaculate Lamb Christ Jesus,
and for the time to come sprinkle my
Conscience with the same blood, that
being cleansed from dead works I
may serve thee the living God in
righteousness and true holiness all the
days of my life, that so this blessed
Sacrament may be a means to quiet
my Conscience, to increase my faith,
to inflame my charity, to amend my

that I am of the number of those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

               <p>O Most gracious God; from whose
bounty every good and perfect
gift is derived, I and all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me praise and magnify thy holy
name for all thy mercies and favours
which from time to time thou hast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon me. But especially I
thank thee for Jesus Christ thy Son,
the fountain and foundation of all
blessings and benefits that thou hast
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93068:99"/>
sent him into the world to take our
nature upon him, and to die for us;
and that thou hast fed me who am
unworthy of the least of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
with the precious merits of
his death and passion. Blessed Lord
God, thou hast been pleased this day
to set thy seal to the pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of all my sins, oh let me not
lose it again by unthankfulness, or
relapsing into my old sins from which
thou hast purged me, lest my last end
be worse than my beginning. But if
hereafter I shall be tempted by the
Devil, allured by the world, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by my own flesh, then set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mine eyes by the remembrance
of thy Spirit how dear the expiation
of my sins cost my Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, even the effusion of his
most precious and holy blood, that
in the contemplation of his death, and
application of his most bitter passion,
I may die dayly unto sin, and so may
shew forth the Lords death till he
come and bring his reward with him,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93068:99"/>
I may receive the Crown of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
which he hath purchased and
prepared for all those that love and
expect the day of his appearing, with
the precious price of his incorruptible
blood. And whereas I have this day
renewed my covenant with thee my
God in vows and purposes of better
obedience assist me by thy grace, and
strengthen me by thy power, that I
may pay the vows which I have
made unto thee, and that by vertue
of thy heavenly nourishment I may
grow up in grace and godliness, till
at last I come to be a perfect man in
Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>Preserve and maintain always this
thine Ordinance that it may be a
note and a badge of my publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and give unto all of us that
have been partakers of thy body and
blood, one heart and one mind in the
unity of Spirit for the worthy and
reverend receiving of the same when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we shall come to thy holy
