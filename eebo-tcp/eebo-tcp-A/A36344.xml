            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAD I given thoſe Opportunities for men of
ill Converſe, and worſe Inſinuations to
have drawn me aſide, as others have done,
to accuſe the Innocent, perhaps I had had
no Occaſion to give your Lorſhip this Trouble: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Enemies of the King, the Kingdom and the
Proteſtant Religion, obſerve my Reſolutions fixt and
conſtant to ſerve all <hi>three,</hi> to the utmoſt of my Power
and Capacity; therefore, rather than they will leave
Plotting, they have placed their little Sham Plots up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me too. However they go on in the old Popiſh Track
of endeavouring to render Scurrilous and Scandalous,
the Perſon againſt whom they raiſe their Batteries; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reſt I find my ſlef moſt terribly aſſail'd by
two of theſe Enginees of Defamation; by the one in a
publick Pamphet; by the other in a written, but very
malicious Letter, cunningly diſtributed about the Town
to ſeveral of the moſt Eminent Perſons of this City.
<pb facs="tcp:40874:3"/>
Which being done, without the leaſt Proof of the Charges
therein contained, I cannot but look upon it, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Aſſaſſination of his Majeſties moſt Royal Grace
and Mercy towards me. This, my Lord, is that which
enforces me thus to appear in my own Vindication, leſt
the World ſhould think thoſe Reproaches confirm'd by
my Silence, and conſequently thoſe Royal Favours ill
beſtow'd, as being unworthily forfeited. This it is that
emboldens me to make this Addreſs to your Lordſhip,
to ſhew that I am not affraid of Contradiction before
ſo worthy and ſo great a Magiſtrate: Whoſe Zeal for
the Proteſtant Religion is ſo well known, that you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
the Plotters of its Deſtruction: Whoſe Charity,
Generoſity, and Candor are ſuch, that you will not lend
a forward Ear to Scandal and Reproach: and whoſe
Juſtice is ſuch, that ſhould I be found impoſing Falſhood
upon your High Dignity, as you would be the firſt to
Condemn me to deſerved Puniſhment, ſo you will be as
ready to uphold and vindicate the Innocent. And it

            <p>THE beſt and moſt pious men that ever were
in the World, could not avoid the Scandals
and Reproaches of venemous and malicious
Tongues: Even the very Saints and Apoſtles
were not free. Nor could our Bleſſed Lord
and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſo well behave himſelf in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted
Life, but that the Wicked had their Scorns and
Scoffs ready at hand to blur and defame his Immaculate
Converſation: Men as impious as <hi>Satan</hi> found out Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
and falſe Oaths to betray his Innocency, and either
through the Credulity or the Obduracy of his Judges to
condemn and put him to Death. If then thoſe devout and
holy Perſons, if <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Saviour of the World, could
not be ſafe, though it were in an Age when the Crafts and
Deviſes of Hell were not ſo well known, or at leaſt ſo
well practiſed among men as now they are, how can poor
miſerable Creatures not only laden with Original Sin, but
more obnoxious, once perhaps for Crimes perticularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
than the reſt of their fellow Creatures, and the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
of Human Precepts, propoſe Immunity to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
more eſpecially when the moſt refin'd Villanies and
Perjuries abound that ever were heard of, ſuch as neither
the Memory of Man or Hiſtory can Parrallel, by ſwearing,
forſwearing, counterſwearing, and all this made a Trade
by Men-Swearers, and Women-Swearers, <hi>that live by the
price of Blood, who if they can but faſten a moments Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon a man, never leave till they have ſworn him out
of his Life?</hi> Now is it in the power of Man to Divine when
this their thirſt of Blood will be quenched, while they ſtill
under various Pretences endeavour to worry the people of
God, and to annihilate the Immaculate True Religion of
Chriſt, ſet on to the End, that what the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> began, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40874:4"/>
could not accompliſh by Clandeſtine Contrivance, they
ſhould finiſh by the accurſed, but moſt ſeemingly plauſible
Procedure of that Caitiff <hi>Jezebel.</hi> For always the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
were of opinion that the beſt Expedient to introduce <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
and that Helliſh Sting in the Tail of it that Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mankind, called <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> was to inflame the
Nation by falſe Alarums, and impious Inſinuations of <hi>Sham-Plots,</hi>
and Contrivances laid upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to whip
and ſpur on Proſecutions againſt the Innocent, hoping
thereby to provoke them into <hi>Mutiny</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> that ſo
there might be a Colour to call in a Forreign Power, the
more eaſily to accompliſh their Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Another ſort of Men (ſo call'd) there are, who encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
abett, and uphold thoſe Inſtruments of Satan, and
their inferior Tools, who are of ſuch a malicious and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Tincture in themſelves, that the leaſt appearance of

               </gap>s them to the heart, that
if he be not a Proſelite of their own, that is a Convert to,
their wicked Deſigns, he muſt be preſently perſued at the
heels with a ſort of Cur-like Obſervations, on purpoſe to
foreſtal him in the good Opinion of Men, and to render
him Odious for well doing; as if Reformation and the Imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

and Impiety, or that his former m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

be blotted out. A piece of Charity which would never be
owned by any but a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> that Abhorrer of all Mercy, from
whom the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are never to expect any favour: So
that it is no wonder I ſhould be ſo Viperouſly bitten by one
that either profeſſes or upholds, a Sham Politick, called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that bears ſuch an Antipathy to Charity, that would
ſhut <hi>Heaven</hi> Gates, and no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſuffer the <hi>God</hi> of Mercy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to forgive any but ſuch as they ſhould approve of. I
have obſerved, though perhaps not ſo well read as my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor,
that the great Creator, whom Man offends Millions
of times more than Man can offend Man, declares himſelf
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40874:4"/>
               <hi>that he is willing to receive a Sinner at what time ſoever he
repenteth;</hi> and that there is no one Attribute in which he
more glorifies himſelf than in that one Attribute of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
I have alſo obſerv'd from the words of our Saviour,
what great rejoycing there is in <hi>Heaven</hi> at the recovery of
one loſt Sheep. But the Cuſtom alters with the Place; for
certainly never was there ſuch Madneſs, Fury, Curſing, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
Drunkning, Whoreing, Backbiting, Rayling Fretting,
Fuming, Grinning and Girning, at the retrieving of one
Penitent Sinner, as I have obſerv'd in my ſelf. All which
makes me apt to beleive, that that ſame Perſon of Quality
(ſo reported to be) who wrote thoſe celebrated Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
called, <hi>Obſervations upon a late Libel, called a Letter from
a Perſon of Quality to his Friend, concerning the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>
&amp;c. was rather led by the Cuſtom upon <hi>Earth,</hi>
than inſtructed by <hi>Heaven;</hi> for beſides that the work does
not ſeem to be any way inſpir'd by reaſon of its inſipidneſs;
it has this Paragraph, for I ſhall give it no other Title, till
I have Diſſected it.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid <hi>Dangerfeild</hi> was a Rogue, granted, and yet as I hear,
this Rogue was brought into both houſes juſt before the Debate, to
whip them up into the Bill of Excluſion, but now they tell a very
ſtrange thing, which is, that <hi>Dangerfeild</hi> is become truly honeſt.
It is much, and in my Opinion, it is a lower kind of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
to beleive <hi>Dangerfeild</hi> is honeſt, when nothing is viſible
but the Knave. That this man ſhould be made honeſt would be a
mighty Cure, and ſuch a one as ſome of his Doctors would be loath
to work upon themſelves. In the mean time I cannot but put them
in mind that it looketh a little Popiſh, not only to give a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
to ſuch a known Sinner, but immediately to make a Saint
of him. If the gathered Churches can do ſuch Miracles, it is well,
but if they ſhould endeavour to put falſe ones upon the World, it
might diſparage their Prudence, and leſſen their Reputation; of
which I am ſo tender, that in kindneſs to them I give them this
Warning of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is ſaid</hi> Dangerfeild <hi>was a Rogue, granted.</hi> With Mr.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40874:5"/>
               <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Qualities</hi> leave, it is not granted, I was no Rogue,
nor was it ſaid ſo by any but Mr. <hi>Perſon of Qualities</hi> Gang.
For before that time he talks of, I had received mine and
his Soveraigns gracious Abſolution for my paſt Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
So that it is apparent, this Paragraph was joſtl'd in
by head and ſhoulders by the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> to call me <hi>Rogue,</hi>
that he might caſt an aſperſion on both Houſes of <hi>Parliament</hi>
then ſitting: For ſaith he, <hi>And yet this Rogue was brought
into both Houſes to whip them up into the Bill of Excluſion.</hi>
The Paraphraſe of which runs thus, <hi>Dangerfeild,</hi> then no
<hi>Rogue,</hi> though unpardon'd, when he was brought up to
kiſs the D. of Y's, hand <hi>&amp;c. to whip up the Sham Plot,</hi>
afterwards became a <hi>Rogue</hi> by diſcovering of the Secret:
and being brought into both houſes to declare the Truth of
the buſineſs, to the end they might be able to juſtifie ſuch
high and national Proceedings againſt the Party accuſed,
he was ſtill the ſame <hi>Rogue;</hi> from whence that it muſt be
gathered from his words, either the Parliament had <hi>Rogues</hi>
brought before them to ſpur them up to look after the
<hi>Kingdoms Safety;</hi> or otherwiſe, that the Grand Counſel of
<hi>England,</hi> and the Nobleſt in the World, ſuffered themſelves
to be Dog whipped by a <hi>Rogue</hi> into an ill Act: Which is the
moſt ſcandalous Imputation that ever any <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi>
could have invented where withal to defile his own Neſt.
Now was it leſs injurious to the honour of his Majeſty to
vilify that Pardon, which was therefore given me, to the
end I might be qualified to appear before thoſe great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies;
the very buſineſs for which I am by the <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
call'd <hi>Rogue?</hi> This is the <hi>Quondam C. J. S.</hi> with the
Image of his dear Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> before him all over—The
unlucky fate of your high flown Obſervators now a days
to be ſtill againſt Parliaments, and conſequently againſt the
Rights and Liberties of their Native Country. But, ſaith he,
<hi>This Rogue was brought into both Houſes juſt before the Debate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the Obſervator is not only contented to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
both Houſes, but more irreverently to aſperſe them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40874:5"/>
with an Untruth: For the diſguiſed <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi> muſt of
neceſſity in this beleive me, in regard the Journals of the Houſe
will otherwiſe correct him; wherein he will find that I had not
been at the Houſe of Commons Bar, not in twelve days at leaſt
before the Bill of Excluſion paſſed, ſave once, which was to
acquaint the Houſe concerning the defect of his Majeſties Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to me; ſo that the words, <hi>juſt before the Debate to whip
them up,</hi> muſt needs be looked upon either as an Excurſion,
or Deviation, or what ye pleaſe to call it, from the Truth,
or elſe a moſt <hi>Malitious</hi> Suppoſition.</p>
            <p>As to the Imputation upon the Houſe of Lords, true it is,
that I attended ſeveral days in expectation of being called in,
to inform that, as I had done the other Houſe, how far the <hi>D.</hi> of
<hi>Y.</hi> had been privy to the Deſigns of Mrs. <hi>Celiers,</hi> but had for
a conſiderable time failed of admittance, and underſtanding
that the Bill was juſt ready to be brought up, I was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
to give my Information before the Bill came; and
accordingly made my Application to a <hi>Noble Peer</hi> upon whoſe
Motion, as I humbly conceive, I was called in, where I related
the whole Truth to the beſt of my knowledge. Now was I
a little glad of having the opportunity to deliver my ſelf juſt
before the coming of the <hi>Bill;</hi> as beleiving that nothing could
more concern the Preſervation of the True Religion and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd
Government, the Safety of his Majeſties Life (whom
God preſerve) the ancient and juſt Rights, and Liberties of
the Nation, than the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> did: and beſides I
thought it no ſmall honour to my ſelf, that it was in my poor
Capacity, having Truth and Juſtice on my ſide, to contribute
to the warmth of debate about the paſſing of a <hi>Bill</hi> in the
Lords Houſe, which the <hi>Commons</hi> had paſſed with ſo much
Vigor and Reſolution but juſt before. Now for doing this,
which <hi>I</hi> have reaſon to think, was one of the beſt Actions <hi>I</hi>
ever undertook in my Life, here comes an <hi>Obſervator,</hi> with a
farc'd Paragraph, and calls me <hi>Rogue,</hi> and <hi>Parliament Spurrer.</hi>
And yet, if he be the Author, who is ſo reported to be, of
thoſe <hi>Obſervations,</hi> he was formerly of another mind, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40874:6"/>
               <hi>Collyrium</hi> has cleared the eyes of his Judgment: For <hi>I</hi>
well remember that a little before the meeting of the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
which conven'd at <hi>Weſtminſter, I</hi> met with a <hi>Perſon of
Quality,</hi> in a certain place, at which time amongſt other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
<hi>I</hi> took the liberty to give him the Epitome of thoſe
Helliſh Deſigns wherein the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had engaged me; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> did me the honour to make this Reply
<hi>Verbatim</hi> as follows. <hi>I am ſo well ſatisfied that there hath been
and ſtillis, a moſt Helliſh Plot of the Papiſts againſt the Kings Life,
our Religion and Government, and to enſlave us to a Foreign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and I find ſuch Demonſtration attending all the Diſcoveries
thereof, that for my part I am ſatisfied there is none but Fools or
Knaves, and thoſe muſt be in it too, that at this time of day doubt
the truth of a Popiſh Plot. Nay he that hath but honour and honeſty
enough to be concern'd for the ſafety of his own private Affairs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but acknowledg himſelf moſt highly indebted to the Diſcoverers,
for what he now enjoys; and for my part my Concern for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Intereſt is ſuch, that I deſire all men, when ever</hi> I <hi>am found in
the Disbeleif of a Popiſh Plot, or any ways acting in the leaſt matter
or thing whatever, contrary to the Intereſt, Safety, and well Being, of
what I ſaid to you before, (meaning as I ſuppoſe tbe Kings Majeſty,
the Proteſtant Religion, and Government) to ſlight, and deem me
the worſt and baſeſt of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet <hi>I</hi> have a ſtrong jealouſie concluding from rational
grounds, that this is the very Perſon that at this time of day,
ſo confounds the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> ſo vilifies the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> with
Shams and fictitious Contrivances. I am credibly informed, he
is the only Perſon whoſe Zeal and great Concern for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
and detecting of <hi>Popiſh Traytors and Treaſons,</hi> hath
now transformed it ſelf into the ſhape and real beleif of a
<hi>Presbyterian Plot;</hi> but pray <hi>Heavens</hi> he be not the only perſon
that can be found to be in that <hi>Presbyterian Plot,</hi> when a <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi>
comes to look into the bottom of it; and its well if he
have not made uſe of my name for a Colour only, that he
might the more freely lay out upon the Parliament, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
againſt him. This is the <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi> that ſo <hi>be-Rogues</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40874:6"/>
me about <hi>whipping the two houſes into the Bill of
Excluſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Town top Metaphor that no way agrees with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned Expreſſions, the Dignity of the Aſſembly,
nor my buſineſs at that time. Yet for all this, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſo great a change of Opinion, and ſuch an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Deſire to <hi>all Mankind,</hi> of which I may be looked
upon as a Morſel; <hi>I</hi> have a greater deference for <hi>Perſons</hi>
of Dignity, than to condemn him from his own Lips,
as he has ſetenc'd me for acting according to my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now they tell a ſtrange Thing.</hi> Why what is that?
Do the Beaſts in <hi>Epping</hi> Foreſt begin to ſpeak <hi>Arabick?</hi> Or
has the <hi>Thames</hi> flowed over the Traytors heads upon <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
Bridge?</hi> No, none of theſe <hi>whipping</hi> Miracles neither.
What then? <hi>Why</hi> Dangerfeild <hi>is become truly honeſt.</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I have heard of far greater Miracles than this, among
the <hi>Obſervators</hi> Friends the <hi>Papiſts, I</hi> have heard of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Hypocritical Luberly Fryers that have ſcraped acquaint<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ance
with the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> in <hi>Heaven:</hi> Others that have been
Sainted. Shall it be no wonder for a Company of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
Dominicans to be the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi>'s only Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and is it ſuch a Wonder that I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>trnly honeſt?</hi> But I find the Temper of this <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher:</hi>
He is ſo Spotleſs, ſo clear from Stain or Blemiſh
of Sin, juſt ready for <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Chariot, that he cannot
endure to hear of the return of a Prodigal Son. No—
let him be whip'd back to his Actions again with a Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
The Coldneſs of his Charity has condenſed the
word <hi>Knave</hi> into a <hi>Viſible</hi> Subſtance, ſo that it comes
out of his Mouth, like his breath in a Froſty Morning;
and all this while the only reaſon why the <hi>Knave</hi> is ſo
viſible to him in me, is, becauſe he ſuppoſes me to have
been <hi>Laſher to the two Houſes.</hi> But if that be all, ſeeing
his Majeſty has been pleaſed to Abſolve me from my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Tranſgreſſions, and I defie any perſon to charge me
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40874:7"/>
ſince, I ſhall preſume fo far by vertue of the <hi>Kings
prerogative</hi> of Mercy, as to beleive my ſelf as honeſt
as the Perſon that ſee's the <hi>Knave</hi> ſo viſible in me. And
ſo his hard ſtrain'd Simile of Tranſubſtantion vaniſhes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it's original Nonſenſe. But <hi>ſaith he,</hi> perſiſting in his
malice, <hi>That this Man ſhould be made honeſt, would be
a mighty Cure.</hi> What is this but to ſnarle at <hi>Heaven</hi>
it ſelf? For Converſion is a <hi>Cure</hi> from thence. He then
that Queſtions the ſtrangeneſs of ſuch a <hi>Cure,</hi> calls in doubt
either the Power or Practice of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> as if it were
an unuſual thing with God to work ſuch <hi>Cures.</hi> I would
gladly know of the <hi>Paragrapher</hi> wherein I have been diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
either to him or the publick. If I <hi>whip'd up the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
by ſpeaking Truth, I was neither <hi>Rogue</hi> nor <hi>Knave:</hi>
If I did not, he was bound in Conſcience, if honeſt, to
have convinc'd the World of my defects. Otherwiſe all
he ſays muſt be looked upon as meer inſinuation of ſome
conceiv'd Malice, and an overweaning hatred of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
To which if any <hi>Doctors</hi> of mine, as he calls 'em,
have been inſtrumental, it was their Duty ſo to do; and an
evil peice of ſeverity in him to abuſe them for it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
he lets fly at Randome at certain <hi>Individuum Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum's,</hi>
Heaven knows whom, and tells them, <hi>It looks a
little Popiſh, not only to give a General Indulgence to ſuch a
known ſinner, immediately to make a Saint of him.</hi> But
he miſtakes the point extreamly. I never received any
ſuch kindneſs at their hands. Tis to the Kings Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that I ow my forgiveneſs in this World: Nor can
I tell, why the Supream head of the Church, may not as
Lawfully and with as much Authority forgive on Earth,
as the <hi>Paragraphers</hi> dear friend the <hi>Pope.</hi> Had I been fond
of <hi>General Indulgences,</hi> or been ambitious of a <hi>Saintſhip,</hi>
I ſhould have moved in the ſame ſphear of Iniquity from
whence the Kings moſt Royal Clemency redeem'd me.
Which had I done, I make no queſtion but I might have
had <hi>a General Indulgence</hi> from the <hi>Paragrapher</hi> himſelf;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40874:7"/>
Now what he means by their making <hi>a Saint</hi> of me, I
know not; I am apt to beleive he was himſelf in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
dream when he ſaid it. I muſt confeſs the next way
to be <hi>a Saint,</hi> is to converſe with good and vertuous men,
and ſo to be made <hi>a Saint,</hi> I think is much better than to
be made a Devil with thoſe incarnates from whoſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Society I am ſo happily retird. In the mean time
what a ſevere Interpreter of other peoples actions is this
ſame <hi>Paragraphers?</hi> Men cannot cheriſh the ſprouting
bloſſoms of Reformation and Penitency, with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Acts of kindneſs and Civility, but <hi>whip,</hi> they muſt
be ſaid to <hi>Saint</hi> the perſon they favour. Certainly the
Papiſts and their adherents, are the moſt cruel people in
the World, that make ſo many <hi>Saints</hi> themſelves, and will
not permit my <hi>Doctors</hi> to make one. But as ſevere as they
are, if any <hi>Doctors</hi> do make me <hi>a Saint,</hi> I am reſolved I
will make one ſhift or other to ſlip in i'the croud. And
again, I promiſe the <hi>Paragrapher</hi> that whoever they be that
may make him <hi>a Saint,</hi> I will neither envy him, nor trouble
my head about it.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place he falls upon the <hi>Gathered Churches,</hi> lays
the <hi>Miracle</hi> of my Converſion to their charge, and very
gravely Cautions them to finiſh their work, upon the
high forfeitures of <hi>diſparaging their prudence,</hi> and <hi>leſning
their Reputation.</hi> So eagerly does this <hi>Nimrod</hi> of invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
perſue me through all Societies of Men, as if he
envi'd me a being upon Earth, and therefore reſolved to
hunt me out of the World. Thus did <hi>Satan</hi> appear among
the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to heap accuſation upon accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Innocent <hi>Job:</hi> And thus the Obſervator endeavors
to <hi>Whip up the gathered Churches</hi> into an ill opinion of
me. But ſuppoſe the <hi>Miracle</hi> ſhould be accompliſhed, as
I truſt it is; I hope the Obſervator will not exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Juſtice, if the <hi>diſparagement of imprudence</hi> and the
<hi>leſning of Reputation</hi> ſhould redound to himſelf. For my
party I look upon this <hi>Shimeian Paragrapher,</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40874:8"/>
from Providence, contrary to the intent of the
Writer, to make me the more wary of my future demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.
For certainly it would <hi>whip up any</hi> man of Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
how prone ſoever to vice, to proſecute his intentions
of a reformed life, if it were but to ſpite the fury of ſuch
a malicious adverſary. As for the <hi>Gathered Churches,</hi> as
he calls them, he acknowledges both <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to be among them. But withal, by way of <hi>Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
would inſinuate to the World, that he beleives
that the Nut-ſhel which contained <hi>Homers</hi> works would
comprehend both. Otherwiſe he could never be ſo idle
as to think, they would forfeit thoſe pretious Jewels
of <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> to uphold a <hi>Rogue</hi> or a viſible
<hi>Knave</hi> or cheriſh a <hi>known ſinner</hi> in his Wickedneſs.
But the mark at which he ſhoots is apparent. For
having fixed the Characters of <hi>Rogue</hi> and <hi>Knave,</hi> upon
me, he endeavors by the ſame Artifice to undermine
the <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> of the <hi>Gathered Churches,</hi>
by pretending them to be my Abettors: With the
<hi>Stilletto</hi> of a <hi>Tender</hi> Caution wounding both their
<hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> at once, which he ſeems
to be ſo nice of. In all which he does but verifie
the Text of Holy Writ, whoſe Oracles never fail,
which tells us, that the <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi> of
the Wicked are Cruelty. Thus the <hi>Prudence</hi> of the
<hi>Gathered Churches</hi> diſtinctly diſcerns, and more than
this; for they cannot but be almoſt aſſured from the
venemous Symptoms of this <hi>Paragrapher,</hi> that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
perſecutions proceed in ſome Meaſure from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and that if a new Writ <hi>de Haeretico Comburendo</hi>
were let looſe again, he would be as active and as
nimble as 'ere a <hi>Bonner</hi> or <hi>Gardner</hi> in <hi>England</hi>
ever was to remove theſe eye ſores of the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Religion from his ſight. Nor do their <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
leſs appear, by their Patient ſuffering the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40874:8"/>
Scorns and Contumelies which are daily thrown upon
them, with the ſame Patience, and enduring the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of their Conſciences, by awaking dormant
Acts againſt them; And all this to Exaſperate their
Loyalty, and incenſe them to incur their Soveraign's
Diſpleaſure: While the Dreams and Buffoonries of the
<hi>Obſervator</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> are foſtered and encouraged,
to lighten and enflame our Diviſions; thoſe <hi>pretty
Motions</hi> that are blindly moved through the Fatal
Cunning of <hi>Jeſuitiſm,</hi> by the great Wheel of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Conſultation. Thoſe <hi>Corroſives</hi> of imbittered Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
that keep our Wounds ſtill feſtring, which
elſe might ſoon be cloſed without the leaſt appearance
of a Scar. Proceedings ſo much the more to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at, that we ſhould be vexing and tormenting the
Native Proteſtants of the Land, at the ſame time
when the Kingdom rejoyces to be the far applauded
Sanctuary of Exiled Foreigners of the ſame Profeſſion,
exterminated from their Eſtates, their Callings and their
Habitations, only for the ſame Crimes of <hi>Conſcience and

            <p>Having thus as I hope wiped off the Stains of Printed
Reproach, caſt upon me by thoſe I never in my Life
provok'd or injur'd; I am now to give an Account of
an Accident that lately befel me in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> An Affair that
has made ſuch a great Noiſe in the World, and ſet the
Clacks of all my Adverſaries a going, even to a
Midwives Vanity: and would have made a far louder
Din, had not my Innocency, Scann'd in the face of
Juſtice, brought me off.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman, a Friend of Mr. <hi>Colledges,</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I was to take a Journy into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and that I
was well acquainted at <hi>Waltham,</hi> deſired me to take
that place in my way; and to diſcourſe with one <hi>George
French</hi> an <hi>Inn-Keeper</hi> in that Town, to know what
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40874:9"/>
he could truly teſtifie concerning the Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of one <hi>Heynes</hi> an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to give Evidence againſt <hi>Colledge</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
and if I could judge him to ſpeak any thing materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
that I would ſerve him with a <hi>Subpena,</hi> he giving
me one at the ſame time. At firſt, I refuſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in this Affair, as being an Evidence for the King
in the Diſcovery of ſeveral Treaſons and Villanies of
the Papiſts; but the Gentleman preſſing it upon me,
and withal telling me that I was as much obliged to
uſe all lawful and honeſt means to preſerve the Kings
Subjects, as to teſtifie againſt them upon any Legal
Proſecution, and having no knowledge more than what
was Popular and Common talk of what was laid to <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge's</hi>
Charge, no way concern'd either for, or againſt
him; on the other ſide Perſonally knowing <hi>Hayns</hi> to be a
moſt Notorious Papiſt, that had correſponded with Mrs.

had been employed of her to run of Errands to the Priſons,

Priſoner for Debt in the Kings Bench, upon theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
<hi>I</hi> thought my ſelf, as much obliged to do that

was willing to have me, and took Horſe upon the
Sunday after Evening Prayer, and rode to the ſaid <hi>George

to ſtay there all Night. Being ſhewed into a Chamber,
<hi>I</hi> ſent for the Maſter of the houſe, who neither knew

long he had kept the houſe. To which he replyed his
name was <hi>French,</hi> and that he had kept the houſe about
two or three years; that he had a few years before ſerved
the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> in the Station

him an oppertunity of ſwearing he would do the Inn-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

his words good, <hi>Ohara</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> and upon Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

which was accordingly done. Upon this relation, which is
<hi>verbatim</hi> as I had it from <hi>French,</hi> I ſerv'd him with a <hi>Subpena,</hi>
whereupon he demanding my name, I told it him. This

ſhe might poſſibly be too much concern'd for the abſence of
her Husband; and going away, leaving the <hi>Subpena</hi> upon the

Room, in which was a Quartermaſter belonging to one of

neither Hand nor Seal to it; that it was a new deſign to draw
him into trouble, by making of him be a Witneſs againſt the

of acknowledging the good ſervices he has done by his
diſcovery, to the King and Countrey; for if I get but once
into his Company, let me alone to affront him. Upon which,
<hi>French</hi> returning to my Chamber door, made a ſtand, and
there related the deſire of the aforeſaid Company, <hi>Bruff</hi> all
the while ſtanding behind him; I anſwer'd <hi>French,</hi> I was a

I pleaſed, which he promiſed to pledge and be gone: To this
I anſwered, I did not accuſtom my ſelf to drink healths, in
regard it was the only promoter of quarrels. He replied,
that was only about the healths of women; and then preſſed
me to drink the Kings health. I told him I was unwilling to
drink any health at all, for many reaſons, ſome of which
were theſe; Firſt, the Lords day was not expir'd. Secondly,
that the King had cauſed a Proclamation to be publiſhed,
ſhewing His Majeſties diſlike about drinking of any health.
And thirdly, It was not viſible to me, wherein I could in the
leaſt meaſure contribute to the Kings ſervice by the drinking
of his health; but if he would undertake to make out that
it did, I ſhould think my ſelf as much oblig'd, as he ſeem'd
earneſt to have it done, and that with a heart as full of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
as he, or e're a man living. Upon which he took upon
him to make me underſtand how it would be ſerviceable to
the King, for me to drink His Majeſties health, by this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation:
For ſays he,<note place="margin">This Quartermaſter was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Bacchanalian,</hi> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Holy <hi>Eumenides;</hi> and had read all the Folio's of the famous <hi>Asdriasduſt Tiſſofican</hi> all over, and has made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them: but bring him a Point of War, and you gravel him preſently.</note> 
               <hi>To drink
a health, does imply the honour, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhes,
and higheſt obligations to
ſervice imaginable; and in fine, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one man has drunk anothers
health, 'tis to be underſtood from that
very time, that he becomes his Slave
and Vaſſal, and therefore, in ſuch a
time of diſtinction as this is, he
thought every loyal hearted man, that lov'd his King as he ought
to do, oblidged to that interpretation, is an argument prevalent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough
to drink the Kings health.</hi> To this I replied, the King, I
humbly conceived, only expected a peaceable and quiet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40874:11"/>
from his People, whom His Majeſty calls good
Subjects, not Slaves or Vaſſals; and I could not hold my ſelf
oblig'd to take any notice of his interpretation. Then he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
me in the Common Dialect of Civility, intimating how
much I was oblig'd to anſwer the requeſt of a Gentleman
and a Stranger, and in my own Room too. To that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d,
that he was only a preſumtive gueſs that had by his
carriage, rendred himſelf more bold than welcome becauſe
not invited; but yet ſince he had put the thing by the way
of Common Civility, I would not be behind hand with him;
and then I promis'd to drink the Kings, provided he would not
impoſe any other health upon me: Upon which he let fall a
Rapſodie of Oathes and Curſes, wherein I thought he had
bound himſelf as faſt as that ſort of Troopery engagement
could hold him. But he little regarded thoſe ties: For I
had no ſooner fill'd his Glaſs but he begins the D. of <hi>Yorks</hi>
health upon me. Whereupon I ſtood up and declar'd I would
not drink it, becauſe of the interpretation which he himſelf
had made but juſt before of health drinking; and for that,
I had a Thouſand reaſons beſt known to my ſelf, beſides as
many well known to the world, why I would not engage my
ſelf, to be his Highneſſes <hi>Slave</hi> or <hi>Vaſſal,</hi> and ſo I refuſed his
health. Then he began to catch at the expreſſion, <hi>Reaſons beſt
known to my ſelf;</hi> and ſaid, he would give me one convincing
argument for my drinking that health: I being full of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
to hear that, deſired him to declare what it was; then
he inſiſted that the <hi>Duke</hi> being of the Church <hi>England,</hi> His
Majeſties Royal Brother, and next Heir to the Crown, and
pray'd for in the Church according to the appointment of the
Canon Laws thereof, I ought to, and that was the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that induc'd him and many Thouſands beſides to drink his
Highneſſes health. To Which I replied, that though the Duke
were prayed for as a branch of the Royal Family, in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Prayer; yet I could not underſtand that either that
Prayer, or the Common Laws of the Church, had made
any appointment for drinking his health, and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
it; adding, that if he were no better acquainted with
Martial, than he ſeem'd to be with Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40874:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was very unfit to ſerve the King; and ſo I deſired the Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to withdraw; for which he call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d me Son of a whore,
and gave me ſome other Thunder-thumping complements of
the ſame nature, which I very patiently took, finding his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
ſuch, as if he had the Popes Pardon or diſpenſation
in his Pocket, for his own ſecurity, in caſe he had cut my
Throat. And therefore I courted him divers times to march
off, which at length he did, diſcharging, as he went, ſuch
Volleys of flaming Oathes, as if his Jaws had been the vent
of <hi>Aetna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he came into his own Room, he and his Crew,
drank my Damnation,<note place="margin">That muſt be forgiven him, as being done by the appointment of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Cannon Laws, which he had ſtudied.</note> and while he
continued there, I went to Supper, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſent for the Woman of the houſe,
to whom I declar'd how I had ſerv'd
her Husband with a Subpena, to go
the next day, being Munday, towards
<hi>Oxford;</hi> and then I asked if ſhe would be content to ſpare
him for five or ſix days? ſhe anſwered yes, if the buſineſs he
went about were juſt and honeſt, and that he might have
his charges borne. To which I anſwered, the buſineſs was
juſt and honeſt; for which I refer'd her to the words of the
Subpena, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that he was to teſtifie the Truth according
to his knowledg, in a Cauſe between the King and <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
that what Money the Law did allow to other Witneſſes in
ſuch Caſes, I did promiſe to ſee paid to her Husband. The
Woman ſeemed very well content, and after Supper leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mine, went into the Troopers Room, where by that
time, they and the man of the Houſe were gotten ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
Drunk; in which condition they laid their heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to paraphraiſe upon the writ of <hi>Subpena.</hi> Says <hi>Bruff,
Dam him for a Dogg that made that Subpena,</hi> (ſpeaking to the
Woman) tis a <hi>ſhamm,</hi> and a deſign to dram your Husband
into ſome more Roguery. Then ſays
the Woman,<note place="margin">For you muſt know there are a ſort of Induſtrions Women that uſe to ſwear at this rate.</note> 
               <hi>Damn that Dog,</hi> Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,
<hi>for I will have his buſineſs done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he goes hence. Damn me,</hi> ſays <hi>Bruff,</hi>
do, wel all help you. I being in my
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40874:12"/>
own Room, and hearing this threatning Dialogue, thought
I had reaſon enough to apprehend my Life in danger. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I ſent my man for the Maſter of the Houſe three
times, but he ſtill brought me word he was ſo Drunk that
he could not come; which anſwer he had every time from
the Wife, who as often as the Husband attempted to ſtand
up; ſhe ſtruck him down again with a
ſwinging Curſe or two,<note place="margin">Theſe are other marks of an Induſtrious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> interlarded with
ſlaps o'th' Face. Then I ſent ſeveral
times for the Woman, but neither was
to be perſwaded. Preſently hearing an
extraordinary noiſe amongſt 'em, I thought they were put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelves into a poſture to do my buſineſs, (as they
had all call'd it but juſt before.) Whereupon I betook my
ſelf to my Sword and Piſtol, reſolving to ſtand upon my
Guard, knowing the Law juſtified Self-preſervation; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in my own Room, and beſides, having nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to faſten the Door, I found my ſelf ſo much the more
expos'd. Then 'twas that I ſent my man into the Street to
call a Conſtable, or raiſe the Town, with all ſpeed, that I
might be ſafe; who was no ſooner gone from me, but in
came Mother Induſtry, Sir (ſays ſhe) I underſtand you ſent
divers times for my Husband, then for me, and now for a
Conſtable, I cannot underſtand your meaning by it. And
then ſtepping out of the Room ſhe Swears, <hi>Dam her,</hi> my
buſineſs ſhould be done before the Conſtable could come.
Which was no ſooner ſaid, but in comes the Quartermaſter,
who confidently demanded, what was the matter with me,
and what apprehenſions of danger I had that made me ſend
for a Conſtable, and put my ſelf in that poſture of defence.
(for then I cock'd my Piſtol) To this I reply'd (drawing
forth my Sword, and making a ſcratch on the boards of the
flowr between him and me) Sir, you are the Perſon from
whom I apprehend my Life to be in Danger, (I having heard
all your Deſign) and this being my Room, and my Caſtle,
you having twice forced your ſelf into the ſame, without
being requeſted thereto by my conſent, either be gone, or
elſe I will certainly fire upon you, then the woman (for ſhe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40874:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was in the Room all the time) puſh'd him into a char, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and curſing at the old rate, that he ſhould ſtay there for
her pleaſure. Then I told them I knew their deſign was upon
my life, and if he did attempt to come over that line or
ſcratch upon the boards before the Conſtable came, I would
Piſtol him, laying my Sword by at the ſame time, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
a holſter Piſtol, which I alſo cock'd and held in my
Sword hand, as thinking my ſelf more ſecure with two, than
with one Piſtol and a ſlight Sword. Upon this, the Woman
whiſpered to <hi>Brnff,</hi> who aſſoon ſtood up, draws his Sword
and whiſtled, which was no ſooner done but in came four
or five Ruffian-like Fellows, which I afterwards underſtood
to be the Troopers who had been all the time in the next
Room waiting for notice. Two of them <hi>Bruff</hi> commanded
to ſtay in the Room, and the reſt to fetch their Carbines:
which was accordingly done. Then he commanded the
Peace (as he call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d it) and me to deliver my Piſtols, at which
time I muſt confeſs it vvas in my mind to have fired; but it
pleaſed <hi>God</hi> in his Infinite Mercy, for ſo it fell out, I had
juſt time enough to conſider, that I vvas all alone, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
People vvho joyntly ſought my Life; and if it ſhould
happen that I ſhould kill one of them, tho it vvere in my
ovvn defence, and my ſelf invaded by them in my ovvn
Room; yet I could not tell hovv the Devil might put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hearts to ſvvear the thing upon me; ſo that I rather
choſe to capitulate for my life upon their terms, and be at
their mercy, than to run the hazard of being Hang'd; for
that in vvhich caſe I had reaſon enough to knovv, the Plea
of my Innocency could do me no ſervice: Thereupon I
told the Quartermaſter I vvould deliver my Piſtols, provided
I could have any tollerable Security for my Life. Then he
Svvore <hi>Dam Him,</hi> I ſhould have none (preſſing upon me)
Was not his Honour ſufficent enough for me to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
He (as he ſaid then himſelf) had fought divers Prizes at
the <hi>Bear-Garden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe reaſons, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Whelps of Bitches, do queſtion the Honour of the Bears themſelves.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40874:13"/>
and Sea-Fights, And ſhould ſuch an Eternal Son of a Bitch
as I was, queſtion his Honour? Upon this, I reſolv'd upon
the conſiderations aforeſaid, not to fire; and ſo turning the
Muzles of my Piſtols outwards (not having time to uncock
them) to prevent Miſchief, I ſurrendred my ſelf to this man
of Honour; which I had no ſooner done, but as ſoon the
Quartermaſter, catches hold of my Piſtols, and turns the
Muzels of 'em to my Breſt, ſtrugling to trip up my Heels,
at which time I being ſomewhat ſtronger in my left Arm,
than he was in his right with which he held my hand, I forc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d
the Muzle of the Holſter-Piſtol by the hollow of my Body,
and paſs'd it under my Arm, believing it their ſecure: But
having been wounded ſeveral times in my right Arm and
Shoulder, I wanted ſtrength to ſecure the ſmall Piſtol as I
had done the other, upon which <hi>Bruff</hi> preſſed ſo hard, that
my Thumb which was on the top of the Cock, and my fore-Finger
which was at the Tricker fly'd off, then down went
the Cock, giving fire to the Powder that was in the Pan.
However by the Infinite goodneſs of that <hi>God</hi> who knew the
Innocency of my Cauſe, the Piſtol did not Diſcharge;
which had it done, it muſt undoubtedly have kill'd me; for
it was Loaden with a Bullet ſru'd on, and the Muzle was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
at the middle of my Breſt. Now that I might be ſo
much the more induced to admire and value that infinite
goodneſs of <hi>God,</hi> which had ſo miraculouſly deliver'd me,
I have made tryal of the ſame Piſtol, divers times ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
as it vvas then, and it never faild to diſcharge, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſecond deliverance of that kind, vvhich hath hapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me vvithin this ſix Months; for all vvhich, I bleſs that
<hi>God</hi> vvhom I ſerve, that he hath made me knovv, 'tis he
only is able to deliver; for all vvhich I ſubmit my ſelf to
his infinite Grace and Goodneſs, and novv return to our
Quartermaſter, vvho by this time, vvith the help of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv
Ruffiains having gotten the Piſtols out of my hands, fell
upon me with a moſt outragious Violence. Toar all my
Linnen and Cloaths, not vvithout ſome remembrances of
the Womans Malice, vvho vvould novv and then lend her
helping hand vvith ſome ſmall Cuffs at my Face; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40874:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their uſage to me was too ſoft, ſhe would often cry to
them, Damn him, Murder him, Kill him, Kill the Dog.
And indeed I expected no other; for they drew me by force,
out of my own into their Room, where, under pretence of
ſearching for ſmall Arms in my Pockets, they intended to take
my money: But my telling rhem it would make 'em liable
to Indictments for Robbery, they deſiſted in that, but not in
their blows upon my head and face, till the Conſtable come,
who was no ſooner entred the Room, but the Quarterma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
not giving me leave to ſpeak, commanded the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſecure me till the morning, that I might be brought
before a Magiſtrate, telling him how he had been forc'd to
keep the peace; upon which, this being the very Conſtable
which my man brought, (whoſe name is <hi>Thomas Vines)</hi> he
took me back into my own Room, where I had the opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of informing him what had hapned to me, which he
little regarded, but ſtill ſuffered the Quartermaſter and his
train to come into the Room and abuſe me. By this time it
was near one of the Clock, ſo that I reſolv'd not to go to
Bed; but when it was day, to take my Horſe and make my
complaint to ſome Juſtice of the Peace, little dreaming that
the Conſtable for whom I ſent, only to keep the Peace for
the ſafety of my life, vvould have had the impudence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
me longer than I had pleaſed; ſo that about Five a Clock
in the morning I vvas preparing to be gone, and thanked the
Conſtable for his care about me; but he ſvvore he vvould
not ſuffer me to go, untill I had been before a Magiſtrate.
I demanded if he underſtood the duty and office of a Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
or if he thought himfelf ſafe to detain me vvithout a
Warrant, there being not the leaſt appearance of injury that
had been done to any but my ſelf? or if he look'd upon the
Quartermaſters command to be as vvarrantable to them
both, as if it had been given by a Civil Magiſtrate to vvhom
ſuch matters only belong? To all which, he replied, he well
underſtood his buſineſs (and ſo 'tvvas a ſign) and vvould
not ſuffer me to ſtir from my Room. Nevertheleſs the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
thinking I had touch'd him to the quick by vvhat I had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40874:14"/>
ſaid, goes into the Tovvn to adviſe (as I ſince underſtood)
with one <hi>Tho. North,</hi> the High Conſtable of that Hundred,
to whom he ſtated the Caſe, fearing that what he had done
in detaining me was not warrantable, it being only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of a Millitary perſon. To which, the High Conſtable,
who was either as much Knave or Fool as any of 'em, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that he would juſtify him in what he had done; and
ordred him, if I did attempt to be gone, he ſhould knock
me down, or uſe any other violence what he pleaſed. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this the Conſtable returned, and told me he had very well
conſidered his buſineſs, and found himſelf juſtifiable, though
he kill'd me, if I offered to be gone. Whereupon I ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
only demanding what Magiſtrate he intended to have
me before? and when? His anſwer was, whom he pleaſed,
and his own time. When I found him ſo huffy, I gave him
to underſtand how much he was miſtaken in that point; for
that the Law did allow me the liberty of chuſing my Juſtice,
provided it were in the ſame County, and I were not taken
upon a ſpecial Warrant: but it was all one to him, for he lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
regarded what I ſaid, only in a ſhort time after he gave
me notice to prepare my ſelf. But I was more ſurpriſed
when I underſtood what they intended and had contrived to
ſwear againſt me: For I had overheard the Quartermaſter,
who told the Woman of the Houſe they were all undone,
if ſhe did not ſtand their Friend, for they could not juſtify
what they had done, unleſs ſhe would ſwear the Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me. That ſhe ſoon promiſed to do. And that made
me conſider of taking ſome friend along with me to be my
Bail; and I accordingly ſent for one, that came, and upon
my relation of the buſineſs, was as willing to go, as I was to
deſire him, being well ſatisfied how much I had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed.</p>
            <p>My Friend being gone before, the Conſtable whiſpers me
to this effect, Sir, I believe you are doubtful of what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be ſworn againſt you, and leaſt there ſhould be
occaſion for Bail have ſent for that Friend, which I do aſſure
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40874:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you need not have been. For notwithſtanding what has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
about my detaining of you, yet you had better make
uſe of and depend upon me, who will be bound for you as
far as a hundred pounds goes. For that perſon which you
intend for your Bayl is a Presbiteryan, and will do both you
and himſelf, much prejudice, ſhould he appear in this Affair.
Now as for my friends being of any other perſwaſion than
that of the preſent Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is Eſtabiſh'd by
Law, I knew to be moſt notoriouſly falſe, and had ſufficient
reaſon to think my friend the Conſtable, as great a Rogue as
any of the reſt, whoes beſt principles are all ſorts of Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,
and therefore I thought my ſelf ſo much the more
oblidg'd to have a friend: Becauſe I ſaw all they drove at,
vvas to triumph and rejoyce at my Committment to Priſon.

With this and ſuch kind of ſtuff did our Juſtice make ſhift,

than I was, with a great deal more of ſuch like

he was ſure they would. However, Sir, ſaid I, you are

vallued not a Parliament, a Fart for a Parliament. Then I
held up my Finger and bid him have a care; upon which,
he became ſomewhat mild, and offered to let me go upon

had not a deſign to ſuborn me to charge Mr. <hi>Colledges</hi>
Friend, from whom I had the <hi>Subpena;</hi> with a deſign to
deſtroy my Evidence in the <hi>Popiſh-Plot?</hi> And whither or
no the overflowing of his Gall has not carried him ſo
much beyond the ſedate and mild behaviour of a Civil
Magiſtrate, that I had juſt cauſe to think him as bad a
perſon as the Woman who had ſworn ſo falſely againſt
me? For how likely a thing is it, that I who never
knew the Woman, nor ſpoak to her in my life before,
nor had ever heard of any the leaſt injury, either her
ſelf or any thing relating to her had done me, ſhould
attempt to kill her, to threaten either her, or her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
Life or Ruine, as ſhe had ſworn.</p>
            <p>But now to ſhew you what became of this affair,
which Mr. <hi>Juſtice Overdo,</hi> by his double dilligence had
taken no ſmall pain to Nurſs into a Subornation, I ſhall
tell you in a few words. Being bound over to the
Quarter-Seſſions which opened at <hi>Chelmsford</hi> the 4th of
<hi>October,</hi> I attended, and the Evidence being heard againſt
me, and my Defence againſt that; the thing I ſtood
charg'd with ſeem'd ſo improbable, that the Court (not
being of <hi>Squire John</hi>'s opinion, though he had pawn'd his
Soul upon it,) by their great Juſtice and Honour, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
both me and my Bail, leaving thoſe malicious
Proſecutors to my courſe at Law; which I ſoon made uſe
of, for I ſtraight vvay procur'd a Bill to be dravvn up againſt
<hi>Slouch the Quartermaſter</hi> for the aſſault, and preſeuted it to
the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> vvho upon direct Evidences found it <hi>Billa
vera;</hi> upon the knovvledg of vvhich, the <hi>Bacchanalian</hi>
Svvaſh-Buckler, notvvithſtanding all his health-drinking,
leaving, fearing the proceſs of the Courr vvould reach him,
flead, but our Juſtice remain'd behind, biting and puniſhing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40874:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Lips that had ſo unadviſedly publiſhed his Ignoronce in
the <hi>Law,</hi> his contempt of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and ſlght of Salvation,
finding himſelf not only liable beſides to a juſt complaint in
<hi>Parliament,</hi> but in the Interval, obnoxious to ſeveral Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
in the Crovvn-Office! not only for his misbehaviour
in this ſingle affair, but for ſeveral moſt notorious miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
by him committed, at a Special Seſſions held at
<hi>Epping</hi> in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> vvhich he may be ſure to
hear of on both ſides his Ears. As alſo hovv baſely he hath
repreſented the Kings Perſon to the vvhole Country?</p>
            <p>That which follows now, is ſuch a piece of unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel'd
Impudence, as nothing but a Devil in that horrible
Shape of a Papiſt would be guilty of. The Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which was ſent to the Honourable Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi>
there having been ſome Scores containing the ſame matter,
ſent by the Penny-Poſt to divers other Eminent Citizens and
Perſons of Quality. Which Letters by the Stile, the hand
Writing, and the moſt notorious and apparent ſtories and
defamations hodg podg'd together in the ſame, ſufficiently
demonſtrate them to be contriv'd and ſent abroad by ſome
Raſcally lying Prieſt, and ſubſcrib'd by the two firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of that ſo Famous Female Politition, Madam <hi>Cellier</hi>'s
Name. The Letter runs thus, <hi>Verbatim.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot but extreamly concern my ſelf about your

Monſter of a Man <hi>Dangerfield:</hi> who though his carriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

he yet paſſes for a very honeſt man, and is hug'd and
careſs'd by many Eminent Citizens (as I my ſelf have

the King came from <hi>Windſor,</hi> he has been to kiſs his

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40874:17"/>
with ſuch deſperate, bloody, and Villanous Treaſons,
and that for the moſt part againſt no ſmall Perſons;
that when I firſt heard the account thereof, it made my
Hair ſtand an end, admiring how it was poſſible for
a man to have ſo much of the Devil in him, and to
conceal it thus long, and ſo well, as to be taken for
the greateſt miracle in a Correction that hath happened

                  <p>As for what is paſt in relation to <hi>Colledge</hi> and others,

                  <p>But I can aſſure you, <hi>Dangerfield</hi> is too cunning a
Rogue, to miſcarry in ſuch a weighty Affair, where
his Neck is ſo much concern'd; and hath taken ſuch
good Notes (as he calls 'em), and brought ſuch conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Perſons of Quality, in Diſguiſes, into your ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

            <p>From this Letter all Men of Reaſon, that wilfully
will not cloſe the Eyes of their Underſtandings, may
eaſily deduce the Character of the whole Popiſh Gang,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40874:18"/>
of which this ſame Jeſuitical Caution-monger ſeems to
be one of the great Bell-weathers. There is in it Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
Envy, Treachery, Inhumanity, counterfeited-Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Forgery, Diſſimulation, Lying, and that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Vice which gave to <hi>Satan</hi> the additional Name of
<hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>Diabolus,</hi> Falſe accuſation; which makes out
the Character of a Papiſt to be Envious, Malicious, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,
Inhumane, a Counterfeit-Friend, a Forger, a
Diſſembler, a Liar, and a Falſe-accuſer: A Vice ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
and abominated by all the Saints in <hi>Heaven,</hi> that
one of the Reaſons ſet down in the <hi>Revelations</hi> why
they gave Glory and Honour to <hi>God,</hi> was this, Becauſe
the Accuſer of the Brethren was caſt down into the <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs-pit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to ſhew the World that this ſame <hi>Son of Miſchief,</hi>
who wrote the foregoing Letter, has accumulated to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
all thoſe rare and diabolical Qualities before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and made himſelf the very <hi>Pandora's Box</hi> of all the
Infections that deſtroy Common Morality; his Malice,
his Envy, and his Inhumanity appear in this, that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me to be in the favour of worthy and good Men, he
endeavours to canker their Friendſhips towards me; as if
all other Men were to bear me hatred, becauſe it would
be a thing acceptable to the envenom'd rancour of him
and his Party; and becauſe he thinks, if they ſhould
forſake me, I ſhould be abandon'd by all the World beſide.
Then, thought he, neceſſity would conſtrain the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and forlorn Wretch to ſeek for ſuccour, to unſay what
I have ſaid, to unſwear what I have ſworn, and make
my ſelf the <hi>Opprobrium</hi> of the World, as others have
done. No, no, Sir, you were miſtaken in your Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
I am not a Perſon of thoſe tottering Reſolutions,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40874:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be ſhaken by your Paper Engines: Nor ſhall all the
Neceſſities in the World make me recede a Tittle from
what I have aſſerted in the Face of the Nation; but ſhall
be ready to appear again, whenever call'd, with the ſame
boldneſs and the ſame Truth that redeem'd me from the
Vaſſalage of a burthened Conſcience. His Counterfeited
Friendſhip and Diſſimulation appears in his being ſo <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
concern'd for the great Misfortune of Sir</hi> Thomas
Player, <hi>and other Eminent Citizens, for having any thing
to do with that Monſter of a Man,</hi> Dangerfield: By which
he ſhews himſelf an exact Follower and Admirer of his
Doctor <hi>St. Judas,</hi> to pretend a kindneſs, and trouble for
their <hi>Misfortune,</hi> while he was ſeeking to betray them
with a Kiſs. For, his kind Paper, and his deep Concerns,
were Contrivances to probe their Hearts. Had thoſe
worthy Gentlemen ſhewed any Signs of Commotion,
had they ſeem'd to have been ſtartled at the News and
Diſcovery of ſuch a <hi>Monſter of a Man,</hi> thence they would
have argu'd a certain Guilt: And then you ſhould
have had thoſe Miſcreants obſerving every Motion
and Lineament of their Faces, like Picture drawers; then
you ſhould have had 'em diving into the very bottom of
their Breaſts, like <hi>Indians</hi> for Pearly Oyſter-ſhells: Nor
would they ever have left 'em, till they had found, tho'
it had been but a Barley-corns-worth of Probability;
knowing well what a Mountain of Treaſon they could
have built upon ſuch a ſmall Foundation. But ſuch was
the firm and unſpotted Loyalty of thoſe Gentlemen, that
all the Efforts of this ſame Hell-prompted Son of <hi>Belial</hi>
prov'd unſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>But now to compaſs his Deſign, and to make out his
Kindneſs, <hi>Dangerfield</hi> muſt be a <hi>Monſter of a Man:</hi> For the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40874:19"/>
Papiſ's never uſe to ſlander, but they do it to purpoſe. And
indeed I'll ſay that for him, hitherto he has laid the <hi>Plot</hi>
of his Lie like an Artiſt; 'tis all ſuper-fine Roguery, all
Wimble-Miſchief. But alas! by and by, through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Direction of Providence, the Fool ſpoils all
again, and down comes the whole Machine of his Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon his own Head. For, ſaith he, <hi>tho</hi> Dangerfield <hi>paſs
for a very honeſt Man, &amp;c. yet I can aſſure you, ſince the
King came from</hi> Windſor, <hi>he has been to kiſs His Hand, and
has given ſuch a Catalogue of Names, charged with ſuch
deſparate, bloody, and villainous Treaſons, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Man had been finely ſerv'd now, that ſhould have
made a Lying Match, and laid a round Wager upon this
Fellow's Head. Certain it is, that this ſame Intelligencer
could not chuſe but be aſſured, that at the ſame time all
this was falſe; and yet he has the impudence to make His
Majeſty Himſelf concern'd. Had he no body to put his
Fables and his Stories upon, but upon the King? Could
he not be content to forge an impudent Untruth, but his
<hi>Villainſhip</hi> muſt be ſo deteſtably inſolent, as it were to
beſpeak the Royal Atteſtation to make it probable? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I gain one extraordinary Happineſs by it, of which
I am not a little proud, that I have the Great Exemplar
of Juſtice on my ſide, to acquit me from ſo foul a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
to whom I humbly appeal, and at the ſame time
provoke the Engraver of my Monſtroſity to do the ſame.
Nay, he goes on, driving the Nail to the Head, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to clinch it o'th' other ſide: <hi>The Treaſons,</hi> quo' he, <hi>were
ſo deſparate, bloody, and villainous, that when he firſt heard
the account thereof, his Hair ſtood on End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He would ſeem by theſe Words to be a Perſon that us'd
to be frighted with his own Shadow; but he is too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40874:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Knave to be ſo eaſily ſcar'd. Some ſay it was
the Devil that ſtood at his Elbow, to help his Invention,
that made his Hair ſtare: But that can never be neither;
the Viſit of a dear Friend, ſuch as the Devil is to him, can
never be terrible to any Man: Therefore there muſt be
ſome other Reaſon why his <hi>Hair ſtood on end:</hi> I think I
have it; His Conſcience appear'd to him in the gaſtly
ſhape of Treaſon and Murder, mantled with Perjuries
and High-Treaſons, with a Glory of Hell-ſire encircling
her Brows; and that put him into a terror for a while:
but it ſeems he had a Charm, and ſent her packing with
a vengeance; for he has no ſooner done with one Lie,
but he begins another immediately.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For my part,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am of the Church of</hi> England
<hi>eſtabliſhed by Law.</hi> Which if he be, I durſt be bound to
do Penance with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> He of the Church of
<hi>England!</hi> Rather of ſome of thoſe <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that worſhip the Devil. No Man can believe him
to be of that Church, of which no ſooner has he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
himſelf a Member, but he preſently diveſts it of the
true Character of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> For, ſaith he, <hi>I am of the
Church of</hi> England, <hi>yet have the Charity to be concern'd, &amp;c.</hi>
As if <hi>Charity,</hi> without which there can be no true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
were not a thing uſual in the <hi>Church of England;</hi>
only he had pick'd up a little by the bye. Truly the
<hi>Church of England</hi> is very much honour'd by ſuch a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
But the Doctrine and Practice of the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> I hope, is too well known, to be canker'd by
ſuch a polluted Gangren as he. They ſay, indeed, that
Perſons infected with the Plague are ſtill de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
others; and this, I make no doubt, was the <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſon
why he profeſſed himſelf to be of the <hi>Church of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40874:20"/>
For, thinks he, if I could perſuade the World, that the
Members of the <hi>Church of England</hi> were without <hi>Charity,</hi>
Liars, and Forgerers, like himſelf, what a fine Church
would he make of it? And thus you ſee how he levels
his Porcupine Quills at all, in particular, in general;
here, there, and every where; as if he thought that
Scab of himſelf were ſufficient to Leproſie the whole
<hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But wherein does his</hi> Charity <hi>conſiſt? Why, in being</hi>
concern'd to ſee how that ſubtile Emiſſary, that true Emblem
of his Lord and Maſter <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who is certainly a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
in his heart, gulls and leads you poor unthinking Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
about by the Noſes.</p>
            <p>One would think a Perſon of ſo much <hi>Charity,</hi> a Man
of more <hi>Charity</hi> than all the <hi>Church of England</hi> beſide,
might have reſerv'd about the quantity of half a Scruple
for me too, and not in the midſt of all his <hi>Charity</hi> have
ſhewn himſelf ſo tranſported, and in ſuch an agony of
raving and railing: And all this to uſher in a Lie, as long
as from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> ſpun up with a great deal of
curioſity and ſtudy, and yet not worth the while: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impoſſible for a Lie of ſuch a magnitude to continue
long conceal'd. For Lies of this ſort, like Fire-works
thrown in the middle of the Street, ſpend themſelves with
a Bounce, and do no more miſchief. And thus it is a
ſtrange thing that I ſhould have been all this time <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming
the Nation, and putting all into Mutiny and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,</hi>
and no body hear of it. Nay, I am perſuaded,
that had this ſame Lie-framer known it himſelf, he would
not have been ſparing to have given a piece of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
ſo conducing to the Nations ſafety and my Ruine.</p>
            <p>In the Concluſion, he ſays, <hi>he cannot give any account of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40874:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Particulars of this Helliſh Deſign.</hi> Hereby the Devil
may ſee what a great care he ought to take, and what a
Watch to ſet over that Creature Man. Here is a little
Conjurer, that has been uſing his Art, and ſummoning
from the Infernal Regions a whole Squadron of Lies, to
aſſail my Reformation; and the active Hobgoblins are
buſie at work: when on a ſudden out drops an unwary
bit of Truth from the mouth of their Maſter, and then
they all vaniſh; as our Grannams of old us'd to tell us,
the Devil was wont to take his Heels upon the recital of
a <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> or a Doſe of Holy Water. For now he is
plain with all, and tells the World, <hi>he cannot give any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Particulars of this Helliſh Deſign.</hi> Where I
ſhall leave the Fool groping in the dark, deſiring him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
That when he has met with his Tinder-box,
ſtruck a Light, and overtaken the Particulars which he
is hunting after, he will be ſo candid as not to conceal
the leaſt Tittle of his Knowledge, to the end he may in
ſome meaſure acquit himſelf from being thoſe three
things, which otherwiſe I muſt needs take him to be;
that is to ſay, a <hi>Liar,</hi> a <hi>Fool,</hi> and a <hi>Knave.</hi>
