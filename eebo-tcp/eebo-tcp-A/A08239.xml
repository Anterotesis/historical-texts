            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and vnnecessary leysure, without profit, and not to meditate &amp; thinke that at one time or other it is meete to hoouer with the winges, to leaue the nest, and to flie abroade, that they may aspire to the knowledge, and attaine to the sight of great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherwith they shal neuer be acquainted, otherwise than by the booke or the map, which differ as much in mouing the imagination and other faculties of the mind, as the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a thing in a glasse or a paynted table, doth vary from the thing represented? To vndertake trauelling, the vtilitye (which is not small) springing from thence, shoulde inuyte all liberall mindes and free natures. And in truth none are so muche adorned and benefited by peregrination as Noble and Great men; though doubtlesse it is not deniable, that common men, (I meane not triobular mates) men I say, of base descent and linage, haue thereby not only bin commended to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable; but also their owne experience and triall of occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in trauelling, doth procure thus much more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vnto them, that they are among men vntrauelled as Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perus among the smaller starres. For when wee eyther heare or reade of fruitefull countries, of well gouerned common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes, of true religion and diuine worship, of learned men, of trayning vp youth, of manners and behauiours &amp;c: is it not sweete in euery ones eare, is it not woorth the vnderstanding, doth it not deserue diligent marking and remembring? But yet much more pleasaunt, and profitable is it to view the very things them selues, to behold them, and to see them with satie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as the Poet very aptly saith:
<q>
                  <l>That which we heare with outwarde eare,</l>
                  <l>moues not the minde so much,</l>

            <p>A certaine Traueller, but (as maye bee suspected by the course of his writing) superstitious, according to his time, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a voyage of his owne, saith thus: Shoulde it grieue or repent me of my peregrination to Rome, specially in the yeare of Iubile? No in truth. For such thinges as were doubtfull to
<pb facs="tcp:13552:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me, before vncertaine, &amp; as a shadow, are now, by the infallible testimonie of mine eies assured vnto me with singular credite, and haue raised vp in me an exceeding delectation &amp; astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They therfore at no hand deserue the hearing, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing induced by an argument drawen from the greatnesse of the labors, &amp; the dangerousnes of circumstances incident vnto tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling, suppose that the same is to be laide a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eepe, to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; not medled with at all. But what (think we) may be obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted against those shelsnailes? This truly, that people are borne to paynes taking, as birdes to flying. Aristotle in his Ethicks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a capable hearer of his morall preceptes, reiecteth infantes and olde men as insufficient: which two degrees of age do seeme (in some mens thinking) vnfit for trauelling: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the one, by reason of their multiplied yeeres; are to be released from the tediousnesse thereof; the other also, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of want in iudgement, vnderstanding and strength, are wholly to be sequestred from it. But I do much mislike their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and the reasons likewise thereto ann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed. For though infantes are vnfit for peregrination, yet to exclude olde men, as vnapt, is (in my poore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt) palpable erron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>artly also for hys sonne Iosephs sake, whom naturally he loued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Agayne, if olde men are condemned as vnfit for peregrination, then truely (by the same comparison) women much more whom the same Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle tearmeth vnperfect creatures. But the Queene of the South, hearing of Solomons wisedome, glory, and mightinesse left the territories of her owne dominions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Onely this I say, that the greatest commendation and praise of a traueller is, not onelye to talke by knowledge roundly of such famous Cities, Countries, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and other straunge obiectes as he hath seene; but also to speake their language redily, to learne their manners desirous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to know their religion perfectly, their pollicie throughly, their gouernment absolutely, and all thinges els, that hee may imploy himselfe about profitably; as it is recorded of Vlisses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom Ascham out of Homer commendeth in these words:
<q>
                  <l>All trauellers doe gladly report great praise of Vlisses,</l>
                  <l>For that he knew many mens manners, and saw many cities.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And as histories beare witnesse of Mithridates the King of Pontus, whose peregrinations and expeditions into forreyne landes was so beneficiall, that (besides a number of vnnamed commoditities) he had the exquisite vse of two and twenty sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry tongues. But nowe (Right honorable and Noble) to stop this flowing streame of wordes, I leaue to the leuell of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act considerations the manifold vtilities of peregrination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you are completely furnished with knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in that behalfe, not seuered, but vnited.

he had caused to be put vnto the chaine, there was no remedy to get them away, but by great presents which the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor made vnto the Bascha, and to those that were about hym: and also that he should become surety too cause to be rendred and deliuered 30. Turks slaues, which were taken at Malta at the landing of the armie. There was within a towre (which the Spaniards had buylt at the entry of the Hauen when they tooke the citie) a French knight with thirty Souldiers which the Turkes did practise as much as in them lay, too ouercome with fayre woordes, as they hadde doone with them of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle: but of his part he did dally with them so well and so long, and with so many subtleties &amp; conditions which he proponed vnto them, that he found meanes to recouer a barke, intoo the which he and his men got<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; after hauing abandoned the place retired into our gallies.

The 18. the Spanish Argosin bought of them a Moore slaue of his with his 2. little daughters, the one being 6. yere old &amp; the other sucking as yet the mothers brests for 62. ducats: which slaue, for my descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diuers apparel I thought good liuely to present by a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the end of the next chapter.</p>

that he had within his gallies the Gouernour and other knights of Tripoli. But he vnderstanding of the taking of Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli was in such a rage and anger, that he sent word back again that he would do nothing vntil the morning, that he shuld haue all his counsel together, to vnderstand of them what were too be done, and afterwardes would let him vnderstande his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The knight Parisot sent foorthwyth certayne refreshinges of bread, wine, and sweet water: which were accepted in better parte then the answeare of the grand maister: Vaillier &amp; other knights went to lye within the Bourge. The next daye in the morning the hauen was opened, into which we entred without any welcome bidden. And neuerthelesse the grand maister sent Parisot and certaine other auncient knights to receiue the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, who greatly disdayned at the message that in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before was sent vnto him, which the knights would fayne haue cloaked and excused, but could not with honesty doe it: being come to the castle, he was receiued of the grandmayster with smal countenance,<note place="margin">Ingratitude of the grand mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> as a recompence for that he had at hys great charges and costs, besides the losse of his men that were dead and diseased, safely brought away the knightes and soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from Tripoli, who if it had not byn for hym and his gifts had all remayned as Slaues to the Turkes: wherein the grande maister could not be perswaded, which against al right &amp; truth mainteined his opinion, that without the good willes of the knights, they would neuer haue Surrendred.

A little below this temple vpon the same mountaine, was the castle of Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, the husband of Helene, which was king of Sparta, &amp; lord of this Ile.

Likewise after our first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall, the Ambassadour hauing sent his gard to the mountain of S.

This yle is diuided into 2. parts: to wit, by height and lownesse, the height towards the south is high and hilly, ful of great woods, darke vallies and riuers, which issuing into the sea, cause many myls to grind.

These trees doe properly resemble the Lentiscus (which is the cause that diuers do write that the Mastic is the teare or droppings of the Lentiscus, but they are a great deale higher &amp; haue more larger leaues. As for the trimming &amp; gathering of the mastick, is vsed in this maner. The Segniori giueth vnto the inhabitats of euery castle or village of this lower part, such portion &amp; qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity of the plants &amp; rootes of these trees, as they think good, vpon conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that euery one in his degree shall trim them &amp; keep the ground cleane that is vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that the time &amp; season being come to gather the Mastic, he do deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto the Segniorie a certaine weight and quantitie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding too the number of the trees that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto him.

them to furnish the quantitie by them promised, they are constrained to pay for that which lacketh, the double that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was giuen vnto them for the aboundance, and this charge the Lordes doe lay vpon them to make them the more careful and diligent, the better to labor, trimme, and make cleane the trees. The order to pull and gather the Mastick from the trees is this. About the beginning of the monethes of Iuly and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, the husband men with a pointed Iron doe rent and cut the barke of the trees in diuers places, and out of these incisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cuttes proceedeth the Masticke by droppes as it were Gum,<note place="margin">The maner of gatheryng of mastick.</note> which they gather in the moneth of September follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; after do deliuer the same vnto the Segniorie, as before is saide, This done, the Lordes do part the same, and put it to the handeling and administration of foure of them: the one of which hath the charge too furnishe all Grecia: the other, the whole West partes, which is Italie, Fraunce, Spaine, and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie: the third distributeth his part throughout little Asia, which verily is Turkie: and the fourth, furnisheth Suria, Egypt and Barbarie. Moreouer the said foure Lords haue vnder them Commities, which do distribute the masticke throughout all the principall towns beyng vnder theyr charge.

About the time that the figs begynne to waxe ripe, they teare certaine braunches of the figge tree that is nought, and caste the same vpon the other that is good, or els doe fasten by the stake certaine quantitie of the yll figges, after they haue firste picked them, out of which prickes do ingender and breed cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine small flying wormes, which with their billes and stinges picking the other figs, sodaynely after they are picked, they come to a good and perfect rypenesse, and as I was informed they haue of those fig trees, a great quantitie in that Iland. The second thing worthie of memorie is, that in certain Casales or villages of that Ile, are seene an inestimable number of great red partriges, as tame as though they wer chickins or hens of this country which the countrie folks do feed by great flocks,<note place="margin">Tame partri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which are led &amp; brought to and fro the fieldes.</note> driuing them in the daye time too goe grase in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, and towards the euening the boyes or girles, which do keep them, do cal them together with a whistle or some song: and these Partriges being accustomed to such calles, inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently euery flock (which somtimes are two or three hundred more or lesse) gather to their conductor, which bringeth them home to their village &amp; dwelling as though they were hennes or tame geese: they go also a feeding in small flockes alongest the streets of the citie &amp; within priuate houses, but being cari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed out of this Ile, they become wild, forgetting their tamenes.<note place="margin">A tribute whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of Chio that wil not marry must pay</note> They of Chio (as diuers inhabitants worthie of credit haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me) obserue a custom vsed of antiquity, that if a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the discease of her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, wil remain a widow with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce neuer to marry again: the Segniorie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straineth her to pay a certain peece of mony, which they cal Argomoniatico, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to

               <p>Now there resteth to speake of the dressing of their meat &amp; the ordinary maner of eating of the Turks which farre differeth from ours,<note place="margin">Great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixte the Turks &amp; vs in dressing of meate.</note> being so superfluous, curious, and delicate, and our Cookes dressing the same accordingly: wheras to the contrary theirs is scant, bare, and grosse, without anye diuersities of lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, dressinges, sawces, ioyces, and confections: their Cookes being very simple dressers of meat, as being neither dainty nor delicate in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dressing therof. For the Turks do content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with slight meates &amp; easily dressed,<note place="margin">Meates of the Turkes.</note> so as they be nourishing or restoratiue: as Bucks flesh, Goates fleshe, Mutton, Lambe, and Kidde, and certayne Hennes, whereof there they haue as fatte and as sauery as in anye other place, where I haue beene. They do eate little beefe, and lesse veale, for they say that the cow ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing her calfe taken away from her would loose her milke, and thereby should lack butter, cheese, and other whitemeat, they hold the sheepes feet for a very delicate meate, which ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in diuers shops at Constantinople are set foorth to be solde readie sodden &amp; dressed with pilled garlike, which is their com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon sauce at all times, there are also to be sold pies of minced meate, and rice dressed with butter and almonds very sauorie and of a good taste: as for the fleshe they wyll rather eate it rosted then sodde, and do roast the same in maner following: They haue a great Iron potte of the bignesse of a ketle, in the bottome whereof they doe lay red burning coales, and ouer it a gredyron, vpon the which they doe roast their flesh through the vapour and heate of the coales,<note place="margin">Water is the moste commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drinke of the Turkis</note> which can neither be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some nor daintie. And to be short their kitchins &amp; Cookes are nothyng lyke vnto ours: as for their drynke, their most vsuall and common beurage is that which is natural vnto al beastes in the worlde, too witte, fayre and cleare water. But they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13552:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue notwithstanding other drinkes artificially made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned of diuers sortes which they doe sel in sundry places of the city. Some made with water and barley after the maner of Ale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some other of peares or apples, or with the seething toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of plummes, reisons, figges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peares, peaches, and other lyke fruits, &amp; of the beurage which they do cal Sorbet, they do much vse to drinke in the sommer with yse or snow to coole the same. They do also drinke much Aqua vitae both at and after meales which they cal Archent. As for natural wine, notwithstanding that by the Mahumetical law, the drinking therof is forbidden them, yet do they for all that leaue it nothing at all, taking of it oftentimes so much in, that scarce they are able to beare it. But it is when it costeth them nothing, for there is no nation in the worlde which seeke more theyr owne aduauntage then these Turkes doe, specially when they maye get it of the Chrystians, because they doe spend more and keep better cheere then they of their nation doe. For example whereof, I haue often times seene diuers of them, &amp; of the principallest, as Secretaries, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomans, and other officers of the great Turke which came to the lodging of Monsieur Darramont our Ambassador, to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet and make merry, and without any curtesie drunk as much as pleased them, which nothing was refused them, but to the contrary the Ambassadour wel knowing their natural inclyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, forgotte nothing which might serue for their good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, aswell with delicate meats, as diuers sortes of good wines both Malmesies and Muscadels, wherof they do stuffe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues so ful, that oftentimes in going home to their houses the largest &amp; broadest streets in the city are too narrow for them. And are so farre from shame and honest ciuility, that they doe not thinke they haue made good cheere, nor attribute any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto those that haue feasted them, except they bee made beastly drunk. Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that by theyr law as I haue said, they are specially forbidden to drinke wine or to bee drunken, wherat they make no great scruple &amp; lesse sinne, so as they may drink free without their cost. They haue another order to make themselues drunk without wine which is with their Opium,<note place="margin">Opium wyll make them drunke.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a composition made with a white stuffe, wherof the Turkes
<pb facs="tcp:13552:95"/>
doe not only vse, but also the Persians and other people of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, through the opinion which they haue, that it maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to forget choler &amp; melancholy, &amp; so causeth them to be ioyfull and merry, and in the warres more stoute and hardy. Of which Opium after they haue taken in of it about a Dragma, doth so worke with them, and maketh them so out of square, that they loose both their wits and vnderstanding, for they go reeling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the streetes, holding one of another, as the other Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kardes doe, foming out of the mouth like vnto chafed boares, making fierce and terrible cries and howlings like vnto doggs. And being in this case, it is not good for Iewes or Christians to meet with them, least they should be well beaten with fystes or cudgels. But those which are most to be feared in the meeting are those 3. kinds which in the former chapter I haue liuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed vnto you: to wit, the Azamoglans, the Leuentis, and the Azappis being renied Christians, and mortall enemies vnto all Christians, and those which do vnto them the most wrongs and outrages, and thus ye haue heard of the manner of eating and drinking of the Turkes, farre differing from ours. But because I will not forgette to touch the manner of the apparrell of these Cooks, I wil say that they do weare a long coate of marokin or leather closed, and shutting the same vppon the brest with great flat buttons of tinne insteed of siluer, wearing on their heads a white Zarcole like vnto the Ianissaries, but without any fringe of gold or other enrichment in al respects as the figure follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth represent vnto you.</p>

The sacrifice being thus ended, a Sermon is made vnto them by the Cady Muselman, and that beng done, euerye one of them doe goe to cast 2. stones in a place, where they say the Diuel appeared to Abraham when he builded the temple. From thence they returne to Mecqua to say diuers other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, desiring God to exalt them as he exalted Abraham to the building of the temple.

And the more to prouoke men to giue vnto them, presented to the one an apple, to the other an orange, or as I haue said, did cast sweet water in their faces, for you must vnderstand that the liberality of the Turkes and Moores is so great that they will hazard to giue the value of a Mangor, which is the 8. part of an Aspre, to haue two or three Aspres again for it. The same day in the afternoone these woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful Sacquas with their ornature came vnto me to the house of my Lord the Ambassador, where then I was lodged, he being then in Andrinopole, to see as they said, the picture which the day before I had made of one of their companions, whiche brought them thither.

As for the other halfe of the young menne that were left in the towne, whilest these were a hunting, exercised them selues in those thinges whiche in their infancie they hadde learned, to wit, to cast the dart, and shoote in companies.

The richest &amp; best peopled nation of this region are the Sabees. The Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Citie wherof is called Saba, cituated on a high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in which their king was in times past created by succession of linage, with great honour and reioycing of the people, whose life although the same seemed to be happy for that he might do al thinges, and had euery man at commaundement without giuing account or reason of those thinges which he did, it was mixed with a great many of perplections: for that it was not permitted vnto him to goe out of his pallace vppon paine (that attempting the contrary) to bee foorthwith stoned by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being an auncient superstition and obseruance which they had by an oracle of their goddes. This region aboue all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the world, is the most pleasant and abundant of things pretious &amp; Aromaticke.

Notwithstanding they were in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation with Alexander the great: yea, so that ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times they durst vndertake to take in hand the occupying of Macedonia.

The first Delly, that I saw, was in Andrinopole, being then with the Lord of Arramont, in the house of Rostan Basha, too whom the sayde Delly was retaynour, who not onelye at my request:

but also in hope to haue some present, as he had, did follow vs vnto our lodging, where whilest he was making good cheere, I tooke the extract of his person, and of his strange habite, which was suche as followeth, his doublet and his longe and large hosen, by the Turkes called Saluares, were of the skinne of a young beare, wyth the haire outward: and vnder theyr Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, bootes, or buskins of yeallowe Marokin, sharpe before and very high beinde, shodde vnderneath with yron, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with long and large spurres. Vppon the head he hadde a long cappe after the Polonian or Georgian fashion, hangyng downe ouer one of his shoulders made of a Leopardes skynne well spotted, and ouer the same before the foreheade for too shew more ferefull, was fastned a long tayle of an Eagle and the two winges nayled vpon the target with two great yron nailes, which hee carryed in a scarfe about his shoulders: hys armes were the Cymiter or skayne, and the dagger: and in the ryghte hande the Busdegan, whiche is to saye, the mase of armes well damaskaned. But certaine when hee departed from Andrino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole, with the forces whiche Achmat Bascha (whiche since the great Turke caused to bee strangled in his bedde) carryed for the great Lord into Transsiluania, I saw him mounted on a fair Turkie horse decked with the whole skinne of a great Lion, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened with the two formost feet before vpon the brest, and the other two hanging downe behind, his Busdegan hung at his sadle bow, &amp; in his right hand bare a long launce, the poleaxe at the point being well steeled, altogeather beeing as yee may liuely see in the picture following. I was moreouer curious to aske him by a Dragoman of what nation he was, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he kept, wherupon wisely he gaue me to vnderstand that he was of nation a Seruian, but that his grandfather was desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Vitruuius in his eight book and third chapter saith, that if they did wash their legs within this riuer Cydne, that incontinent after they should finde them selues cleansed and healed of their disease. The Tarsians were in times past so giuen to philosophie, that they excelled the Athenians and Alexandrians, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Athenians were more famous and renowmed in straunge countries, and that their Citie was more frequented

Neuerthelesse, the Tarsians were in phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy more excellent, and of their citie tooke origin, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater, Archelaus, Antenor, Marcel, Diogenes, Artemidore, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisius, and Crates the Grammarian. Besides Tarse the head ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Cilicia, there is another renowmed citie of the auncients called Coryce, and of the modernes Curth, of all sides enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the sea, sauing of one side being very streight which ioyneth vnto the firme land. Aboue this citie there is an Antherne, a caue or denne,<note place="margin">A caue very strange.</note> which Pomponius Mela saith to be made by such singular artifice of nature, that the admiration, excellency, and soueraigne beautie thereof, carrieth those that enter into it out of their proper senses and memory and almost rauisheth and taketh awaye the spirites of those, whiche vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the sodaine enter intoo it. But after they are come to themselues, they cannot satisfie them of the pleasure which is there. For, for to come to the bottom of this heauenlike denne, you doe discend by a faire stare, about 3. quarters of a myle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delectable and shadowed, where is heard a harmony more then humaine, certaine sounds agreeing, &amp; sounding like vnto sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals or other melodious instruments, which greatly abasheth and seemeth marueilous to those that firste enter into it. So as in times past the inhabitauntes of the countrie by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, opinion did thinke, that this sounding caue was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchrall bedde of the valiaunt Gyant Typhon.

               <p>THracia which first was called Perca, and since Scithon, is a prouince in Europe (counted amongst the regions of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia, most ample and of great compasse, but of an yll tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

the ayre being vnwholesome, &amp; not healthfull, the ground also barren inough, except it be in the places neere vnto the sea. It was named Thracia, after the name of Thiras the sonne of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or els as others say of Thrax the sonne of Mars, &amp; by thys reason (seeming to be the most apparant) was by Euripides cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the house of Mars, at this present day is called Romaine, &amp; is diuided in 2. partes, the one wherof is called Thracia onely, and the other Thracia Chersonese. On the East part bordereth vpon the sea Exinum, and Propontide, on the south the Sea Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geum, the floud, Strymon, presently Redino, &amp; the fields of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia: on the North the riuer Istre, beeing the Danube or Danoe, and on the West the mountains of Peonia a part of Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia, &amp; the riuer of Saue, as Plinie &amp; Strabo haue written, who doe affirme Thracia to be diuided by the mount Eme, and that the Triballes Dardanes (a fierce &amp; proude people) and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s inhabited Thracia, but the Triballes possessed the part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently kept by the Rastians, whom we do cal Seruians. After the Triballes are the Bulgares, from the East vnto the sea Euxinum, &amp; dwel between Istre and the mount Eme, extending towardes the south alongest the sea coast vnto Hellespontus, and is that which presently is called Romanie. The riuers of Thracia are, Bathynia, Athyras, Arsus, vulgarly Chiarelech, Melas, whereof taketh the name the gulph of Mela, otherwise the gulfe of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridia, Hebrus now Matizza, or Valisa, Nesus or Neste, &amp; Strimo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the most famous are the three last. Of the most renowmed mounts ye haue Eme, which separateth the Thracians from the Triballes, which by some hath byn called the chayne of the world. Rhodope, so called by Rhodope Queene of Thracia, out of which do spring the riuers Neste, &amp; Hebrus, &amp; the mount Orbel, much celebrated for the sacrifice of Bacchus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; through the congregation of the Menades vnder the conduct of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Orpheus. Amongst these mountaines Eme is of such a height that from the top therof (which as Pliny reciteth is 6000. paces) is seen the sea of Exinum: there is moreouer the mount Athos of the Latines called Monte santo, because it is altogether habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Caloeres, Greeks, which are (as most curiously wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth M.

This mount Athos is so high, that it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the skies, so as diuers haue written that from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the sun shining, the shadow doth extend to the yle of Lemnos, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant one from another 70. M. pases. And neuertheles Xerxes the great king of the Persians, going against the Graecians, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this mount to be cut through on the side that ioyneth vnto the firm land, making the sea to passe vnderneath it in such sort, that easily he made it round about nauigable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Thraces (as Herodote in his 7 book writeth) haue the way whereby Xerxes passed his army, in such reuerence, that neuer since that time they would till or sow the same. Plutarch in the life of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great, maketh mention of a certayne Stacicrates, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious maister, who being sent for, to come before the said A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, proposed vnto him that if his pleasure were, he would make to be cut in humain figure, the mount of Athos, with such art &amp; industry, that with his left hand, he should sustaine a Citie habitable for 10000. persons, &amp; with the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d shuld powre out a great riuer: which should run down into the sea. But Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander taking it for a iest would not beleeue it. As for the cities of Thracia, the principallest and most ancientest are Bisia, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the fortresse of the kings of Thracia, but odious vnto the swallowes for the detestable sinne of Thereus, Phinolopis, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubisance, presently Pera or Galatha, &amp; Bizance, now Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, cituated vppon the Bosphore Thracian, (wherof I haue before made particular descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.)

               <p>ADrianopolis which sometimes was called Stratomcie, Odry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sus and Trimuntium: vulgarly Andernople, Andernopoli or Andrinople, was a city most ample and faire, as by the auncient walles may be seene, her cituation is in a playne: but about, it hath many fruitful hilles. All the houses, except the auncient churches of the Christians, and the Mosquees and bathes of the Turkes, are builded after the Turkie fashion of wood and earth, Sultan Selim builded there for a dwelling place, a fayre and sumptuous Sarail, for that it was the place of his most resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: as also is of Sultan Soliman, that now reigneth, namely, in Winter, for the commodity of hunting, wherein hee greatly delighteth.

He also further permitted to those that were fayre &amp; well disposed to lye with other mens wyues, for to labour in them as in a fruitfull ground, and to engender children in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, &amp; it was estemed a matter of no reproch to an old &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hauing a faire and young wife, to choose some faire young man seeming agreable vnto him, to make him to lie with her, and so to get her with childe, and rayse vp seede vnto him, which child he took and brought vp as his owne, and yet it seemed vnto him a very foolish and straunge matter in other nations, which so carefully got faire dogges to lyne their hot bitches, and sought the fairest stoned horses to spring their mares: and notwithstanding with great care kept their wyues so closely vnder lock and key, for feare least they shoulde gette of theyr neyghbours, whereof sometymes theyr iealous hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes coulde not furnish them.

               <p>AS for the Athenians, Iustine in his 12. booke reciteth, that they were the first that taught the art of spinning of wooll, making of wines and oyles, to plow the ground, &amp; to sow corn: for at the first they fed on nothing but on acornes, &amp; for theyr dwellings had none other lodgings, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> litle cabbins &amp; caues. Doxius was the first that builded houses in Athens, which (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing therin the maner of the swalows) he builded of earth. In the daies of Deucalion, Cecrops raigned as king ouer the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, &amp; is he whom the Poets haue fayned to haue 2. forheads because he was the first that ioyned the men &amp; the women by the right line of mariage.

After that reigned Amphitrion, which first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated the citie vnto the goddesse Minerua, &amp; named it Athene. In his time was the great flood &amp; inundation of the waters, which marred and drowned the most part of Grecia, &amp; in this great deluge, were only saued those that could get vp to the mountaines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the other which were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed towards Deucalio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> king of Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salia. By whom according to the feinings of the Poets, the world was by order of succession restored. The kingdome being since come vnto Eristheus, during his reigne the sowing of corne was brought in &amp; inuented in Eleusine by Triptolemus, &amp; therfore in remembrance of this good thing the nights were sacred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. The Athenians being esteemed the wisest amongst the Graecians (for that the administration of their common wealth

And this they did for the opinion which they had that a man could not liue without women and company: and when the one was brought to bed or sick he might go vnto the other, or els if the one were barren the other might be fit to bring forth children and succession, and to her that was fitt to conceaue, the gouernement and administration of the house was giuen, and the barren woman was vnto him as a seruaunt.

               <p>THe same Graecians, through their marueilous industry and subtlety of spirite, were inuenters of many monstrous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of superstition and idolatry, for euery one of them had their God, prayers, and ceremonies proper vnto themselues. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter was honored amongst them for a remedy of stormes and tempests, Mars for to eschew the perils and fortune of warres. They honoured Iuno for to get riches, Pallas to obtayne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Venus for to haue discent, &amp; a 1000 like follies whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che amongst them were obserued, so as they fell into such infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that in the end they established their solemne feasts impure and vnhonest: at the which it was vnto euery one indifferently permitted, vnder pretext of religion and holinesse, to rauish &amp; defloure women and maydens: such were the braue solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their false gods, by the Graecians aunciently obserued vnder colour of religion, and so deeply were their hearts drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in errour and idolatry most abhominable, through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of true vnderstanding, and knowledge of the most high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Lord. Cecrops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion is made, was the first amongst them that called on God vnder the name of Iupiter, who inuented the images, and dressed the altars for to offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. And Orpheus was he which produced and celebrated the first sacrifices vnto Liber Pater in the mountaine Boetia, neer vnto Thebes, wheras Liber Pater was born. Wherfore they were called Orpheique, and in the same Orphee was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes taken and torne in peeces. And likewise amongest the Thebans, the Eagle was in opinion thought to be of such diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that because she did flie so high, they supposed her to haue some communication with God. The Athenians also had their religion in such honour and reuerence, that they banished out of their city the Philosopher Diagoras, for that he durst write, that he doubted whether there were any goddes, and if there were any, what kind of ones they might be. These also condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
