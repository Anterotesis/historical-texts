            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Seasonable warning, and serious Exhortation
to, and Expostulation with the Inhabitants
of Aberdene: concerning this present Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation
and day of Gods living Visitation towards
them.</head>
            <p>GReat, unutterably great, O ye Inhabitants, is the Love of God which flowes in my
heart towards you, and in bowels of unspeakable compassion, am I opened, am
I enlarged unto you, in the sight and sense of your conditions, which the Lord
hath discovered and revealed unto Me. O that your eyes were opened, that
ye might see, and behold, this Day of the Lord, and that your ears were unstop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to hear His voice, that cryeth aloud, and calleth One and All of you to Repentance; and
that your hearts were softened, &amp; enclyned to discerne and perceive this blessed hour of His
present Visitation, which is come unto you. He hath lifted up a Standard in the midst of
you, and among your Brethren; He hath called already a Remnant, and inrolled them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
His Banner, and he is calling All to come, he hath not left one without a witness: Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are they that receave Him, and hear him in this day of his appearance. He hath sent forth,
and is daily sending forth his Servants and Messengers, to invite you to come and partake with
Him of the Supper, of the Feast which he hath prepared; and among many others, whom at
sundrie times he hath caused to sound sorth His Testimony: I also have in the Name and
Power and Authority of God, proclaimed his everlasting Gospel among you, and preached,
and held forth the glade tydings of this glorious dispensation, which is Christ manifesting
and revealing himself in and by his Light and Spirit in the hearts of all men, <hi>to lead them out
of all unrighteousness, and filtheness, both of Flesh and Spirit; unto all righteousness, truth, holyness,
peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> But because many of you have dispysed this Day, and as ye
have made mirry over Gods witness in your hearts, not liking there to entertaine Him in his
meek, lowly, yet lovely appearance; so have ye despysed, mocked and rejected, that which
testifieth to this witness without you. Therefore was I commanded of the Lord God, to pass
through your streets covered with Sack-cloath and Ashes, calling you to repentance, that ye
might yet more be awakned, &amp; alarumed to take notice of the Lords Voice unto you, and not to
despyse these things which belong to your peace, while your day lasteth, least hereafter they
be hid from your eyes. And the command of the Lord concerning this thing, came unto me
that very morning, as I awakened, and the burden thereof was very great; Yea, seemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
insupportible unto me, (for such a thing untill that very moment, had never entered me
before, not in the most remote consideration) And some whom I called to declare to them
this thing, can bear witness, how great was the agonie of my Spirit, how I besought the Lord
with tears, that this Cup might pass away from me: Yea, how the pillars of my Tabernacle
were shaken, and how exceedingly my bones trembled, untill I freely gave up unto the Lords
will. And this was the end and tendency of my testimony, to call you to Repentance, by this
signal and singular step, which I as to my own will and inclination, was as unwilling to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42613:2"/>
found in, as the worst and wickedest of you, can be averse from receiving, or laying it to heart.
Let all and every one of you in whom there is yet alive the least regard to God, or his fear,
consider and weigh this matter in the presence of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the Spirit of Jesus Christ in
your hearts, which makes all things manifest, search and examine every one his own Soul,
how far this warning and voice of the Lord is aplicable unto them, and how great need they
have to be truely humbled in their Spirits? Returning to the Lord in their inward parts, with
such true and unfeinged Repentance as answers to the outward cloathing of <hi>Sack cloath,</hi> and
being covered with <hi>Ashes.</hi> And in the Fear and Name of the Lord, I charge all upon this
occasion, to bewarr of a slight, froathie, jearing, mocking spirit, for though such may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to insult for a season, <hi>yet God will turn their laughter into howling, and will laugh when
their calamity cometh;</hi> and such are seen to be in one spirit with those who <hi>spat in the face of
the LORD JESVS, and buffeting him, bid him prophesie who smote him.</hi> Therefore consider, O
Ye Inhabitants, and be serious, standing in fear; Where are ye who are called Christians? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom it is become a wonder, <hi>A stone of stumbling, or matter of mockrie, or a ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
for one in the Name of the LORD, to invite you to Repentance in Sackcloath and Ashes:</hi>
Would not the Heathen condemne you in this thing? And will not <hi>Niniveh</hi> stand up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against you? How is it that ye that are called Christians, can willingly give room to
every idle Mountebank, and can suffer your minds to be drawn out to behold these sinful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisments,
which indeed divert the mind from the serious sense of Gods fear? The people
can be gathered there, and neither the Magistrats complaine of tumult, nor yet Preachers nor
Professors cry out against it as delusion, or madness. O my Friends consider, can there be any
more strongly deluded, then for people daily to acknowledge and confess they are sinners,
and sinning, in words; and to startle at that which did so lively represent unto them, what
they owne to be their condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Were it in good earnest, or were it from a true sense of your
sins, that ye so frequently seem to acknowledge them, ye would not dispyse, nor overlook that
which calleth you to repentance for it. How is it that you can so confidently array your selves
in all manner of gaudy, and superflous Apparel, and exceed in lustful pouderings and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,
and yet are ashamed and amazed at <hi>Sackcloath</hi> and <hi>Ashes;</hi> which according to your
own acknowledgement, is so sutable to your states? Is not this to glory in your shame, and to
be ashamed of that which ought to be, and would be your greatest glory, to wit, true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feinged
Repentance. I shal add that which upon this occasion I declared unto you; I was for
a Sign from the Lord unto you, <hi>I desire ye may not be among those that wonder and perish, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repent and be saved.</hi> And this is my <hi>Testimony</hi> unto you, whither you will hear or forbear,
I have peace with my God in what I have done, and am satisfied that his requirings I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in this thing. I have not sought yours but you, I have not coveted your gold or
silver, or any thing else; nor do I retaine, or entertaine the least hatered, grude, or evil-will
towards any within or without your gates, but continue in pure and unfeinged love towards
all and every one of you, even those who do most dispise or reject me, and my <hi>Testimony,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ready to bless those that curse, and to do good to those that dispitfully use me, and to
be spent in the will of the Lord for your sakes, that your souls may be saved, and God over
all may be glorified; for which I travel, and cry before the Throne of Grace, as becometh</p>

            <head>After this Paper was committed to the Press, some
Queries concerning this mattrr were sent (to
a Friend in Aberdene) by One who in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
styles himself a sober Inquirer, which
maske he quickly pulled off, either for want of
wit, or from too much malice against the truth,
by spreading these queries, at the same time among several
hands, which no truely, sober Inquirer would have done,
untill he had first received, or been refused satisfaction
from him, to whom he particularly directed them. In
order therefore to dispell such cloudie Mists, as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
seeks to raise for darkning the day of Gods appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
through his Children: These Answeres are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fit to be here anexed.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THe Premisses, and Queries following upon them, being all one on the matter, the first being positions
in general, and the other the particular application of them hereto, they need not different an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
both of them are herein comprehended and implyed, as any that will be at the pains to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Queries, and compare them, may observe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the first is therefore answered.</p>
            <p>1. R. B. Denyes his Message to have proceeded from any Light or Illumination in him
as a man, but from the immediate Testimonie of the Spirit of God, in his heart
a manifestation of which Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nig
to the plaine testimonie of the Scriptures, 1. <hi>Cor. 12, 7. 1. Iohn 2. 20. 27. Heb</hi> 8 10. 11. 12.
The which Spirit, and Anointing teaches all the Saints under the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> whereunto
an audible voice is not required for this is said to be within them, and not without them, nor
can it be proven that God spoke alwayes to the Prophets by an audible voice, or that such a
thing is requisite to every true Revelation, receaved from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> els none could be truly
certaine that the Scriptures came from the Spirit of God, untill they received an audible voice
by the outward ear, confirming them of it, nor could any have the assurance of Salvation
without the same, both which the generalitie of <hi>Protestants</hi> hold needful to Believers,
and <hi>Cal. Inst. lib. 1. cap. 7 sect. 4. cap. 8, Sect 1. lib. 3. cap, 1, sect. 4. cap. 3. sect.</hi> 39.
that by the inward, secret testimonie of the Spirit, without an audible voice. Nor was <hi>Iohn Hus</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42613:3"/>
his prophesie of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>George Wisharts</hi> of the Cardinals death alleadged to have proceeded
from an outward audible voice, and yet proved both true. As likwise several others of latter
years, which might be mentioned.</p>
            <p>2. A Message thus delivered from the Testimonie of the Spirit of God in the heart, reaches
to the manifestation of the same Spirit. in the hearts of those to whom it is delivered, if they
wilfully do not resist and shut it out. Thus the Ninivits were reached at the call of <hi>Ionah,</hi> and
those who heard <hi>Peter,</hi> were pricked in their hearts; yet neither the one or the other had such
an immediate particular call as <hi>Ionah</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had, but the testimonie of the Spirit through
these two, touched, reached, and raised that of God in their hearts, and made it applicable
unto them. Yet those that dispise this Light, and manifestation of God in themselves, may
come to jeer, and mock at a message proceeding from it, through another, even as the Scribs
and Pharisees did at Christ; and therefore were worthie of condemnation, and judged by the
Heathen, such as <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Ninivie,</hi> even as it is with those of the same spirit at this
day, who while they cry up the writtings of the Prophets, &amp; other Scripturs, (as did the Pharisees)
are dispysing Prophesying, or the teaching, or leadings of the Spirit, which the Apostle decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be the nature of the New Covenant dispensation; and therefore no wonder if according
to the Scripture <hi>Pro.</hi> 28. 18. where there is no Vision the people perish.</p>
            <p>3. The Assisters to this Action, having had the thing declaired unto them, retiering to the
inward Testimonie of the same Spirit in themselves, did feell union therewith, and such as went
along, did not onlie find a true liberty (which might have sufficed) but some of them a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
to concurr with it. And as for the carrying of the Hat and Cloak, it was altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick,
being neither essential nor circumstantial to the thing, nor so looked upon by these
who did it: Yet the carping thereat shewes in the proposer, a critical mind, very void of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness,
which the Lord, as of purpose to starve, hath permitted him to build that part of the
Querie in relation to A. H. wife upon a false report, the thing being a manifest untruth.</p>
            <p>And in answere to the second proposition of the premisses, its the alone immediate testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the Spirit of God, that can truly discover all false pretenders and delusions, which if
any can, let them deny, without overturning the Basis of all Christian Religion, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the faith of the Saints in all ages uncertaine.</p>
