            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AMONG all the various kinds of <hi>Seditious</hi> People, that from time to time have <hi>Plagn'd</hi> our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, there have been none ſo dreadfully Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and Troubleſome to the Peace of <hi>England,</hi> as our <hi>Government Menders,</hi> who always find ſomething that they think ought to Altered, Amended, or Aboliſhed, and are ſo fond of their own <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> Notions, which rather proceed from <hi>Over-heated Brains,</hi> than <hi>Solid</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they can neither be at quiet themſelves, nor ſuffer any Societies of Men to be ſo, that will but hearken whilſt they are communicating their own fanſiful Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and <hi>Whims</hi> that have no other Deſign than to diſtract the Body Politick.

Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> being ambitious of getting a Name among a Party that never wiſh'd well to the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> knowing the <hi>Honourable and Loyal Houſe of Commons</hi> did Annually meet at <hi>St.</hi> Margaret's <hi>Church in</hi> Weſtminſter, on the 30th of <hi>January,</hi> to bewail a Crime ſo deteſted by God and Man, as the Murder of a King is, he procured the Favour of Preaching before that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Aſſembly</hi> on that Solemn Day of Humiliation, in which ſo black a Crime was committed, which had it not long ſince been publickly appointed by the Voice of the <hi>whole Nation,</hi> that we, and our Poſterities after us, ſhould Yearly bewail the <hi>Guilty Memory</hi> of it, it would have remain'd an <hi>Indelible Diſgrace</hi> to the preſent Age, and to the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name, and yet the reaſon, as 'tis credibly reported, why he coveted the Honour of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before this <hi>Auguſt Aſſembly</hi> on that occaſion, was, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought himſelf able, to give that Wiſe and Illuſtrious Auditory, ſuſtcient Reaſons for for the Non-obſervance of it any longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Bold, Saucy, and Daring undertaking, to Preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Law in force, before our <hi>Legiſlators;</hi> as if they knew not what was fit to be <hi>Retained</hi> or <hi>Aboliſhed,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Directions of a <hi>Pragmatical Preacher,</hi> that like a <hi>Blind,</hi> and Bewildred Traveller, ſeems to have loſt his way; and whilſt he affected to <hi>Dictate</hi> ſo magiſterially out of the <hi>Common Road and Duty of a Preacher,</hi> he fell in a Complication of Abſurdities: Each of which was a moſt intolerable Blunder in his Politicks, and may chance raiſe a Storm upon him, that all the Friends he has will never be able to pacify.</p>
            <p>Of all Men living, mr. <hi>Stephens,</hi> conſidering his own <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> had the greateſt reaſon in the World to have worn out his Days in the greateſt <hi>Obſcurity,</hi> and it not only accuſes his own Diſcretion, but the Common <hi>Prudence</hi> of all his Adviſers, to revive the Memory of

his <hi>former</hi> (and almoſt buried) <hi>Crimes,</hi> by ſetting him up in ſuch a Celebrated Auditory, which would carry the Diſcourſe of them into all the Countries and Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>England,</hi> had he behaved himſelf never ſo cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in the Pulpit: And what then might he reaſonable expect, when he reſolved to <hi>Affront the Laws,</hi> and run counter to the Sentiments of the whole Kingdom; but that his <hi>Ahominable and not to be named Crimes, with which he was accuſed by his Scholars, when he was School-Maſter of</hi> Briſtol, <hi>and for which he run away from the City for fear of being Proſecuted,</hi> ſhould be revived to his Eternal Infamy, and Hatred of all Mankind. Which if his Adviſers had conſidered, they would never have caſt ſuch an <hi>Odium</hi> up on their <hi>Tennets</hi> and <hi>Politicks,</hi> as to have publiſh'd them by a Man of Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Character.</p>
            <p>However, up he comes with his <hi>

brought the Nation under a Cruel and Barbarous Vaſſalage to the Meaneſt of their Fellow Subjects, and his knowing the ſame Cauſes will for ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame Effects, made theſe the main things he inſiſted upon on the Thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing like a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or indeed a Man, beſides his wretched ſelf, could have plaid the <hi>Buffoon</hi> and <hi>Incendiary</hi> at ſo malicious a rate, upon ſo <hi>Solemn</hi> and <hi>Sad</hi> an Occaſion, as brought together that Auguſt Aſſembly before whom he Preach'd; tho' as another Specimen of his Defence, he was pleaſed, for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beſt known to himſelf, to omit praying for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and every Branch of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> which I believe, was ſcarce omited upon that Day by any Preacher in <hi>England</hi> beſides himſelf.</p>

            <p>What could Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> read in the Faces of theſe Wiſe and Loyal Senators, that could tempt him to ſuch an Extravagant Conceit, that they would harken to ſuch an Infamous Propoſal?

Prince, which had been ſo Barbarouſly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And tho' the Bill did not paſs for the <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet the ſame Parliament had done another thing before, which in ſpight of all Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Arguments againſt it, may out-laſt all of that Kind in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> or elſewhere in the whole Nation, <hi>viz. Enated, That the Day of that horrid Particide. be obſerved as a ſolenm Faſt through the whole Kingdom for ever.</hi> And doubtleſs could they have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, that any Perſon would have taken the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to Aſperſe his Memory, or to have given Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the <hi>Non Obſervance of this Faſt,</hi> it would have been Voted no leſs Treaſonable that his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But let us hear Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Reaſons for its Abolition. And the firſt was,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe it creates Animoſities among the</hi> People; which is a very weak Argument, ſince the very <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition</hi> of the Faſt would have furniſh'd them with a Subject to keep up the Popular Animoſities, greater than ever the Obſervation of the Day can pretend to. In which no queſtion but Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> will have his Share, for endeavouring to obliterate the Remembrance and Deteſtation of a Crime, that the Wiſdom of the Nation have <hi>Enacted to continue for ever,</hi> and peradventure he may live to be pointed at in the Streets, ſaying, <hi>That is the Man that Attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put down the Aniverſary Faſt for the Murder of</hi> Charles the Firſt, and by this means like <hi>Eroſtratus</hi> may be remembred till Time ſhall be no more; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, could our Preacher have obtain'd his end, an almoſt Twenty Years <hi>Rebellion,</hi> with the Miſeries,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41320:8"/>
Calamities and Deſolations that accompanied Us, will for ever keep up Animoſities, tho' there were no ſuch Day in the Calender as the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> And therefore with Reſpect to Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Project, I think the beſt way to extinguiſh the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that Guilty Day, <hi>Is to abhor and Utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Principles, that prompted Ill Men to Commit ſo Inhuman and Barbarous a Crime;</hi> for as long as Men will be Arraigning Governments, Trampling upon the Power of Kings, and making all publick Diſtractions, concur in making way to their belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> others will upon better grounds Reply, That God is making Inquiſition for Blood, and that the Murder of our late Sovereign is Required, and Viſited upon this preſent Generation.</p>
            <p>Another Reaſon aſſigned by our Preacher ſor the <hi>Non-Obſervance of this Day of Humiliation,</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Bloody Actors in that Fatal Stroke were <hi>Dead,</hi> and the Memory of their Crimes ought to be Buried with them: Which Argument is as Weak and Feeble as the Other, unleſs he could prove, That the Principles by which thoſe Regici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Acted, were as ſurely Damn'd to all Eternity, as the Authors of them are Dead: For till then, the Faſt ought to continue, like a Buſh ſtuck up by a Charitable Traveller in a Quick-Sand, to Warn Men oſ the Sin and Danger, which thoſe Ill Men by eſpouſing Ill Principles, were led into; for, as I have ſaid before, what has been done, may be done again, and the ſame Cauſes will for ever produce the ſame Effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41320:8"/>
Now to ſhew that theſe Accurſed Principles are at preſent more predominant than they were 1642; which I can aſcribe to nothing but the Looſeneſs and Irreligion of the Age, I would ask Mr. <hi>Stephens,</hi> Whether the <hi>Commonwealth Party</hi> are not now more Numerous, Inſolent, and ſince they joyn'd with the <hi>Jacobites</hi> mor <hi>formidable</hi> too, than in any King's Reign whatſoever? And alſo I would know, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not take the ſame Methods, to Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Preſent Gouernment under <hi>William the Third,</hi> as their Predeceſſors did under his Royal Grandfather <hi>Charles the Firſt?</hi> And I heartily Wiſh this Evil be not ſo long neglected tell it be grown paſt Redreſs, or Cure.</p>
            <p>Are not our Republican Scriblers the Common Authors of all the Virulent Pamphlets againſt the Government? Who by Reporting what is Falſe, and Preverting what is True, are forcing Unſteady Men upon the Rock, on which their Fathers were Shipwrackt.</p>
            <p>Has not a Bold <hi>Rennigado Iriſh Popiſh Prieſt</hi> Written <hi>Milton</hi>'s Life, who Vindicated the Murder of the <hi>Lord's Anointed,</hi> and gives that Wretch many high Elogiums, that once occaſion'd ſeveral Hours De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in the <hi>Houſe of Commons:</hi> Whether he ſhould not be <hi>Hang'd</hi> for what he had Written, in Juſtification of that Abominable Parricide, and had ſome of his <hi>Now Admired Books</hi> Burnt by the Hands of the <hi>Common Hangman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not all that Vile Man's Works now <hi>Reprinted?</hi> And for fear they ſhould not do Miſchief enough that way, Is not an Abridgment of the moſt <hi>Poyſonous Paſſage,</hi> put all together in the Account of his Life?</p>
            <p>And which is no leſs obſervable than all the reſt; Are not all theſe Collections made by a <hi>Prieſt in</hi> Romiſh <hi>Orders?</hi> And who, for ought we know, tho' he Acts the Part of a <hi>Republican,</hi> may be a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, ſent hither on purpoſe to Embroyl our Affairs, and to Divide us among our Selves, that at laſt we may become a Prey to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy of our Nation and Religion; for this is but the Old Game Renewed, and 'twould be a Wonder, while ſome are Rending our Government to pieces, if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould not have their Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing among us, to haſten our Ruine.</p>
