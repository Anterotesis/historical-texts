            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Dearly Beloved, and Highly Eſteemed <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> our heavenly Head; the Living and <hi>Good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi> of the Sheep, by whom we have been found out (one of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and two of a Tribe) and made One holy Flock and Family unto Him, in this day of his Spiritual and Glorious Appearance: <hi>Grace, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> yea, His Peace, <hi>Which the World can neither give you, nor take from you,</hi> be plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully multiplied amongſt you from day to day; that a holy, harmleſs, and faithful People you may be, yielding to the Lord the Fruits of his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106222:2"/>
Goodneſs, by a <hi>Circumſpect</hi> and <hi>Self-denying</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to the End.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear Friends, whom I Know and Love, and you alſo whom I truly love, tho' I do Not Know Perſonally, nor may be ſo known of ſome of you, ſince it has pleaſed the Good and All-wiſe God to order my Courſe from you, ſo that I cannot viſit you; as I have often deſired, before I left you: This therefore is to be my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly <hi>Farewell</hi> unto you. And ſurely my Soul is Bowed in Humble Petitions to Iſrael's God, The True, and Living, and Powerful God, that it may be <hi>well with you</hi> all, here and for ever. And, my Dear Brethren, this is certain, if you <hi>Do well,</hi> you ſhall certainly <hi>Fare well,</hi> and in the End of all your <hi>Trials, Troubles,</hi> and <hi>Temptations,</hi> it ſhall be ſaid unto you, <hi>Well Done, Good and Faithful Servants, Enter ye into the Joy of the Lord.</hi> O it is that which crowns the work. Not Saying but Doing, we muſt not only Begin, but End well; and hold out to the End. <hi>Not of thoſe who are weary of Well-doing, but who follow the Lord fully,</hi> as <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> did in old time, and are Famed for it. So that tho' God has Appeared to us, and Given us many and undeniable Teſtimonies that it was He, and not Another, who Reached our Hearts, and Touched our Conſciences, and brought us to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, yea, and <hi>Forſaking</hi> too, of that which offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106222:2"/>
Him, in great meaſure, Bleſſed be his Name, yet we are not to ſtop, or take up our <hi>Reſt</hi> here: <hi>We muſt Watch ſtill, Pray ſtill, Fight ſtill, that good Fight of Faith, till we have overcome the Enemy of our Souls:</hi> And even then muſt we <hi>Watch</hi> and <hi>Pray,</hi> and that to the End of our Days; that we may not loſe that <hi>Crown of Glory, which God the Righteous Judge, ſhall give to all thoſe that love his Appearance, overcome, and perſevere to the End:</hi> For be aſſured we ſhall <hi>reap if we faint not:</hi> But we ſhall faint if we <hi>wait not upon God,</hi> who alone is the Strength of his People.</p>
            <p>This, My Dear Friends, is that which lies with greateſt ſtreſs upon my Spirit; <hi>Watch to your Dayly Preſervation,</hi> and be not ſatisfied unleſs you feel it. <hi>Sufficient is the Day for the Evil thereof,</hi> ſay'd our Bleſſed Lord. God is not wanting: He that long ſtood at the Door of our Hearts, under our Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency in times paſt, <hi>till his Locks were wet with the Dew, and his Hair with the Drops of the Night,</hi> till we were wakened out of our Carnal Security, and came to Judgment in our ſelves, unto unfeigned Repentance, to be ſure he is not weary of waiting to be <hi>Gracious</hi> now to his poor People; Eſpecially if they are <hi>Poor in Spirit, and hungring and thirſting after Righteouſneſs</hi>; and are not <hi>fill'd,</hi> overlaid, and <hi>choak'd</hi> with the Cares and Incumbrances of this World. No, <hi>He was ever Good unto Iſrael, yea, unto
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106222:3"/>
all that are of an upright and clean Heart:</hi> Wherefore, Brethren, let your Eye be to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>wait</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon him; Walk with him, and Dwell with him, and he will Walk and Dwell with you: And then no <hi>Weapon form'd againſt you,</hi> be it in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or in General, <hi>ſhall proſper</hi>; that is, not finally. It may perhaps <hi>Try</hi> you, and <hi>bruiſe your Heel,</hi> as it did your Lord and Maſter's, but it ſhall never fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>Prevail</hi> againſt you, if you keep the Eye of your Minds to him, and have faith in him, who ſaved <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den, and <hi>Shadrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> in the fiery Furnace, and has upheld us to this Day under various Afflictions. And tho' <hi>Balaams</hi> there are, that may be hired by the <hi>Balaks</hi> of our Age, to Curſe our Iſrael-Family of God, of which ſome of us have been very ſenſible; Yet this we know, <hi>The Son of God is among us,</hi> who commands the <hi>Fire,</hi> and the <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>Winds,</hi> as well now as then: And there is no <hi>Inchantment</hi> againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> or <hi>Divination</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that can proſper. And who knows but even ſome of theſe preſent <hi>Balaams</hi> may yet live to ſay, before they dye, as others of them have done ſince we were a People, <hi>How goodly are thy Tents,</hi> O Jacob! <hi>How plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant is thy dwelling place,</hi> O Iſrael! But then, Friends, we muſt keep our <hi>Tents,</hi> we muſt be a <hi>Retired</hi> and a <hi>Peculiar</hi> People, and dwell alone. We muſt keep <hi>above</hi> the World, and <hi>clear</hi> of the Spirit of it, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106222:3"/>
thoſe many <hi>Trifles, Cares</hi> and <hi>Troubles</hi> that abound in it, with which but too many have viſibly wounded and pierced their own Souls.</p>
            <p>Beware of this in the Name of the Lord, and do not <hi>Tempt God</hi>; it is in Chriſt ye have Peace, in the World is the Trouble: Keep therefore in him who has called himſelf (and we have found him ſo) the <hi>Way, Truth</hi> and <hi>Life</hi>; and you ſhall live becauſe he lives: He the <hi>Root,</hi> you the <hi>Branches,</hi> by whom you will be kept Green and Fruitful, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Fruits and Graces of the Holy Spirit, in all your Converſe, and Commerce, that it may be ſeen and ſaid, God is with you, and amongſt you. O let <hi>Humility, Charity, Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Self-denyal</hi> ſhine amongſt you; ſo will you come to ſit, as did the Primitive Chriſtians, in <hi>Heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and be preſerved through the <hi>Noiſe, Snares</hi> and <hi>Hurry</hi> of this preſent Evil World.</p>
            <p>Much I could ſay, for my Heart is open, and full too of Divine Love and Matter to you; but time fails me; therefore feel me, my Dear Friends, in that Love of God which is over Sea and Land; where Diſtance cannot Separate, or Time Decay, nor many Waters quench. In which Love I <hi>Embrace</hi> and <hi>Salute</hi> you all, with the Kiſs of our heavenly Fellowſhip, which the Lord hath given us in the Bleſſed Truth. And my ſtrong Deſires are to him, that we may maintain our bleſſed Relation by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106222:4"/>
ſame means, by which we came at firſt into it, <hi>viz.</hi> the true <hi>Fear and Love of God</hi>; which did not only make us careful, not to offend him, but alſo to be willing to <hi>forſake all things</hi> that came in Competition with him, or our Duty to him,</p>
            <p>Oh let this <hi>Chaſte Fear and firſt Love</hi> abound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, my Beloved, in Chriſt, our Bleſſed Light and Life; or you will <hi>Decay, Wither,</hi> and <hi>Dye</hi> to God, and your Good Beginnings; which God Almighty forbid.</p>
            <p>I know there is a <hi>Serious</hi> and <hi>Diligent</hi> People amongſt you, who do not only know when <hi>Good comes</hi> from the hand of the Lord, but <hi>wait</hi> upon him for it, and that dayly: That their Souls may be ſtrengthened in the way and work of the Lord: And theſe can no more live without his Preſence, <hi>his myſtical and hidden Manna,</hi> in their Spiritual Journey, to the <hi>Eternal Canaan</hi> of God, than out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Iſrael was able to live without <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wilderneſs in their Journey to their <hi>temporal Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> And I Beſeech my God and my Father, and your God and your Father, my Dear Brethren, to attend all theſe holy Waiters upon him with the <hi>good things of his Houſe,</hi> and Dayly make them <hi>Glad</hi> in his Holy Houſe of <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Condition of ſome, who pretend to follow Chriſt, yet are afar off, affects my Spirit; for they know little of theſe Enjoyments, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106222:4"/>
Eat ſo much as the <hi>Crumbs</hi> that fall from Chriſt's Table, and ſeem to ſatisfie themſelves with a <hi>meer Convincement</hi> of the Truth, or at beſt with a <hi>bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> to it. Who taking up with a formal Going to Meetings, and Hearing what others have to ſay of the Work and Goodneſs of God in and to them, <hi>they ſhun the Dayly Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> Whereby they ſhould <hi>dye dayly</hi> to their earthly Wills and vain Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and <hi>Overcome</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> Oh! theſe are ſtill their own, and not the Lord's; and gird themſelves, and go <hi>Whither, and do What they liſt</hi>! For which cauſe they are <hi>Lean, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruitful</hi> to God and to their own Souls; and Worſhip him in the <hi>Form</hi> only, and not in the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi>; ſuch muſt needs be <hi>weak</hi> in Faith, <hi>ready to ſlip and ſtart aſide</hi> at every windy Doctrine, or ſenſual Temptation.</p>
            <p>Oh! My Dear Friends, let me prevail with you in this my <hi>Farewell</hi> to you, to turn your Minds <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and wait to feel your Redeemer, and meet him in the way of his Righteous Judgments; for there is no Redemption but <hi>through Judgment,</hi> nor Converſion, but <hi>through Righteouſneſs. Come and be baptized by Chriſt</hi>; He will Baptize you with his <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He will Scowr and Rinſe you; for, believe me, his <hi>Fan is</hi> ſtill <hi>in his Hand,</hi> and <hi>he will,</hi> if you will let him, <hi>throughly purge his Floor,</hi> viz. <hi>your Hearts,</hi> and make all things <hi>Clean and New there,</hi> by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106222:5"/>
his Spirit and Power. So will you Come to find your Intereſt in Chriſt, as you <hi>feel his Workmanſhip and Intereſt in and over you.</hi> And as you thus come to be related to Chriſt, the <hi>Heavenly Head</hi> (by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be <hi>Head in you</hi>) ſo will you come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to his Body, the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſee your <hi>Proper Memberſhip,</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> therein; which I pray God effect, to his Glory and your Comfort.</p>
            <p>And now to the whole Family and Flock God in this <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> part of the World, of the ſame Communion according to the Diſpenſation of God, be they <hi>High</hi> or <hi>Low, Young</hi> or <hi>Old, Rich</hi> or <hi>Poor, Wiſe</hi> or <hi>Simple, Strong</hi> or <hi>Weak, Male</hi> or <hi>Female, Bond</hi> or <hi>Free,</hi> I ſend this parting Salutation, of my moſt Dear Love in the Truth; beſeeching you all to have <hi>Me</hi> and <hi>Mine</hi> in your <hi>Remembrance,</hi> not only when upon the <hi>mighty Waters,</hi> but when in the <hi>Solitary Deſarts of</hi> America, if it pleaſe the Lord to bring us ſafe thither: For I am not above the Love and Prayers of my Dear Brethren, knowing I need them, and have often found, by Good Experience, <hi>that they avail much with the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt leave you, but I can never forget you; for my Love to you has been, even as <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>'s, above the Love of Women: And ſuffer me to ſay, That, to my Power, I have from the firſt endeavoured to ſerve you (and my poor Country too) and that at my own Charges, with an upright Mind, however miſ-underſtood and treated by ſome, whom I heartily forgive. Accept you my Services, and ever Love and Remember, My Dear Friends and Brethren, your Old, True and Affectionate Friend, Brother and Servant, in Chriſt Jeſus,</p>
