            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>At <hi>Ham,</hi> a ſmall Villiage about 4 miles from <hi>London,</hi> but ſcituated in the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> there dwelt one <hi>Alſop,</hi> by Trade a <hi>Felmonger,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>James Alſop</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſince married with a Widow of good credit and competent Eſtate, vvith 3 Children, one was a Girl, now about nine or ten years of Age: they lived together vvith their father and mother for ſome time ſeemingly very

            <p>Nor can we exactly ſet forth the particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that moved their ſpleen againſt this Innocent wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Life, any further than from, common fame ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on circumſtances afterwards diſcoverd, which ſpeaks it thus, that the father being a Clipper of money, could neither carry the buſineſs ſo privately and cleverly, but the young woman had ſome Notice of it, nor induce her to joyn Cordially therein, but that ſhe would be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually repreſenting to the grand hazard and danger of ſuch treaſonable practiſes, and would be often (eſpecially upon any pet taken or ſmall falling out) upbraiding the fame: hereupon 'tis believed the plot vvas firſt laid to give her a remove out of the World, Remembring that curſed Maxim in the School of Villany.</p>

            <p>Satan, no doubt was ready to inſpire the Old man with ſuch ſuggeſtions as theſe; <hi>Will you ſuffer your life to lye at the pleaſure of another? muſt you not be be always a ſlave to her? or elſe ſhe can ſacrifice you when ſhe lifts, and that legally, to her Revenge; is it not a most wretched life that is held by no other tenure, but the Courteſie, and depends upon no better ſecurity than a Womans ſilence, whoſe natural vanity is ſuch, that if malice ſhould not diſcover it, yet the humour of tatling and Goſſiping,

            </p>
            <p>The poor graceleſs man inclining too much to theſe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſuggeſtions, without fear of God or regard to his own ſoul, reſolves at laſt upon the bloody buſineſs, but ſtill was Irreſolute in what manner to accompliſh it.</p>
            <p>Some ſmall time afore her murther was really acted, her husband would have her ride abroad with him, which ſhe condeſcended to, but as they were coming home in the evening, a Gentleman meeting them, drew his ſword, but paſsing the husband turned back, and run at the woman, when as providence ordered it, paſſengers were heard comming on at a ſmall diſtance at the ſame Inſtant; which obliged this unknown Aſſaſinate to ride away with what ſpeed he could, having done the woman no dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hurts, beſides frighting her, and two ſmall pricks with the point of his Rapier, the one on her arm, and the other on her Breaſt.</p>
            <p>A day or two after his Father had her abroad, and when they came home at Night, he ſent for ſome ſtrong drink, but the Woman was afraid to drink, alledging for an excuſe that her Head aked exceedingly, and that Night told her Daughter, who lay with her, that ſhe was afraid her Father-in-Law would poiſon her.</p>
            <p>Hitherto providence had over-ruled the black de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, but now 'tis reſolved to accompliſh the helliſh mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In order whereunto 'tis very induſtriouſly reported up
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93779:3"/>
and down amongſt the Neighbours, that the Woman was to go the next morning into <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> to viſit ſome friends, and that ſhe would continue there a quarter of a Year, this was raiſed to prevent Peoples enquiry what was become of her when ſhe ſhould be found miſſing, having concluded that very Night to Ship her for Eternity, although 'tvvas knovvn ſhe vvas vvith Child.</p>
            <p>Accordingly her Husband being gone a Journey not to return that Night, and ſhe innocently ſleeping in her Bed with her fore-mentioned Daughter: Behold! a litle after Midnight comes in a perſon with a black Gown on, and a Vizard on his Face, with a Candle in one hand, and a naked Knife in the other. The Girl happened to be awake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly frighted, crept over Head and ears in the Bed: but the bloody murtherer runs up to the Bedſide, and ſeting down his Candle, takes the Woman as ſhe lay harmleſsly ſleeping, and moſt barbarouſly and violently cut her Throat from the one Ear to the other, which ſo ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch't her that ſhe never ſpoke one word, but after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtrugling expired. Having thus acted the bloody Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, their next buſineſs is to conceal it.</p>
            <p>For though in readineſs a Grave had been dug in the Orchard to put her in, thinking that by giving out thar ſhe went away on her Journey very early, all might be huſht up without notice or ſuſpition, yet now a new difficulty ariſes, for he knew not how to get her out of the Bed, but the Girl will diſcover it. And here we may admite and bleſs over-ruling providence that preſerved ſuch Inhumane hands from murthering her too, but the Lord would not ſuffer them to proceed in their villany.</p>
            <p>But he reſolves upon another trick, and takes down a whole panel of glaſs out of a window neer where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93779:4"/>
lay (being a low Room) to make it ſeem as if they had been robbed, and that the Murther had been done by Thieves; Their men lay up in another part of the houſe that uſed to be boulted in, and old <hi>Alſop</hi> having ſo taken down the Glaſs, begins to ſet up a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Exclamation of Thieves, Thieves, and with much ſeeming haſt and earneſtneſs calls upon his men to riſe, who anſwered that they could not get out, whereupon he unboulted the door, and ſaid they were rob'd, and ſome of them going into the Womans Room, found her all bloody. At which he ſeemed to be mightily ſorry and amazed, and would needs run for a Surgeon, whom he told that he was rob'd, and that he had loſt twenty Guinneys, and that he feared his Daughter in Law was murthered by the thieves.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Neighbours are Alarm'd, and the poor Girl comes running into the ſtreet all bloody with her Mothers blood, but knew not that ſhe was kill'd, for though ſhe found her ſelf wet in the Bed, yet by reaſon of her fright ſhe knew not that it was with blood, nor durſt look up till people came about her.</p>
            <p>She told the people that ſhe ſaw a man come in at the door in a black Indian Gown, and a Vizard on his face, much about the tallneſs of her Grand-father, whereupon, and upon ſome other words that the Woman had ſaid a day or two before to ſome Neighbours, it was thought fit to take him into Cuſtody.</p>
            <p>The rather, for that Providence willing ſo bloody a Deed ſhould not go undiſcovered, had ordered the matter ſo, as to blaſt his politick Lye of Thieves coming in at the VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, for looking up to it, they ſaw that it was taken down indeed on the outſide, but within all before the place, was a large ſheet of Cobweb, vvhole, and not broken in the leaſt, vvhence it appeared evidently no creature could have come in there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93779:4"/>Beſides, he offered the Conſtable Ten Pounds to ſuffer him to eſcape, but he honeſtly replyed, he would not be Bribed in ſuch a caſe for a World. His houſe being ſearched, they found in a Trunck a Vizard-mask, as the Girl had deſcribed, with the mark of a Bloody Thumb upon it, which he had made when he took it off his face, after he had commited this Execrable Murther: They alſo found ſeveral pair of Shears, wherewith to Clip Money: and Clipings of Money in ſeveral places. Nor was that (as is ſuppoſed) all his Trade. For ſearching the Houſe, they found in a great heap of Wool, a very rich Suit of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: Which being asked where he had it, he ſaid he Bought it in <hi>Long-Lane</hi>: But 'tis preſumed uſed the High-Pad, or Robing on the Road, as well as Cliping.</p>
            <p>The Officers demanding of the Old Woman, where the Young VVomans cloaths were, ſhe ſaid ſhe had ſent them before into <hi>Yorkſhire</hi>; but they ſearcht her Trunck, and found all her cloaths there.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Old Man and VVoman were commited, and the Son, her Husband, being then, (as was ſince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> ſoon after returning, was bound over, upon Suſpition, to the Aſsizes. During the time the Old man lay thus in Priſon, a Notable Stratagem is ſet on foot (as 'tis ſuppoſed) to clear him of the Fact: for a report was raiſed that ſome High-way-men had confeſſed they robed the houſe, and killed the VVoman, and after much ſtir, a Portmantle and Letter upon ſearch of a Houſe was found in <hi>London</hi>: The Letter ſpake much to that purpoſe, and that the Perſon was haſtening away for <hi>Holland.</hi> In the Portmantle vvas a bloody ſhirt, a ſtrange (not Vizard-Mask) but) great frightful Vizard: ſeveral Clipings and Fileings of Silver, &amp;c. The Perſon that ovvns this Portmantle vvas aot to be found: but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Toppham,</hi> being very much concerned in the buſineſs, and ſolicitous, he began to be ſuſpected to be ſome way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Guilt, and thereupon being Apprehended, after ſome time he was diſcovered to be Old <hi>Alſop</hi>'s own Son, and thereupon was likewiſe Comited.</p>
            <p>At the Aſsizes holden for the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> at the Town of <hi>Chelmsford, March</hi> 23. 1673/4. <hi>Alſop</hi> the Father being Indicted both for Cliping of Money, and Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Daughter in Law, was brought in Guilty by the Jury; his VVife and his Son <hi>James,</hi> upon a long debate of the matter, were acquited, but his Son <hi>VVilliam Alſop,</hi> alias <hi>Toppham,</hi> being Indicted in the ſame manner as his Father was, of his own accord pleaded guilty to both Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and afterwards beg'd for Tranſportation; which being denyed, he there alledged that he Pleaded guilty, only to take off the Crime from his Father, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it was then too late, whereupon both his Father and he Received Sentence of Death</hi>:</p>
