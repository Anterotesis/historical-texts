            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADMONITION TO MY LORD PROTECTOR, <hi>and his Council, of their preſent danger,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O begin ſuch a buſineſſe as this methodically, we are firſt to ſhew the juſt Exceptions the people and Souldiery have to this plauſible elective form of Government, ſo well intended by your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Councill; next thoſe to your perſons, with the dangers enſuing thereupon to your ſelves and the Nation: And laſtly, the onely means of a totall and laſting prevention.</p>
            <p>And I muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe, that there is ſo much ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſon to preferre the continuall Election of wiſe and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant men, before the Succeſſion of Kings or Protectors, who may poſſibly prove Children, or Fools, or Tyrants or Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, that it may ſeem a wonder that the experience of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath not driven them to the ſpecious forme of Elective Monarchies.</p>
            <p>But the tryals they have had, have beaten them to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for though the renown of your Highneſs's many victories and great abilities, with your long and proſperous prepoſſeſſion of the Generalſhip, did ſilence the ambitious pretences of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitours in your Election, yet we muſt no more look for a man that hath no Equals after your Highneſſe; for the moſt eminent ſort of men, are as near of a ſize in wit and courage, as they are in ſtature; and as they are equals in virtue, ſo will they be in intereſt, at leaſt their factions will be ſo near an equality, that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in an Army may by his cunning and induſtry draw in other factions from amongſt the people to increaſe his numbers upon the common ſpecious pretences of a Reformation in Religion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118658:4"/>
and Government agreeable to thoſe peoples humours whom he courts, and ſo prepare himſelf to decide his pretentions by a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War, which I may juſtly call the great Sea of calamities that ſwallows up all the ſtreams of other petty tyrannies, as not worth a name, in reſpect of the ruinous inundations of that many headed Monſter, which commonly uſhers in a Forraigner with it to make our miſeries almoſt immortall.</p>
            <p>And that this is like to be our ſad fate upon the <hi>Election</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Protector,</hi> is as certain, as that all men (whether honeſt, or diſhoneſt) have naturally an ambition to get as much power as they can to oblige or diſoblige; and conſidering how naturall men overvalue themſelves, I think the deſigns of ambitious men to be commonly juſt in their own thoughts, out of the Confidence they have of themſelvs, of excelling others in good <hi>Government.</hi> But that thoſe gallant men who run ſo many <hi>hazards</hi> to build up your <hi>Highneſſe greatneſſe,</hi> ſhould not adventure as far for <hi>themſelves</hi> apart, after your <hi>Highneſſe death,</hi> were the greateſt <hi>miracle</hi> that I have known.</p>
            <p>And to confirm this by an <hi>ancient example</hi> or two, of the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and moſt <hi>civillized people</hi> then in reputation in the world; we will begin with the great <hi>Alexander,</hi> who at his <hi>death</hi> (it ſeems intending an <hi>Election</hi> amongſt <hi>themſelves</hi>) told his great <hi>Officers,</hi> that he would leave his <hi>Empire</hi> to the <hi>worthieſt;</hi> but they could ſo ill agree who that was, that they divided that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Army,</hi> and each ſeizing upon what he could, fought it out, till they were all deſtroyed but <hi>Seleucu:</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> And ſo after the death of <hi>Julus Caeſar,</hi> was the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> rent by the diſſentions of <hi>Auguſtus, Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> till the fortune of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> prevailed. And in the declining of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> there were ſeverall times as many <hi>Emperours</hi> as the <hi>Legions</hi> in ſeverall <hi>Provinces</hi> were pleaſed to ſet up, which were ſometimes three or four together for want of a due ſucceſſion. And to come home to the preſent <hi>German Empire,</hi> though it be in effect <hi>Hereditary</hi> to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> yet the very <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> to a <hi>free election</hi> was the principall Cauſe of calling in the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and reducing that ſtrong and flouriſhing <hi>Empire</hi> to ſuch a <hi>wilderneſſe</hi> as now it is. And doubtleſſe, all <hi>Governments</hi> were to be rejected as pernitious <hi>tyrannies,</hi> were it not for avoiding the tyrannie of Confuſion, which ſubjects the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> of every <hi>particular man</hi> to any ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Rogues</hi> that ſhall aſſemble at ſuch a time of Liberty. If then the <hi>publick peace</hi> be the chief end of all <hi>Governments,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118658:4"/>
thoſe <hi>Forms</hi> muſt needs be the worſt which are moſt ſubject to decline to <hi>Factions,</hi> though they do not immediately do ſo; and of <hi>Monarchies</hi> no doubt but the <hi>elective</hi> is moſt liable to this Confuſion.</p>
            <p>And though it may be objected, that the follies of a weak he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary King may introduce the ſame inconvenience, I ſhall firſt anſwer that there is ſeldome ſuch a King; for their extraordinary educations make them knowing men, if it findes them not ſuch. But if he be a fool, or coward, he hath ſubjects under him fit to command Armies, and no doubt a wiſe Council of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, who knows how to Humor and govern him as well as any of his fellow fools; And if he be a child, his minority moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly proves peaceable, if his Title be unqueſtionable. But it may be ſaid he may prove a Tyrant, and that I muſt confeſs, but ſo may an Elective Monarch, though he ſeem a lamb at his firſt entry, I am ſure he hath more reaſon to be ſo, becauſe he hath more of his equals or ſuperiors in birth to fear. And if we look upon other differences of theſe two kinds of Kings, we ſhall finde the Elective King more neceſſitated to exhauſt the people, both in reſpect of the charge of gaining and ſecuring his preſent power, and leaving his poſterity like the children of a Monarch, and ſo the Treaſury ſhall be alwaies emptied into private purſes, and the people a new exhauſted by the next hungry Prince with his neceſſitous kindred and dependents. So that I muſt conclude that every Election doth certainly threaten the worſt of evils, and that the inconveniences of a ſucceſſion are farre leſſe, and do very ſeldome happen by the concurrents of many ill accidents together. And I think this may ſerve for demonſtration of the peoples exceptions, who judge by the preſſures they feel. And now let us examine the diſtaſts of the ſouldiery and people together to your Highneſſe perſon, and I doubt we ſhall finde that the greater their love and admiration once was, the more is now their hatred and your Highneſſe danger; for they both looked upon you as a zealous reformer not only of Tyranny, but of the very cauſes of it; and (though you acted beyond their reaſons) they thought it was becauſe you had more reaſon then they, and ſo with an implicite faith they expected from your Highneſſe ſuch a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſhould recompence their great expence of blood and treaſure. But after the ſpirir had moved you to break your Oathes of allegiance and ſupremacy (which you took with all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at your firſt entrance into Parliament) and after that your truſt from the two houſes upon the ſcore of the Covenant, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118658:5"/>
ſince again to deſtroy the King, weed the Parliament, and at laſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear it up by the roots, and they in the end ſee no other fruits of bloud and perjury, but the giving laws like a Conqueror, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that kind of Government upon the ſouldiery which they have fought againſt, and indeed a worſe: what can be feared from ſuch a deluded Army and people, but that they ſhould as boldly draw their ſwords together againſt a Protector, as the Presbyterians and all ſorts of Independents did formerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King notwithſtanding their own differences in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Certainly they will be as little ſcrupulous of murthering Monarch by his own law, as one by all the Laws of the Land eſtabliſhed, and will think your <hi>Highneſs</hi> as guilty of the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of the <hi>Nation,</hi> as they once thought the <hi>King,</hi> and there is no queſtion but the people who finde their <hi>Taxes</hi> and <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> perpetuated (which were inconſiderable when they firſt quarrelled with them) will be as forward to aſſiſt the ſouldiery, as they can wiſh them. And I think this general diſaffection of the people was ſo evident to your <hi>Highneſſe,</hi> before they were exaſperated by the death of the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> that you need not doubt their unanimous inſurrection, if they ſhall be prepared and countenanced in it, when the people of <hi>ſingle Counties</hi> ventured their <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>fortunes</hi> ſo freely as they did before the <hi>Kings death;</hi> where it is remarkable, that a remnant of the broken and diſcouraged people of <hi>Kent,</hi> with ſome ſmall additions in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> were able to divert my Lord <hi>Fairfax's</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at <hi>Colcheſter</hi> three moneths together; if the Nation had been then prepared for a generall inſurrection in a day, it is probable your <hi>Highneſſe glories</hi> had been nipped in the bud, notwithſtanding your renowned <hi>victories</hi> againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> at that time. But it may be asked, why the <hi>people</hi> did not ſhew this readineſſe when the <hi>Scots</hi> with their <hi>King</hi> came to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and the Anſwer is, that their comming was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, and in ſuch haſte, as ſhewed they rather came to ſeek then give protection, and the for-laid deſignes, if there were any, were (as was then pretended) diſcovered: But howſoever, there was little more then was requiſite for diſperſing of <hi>Orders</hi> between the day of their arrivall at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and that of their defeat.</p>
            <p>But the grand <hi>Objection</hi> is, that the fear of the <hi>Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> (the <hi>King</hi>) will alwayes keep the <hi>Souldiery</hi> at unity in their <hi>Obedience</hi> under your <hi>Highneſs;</hi> but I anſwer, that if a few of them ſhould but reſolve to murther your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118658:5"/>
one or two more of your principall <hi>Officers,</hi> which no doubt they may eaſily and ſecurely do, they would find time enough to ſettle any form of Government they pleaſed, before the <hi>Common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy</hi> (who hath neither <hi>Money, Shipping, Arms,</hi> nor <hi>Friends</hi> abroad, nor any footing in this Nation) could give them any diſturbance. And how far <hi>zeal</hi> may prompt thoſe who are <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> and the ambition of ſharing the Government thoſe of no <hi>Religion,</hi> a wiſe man ought to fear; but admit the <hi>King</hi> were landed, and conſiderable, the <hi>Souldiery</hi> very well known by experience, how welcome even particular men are that revolt to an enemy in a doubtful condition; much more great bodies, which may not onely make what advantagious conditions they pleaſe for themſelves, But may impoſe upon him ſtricter limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his power, than your <hi>Highneſs</hi> is now tied to by your <hi>Protectorſhip,</hi> and no doubt may retain any places of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or ſtrength they ſhall then be poſſeſſed of, for ſecurity of performance of conditions. But if the worſt ſhould happen, that he ſhould come in a Conquerer without their help, they know that a few of the great Ones will onely be puniſhed; for reaſon will lead any conquering Tyrant (for his own ſecurity) to ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the multitude with a general pardon and Act of Oblivion; and for any <hi>ſcruples</hi> they may have of betraying your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Truſt,</hi> I doubt they will be wiped away by their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of your firſt breaking yours with <hi>King, Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> and ſo they may probably render you a <hi>bloody re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall</hi> for the deſtruction of their <hi>Fellow ſouldiers,</hi> whom you call <hi>Levellers.</hi> Laſtly, Conſider the <hi>fondneſſe</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> to their <hi>Old Forms of Religion,</hi> as well as <hi>Government,</hi> which you have aboliſhed without giving the <hi>liberty</hi> to <hi>tender conſciences</hi> they expected, and your <hi>Highneſs</hi> will conclude with me, that the world affords you few others than <hi>Enemies</hi> at home, and <hi>Emulators</hi> abroad: And if I have told you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>truth.</hi> I doubt not but your generoſity will think me more worthy of <hi>thanks</hi> then any of your <hi>Flatterers,</hi> eſpecially if I propoſe a juſt, ſafe, and honourable remedy for the <hi>miſchiefs</hi> that threaten your <hi>Highneſs</hi> and the <hi>Nation.</hi> And now having ſufficiently opened the wounds, I ſhall apply the promiſed Cure. And it is not the leſſening of your <hi>Highneſſe</hi> in any thing, for I am one of thoſe that believe <hi>Monarchy</hi> to be the beſt form of <hi>Government,</hi> ſo as it be hereditary: for admit a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> be a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> his <hi>Tyranny</hi> is mortal, and his care will be greater not to offend, than of a multitude of <hi>Governors,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118658:6"/>
who may lay <hi>faults</hi> upon one another, and are as ſubject to <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi> and <hi>avarice</hi> as the <hi>ſingle perſon,</hi> ſo that it is better to be preyed upon by one <hi>Family</hi> with its <hi>dependents,</hi> than by three or four hundred with theirs, and we may eaſier pleaſe the one, and have <hi>justice</hi> of him, than of the <hi>ſlow</hi> and <hi>factious great Body,</hi> who muſt moſt of them joyn to oblige, and yet any one can by his <hi>miſ-information</hi> diſobliege, becauſe the accuſed ſhall be branded with the Title of a <hi>Malignant,</hi> when they have not ſo much as leiſure to hear him. And ſince an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power will be in all <hi>Governments</hi> in thoſe that have the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Militia,</hi> it is better both for <hi>defence</hi> and <hi>offence,</hi> that the General and civil <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould be all one, than that a gallant <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> ſhould be ruined, as <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> and his <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were by the delatory and malicious practiſes of <hi>Hanno,</hi> a Senator with his faction.</p>
            <p>But to return to our purpoſe for the ſatisfaction of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and firſt for the ſouldiery, becauſe they have fought hard for it, I ſhould propoſe to your Highneſſe to have all officers of the Army above the degree of Captaines to have votes in your Highneſſe Councill of State at thoſe times that they are free from their more urgent imployments in the field. So will each ſouldier of the Army be ſure to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by his extraordinary deſerts to riſe by degrees to the State preferment he ſees his officers ſo juſtly rewarded with.</p>
            <p>Then for this next Parliament (though they ſhould not have power to alter the Government) I could wiſh your Highneſſe and Councill would conſult with them about your late eſtabliſhment, and hear what objections they have againſt it. And if the Parliament and Army ſhould joyn in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to this purpoſe, I preſume you would not deny it. And it were better to offer at acts of Grace before they were asked.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if my reaſons for an hereditary Monarchy be ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, I moſt humbly beſeech your Highneſſe and Council to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether the eſtabliſhment of the ſucceſſion after your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in an uſurping line, will not expoſe the Nation to all the miſeries I have mentioned in an elective government, and if this be doubted, be pleaſed to look over our own Chronicles, and you ſhall find variety of examples, without going further then the time of the conqueſt. For firſt, <hi>Harrold</hi> by his uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion encouraged and occaſioned the Conqueſt of England; then was there another deluge of blood occaſioned by the uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118658:6"/>
of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt; and again what ſlaughters and rapines did this miſerable Nation endure by the unjuſt ambition of King <hi>Stephen</hi> in detaining the Crown from <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſſe, which fire could not be quenched but by the ſucceſſion of her ſon the right heir, which was at laſt agreed to by King <hi>Stephen.</hi> But to come nearer home, you ſhall find that <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth ſaw his country bleed in his life-time for his uſurpation, though he came in with the generall good liking of the people, and thought he ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſecured himſelf by the Kings murther. But though his induſtry ſecured the Crown to his ſon, yet was his ſons death conſpired by his principall friends juſt as he was ſetting out for the invaſion of <hi>France;</hi> but that conſpiracy being detected, he by his unparallelled vertues and ſucceſſes and the weakneſſe of the true heir, avoided during his ſhort life any ſtorms at home. But they fell moſt heavily upon our flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Countrey in his Succeſſor <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixths time who could never have loſt the Crown by his weakneſſe if his title had been good; as appeareth by the notable contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, but between them were many thouſands of Orphans and widows left weeping over their own and their Countreys deſolate and bloudy ruines; and at laſt the ambition of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the ruine of his Grandchild, and a hatefull memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his unjuſt Ambition and the ſad conſequences of it. But if theſe examples do not ſufficiently convince, the reaſon of the thing doth, for there will alwayes be a conſcientious and a neceſſitous party for the true heir in any Nation againſt an Uſurper; beſides malecontents which are ſtill the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber becauſe many muſt neceſſarily be injured, and more unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded that think they deſerve it, and even all men that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned will be for the true Heir, and be pretended lovers of Juſtice, and with much reaſon muſt hate preſidents of wrong, leaſt they ſhould time other time ſuffer it. And ſo I may conclude we are as certain of a civill warre from an unjuſt ſucceſſion as from an Elective Government. And the incomparable miſeries and ill conſequences of that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared, though our own experience might partly have ſaved me the labour. But your Highneſſe may think an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Fleet a ſufficient ſecurity for an Iſland againſt a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nation that may interpoſe at ſuch a time of our deſtructions. But I anſwer, that if none of your ſhipping ſhould revolt, yet might our next neighbours the French (if
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118658:7"/>
they ſhould then make peace with their other enemies) take the opportunity of the ſame ſtorm that ſhall force your Fleet in the Winter into Harbors to blow them over the ſhort paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into <hi>England,</hi> if they have any party to ſecure their Landing here.</p>
            <p>But if this be thought frivolous, I ſuppoſe I have ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough beſides to make it appear that the true intereſt of your Highneſſe and your poſterity with that of this Kingdome to think of a treaty with <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> if he will accept of the Crown after your deceaſe upon the ſame terms you now hold it, I mean the ſame Councill and limitation of power, with a competent maintenance for him in the mean time, in ſome ſuch remote place as you ſhall need leſſe to fear him then you do now, if he ſhould incline to the breach of ſuch an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as may be ſecured by Oaths, Hoſtages, and by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of ſuch States whoſe intereſt it is (in reſpect of their greater neighbours) to be alwayes friends to the peace of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and by ſtricter ties then are here neceſſary to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; beſides the honeſty, diſcretion and temper of the young man, who (notwithſtanding his great courage) ſhews he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herits the mildneſſe of his Father and Grandfather on the one ſide, and of his Mother and Grandfather on the other ſide, which great King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> after he had victoriouſly broken the heart of that great Rebellion called the <hi>Catholique League,</hi> notwithſtanding received the only head of it then living the Duke of <hi>Main,</hi> into his protection and favour, and never took the leaſt revenge of him or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Rebellious crew in all the time of his reign. But above all things the Kings own intereſt and the good of his Countrey will oblige him to bury his reſentments, and both to accept and keep ſuch conditions as redeem him and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from miſery at the preſent, and ſecure him and his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the end to the re-enjoyments of all their rights, without the ſlaughter or deſtruction of any part of his Kingdomes, which he is moſt tenderly ſenſible of; and what doubt can there be but that he will rather expect quietly the deceaſe of an old man (as your Highneſſe is) then run an improbable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of all his fortunes for a few years, which he muſt have ſtayed for till his fathers death, if he had not been untimely cut off: and that he was willing to do ſo, your Highneſs knowes, by his pious and earneſt ſollicitation then to you and the reſt of the officers then with you for the ſaving of his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118658:7"/>
life. And let me ad a very late tryal of him, when <hi>Wiſeman</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers propoſed your murther to him, he refuſed to conſent to it, notwithſtanding his intereſt, and the exaſperation of his wants; how then ſhould he be feared when thoſe motives are taken away?</p>
            <p>But admit this were not ſo, you have, ſtill all the power in your own hands, and would have the affections of the people (which he now hath) if he ſhould be perfidious to their diſquiet anew. If then it be clear that you are ſecure on the Kings ſide, where lies the danger of this accommodation? it is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted intereſt of the military men to be alwaies governed by a Monarch, eſpecially if they be well provided of ſubordinate places under him, and the people are ſo paſſionately affected to the old line, as their onley conſtant ſecurity from rapine and bloudſhed, that they will never be at reſt till they have an oportunity to deſtroy the rooter up of that three great fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of their Religion, Laws, and that unqueſtionable ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which would intirely ſecure them from any more diſputes; and even moſt of thoſe who formerly fancyed, better forms of Government, are now for falling into the old channel, out of diſpair of drawing the peoples affections to their fancies, without which they know the peace of the Nation can never be long preſerved; if your Highneſſe ſhould yet prove one of that number, your name would be as good as it is great; for a man may be thought reaſonably to undertake indirect courſes for a great and publick good, ſo as he leave thoſe courſes when he ſees his end is not to be compaſſed: And if your Highneſs do ſo, your curſes will be turned into praiſes, and you may ſleep again without any fear of your own guards, who otherwiſe are not like to ſcruple the murthering of ſo unjuſt a maſter for a greater reward than you can give them, if the preſent ſeizure of your treaſure were not ſufficient for them: For men of no <hi>Religion</hi> will at any tine betray a perſon as wicked as themſelves for their intereſt, and thoſe that are <hi>zealous</hi> will do the ſame upon the ſcore of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and their <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> to other <hi>forms</hi> or <hi>perſons;</hi> ſo that your <hi>Highneſs</hi> can be ſecure of no body, nor any thing, but the rewards of <hi>injuſtice</hi> with infamy, for the preferring your <hi>Sons advancement</hi> before your <hi>Countreys ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> who if he were planted can never be ſecured by any <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> or <hi>Oaths,</hi> ſince both have been ſo commonly broken, and ought to be ſo, if unjuſtly made or taken; and if his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues be never ſo great his meer youth ſhall make him be deſpiſed by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118658:8"/>
thoſe that have had the ſtart of him in <hi>ſucceſſes,</hi> and the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> of the <hi>Army;</hi> and the ſeeming reſpect that is now paid him upon your <hi>Highneſs</hi> ſcore, ſhall vaniſh with your <hi>death,</hi> and all your <hi>Family</hi> be deſtroyed (like that of the great <hi>Alexanders</hi>) by your own friends and followers, if you your ſelf ſhould ſcape ſuch a cup of poyſon as he met with on ſuch a dagger as finiſhed the ambition of <hi>Julius Caeſar:</hi> And now my Lord, for a Concluſion, give me leave to wonder at the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of all ill men, though they belive in no other world, ſince their ambition is to gain eſteem, and how they ſhould be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hated at once for the ſame fact, I know not, without a contradiction. If they did but conſider how even wicked men hate one another for fear of receiving the ſame injuries from their companions which they have inflicted together upon others, they would prefer the love and admiration of Mankind before the being admirably hated, which ſince your Highneſſe may ſo eaſily do, and cannot with juſtice, honour and ſafety do any thing elſe, it ſhall no more be doubted from your generoſity by</p>
