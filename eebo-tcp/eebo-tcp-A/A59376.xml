         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HO Informeth and ſaith, That <hi>William
Bradley</hi> Eſq; one of His Majeſties Juſtices
of the Peace for the County of <hi>Waterford</hi>
in the Year 1677. gave him the ſaid Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
an Oath of Secrecy touching the
Plot intended and deſigned in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by
the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and the reſt of the Confederates againſt
the Kings Majeſty; At which time he imparted to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant,
the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> had received a Commiſſion from
the <hi>French</hi> King to be a Colonel of Horſe in the County of
<hi>Waterford,</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>William Bradley</hi> was to be his
Lieutenant Colonel, and deſired this Informant to provide
himſelf with Horſe and Arms, and to procure as many as
he could of thoſe he dare truſt: and that this Informant
ſhould have a Command of being a Captain under the ſaid
<hi>Earl</hi> and Him.</p>
            <p>Whereupon this Informant did provide himſelf and ſpeak
unto <hi>John Follis, James Finican</hi> and <hi>Dennis Mac-Namarra</hi>
to provide themſelves with ſuch Neceſſaries as were requiſite
for that purpoſe; informing them alſo, That Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi>
did impart ſuch matters unto this Informant, and who knew
that the ſaid <hi>Mac-Namarra</hi> had imparted ſuch matters to the
ſaid <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Dennis,</hi> who afterwards did confeſs the ſame to
his <hi>Grace the Lord Lieutenant</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> and before this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant
had liberty to ſpeak with them, or they with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then kept cloſe Priſoner from any one of the Kings Evidence.</p>
            <p>The precedent Examination this Informant gave, when
on a Petition preferred by the reſt of the Kings Evidences,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47579:4"/>
this Informant was kept from any of the Earls Friends and
from <hi>Quarter-Maſter Ely,</hi> who was always with this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
before and not denied to be with him; But on the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of the aforeſaid Gent. then it was Ordered, That this
Informant ſhould be kept cloſe and not to have any to come to
him: This Informant was then very fearful to diſcover his
Mind, becauſe of the guilt that was upon him, being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
which after a Promiſe of Pardon, if this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
ſpake the Truth, he then reſolved to Diſcover ſo far as
he knew, though againſt himſelf: Upon which he freely
declared his Mind in this following Examination.</p>
            <div type="statement">
               <p>After the aforeſaid <hi>VVilliam Bradley</hi> did impart to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant
the aforeſaid Treaſon, this Informant met with the
<hi>Earl of Tyrone</hi> upon the Land of <hi>Gaveſton</hi> in the County of
<hi>VVaterford</hi> with two of his Men, <hi>viz. Thomas Power</hi> his
Gentleman, and <hi>Garret Mac-Teige</hi> his Follower, and another
whoſe name is <hi>Luke Power,</hi> this Informant having in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with him one <hi>VVilliam Power,</hi> and <hi>Boetius Clauſy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then abroad Hunting with Dogs; The ſaid
<hi>Earl</hi> knowing this Informant at a diſtance, called to him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which this Informant went to him: The ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> taking
this Informant from the Company, asked him, whether Mr.
<hi>Bradley</hi> had imparted to him any Matter of Secrecy; this
Informant replyed, that he had: The ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> then told
this Informant, that he muſt be very private and diſcover it
to none, but thoſe he was very ſure of. After which, the
ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> drew a Liſt out of his Pocket, and ſhewed this
Informant a Liſt of ſeveral Perſons that were to be Superior
Officers, both in the County of <hi>VVaterford,</hi> County of
<hi>Cork,</hi> County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> County of <hi>Limerick</hi> and County
of <hi>Clare,</hi> which this Informant took ſpecial notice of and
knew ſeveral of the Perſons; amongſt the reſt, the <hi>Earl</hi>
entred my Name with my own Pen and Ink in the Liſt;
The ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> telling this Informant, he had his Commiſſion
ſent him from the <hi>French</hi> King, under Hand and Seal to be
a Colonel of a Regiment of Horſe in the County of <hi>VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford,</hi>
and ſaid there was hardly a County in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
Perſons were appointed by the <hi>French</hi> King for that purpoſe:
and named in the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> Colonel <hi>Peirce Lucy</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47579:4"/>
and the Lord <hi>Brittas,</hi> Sir <hi>John Fitz-gerrald, David Fitz-gerrald</hi>
and ſeveral others in the County of <hi>Clare, John Mac-Namarra</hi>
and ſeveral others in the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> Sir <hi>Turlo
Mac-Mahan</hi> and ſeveral others in the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> and
that the ſaid <hi>Earl of Tyrone</hi> was to be Colonel in the County
of <hi>VVaterford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> to be his Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,
<hi>Quarter-Maſter Ely</hi> his Major, Mr. <hi>John Butler</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
his Captain, with the names of ſeveral others of that
Company, which he did not read unto this Informant; The
ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> ſaying they were to raiſe ſeveral hundreds of men
in every County, and that the Superior Officers were to
meet on purpoſe to return an exact Account of their Forces
to the <hi>French</hi> King: On which the ſaid <hi>King</hi> would Land
many thouſands of men in the River <hi>Thanan,</hi> and aſſoon as
they were Landed, the next buſineſs was to go to the City
of <hi>Limerick</hi> with 500 men and divide them into two Parts,
the one Party to enter the City at Candle-light, and that at
ſeveral Gates, and ſuch as beſt knew the City were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſet upon the Guards and put them all to the Sword, and
the reſt to be hard by the City, and to enter in immediately
when the Alarm was given, and the Body of the Army to
draw up as faſt as they could.</p>
               <p>By which, ſaid the <hi>Earl,</hi> we do not queſtion but to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
our ſelves of the City and <hi>Kings Caſtle,</hi> and to baniſh
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> very ſoon; and indeed ſaid the <hi>Earl,</hi> 'tis the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God to bring ſome Downfall on that unjuſt King,
the <hi>Duke of Ormond</hi> and his Children, that wronged me in
ſo high a Nature on the account of <hi>Villiers:</hi> therefore ſaid
the <hi>Earl,</hi> Go home, loſe no time, but make your ſelves
ready, for we know not how ſoon occaſion may require your
Aſſiſtance, and ſpeak to as many Friends as you can, which
accordingly this Informant did and provided Horſe and Arms
for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>After Diſcovery made hereof by <hi>Hubburt Bourke</hi> as you
may read in his Information, who partly knew the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and having Diſcovered the ſame, was bound by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance
to proſecute the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> at the next Aſſize
at <hi>Waterford,</hi> he did for want of this Informants and others
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47579:5"/>
Teſtimonies abſent himſelf from the Aſſizes, unto which he
was bound, and for other Reaſons mentioned in his Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>But in a ſhort time after, the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> hearing that Mr.
<hi>Bourke</hi> was going for <hi>England</hi> to make his application to
the King and Parliament; the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> Commanded this
Informant to write unto the ſaid <hi>Bourke,</hi> which accordingly
he did, and ſignified in his Letter, that this Informant would
very willingly ſpeak with him, but he not anſwering this
Informants expectation, this Informant went himſelf to
him at <hi>Waterford,</hi> and Courted him to go along with this
Informant to his Houſe, which he prevailed with him to do.</p>
               <p>This Informant then haſtened to the ſaid <hi>Earl,</hi> and gave
him an Account of his proceedings, which the <hi>Earl</hi> liked
very well, whereupon he ordered <hi>Major Butler</hi> and <hi>John
Rovan,</hi> and this Informant to confer with the ſaid <hi>Bourke,</hi>
and at the Mill of <hi>Carrygninier</hi> we met, and according to the
ſaid <hi>Earls</hi> order did offer the ſaid <hi>Bourke</hi> a Farm Stock, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a ſum of mony ſo as that he would charge Mr.
<hi>Villiers;</hi> Captain <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradley,</hi> and others with
Suborning or prompting the ſaid <hi>Bourke</hi> to proſecute the ſaid
<hi>Earl,</hi> and that he ſhould acknowledge it, and Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi>
aforeſaid ſhould confeſs the ſame, and that ſo <hi>Bourke</hi> and
<hi>Bradley</hi> ſhould be committed Witneſſes againſt <hi>Villiers</hi> and
<hi>Nicholas,</hi> upon which the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> would bring his Action
of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> againſt <hi>Villiers</hi> and <hi>Nicholas</hi> for
40000 <hi>l.</hi> which was contrived by Mr. <hi>Andrew Lynne</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> the ſaid <hi>Earls</hi> Friends, unto which the ſaid <hi>Bourke</hi>
refuſed to conſent.</p>
               <p>Here it is to be obſerved, That Mr. <hi>Villiers</hi> and Captain
<hi>Nicholas</hi> were at Law with the ſaid <hi>Earl,</hi> and therefore the
ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> did ſuppoſe the World would ſooner believe what
was laid to their Charge, upon the <hi>Earls</hi> account, though
falſly alledged againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bourke</hi> not accepting the aforeſaid Offers, the <hi>Earl</hi> then
Petition'd the Lord Lieutenant and Council, who ſent a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47579:5"/>
Summons for the ſaid <hi>Bourke,</hi> and brought him to <hi>Dublin,</hi>
and being Examined of ſeveral matters, he gave in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
and got alſo Mr. <hi>Sampton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jury</hi> to be
Summoned up, and to be Examined, upon whole Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:
A Summons was iſſued out againſt Quarter-Maſter
<hi>Ely, John Povan,</hi> Major <hi>Butler</hi> aforeſaid, and <hi>Lawrence

Houſe to have Inſtructions touching the Management there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
The <hi>Earl</hi> alſo ſent to his Gentleman Mr. <hi>Power</hi> for
this Informant, he being then in <hi>Waterford,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Power</hi>
came to this Informant and told him, That the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>
and Quarter-Maſter <hi>Ely</hi> ſent for this Informant, to the
intent he might repair to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and having no Horſe with
him at <hi>Waterford,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Power</hi> the <hi>Earls</hi> Gentleman,
provided this Informant with a Horſe, on which he went
with him to <hi>Curronymore</hi> to the <hi>Earls</hi> Houſe, where this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant
met with the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> and Quarter-Maſter <hi>Ely</hi>
together.</p>
               <p>Upon which the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> and Quarter-Maſter <hi>Ely</hi> took
this Informant into the Garden, and there did agree to ſend
to <hi>John Rovan,</hi> who came immediately, at which time the
<hi>Earl</hi> and Quarter-Maſter <hi>Ely</hi> did inſtruct us what we ſhould
ſay, when we came to <hi>Dublin</hi> before the Council; and told
this Informant the great Danger, if we ſhould diſcover any
thing of the Matter: but proferring an Oath unto us, and
finding us unwilling to Swear what they would
have us to Swear, the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> then told us, that we ſhould
be Abſolved by <hi>Dean Powers</hi> his Couſen and the reſt of the
Clergy, and after inſtructing us in the Garden for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time, the <hi>Earl</hi> gave this Informant an Horſe, and
gave <hi>John Rovan, Lawrence Swillivant</hi> and this Informant
Money to bear our Charges to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and when we came
there, we were maintained at the <hi>Earls</hi> Charge; with
promiſe to get Bayl for this Informant, if Impriſoned, and
we were there always accompanied with the <hi>Earls</hi> Friends,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47579:6"/>
who promiſed this Informant great Reward, if he would
conceal what he knew.</p>
               <p>This Informant alſo had Money from Quarter-Maſter
<hi>Ely,</hi> whilſt he was in the Purſivants hand, and ſeveral
Maſſes were ſaid in the County for the <hi>Earl</hi> and this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant,
whilſt this Informant continued from Diſcovering,
but ſince hath Excommunicated him.</p>
               <p>But at length Mr. <hi>Ivy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> Petition'd the Lord
Lieutenant and Council to have this Informant kept cloſe
Priſoner, and to keep the <hi>Earls</hi> Friends and Sollicitors from
this Informant, which accordingly was done.</p>
               <p>Now this Informant being by himſelf, and conſidering the
evil Caſe he was in, God ſo touched this Informants Conſcience,
that he confeſſed the Truth: Several other things there are
relating to the <hi>Powers,</hi> concerning ſtealing of Horſes and
providing of Arms for the ſame purpoſe, which is treated of
in Mr. <hi>Ivy</hi>'s Examinations and in <hi>James Finicans,</hi> which
<hi>Powers</hi> were Examined upon Oath before Sir <hi>Jo. Davis,</hi> and
ſince bailed out of Goal by means of Captain <hi>Morris</hi> the
Proſecutor, who now goes armed moſtly accompanied with
the <hi>Earls</hi> Friends and Kindred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>James Finican</hi> was by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> ſollicited not
to confeſs any thing againſt him, for which the ſaid <hi>Bradley</hi>
promiſed him a good Reward in Money, and was before
the Committee, and did for ſome time endeavour to conceal
the matter; but being kept from the ſaid <hi>Bradley</hi> for a ſeaſon
in the <hi>Marſhals</hi> hand, told the ſaid <hi>Marſhal,</hi> that he would
not be in trouble for concealing others Treaſons, he the ſaid
<hi>Finican</hi> deſired to be carried again before the Committee,
confeſſed the whole Matters, ſaying, that if Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47579:6"/>
were put where he was, he would confeſs the Truth too;
this aſtoniſhed the ſaid <hi>Bradley,</hi> for as much as the ſaid <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans</hi>
promiſe to the ſaid <hi>Bradley</hi> of Concealing, made him
the ſaid <hi>Bradley</hi> to tell the Committee, that he would be
ſaved by the ſaid <hi>Finicans</hi> Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>You may obſerve that while this Informant denied to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
the truth and conceal the Plot, the <hi>Earls</hi> Friends got a
Petition writ againſt Mr. <hi>Ivy,</hi> to be preferred to the Lord
Lieutenant and Council, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid <hi>Ivy</hi> was a man
of ill Fame and a diſhoneſt man, and that he knew nothing
of thoſe Treaſons and <hi>Briggs</hi> before-mentioned, which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
they gave this Informant to ſend unto, or deliver unto
the Lord Lieutenant and Council.</p>
               <p>In the mean time this Informant being kept from them,
his Conſcience forced him to confeſs the Truth. He then
ſhewed the Petition unto the ſaid Mr. <hi>Ivy,</hi> of which they
were much aſhamed and would have denied it, but that this
Informant juſtified it, and told who brought it unto him
(meaning Mr. <hi>Michael Roe)</hi> the hand alſo being known,
which way this Informant always obſerved, they always
made uſe of to endeavour to clear themſelves, by calling in
Queſtion the Reputation of their Accuſors.</p>

made Archbiſhop of <hi>Caſhell, Waterford,</hi> and <hi>Liſmore:</hi> And
that by the Titular Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> the ſaid <hi>Brenan</hi>
producing Bulls from the Pope to the ſaid Primate for that

of Prieſts and Fryers which reſorted to <hi>Knock-houſe,</hi>
a Houſe of Entertainment three Miles Weſtward of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
And that in the ſame year 1676. this Informant took
extraordinary notice of it, being not a thing ſo uſual; But
being in Company with ſeveral of the ſaid Prieſts in the
ſaid Houſe, and that at ſeveral times, and eſpecially with
Dean <hi>Power</hi> aforeſaid, who was next in Power to the ſaid
<hi>Brenan:</hi> This Informant began to enquire the reaſon of
their publick meetings ſo often, it being in time of Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
The ſaid <hi>Power</hi> made anſwer, that he would ſatisfie
him as to that Effect Patron-Day at <hi>Kesk,</hi> which on our Lady
following, being within few days after the ſaid time, which
accordingly he did, as followeth; The Congregation being
gathered together to Confeſs and Receive the Sacrament
after the <hi>Popiſh</hi> way, one <hi>Edmond Power</hi> a Jeſuit preached
a Sermon, which was to let the Congregation underſtand
that they had <hi>Indulgences</hi> from the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> granted
them, and Liberty to eat Fleſh on <hi>Wedneſdays:</hi> But in the

to give in Charge to his Pariſhioners, at the time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and proceeded no farther: On which, the Prieſts
fell to their Offices, which was to Confeſs the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
And this Informant being then one of that Religion,
this Informant Confeſſed to the aforeſaid Dean <hi>Power:</hi> but
in his Confeſſion, the ſaid Dean gave this Informant in

               <p>That he ſhould not divulge to any Perſon whatſoever on
pain of Mortal Sin and Damnation what he would impart
to this Informant; which this Informant promiſed he would
not: with that he proceeded thus; That the Conſideration of
the aforeſaid Indulgence and Liberty was, That whoever was
in a Capacity to help and aſſiſt the holy Cauſe, deſigned &amp; in
hand for a long time, was to have great Preferments, together
with the benefit of the aforeſaid <hi>Indulgences</hi> which was a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

were to have the Benefits and Profits of the Tithes accrueing
out of each Pariſh, with the Gleabes and Monks Lands and

did wrongfully poſſeſs for a long time: And that the <hi>French</hi>
King and the reſt of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Confederates, together with
the aſſiſtance of his Holineſs the Pope, did intend imediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Invade the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and

whom we are ordered to Celebrate ſeveral hundreds

all the Popiſh Prieſts within his Juriſdiction. After which

Celebrated in the Honour of the Earl of <hi>Angleſea</hi> through

OF
James Naſh.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JAmes Naſh</hi> of the County of <hi>Lemerick,</hi> depoſeth, That
about Four Years ago, Captain <hi>John Purden,</hi> after
he had heard Maſs, took this Deponent aſide, and
after ſeveral inconſiderable diſcourſes, queſtioned this
Deponent why he did not go into <hi>France,</hi> being the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place to Improve him, and make him a compleat Man,
for that there were like to be Troubleſome times, and
there would be want of ſuch Improved Men. But being
no further preſſed at that time, this Deponent took lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
notice thereof. Soon after, this Deponent being at
Maſs in the ſaid <hi>Purden</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Burgatt</hi> a Prieſt apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf to this Deponent much after the manner <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
had formerly, and in concluſion, Commanded this
Deponent to go to Captain <hi>Thomas Mac Everie</hi>'s Houſe,
for there he had ſomewhat material to Impart unto
him: And immediately after they had Dined, there the
ſaid <hi>Mac Everie</hi> took this Deponent aſide, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Sworn him to ſecreſie, diſcourſed with him as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>You know, ſaith he, that the King at <hi>Breda</hi> before his
Reſtauration, promiſed the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentry to reſtore them
to their Eſtates and Religion, but ſince this is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
we have deſigned to caſt off the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bondage
and free our ſelves from their Slavery, and to recover
our Eſtates and Religion. When this is done you ſhall
have your Fathers and Uncles Eſtates in lieu of your
Services, for I intend you ſhall be my own Lieutenant,
for I am to have a Regiment, by which means I ſhall
have an opportunity to advance you; for the King of
<hi>France</hi> hath promiſed us aid of Ten thouſand men and
twenty thouſand Arms to carry on the deſign. At this time
the ſaid <hi>Mac Everie</hi> gave this Deponent a Caſe of Piſtols
and about Thirty Shillings in Money, to carry Letters
to Collonel <hi>Oſſulivan</hi> at <hi>Beer-Haven,</hi> and directed him,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47579:10"/>
That if this Deponent ſhould be queſtioned on the way,
to declare he belonged to the Army; accordingly this
Deponent delivered his Letters, and returned with anſwers,
Purſuant whereunto, Captain <hi>Everie</hi> went to Captain
<hi>Purdens</hi> Houſe, where was a great Meeting of the <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Gentry of the Country, who rejoyced much at the anſwer
of the ſaid Letters, but what they were this Deponent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, but that at that time they were ſworn to Secereſie
upon a great Book, which this Deponent thinks was the Life
of the Saints, <hi>viz. John Purden, Thomas Mac Everie, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauce
VVhite, John Hurley, John Bourke,</hi> with many others,
which this Deponent hath forgot at preſent. That there were
ſeveral other Meetings ſometimes at <hi>Mac Everie's,</hi> ſometimes
<hi>Purdens,</hi> where they uſually drank a Health to the Proſperity
and good ſucceſs of the deſign; after which they all kneeled
down and ſaid an <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> with other Prayers.</p>
            <p>That this Deponent going another time to <hi>Beer-Haven</hi>
with Letters, ſaw in the Harbour a French Man of War,
who as this Deponent was informed, came on purpoſe
to ſound the Harbour and to try the peoples minds and
the poſture of their Aſſiſtance, if there were an occaſion.
Upon this Deponents returning to Mr. <hi>Everies</hi> with an
anſwer, there was another great Meeting of the Gentry,
and great Rejoycing at the ſaid <hi>Sullivanes</hi> anſwer. Not
long after this, the Deponent went again to <hi>Sullivane,</hi>
but at his return with Letters their Countenances were
much changed to what they were formerly; for this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
was given to underſtand, that the French King
being Involved in a War with the Emperour and <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
could not poſſibly ſpare thoſe aſſiſtances he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
promiſed, for that he rather wanted men to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his own Army, ſo that for a long time this affair ſlept,
having no encouragement from abroad but of late, by
the Induſtry of the Prieſts and ſome other great Agents,
their deſigns begin to take Life again, having aſſurance
that the French King being at Peace with his Neighbours
will in a ſhort time make good his promiſe as to his
former intended aid.</p>
            <p>That this Deponent reflecting with much Reluctancy
on the ſad Subject he was engaged in to the Ruine of
the Nation, applyed himſelf to Father <hi>Brodeene</hi> the Pariſh
Prieſt, and in Confeſſion deſired to be Abſolved of his
ſo heinous offence in being aſſiſtant to the Diſturbance of
the Kingdom; Upon which the ſaid Prieſt bitterly Curſt
him, commanding him to ſecreſie, and that if he did
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47579:10"/>
deſiſt from carrying on the Deſign, he ſhould be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
Damned. Some little time after, this Deponent
being from home, had his Houſe broken open, Rob'd of
his Money, the aforeſaid Piſtols, and all his Papers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he had kept a Catalogue of all the Names, and the
preciſe times of their ſeveral Meetings, Swearings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
By which this Deponent gueſſes that the Prieſt had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
them with his Confeſſion.</p>
