            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A true Relation of the Tryals, Sufferings and Death of <hi>Francis Howgil,</hi> who dyed a Prisoner for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Jesus, in <hi>Appleby</hi> in the County of <hi>VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland,</hi> the 10th Day of the 11th Moneth, 1668. in the 50th Year of his Age.</head>
                  <p>THE said <hi>Francis Howgil</hi> about the latter End of the 5th Moneth 1663. being in the Market in <hi>Kendal</hi> about his ordinary Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was summoned by the high Constable to appear before the Justices of Peace then present at a Tavern, who tendred him the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> as they said, and committed him to Prison till the Assizes at <hi>Appleby</hi>; so at <hi>Appleby</hi> he appeared, and had the same Oath tendered in the Court by the Judges, and for not taking it was indicted, only he had Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to answer to the Indictment the next Assizes, in the mean Time a Goal Delivery being at <hi>Appleby,</hi> he was required again to enter into Bond for the good Behaviour, only to ensnare and to bring him into further Bonds and for denying was committed Prisoner: A further Relation of his Tryal at two several Assizes is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Being at the Assizes, he had free Liberty of Speech and good Audience before the Judges and great Men of the Country and many others, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Lord made him without Fear, and girded his Heart with Strength, and opened his Mouth in Wisdom, so that he gained upon his Adversaries, for which Glory is given to God, who was a present Help to him in the time of Need.</p>
                  <p>Before the Judges sate <hi>F. H.</hi> spoke to the Clerk of the Assizes, and told him, he did not know whether they expected his Appearance then or not; the Clerk said, <hi>You have done well,</hi> and that he would acquaint the Judge, and he should only engage to him to appear the next Assizes, to answer the Indictment against him, and that he should not appear in Court; <hi>Francis</hi> bid do what he would: In the mean time Sir <hi>Philip Musgrave</hi> (so called) a great Adversary to the Truth, and the great and chief Prosecutor of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> had informed the Judges against him, <hi>As that he was a dangerous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a Ringleader and a Keeper up of Meetings of dangerous Consequence, and destructive to the Peace of the Nation</hi>; so then they concluded he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Court; and so the Clerk informed him, and told him about what time he should be called: So the Court began, Judge <hi>Twisden</hi> gave the Charge to the grand Jury, in which he said, <hi>There was a Sort of People, who under Pretence of Conscience and Religion, who seemed to build upon the King's Declarations from</hi> Breda, <hi>and under Colour of this hatched Treasons and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,</hi> and gave the Jury Charge to enquire and present such, that the Peace of the Nation might be preserved; so they impaneled the Jury,
<pb facs="tcp:40634:3"/>
and <hi>Francis</hi> was called to the Bar, and the Judge spake as Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>Judge, speaking calmly to him said, <hi>The Face of things was much altered since the last Assizes,</hi> &amp; made a large Speech to him and the Country, telling him, <hi>That all Sects under Pretence of Conscience did violate the Laws, and hatched Rebellions, not</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I have any thing to charge you with; but seeing the Oath of Allegiance was tendered to you the last Assizes, and you refused to take it; it was looked upon that such Persons were Enemies to the King and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; and said, <hi>I will not trouble you now to answer to your Indictment, but I must do that the next Assizes; in the mean time you must enter into Recognizance for the good Behaviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which <hi>F. H.</hi> answered I desire Liberty to Speak, which he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interruption, and said as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> Judge <hi>Twisden,</hi> thou very well knowest upon how slender an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or none I was brought before thee the last Assizes, where thou were pleased to tender me the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> though I believe both thee and the rest of the Court did know it was a received Principle amongst us not to swear at all, many Reasons I gave thee then, many more I have to add, if I may have Audience; for it may appear to you an absurd thing and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy in me to refuse it, if I should not render a Reason; I am (said he) none of those that make Religion a Cloak of Maliciousness, nor Conscience a Cloak to carry on Plots or Conspiracies, the Lord hath redeemed me and many more out of such things; and seeing I am engaged to appear at the next Assizes, I desire no further thing may be required of me.</p>
                  <p>Judge. <hi>You must enter into Bond this dangerous time, and therefore consider of it, and tell me now, or before the Assizes end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Day of the Assizes he was called again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> Seeing thou art pleased to let me answer to my Indictment, which I am willing to do, I have been of good Behaviour, and shall so continue; but it seems a hard thing to me, and full of Severity, that seeing I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to appear to answer an Indictment of so high a Nature (if prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against me) which tends to the Loss of my Liberty for Life, and my Estate forever, I hope the Court will not envy my Liberty for five Moneths.</p>
                  <p>Judge <hi>Turner</hi> said, <hi>We do not desire your Imprisonment, if you will be of good Behaviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>F. H.</hi> pressing further that they would not put him upon giving Bond to be of the good Behaviour, knowing himself to be bound by the Truth, that he could not mis-behave himself.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Daniel Flemming</hi> another persecuting Justice had framed another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment against him for meeting, and stood up (fearing the Snare of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Bond would not hold) and said as followeth.</p>
                  <p>D. Flemming, <hi>My Lord he is a great Speaker, it may be the</hi> Quakers <hi>cannot want him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Let him be what he will if he will enter into Bond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> said, he had nothing to accuse himself of, for his Conscience bore him Witness that he loved Peace, and sought it with all Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40634:4"/>Judges both spake, <hi>What do you tell of Conscience? we meddle not with it, but you contemn the Laws, and keep up great Meetings, and go not to Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> We are fallen in a sad Age, if meeting together peaceably, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arms or Force or Intention of Hurt to any Man, but only to worship God in Spirit, and exhort one another to Righteousness, and to pray toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the holy Ghost, as the primitive Christians of old, that this should be reckoned Breach of Peace and Mis-behaviour.</p>
                  <p>Judge <hi>Twisden, Do you compare these times with them? they were</hi> Heathens <hi>that persecuted, but we are</hi> Christian <hi>Magistrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> It is a Doctrine alwayes held by us, and a received Principle as any thing we believed, that Christ's Kingdom could not be set up with carnal Weapons, nor the Gospel propagated by Force of Arms, nor the Church of God built with Violence; but the Prince of Peace was manifested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, and we could learn War no more, but could love Enemies, and forgive them that did Evil to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip Musgrave</hi> stood up, and said, <hi>My Lord, we have been remiss towards th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> People, and have striven with them, and put them in Prison again and again, and fined them, and as soon as they are out they meet again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then stood up <hi>John Lonther</hi> called a Justice, and said, <hi>My Lord, they grow insolent, notwithstanding all Laws and the Execution of them, yet they grow upon us, and their Meetings are dangerous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip Musgrave</hi> stood up, and produced a Paper (and Justice <hi>Flemming</hi> so called, seconded him) in great Capital Letters, and gave the Judge it; he told the Judge, <hi>That it hapned some</hi> Quakers <hi>were sent to Prison, and one of them dyed at</hi> Lancaster, <hi>and they carryed his Corps through the Country, and set that Paper upon his Coffin,</hi> This is the Body of such an one, who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by <hi>Daniel Flemming</hi> till Death.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>We have spent much time with you, I will discourse no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> I acknowledge your Moderation towards me allowing me Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to speak, I shall not trouble you much longer; I shall be willing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to answer to the Indictment at the Assizes, and in the mean time to live peaceably and quietly, as I have done, if that will satisfie.</p>
                  <p>Judge <hi>You must enter into Bond to come at no more Meetings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> I cannot do that, if I should, I were treacherous to God and my own Conscience and the People and you would but judge me a Hypocrite.</p>
                  <p>They weare loath to commit him, yet at last they did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> turning about to the Country People said, the Fear of God be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you all.</p>
                  <p>The Hearts of People were tender towards him, and some were very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and affectionate to him.</p>
                  <p>Being thus committed on the 23d of the 1st Moneth, 1664. he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Prisoner about five Moneths, and a great Part of the time of his Imprisonment kept very strictly; and a Charge was given from the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces several times, that none should be suffered to speak with him; and the Goaler (being a cruel Man) was ready to execute their Orders to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, and kept him so close, that none were suffered to come to him, or
<pb facs="tcp:40634:4"/>
speak with him, but who got secretly to him, without the Goalers Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; all which the said F H. bore patiently, and never opened his Mouth to complain: And when the time of the Assizes came, he got Liberty to speak with the Clerk of the Assizes, who told F.H. that he must prepare himself to come to a Tryal; he said, he was prepared, but thought that all he could say would little avail, he believing they purposed to prosecute him with all Severity, which proved so, as will appear by the Relation following; for indeed the County Justices, who began to prosecute him, had incensed the Judges against him before hand; however F. H. endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all he could to convince them of his Innocency, and to that End drew up the Substance of the OATH into several Heads, which he could SUBSCRIBE to, though he could not SWEAR, and delivered it to the Court, and drew up another Paper to Judge <hi>Turner,</hi> shewing him and the Court the Cause of his first Commitment, and the former Proceedings against him, and how unequal it was, that they wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the other Statutes lately made against <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> and prosecuted him upon a Statute formerly made against <hi>Popish</hi> Recusants; in the same Paper he also signified, that he was a Man of a tender Spirit, and feared the Lord from a Child, and had never taken any Oath, but once in his Life, and that was twenty Years since, and that his refusing to take the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> was not in any evil Intent to the King's Person or Government, neither in Thought, Word or Deed, but meerly upon a spiritual and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Account, and that he could not swear, being otherwise perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he could not swear, seeing it was against the Command of Christ and the Apostles Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He declared that he was able to make it evident to be against the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the primitive Christians for divers hundred Years, and so no new Opinion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he did neither in Wilfulness nor Obstinacy refuse it, being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the Dammage that would come thereby, if they did prosecute him upon that Statute, he having a Wife and Children, and some small Estate, which he knew lay at Stake in the Matter; but said, if it were his Life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, he could not revolt from, or deny that which he had most certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in; but if any could convince him, either by Scripture or Reason in the thing, he had an Ear to hear; and therefore, all those things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he desired he might be dismissed from those his strait Bonds, and from their Persecution of him upon that Account: Both which Papers his Wife delivered to the Clerk, and he to the Judges, and they to the Justices before F. H. was called into the Court, which they read, in which Papers F. H. had come as near them as he could in the Truth, that he might leave them the more without Excuse; but all would not prevail with them, for they were set on to do their Utmost against him.</p>
                  <p>Here followeth the Sum of their last Proceedings against F. H. and the most material Passages in open Court at the Assizes holden at <hi>Appleby</hi> the 22d and 23d of the 6th Moneth, 1664.</p>
                  <p>F. H. being called to the Bar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40634:5"/>Judge spoke moderately and said, <hi>Here is an Indictment against you for refusing to take the Oath of Obedience, so you must plead to it either guilty or not guilty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>F. H. with a Heart girded up with Strength and Courage said, Judge <hi>Turner,</hi> May I have Liberty to speak, and make my Defence, for I have none to plead my Cause but the Lord?</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>You may.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> I will lay the true State of my Case before thee, and of the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings against me from the first, seeing Judge <hi>Twisden</hi> is not here, who had Knowledge of all the Proceedings hitherto; I am a Country Man, born and brought up in this Country, my Carriage and Conversation is known, how I have walked peaceably towards all Men, as I hope my Country men can testifie; about a Year ago being at my neighbouring Market-Town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my reasonable and lawful Occasions, I was sent for by an high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable out of the Market to the Justices of Peace, before whom I went; and when I came there, they had nothing to lay to my Charge, but fell to ask me Questions to ensnare me about our Meetings; and when they could find no Occasion, they seemed to tender the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> to me, though they never read it to me, neither did I positively deny it, yet they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to Prison; and so I was brought hither to this Assize, and then the <hi>Mittimus</hi> by which I was committed was called for, and the Judge read it, and said to the Justices, it was insufficient, nevertheless Judge <hi>Twisden</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Oath of Obedience to me; many things I did alledge then, and many more I have to say now, if time will permit; from that time I was under an Engagement to appear at the next Assize, and so was called, and did appear at the last Goal-delivery, and a further Obligation was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of me for good Behaviour, which I could not do, lest I should be brought into a further Snare; and since that time I have been committed Prisoner these five Moneths, some of which time I have been kept under great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, my Friends not permitted to speak to me; and thus briefly I have given thee an Account hitherto; and as to the Oath, the Substance thereof, with the Representation of my Case, is presented unto the Court already, unto which I have set my Hand, and also shall in those Words testifie the same in open Court, if required; and seeing it is the very Substance the Law doth require, I desire it may be accepted, and I cleared from my Imprisonment.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>I am come to execute the Law, and the Law requires an Oath, and I cannot alter it; do you think the Law must be changed for you, or only for a few; if this be suffered, the Administration of Justice i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> hindered, no Action can be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor Evidence given for the King, nor no other particular Cases can be tryed; end your Principles are altogether inconsistent with the Law and Government; I pray you shew me which Way we shall proceed, shew me some Reason, and give me some Ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> said, I shall, in the Mouth of two or three Witnesses every Truth is confirmed; and we never denyed to give, and still are ready to give E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for the King wherein we are concerned, and in any other Matter for the ending of Strife between Man and Man in Truth and Righteousness, and this answers the Substance of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40634:5"/>Judge, <hi>Is this a good Answer, think you? whether to be given with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Oath? the Law requires an Oath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> Still Evidence is and may be given in Truth, according to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Law, so that no Detriment cometh unto any Party, seeing that true Testimony may be born without an Oath; and I did not speak of changing the Law; yet seeing we never refused giving Testimony, which answereth the Intent and Substance of the Law, I judged it was reasonable to receive our Testimony, and not to expose us unto such Sufferings, seeing we scrupled an Oath only upon a conscientious Account, in Tenderness of our Consciences, for Fear of breaking the Command of Christ, the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World, which if he do, there is none of you able to plead our Cause for us with him.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>But why do you not go to Church, but meet in Houses and private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, which the Law forbids.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> We meet together only for the Worship of the true God in Spirit and Truth, having the primitive Christians for our Example, and to no other End, but that we may be edified, and God glorified; and when two or three are met together in the Name of Christ, and he in the midst of them there is a Church.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>That is true; but how long is it since you have been at Church? or will you go to the Church the Law doth allow of? give me some Reasons why you do not go.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> I have many to give thee, if thee hast Patience to hear me; <hi>first,</hi> God dwells not in Temples made with Mens Hands: 2<hi>dly,</hi> The Parish House hath been a Temple for Idols, to wit, for the Mass and the Rood; and I dare have no Fellowship with Idols, nor worship in Idols Temples; for what have we to do with Idols, their Temples and Worship?</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Were there not Houses called the Houses of God and Temples</hi>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> Yes, under the Law; but the Christians who believed in Christ separated from these (and the Temple was made and left desolate) and from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Temples too, and met together in Houses and broak Bread from House to House; and the Church was not confined then to one particular Place, neither is it now, many more things I have to say; the Judge interrupted.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Will you answer to your Indictment</hi>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> I know not what it is, I never heard it, though I have often desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Copy.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Clerk, read it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So he read it, how that F. H. had wilfully, obstinately and contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously denyed to swear when the Oath was tendered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> I deny it.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>What do you deny</hi>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> The Indictment.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Did you not deny to swear? and the Indictment convicts you that you did not swear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> I gave unto the Court the Substance of the Oath, as you all know: 2<hi>dly,</hi> I told you I did not deny it out of Obstinacy or Wilfulness, neither in Contempt of the Kings Law or Government; for my Will would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choose my Liberty then Bonds; and I am sensible it is like to be a
<pb facs="tcp:40634:6"/>
great Dammage to me; I have a Wife and Children, and some Estate, which we might subsist upon, and do Good to others, and I know all this lyes at Stake; but if it were my Life also, I durst not do but as I do, lest I should incur the Displeasure of God; and do you judge I would loose my Liberty wilfully, and suffer the spoiling of my Estate, and the ruining of my Wife and Children in Obstinacy and Wilfulness? sure nay.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Jury, you see he denyes the Oath, and he will not plead to the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only excepts against it because of the Form of Words; but you see he will not swear, and yet he saith he denies the Indictment, and you see upon what Ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then they called the Goaler to witness and swear, that the last As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizes F. H. did refuse, &amp;c. which he did; and the Jury without going from the Bar, gave in their Verdict <hi>Guilty,</hi> and then the Court broke up that Night.</p>
                  <p>The next Day towards Evening, when they had tryed all the Prisoners, <hi>Francis</hi> was brought to the Bar to receive his Sentence.</p>
                  <p>Judge stood up and said, <hi>Come, the Indictment is proved against you, what have you to say why Sentence shall not be given.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> I have many things to say, if you will hear them: 1<hi>st,</hi> As I have said, I denyed not out of Obstinacy or Wilfulness, but was willing to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the Truth in this Matter of Obedience, or any other Matter wherein I was concerned: 2<hi>dly,</hi> Because Swearing was directly against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Christ: 3<hi>dly,</hi> Against the Doctrine of the Apostles: 4<hi>thly,</hi> Even some of your principal Pillars of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; as Bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> sometime <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he said in his Works, <hi>The</hi> Waldenses <hi>did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all Swearing in their Age from that Command of Christ and the Apostle</hi> James, <hi>and it was a sufficient Ground</hi>; and Doctor <hi>Gauden,</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> in a Book of his I lately read he cited very many ancient Fathers, to shew, that the first three hundred Years Christians did not swear, so that it is no new Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>To which the Court seemed to give a little Ear, and said nothing, but talked one to another, and <hi>Francis</hi> stood silent, and then the Judge said,</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Sure you mistake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> I have not the Books here.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Will you say upon your honest Word they denyed all Swearing</hi>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F, H.</hi> What I have said is true.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Why do you not come to Church, and hear Service, and be subject to the Law, and to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's sake?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F.H.</hi> We are subject, and for that Cause we do pay Taxes, Tribute &amp; Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, <hi>and give unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the Things that are his, and unto God the Things that are his,</hi> to wit, Worship, Honour and Obedience; and if thou mean the Parish Assembly, I tell thee faithfully, I am perswaded, and upon good Ground, their Teachers are not the Ministers of Christ, neither their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Worship of God.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Why, it may be for some small things in the Service you reject it all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> First it is manifest they are time-servers, one while preaching up that for divine Service to People that another while they cry down, as Popish, superstitious and Idolatrous; and that which they have preached up twenty Years together make Shipwrack of all in a Day, and now again
<pb facs="tcp:40634:6"/>
call it divine, and would have all compelled to that themselves once made void.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Why, never since the King came in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> Yes, the same Men that preached it down once now cry it up, so they are so unstable and wavering, that we cannot believe they are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ: 2<hi>dly,</hi> They teach for Hire, and live by forced Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and would force a Faith upon Men, contrary to Christ and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Rule, who would have every one perswaded in their own Minds, and said, <hi>Whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin,</hi> and yet they say, <hi>Faith is the Gift of God,</hi> and we have no such Faith given; but yet they would force theirs upon us, and because we cannot receive it, they cry, <hi>You are not subject to Authority and the Laws,</hi> and nothing but Confiscations, Imprisonment and Banishment is threatned, and this is their greatest Plea, I could mention more Particulars; then the Judge interrupted.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Well, I see you will not swear, nor conform, nor be subject, and you think we deal severely with you, but if you would be subject we should not need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> I do so judge indeed, that you deal severely with us for Obedience to the Commands of Christ; I pray thee canst thou shew me how that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those People, for whom the Act was made, have been proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by this Statute, though I envy no Man's Liberty.</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Oh yes, I can instance you many up and down the Country that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munired, I have done it my self, pronounced Sentence against divers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> What against <hi>Papists</hi>?</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>No.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> What, against the <hi>Quakers</hi>? so I have heard indeed; so then that Statute which was made against <hi>Papists,</hi> thou let'st them alone, and executest it against the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Well, you will meet in great Numbers, and do increase, but there is a new Statute which will make you fewer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> Well, if we must suffer, it is for Christ's sake, and for well doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Francis</hi> then being silent, the Judge pronounced the Sentence, but spake so low, that the Prisoner, though near to him, could scarce hear it.</p>
                  <p>The Sentence was, <hi>You are put out of the Kings Protection and the Benefit of the Law, your Lands are confiscate to the King during your Life, and your Goods and Chattels forever, and you to be Prisoner during your Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> A hard Sentence for my Obedience to the Commands of Christ; the Lord forgive you all.</p>
                  <p>So he turned from the Bar; but the Judge speaking, he turned again, and many more Words passed to the same Purpose, as before; at last the Judge rose up and said,</p>
                  <p>Judge, <hi>Well, if you will yet be subject to the Laws, the King will shew you Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. H.</hi> The Lord hath shewed Mercy unto me, and I have done nothing against the King, nor Government, nor any Man, blessed be the Lord, and therein stands my Peace; for it is for Christ's sake I suffer, and not for Evil doing. And so the Court broke up, the People were generally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and many were sorry to see what was done against him; but <hi>Francis</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40634:7"/>
signified how contented and glad he was, that he had any thing to loose for the Lord's precious Truth, of which he had publickly born Testimony, and that he was now counted worthy to suffer for it.</p>
                  <p>As for the time of <hi>F. Howgil</hi>'s Sickness (which he endured with much Patience and Cheerfulness) it begun the 11th of the 11th Moneth, 1668. and continued till the 20th of the same Moneth, and then he departed this Life, having then for the Testimony of Jesus been Prisoner four Years and eleaven Moneths; he was not unsensible of the Decay of his outward Man sometime before, which moved him to a Disposal of his outward Estate, and the setting of his House in Order; his Love was very dear to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Fellow-Labourers, with whom he had laboured and travailed in the Work of the Ministry; in Testimony whereof he left to each of them something, as a Remembrance of his Love, and also was mindful of the Church, and left a Legacy to be distributed amongst the poor of the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Faith in the Parts where he lived.</p>
                  <p>And though the time of his Departure did draw nigh, and his Sickness encreased, yet in all that time he was in perfect and good Remembrance, and oftentimes very fervent in Prayer, and uttered many comfortable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, to the great Refreshment of those who were with him. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Dayes before his Departure, being attended by his dear Wife and several Friends, he begun to say unto them, <hi>Friends, as to matter of Words, you must not expect much more from me, neither is there any great Need of it, as to speak of Matters of Faith to you, who are satisfied only that you remember my dear Love to all Friends who enquire of me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I ever loved Friends well, or any in whom Truth appeared; and truly God will own his People, as he hath everhither to done &amp; as we have daily witnessed, for no sooner had they made that Act against us for Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nishment (to the great Suffering of many good Friends) but the Lord stirred up Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against them, even three great Nations, whereby the Violence of their Hands was taken of; I say again, God will own his People, even all those that are faithful; and as for me, I am well, and content to dye, I am not at all afraid of Death; and truly one Thing was of late in my Heart, and that I intended to have writ to</hi> G. F. <hi>and others, even that which I have observed, which Thing is, that this Generation passeth fast away; we see many good and precious Friends within these few Years have been taken from us, and therefore Friends had need to watch, and be very f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And often in the time of his Sickness he said, <hi>He was content to dye, and that he was ready, and praised God for those many sweet Enjoyments and Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had received on that his Prison-house-Bed, whereon he lay freely forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all who had a Hand in his Restraint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he said, <hi>This was the Place of my first Imprisonment for the Truth here at this Town, and if it be the Place of my laying down the Body, I am content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several Persons of note Inhabitants in <hi>Appleby,</hi> as the Mayor and others, went to visit him, some of which praying that God might speak Peace to his Soul, he sweetly replyed, <hi>He hath done it,</hi> and they all spoke well of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40634:7"/>And a few Hours before his Departure some Friends (who lived several Miles from that Place) came to visit him, he enquired of all their Welfare, and prayed fervently (with many heavenly Expressions) <hi>That the Lord by his mighty Power might preserve them out of all such Things as would spot and defile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And a little after he was saying something concerning Weeks (or a time) after which Persecution should be ended; but his Weakness was so great, and his Voice so low, that it was not fully heard.</p>
                  <p>A little Season after, he recovering a little Strength further said, <hi>I have sought the Way of the Lord from a Child, and lived innocently as among Men; and if any enquire concerning my latter End, let them know, that I dye in the Faith in which I lived, and suffered for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after these Words he spake some other in Prayer to God, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finished his Course in much Peace with the Lord.</p>

                  <head>George Fox's Testimony CONCERNING Francis Howgil.</head>
                  <p>NOW concerning <hi>Francis Howgil,</hi> who was one of the Lord's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, that preach'd his everlasting Word of Life from about the Year 1652. until the Year 1668.</p>
                  <p>He was convinced of God's eternal Truth, and received his Gospel in the Year 1652. the same Day that he had been preaching in the Morning in <hi>Furbank</hi> Chappel, in the Afternoon he was convinced by a Messenger of the Lord, and several others that had been Teachers were convinced by him, as <hi>John Audland</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>He had a great Acquaintance with the highest Sort of Priests, and after he did receive the Lord's Power and the Word of Life, he was a Torment to them, and he did confess to some of the Priests, that the Knowledge of God and his Truth he knew no more of whilest he was amongst them, as to the inward Enjoyment of it, then a Child of five Years old.</p>
                  <p>And he and <hi>John Audland,</hi> that had received some Money for preaching at a Parish called <hi>Colton</hi> in <hi>Fornace Fells</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> when they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Gospel freely, and the Word of Life from Christ, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Lord to go and return that Money back again to the Parish and People from whom they had received it, which they did, and this made the Priests more to rage and the Professors.</p>
                  <p>So as the Son of God came to be revealed in him, he began to know his Command, and powerfully and freely to preach him and his Word of Life; this did he and <hi>John Audland</hi> all the Dayes of their Life after their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement preached Christ Jesus freely, as they had received him, and turned many unto God.</p>
                  <p>And no sooner was his Mouth opened, but the Priests, Magistrates and Professors began to rage against him, and began to be offended at the Word of God and the Gospel, and sometime after cast him into <hi>Appleby</hi> Goal, in a nasty stinking Prison in the County of <hi>VVestmorland,</hi> and there they kept him for a time in the latter End of the Year 1652. but the Lord God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him out of the Mouthes of those Lyons, whom God after overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, both Priests, Magistrates and Professors.</p>
                  <p>And so after he was set at Liberty, he grew valiant and bold for the Name of the Lord, and travailed up and down on Foot, preaching the everlasting Gospel, and went to many Steeple Houses, to warn both Priests and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Day of the Lord that was coming upon them, and directing of
<pb facs="tcp:40634:8"/>
them to Christ Jesus, their Teacher and Saviour, and travailed a foot through the Countries to <hi>London,</hi> and was moved of the Lord, he and <hi>John Cham</hi> to go and admonish <hi>O. Cromwel</hi> after he was newly made Protector, and went to some of the Steeple-houses in <hi>London,</hi> and other Meetings, declaring to them the Day of the Lord and the Word of Life, and where they might find it.</p>
                  <p>And after this he travailed through the Countries to <hi>Bristol,</hi> preaching the Word of Life, and after went into <hi>Ireland</hi> with <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi> and preached the Word of Life there to both Magistrates, Priests and People, under great Sufferings, and many were begotten to the Lord Jesus, their Saviour and Teacher, there was Truth and Life by them.</p>
                  <p>And after <hi>Henry Cromwel,</hi> the Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> banished him and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Burroughs</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> through the Instigation of the Priests and other Magistrates; but the Lord overturned them his Adversaries also.</p>
                  <p>And so continuing in the Labour of the Lord till the Year 1661. he was imprisoned at <hi>London</hi> (when the <hi>Monarchy</hi> People rose) with many others though clear and innocent from that bloody Act; <hi>for his and their Weapons were spiritual, and they sought another Kingdom:</hi> And after he and they were set at Liberty, he still continued in the Work of the Lord, travailing up and down the Nations; and coming into the North, at <hi>Kendal</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates sent for him out of the Market, and tendred him the <hi>Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and Supremacy,</hi> and because for Conscience sake he could not swear, in Obedience to the Command of Christ his Saviour, they committed him to <hi>Appleby</hi> Goal in the Year 1664. and there they kept him from Sessions to the Assizes in a smoaky Hole, and at last they premunired him; and his Body being almost spent in the Service of the Lord, being a weak man, there did he offer up his Life, as a Sacrifice of his Faith for the Lord Jesus Christ's Truth, and dyed a Prisoner for the Name of Jesus in the latter End of the Year 1668. and so laid down his Life as a Testimony against the Persecutors &amp; Breakers of the Command of Christ; and his Blood doth cry for Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, though he could say, <hi>The Lord forgive all h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>And now this peaceable Man the persecuting Priests and Magistrates have gotten their Desire, to shut up in Prison this Servant of the Lord to Death, for obeying the Command of Christ; but how they will answer it before the <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the great Judge at his Tribunal Day, which hastens apace; let them consider with themselves, for if they went into everlasting Punishment that did not visit Christ in Prison, what w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And so they made his Wife a Widdow, and his Children Fatherless, <hi>who have none to cry unto but the Lord, who will relieve the Widdow, and help the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Place of his outward Habitation was in <hi>Greying</hi> in <hi>Westmorland,</hi> a man known to be of good Report before he received the Gospel freely from Jesus, which he declared freely; and great Sufferings, and Tryals, and Reproaches, and Scorns, and hard Labours in the Work and Service of the

Lord he went through, and many vain Disputes, Priests and Professors of all Sects rose up against him, but the Lord in his Power gave him Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over them all.</p>
                  <p>Who ended his Dayes in Peace in the Truth of God, and the Lord's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Testimony, for his Name, and for the keeping of, and obeying the Command of Christ, his Lord and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>And therefore all Friends and Brethren that are begotten by him through the Word of Life, and others live in the same Word, that lives, abides &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures forever, that is a Hammer &amp; a Fire, &amp; as a Sword to all that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that which is holy and pure; so that in the Truth, Power and Word of Life the Lord God may be glorified in you all the Dayes of your Life.</p>

                  <head>Richard Pinders Testimony CONCERNING Francis Howgil.</head>
                  <p>AS concerning our dear Brother in the Lord <hi>Francis Howgil,</hi> the Author of these ensuing Writings, he was a Man so well known through the Churches of Christ in his Day, that much need not be writ concerning him, as by Way of Testimony to those that knew him, and his Spirit, and Manner of Life and Conversation, yet I having had a full Knowledge of him, especially in the time of his long and tedious Imprisonment in the Town of <hi>Appleby</hi> in Westmorland, where for his Testimony sake he end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Dayes, and laid down his Life as a Testimony for that Truth that he had testified of so largely, both in preaching the Gospel, and in these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Books, which he writ at several times, according as the Lord put it into his Heart, and as there was Occasion to answer Truth's Opposers; and after many Years Travails and Labours in the Work of God, he through the Envy of some great Persons in that Country was made Prisoner at the foresaid Town of <hi>Appleby,</hi> they having nothing justly to lay to his Charge, yet knowing that it was his Principle not to swear at all (Christ having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it) they put the <hi>Oath of Supremacy and Allegiance</hi> unto him, and only for refusing to swear he was premunired, they in the least laying nothing of Misdemeanour to his Charge; and when the Judge pronounced the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Premunire against him, he only replyed, <hi>It is a hard Sentence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only for the Exercise of my Conscience, but the Will of the Lord be done,</hi> and prayed the Lord might forgive them all that had any Hand in it; and so after the said Sentence being committed Prisoner, he continued a Prisoner several Years, in which time I was very conversant with him; and I must give this Testimony for him, that I never heard him in the least murmur or repine in all the time of his Imprisonment, but alwayes appeared as a Man wholly given up in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Will of God; and when at any time we had been speaking of his long Imprisonment, constantly he would have said, <hi>The Will of the Lord be done</hi>; and such was his godly Behaviour and Conversation in the time of his Confinement, that he greatly gained the Hearts and Love of the Goaler's whole Family, and all others of the Town that knew him, and had any Acquaintance with him; and even to this Day, when his Name is mentioned, they are all ready to say, he was a Man that truly feared God, so that he left an exceeding good Savour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him in that Place: And as for the Course of his Time and Dayes in this World, I have this to say, he was born of honest Parents, and brought
<pb facs="tcp:40634:10"/>
up to some Learning, according to the usual Custom of the Country, and in his Youth and tender Years was one that sincerely thirsted after the Knowledge of God, and the Lord was good unto him, and gave him Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of divine things, unto his Soul's great Comfort; and he was an early Owner of the People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and walked with them, and was alwayes ready to suffer with them, as at any time called by the Lord thereunto; he was one greatly delighted in Concord and Unity, and greatly delighted in the Company of such whom he knew truly feared the Lord; and nothing did rejoyce his Heart more then to hear the Truth prospered, and that the Churches did encrease in the blessed Fellowship of the Gospel of Christ Jesus: And when his Dayes were near spent, that Sickness and bodily Weakness came upon him, he endured it with very great Patience unto the latter End; and his dear Wife and some other Friends being with him, he spoke forth heavenly things, as one that had obtained the full Assurance of an heavenly Crown, and as one whose Heart and Soul was fully fixed upon the Lord, who was mightily seen to be with him to his very last End, his Soul magnifying of him for his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto him all his Life long; and so he laid down his Head in Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had faithfully served the Lord in his Generation: And this is my Testimony for that faithful Servant of God, who to the Hour of his Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution bore Testimony unto the Truth; and my Soul's Desire is, his Blood in the Day of the Lord may not be laid to the Charge of some, who had a great Hand both in causing him at first to be made Prisoner, and also in the continuing of him so to the very last; but we leave things with the Lord, as knowing Vengeance belongs to him, and that he will give a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to every one according to their Works.</p>

                  <l>To <hi>Appleby</hi> this innocent Man was brought,</l>

                        <p>DAughter <hi>Abigail,</hi> this is for thee to observe, and keep, and take heed unto all the Dayes of thy Life, for the regulating of thy Life and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this World, that thy Life may be happy, and thy End blessed, and God Glorified by thee in thy Generation; these Things I bequeath unto thee, and counsel thee ever to observe, being the chief Thing alone I have to bestow upon thee, which I prize more then outward Riches; do thou so also, and observe and keep my Sayings; and I charge thee before God, and by the Coming, of our Lord Jesus Christ, that thou observe what I say, the which I am moved of the Lord to leave thee behind, and in tender Love and Affection unto thee (my Daughter) that the Lord may give his Blessing unto thee, and make thy Wayes prosperous, and thy latter End Peace.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>First</hi> of all know this, I was never born to great Possessions, or did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit great Matters in this World; but the Lord hath alwayes endowed me with Sufficiency and enough, and hath been as a tender Father unto me, because my Heart trusted in him, and did love the Way of Righteousness from a Child; I have no great Portion to bestow upon thee of the things of this World, yet of that little which I have, and that God hath blessed me with, something I shall give thee, which I shall not mention here, but thou wilt know at my Decease; but thy dear Mother I rather commend thee unto, whom I trust will provide sufficiently for thee, unto whom my Heart hath been upright before the Lord; she had a sufficient Portion and Dowry when I married her, the which I shall be sorry much to lessen or impair, and whatever was hers (if it please the Lord I decease before her) I freely leave unto her, as was ever my Intention and Purpose, which hath not, neither shall alter (through the Strength of God) as God only knows and bears me record, and shall be manifest unto all in due time, as it is unto the Lord, who hath been with me in the midst of many Troubles, Tryals and Sufferings, and hath lifted up my Head above my Adversaries because I only trusted in his Name, which at all times I found as a Refuge and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Help in the time of need, and so will be unto thee, if thou fear his Name, and trust in him forever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40634:15"/>And now dear Child, hearken unto the Words of my Mouth, and listen unto my Counsel, ponder these things I leave behind me unto thee to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that thy Dayes may be long upon the Earth, and blessed and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto thee, and an Honour to God in thy Generation; at that time when thou wast born and brought forth was a time of deep Exercise and Trouble with me, not from the Lord, who alwayes spoak Peace unto me, and did sustain me, but by Reason of the Adversary of Mankind, who alwayes seeks to devour the Good in all, and is the Sower of Discord and Mischief in the Hearts of them who fear not the Lord, neither abide in his Counsel, in whom he enters, as any Place is given unto his Temptations, and corrupts the Mind; but though it was a great Tryal that came upon me, the Lord kept my Heart in Uprightness unto him, and gave me much Patience; so though the Earth had been removed into the midst of the Sea, and all outward things had run into Confusion, and Nature had changed his Course, the Lord gave me a Resolution and Strength, as not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled neither offended, because he did support me; at that time wast thou born, and therefore I was moved to call thy Name <hi>Abigail,</hi> which signifies <hi>the Father's Joy</hi> or <hi>Delight,</hi> for in thee I was comforted, that did mitigate my present Trouble; and my Counsel unto thee is, <hi>That thou remember thy Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator in the Dayes of thy Youth,</hi> and fear the Lord in thy Youth, and learn to know him and serve him all thy Dayes; first seek the Kingdom of God and the Righteousness thereof, it's not far from thee, it's within thee, it consists in Life and Power, and it stands in Righteousness, Truth and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Justice, Mercy, Long-suffering, Patience, Love, Light and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, this is the Being and Center thereof; therefore seek not lo here or lo there without thee, in this or that outward Observation; for m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I inform thee, thou must silence all thy own Thoughts, and thou must turn thy Mind to that which is pure, and holy, and good within thy self, and seek and wait in that in the Light of Jesus Christ, wherewith thou art enlightened, which shews thee when thou dost Evil, and checks and reproves; take heed unto that, and it will shew the evil Motions and Thoughts; and as thou lovest it, it will subdue them, and preserve thee for the time to come out of Evil; for though thou be born into the World a reasonable Creature, yet thou must be born again, and be made a new Creature, or else thou canst not enter into God's Kingdom; thou must know the Seed of the Kingdom in thy self, of which thou must be born and formed again into God's Image; I have told thee God hath sown it in thee, a Grain of it a Measure of it, a Portion of it, a Measure of Light and Truth, of Righteousness and Holiness; keep in thy Mind to that, and love it, and thou wilt feel the heavenly Father working in thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and Comfort therein; love the Lord with thy Heart and Soul, even him that made thee and gave thee a Being, and all things in Heaven and Earth, and still wait for the Knowledge of him in thy self, he is not far from thee, but near unto thee, and unto all that call upon him in an upright Heart; and do thou enquire of thy dear Mother, she will inform thee, she knows him and the Way to Life and Peace, and hearken unto her Instruction; God is a Spirit, a pure Spirit of Light, and Life, and Power, he that searcheth the Heart, and shews thee when thou dost Evil, or think'st Evil, or speak'st Evil, and shews unto Man and Woman their Thoughts; that which shows the Evil is Good, and that which shews a Lye is Truth, this is within, take heed to it, this is called God's Spirit in the Scripture, believe in it, love it, and it will quicken thy Heart to Good, and it will subject the Evil; here is thy Teacher near thee, loving it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if thou act contrary it will condemn thee; therefore take heed unto this Spirit of Truth, and it will enlighten and enliven thee, and it will open thy Understanding, and give thee to know what God is and to do that which is good and acceptable in his Sight; this Spirit never errs, but leads out of all Error into all Truth. O <hi>Abigail,</hi> believe my Words, they are the Words of God and Truth; be not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, but sober minded in thy Youth, and wait on the Lord within, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto him, God is Light immortal, Life immortal, Truth immortal, an everlasting eternal Spirit, he speaks spiritually and invisibly within the Hearts and Consciences of Men and Women; hear what he speaks, and obey his Voice, and thy Soul shall live; fear to offend him or sin against him, for the Wages of Sin are Death; therefore prize his Love in thy young and tender Years, and do thou read the Scriptures and Friends Books, and take heed unto what thou readest, to obey it, as far as thou understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and pray often unto the Lord that he will give thee his Knowledge, and open thy Understanding in the things of his Kingdom; search thy Heart often with the Light of Christ in thee, manifest and bring thy Deeds to it, that they may be tryed; and examine thy self, how the Case stands betwixt the Lord and thee; and if thou seest thy self wrong, humble thy self, and be sorry, and turn unto him, and he will shew thee Mercy, and take heed for the time to come, that thou run not into the same Evil again; keep thy Heart clean, watch against the Evil in thy self in that which shews it, therein there is Power, and thereby thou hast Power to overcome all Evil: And dear Child, mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>FRiend, I was moved of the Lord to come to thee, to declare the Word of the Lord, as I was moved of the Lord, and deal plainly with thee, as I was commanded, and not to petition thee for any thing, but to declare what the Lord had revealed to me, concerning thee; and when I had delivered what I was commanded, thou questionedst it, whether it was the Word of the Lord or not, and soughtest by thy Reason to put it off; and we have waited some dayes since, but cannot speak to thee, therefore I was moved to write to thee, and clear my Conscience, and to leave thee: Therefore hear the Word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord, I chose thee out of all the Nation, when thou was little in thy own Eyes, and threw down the Mountains and the Powers of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, which had established Wickednesse by a Law, and I cut them down, and broke the Yokes and Bonds of the Oppressor, and made them stoop before thee, and I made them as a Plain before thee, that thou passedst over them, and trode upon their Necks; but thus saith the Lord, now thy Heart is not upright before me, but thou takest Counsel, and not at me; and thou art establishing Peace, and not by me; and thou art setting up Laws, and not by me; and my Name is nor feared, nor I am not sought after; but thy own Wisdom thou establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est: what saith the Lord, have I thrown down all the Oppressours, and broken their Laws, and art thou now going about to establish them again, and art going to build again that which I have destroyed? wherefore thus saith the Lord, wilt thou limit me, and set Bonds to me,

when, and where, and how, and by whom I shall declare my self, and publish my Name? then will I break thy Cord, and remove thy Stake, and exalt my self in thy overthrow. Therefore this is the VVord of the Lord to thee, whether thou wilt hear or forbear; if thou take not away all those Laws vvhich are made concerning Religion, vvhereby the People which are dear in mine Eyes, are oppressed, thou shalt not be established; but as thou hast trodden down my Enemies by my Povver, so shalt thou be trodden dovvn by my Power, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for my Gospel shall not be established by thy Sword, nor by thy Law; but by my Might and by my Power, and by my Spirit: Unto thee, this is the Word of the Lord, Stint not the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, by which I will publish my Name, when, and where, and how I will; for if thou dost, thou shalt be as Dust before the Wind; the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, and he will perform his Promise: For this is that I look for at thy Hands, saith the Lord, that thou shouldst undo the heavy Burdens, and let the oppressed go free: are not many shut up in prison, and some stocked, some stoned, some shamefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated? and some are judged Blasphemers by those who know not the Lord, and by those Laws which have been made by the VVill of man, and stand not in the Will of God; and some suffer now, because they cannot hold up the types, and so deny Christ come in the flesh; and some have been shut up in Prison, because they could not swear, and because they abide in the Doctrine of Christ; and some for declaring against Sin openly in Markets, have suffered as evil-doers; and now if thou let them suffer in this Nature by those Laws, and count it just; I will visit for those things, saith the Lord, and I vvill break the Yoke from off their necks, and I vvill bring Deliverance another VVay, and thou shalt knovv that I am the Lord.</p>

                  <p>THere are many in the County of <hi>Durham</hi> that knovv that thou hast been a Shepherd lately enough, and see thee vvhat thou hast been, and vvhere thou hast been, and vvhere thou art novv, and knovv thee to be one in Nature vvith those Shepherds vvhich the Lord sent <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel, Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to cry against, vvho feed themselves vvith the Fat, and clothe themselves vvith the Wooll, and that thou art one of those Shepherds that cares not for the Sheep, and art in the Nature of one of those Shepherds vvhich the true Prophets cryed against, vvhich vvere as <hi>Evening Wolves, and as Foxes in the Desart</hi>: And for the simples sake I am moved to lay open thy Deceit, that thou art one of those Foxes thou speakest of, vvhich hath Fire in their Tails; and thou art made manifest to be of old <hi>Cain</hi>'s Nature, that old murthering Spirit; and vvith thy <hi>flattering Titles which thou givest unto Men, and hast Mens Persons in Admiration because of Advantage</hi>; and thou art born after the Flesh, the Son of the bond-vvoman, vvho art petitioning to me, that they may abuse their Povver, and exalt themselves over the Heritage of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thou that vvouldst have Lavvs to bind the Consciences of men to walk after thy Will, thou art Anti-christ, vvho art petitioning the Povvers of the Earth to make Lavvs to limit the Holy One of <hi>Israel:</hi> But blessed be the Lord, the Day is come that thou and all Deceivers, Persecutors and Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are discovered; and many see thee among Magistrates, that thy Spirit is the same that vvould command Fire to come dovvn from Heaven, to have destroyed them vvho vvould not receive them.</p>
                  <p>First, Thou sayest, <hi>That</hi> Moses, <hi>who was a Commander over all</hi> Israel, <hi>that he was appointed to bear the People in his Bosome, as a nursing Father</hi>; and thou say'st, <hi>thou art a Cryer for the Remembrance of those things, that all might be carryed in their Arms now</hi>; and thou goest on and tellest them, <hi>that God will require the Government of his Church at their Hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep. Moses,</hi> vvho vvas faithful and true over the House of God, vvho vvas a Figure of Christ, he did receive the Lavv from the mouth of the Lord, he acted in Righteousness; and vvhen <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Madad</hi> prophesied, he

vvas not angry, as thou art; but desired that all the Lord's People vvere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and all vvho vvait upon the Lord, to receive the Lavv of God from his mouth novv, and vvalk in the same, they have the same Spirit, and they vvill not limit the holy One: But thy Cry that thou callest for is, <hi>that thou would'st have them who are in</hi> Moses<hi>'s stead,</hi> as thou say'st they are, <hi>for to limit the Holy One</hi>; and thou art the Deceiver the Apostle speaks of, vvhich art gone into the World, vvho vvould'st persvvade the Magistrates, that they must govern the Church; and so thou vvould'st have this Generation of Rulers to be dashed in Pieces, as all the Generations have been before them, in exalting themselves in the Seat of Christ: when as the Prophet saith, <hi>The Government is upon Christ's Shoulders</hi>; and the Scripture saith, <hi>He alone treads the Wine-press:</hi> And therefore whosoever will assume unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to govern the Church by an outward, visible, carnal Law, shall be as sure to be broken as all the rest: The Church is in God, and is invisible; and that which is visible and natural cannot make any Law to bind that which is unlimited; but they, if they do go about to limit the Holy One of <hi>Israel,</hi> and would set themselves in his Seat of Judgment, and take away his Glory which he will not give to any, and all such as have made any Laws in their own Wills to limit Sons and Daughters, they have all been broken, as the Scripture witnesseth every where: and therefore let all Governours in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all the World, to whom thou writest, take heed how they set themselves in the room of God, and lay Yoaks upon the Necks of them who are free by the Son, and are brought by the Power of the Lord from under the Breach of all righteous Laws, or transgressing any which are holy and just: for the Law is for the lawless; the Law is not for them who are in Righteousness, but the Law is for the Transgressors, who are in Unrighteousness, and they are those that act by that Spirit which dwells in thee, who would levy Troops for the Innocent, and art vvroth, and thy Countenance falls, like <hi>Cain,</hi> and hates thy Brethren, and would have a Lavv made over the Conscience, and vvould have the Povvers of the Earth to abuse their Povver, in turning their Svvords against them vvho live in Righteousness, and declare against Unrighteousness.</p>
                  <p>And further thou goest on and tellest them, <hi>This was a Law given to</hi> Adam, and so thou pervertest the Scripture by thy Imaginations: Where readest thou of such a Lavv given to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he compelled his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Religion? And further thou sayest, <hi>Which Care of Government is in great neglect in this Nation; upon respect to tender Consciences, sundry Sects and Sorts of Schismaticks are suffered unsuppressed, and they sacrifice to</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi> Bethel.

who they had been, and where <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> is, lest they be mistaken, as thou art, that callest Darkness Light, and Light Darkness: But all that thou art troubled at is this, that the Light of Christ in the Conscience should have Liberty; and here thou art he which is born after the Flesh, and art that <hi>Egyptian</hi> thou speakest of, which persecutes the Righteous Seed: It is true, there are Sects and Schisms too many, and Opinions, they stand all in one Ground, and thou and they come out of one Land, <hi>Babylon</hi> is the Land of your Nativity; in the Light you are seen, that thou and they are turned from the Light of Christ, and so are gone into Sects and Opinions and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations; and all the Powers without in the World cannot suppress the Root from whence these flow; none can overcome the Root from whence Heresies and Opinions come: And therefore, vain Shepherd and blind, cease thy Divining; those that thou would'st have supprest, are those that break Bread from House to House, and meet together in the Name of the Lord, as the Saints ever did; and this thou callest <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> because they will not come to an Idols Temple, where all the deceived in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worship an Unknown God; I say unto thee, thy Steeple-house (thy Idols Temple) which God never commanded, where all Lyars, Fighters, Swearers, Night-Birds and Scriech-Owls meet, and call it the House of God, and where they speak nought but the Imaginations of their own Hearts, and call them the Ordinances of God, and it the Church, that is <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> And as for the Magistrates which thou tellest, they ought to suppress the false Prophets, thou mightest have declared who they had been: But for the honest-hearted Magistracy and People, I shall declare a little when they came in, and who they are; Christ sayes, <hi>Many False Prophets shall arise</hi>; and <hi>Paul, Peter, John,</hi> and the rest they saw them come already then, many Anti-christ's and Deceivers; and then they came in, as the Scriptures witness, and they have deceived the Nations since; and Christ saith, <hi>By their Fruits you shall know them</hi>; and they are such as he cryed Wo against, which <hi>laid heavy Burdens upon the People,</hi> and such as <hi>were got into</hi> Moses<hi>'s Seat, and were called of Men Master, stood praying in the Assemblies, and had the chiefest Place in the Synagogue</hi>; and <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>They followed after covetous Practices</hi>; and <hi>Jude</hi> saith, <hi>They went after the Error of</hi> Balaam <hi>for Gifts and Rewards</hi>; and <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, <hi>They sought for their Gain from their Quarter</hi>; and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saith, <hi>They were such as fed of the Fat</hi>; and <hi>Zachary</hi> saith, <hi>They were as Evening Wolves</hi>; and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>They were covetous Men, heady, high-minded, and Lovers of Pleasure, and fierce Despisers of those that are good, and had a Form of Godliness, and they were Witches that turned them back to Circumcision, and false Prophets, when the Substance was come</hi>: And are they not so now, who sue for Tythes, maintain the first Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and bewitch People, and deny Christ come in the Flesh? Now let all judge where these are; many in the North taking away the Peoples Cows, their Pots, Kettles and Bedding; and one Priest sued one for <hi>Two Pence</hi>; and two in <hi>York-shire</hi> sued one for <hi>One Penny</hi>; and another for a <hi>Penny Half-penny</hi>; and these are they that call themselves, the Ministers of the Gospel; shame, shame, blush, howl ye Caterpillars, the Hand of the Lord is against you; and yet I would not have their Lives taken away, as thou would'st have theirs that thou callest Sectaries; but to that in thy Conscience I speak, which will let thee see, that thou hast a busie Mind, and abidest not in the Doctrine of Christ, but art among the false Prophets.</p>

                  <p>There is profession enough in the Nation, but little Possession; and all who profess high things, and do not possess them, are Hypocrites: And now blessed be the Lord, Christ is come and made manifest, which is the highest Attainment; and he comes not to send Peace on the Earth, but a Sword, and he shall confound the mighty and lofty, and they that have lived at ease shall be poured from Vessel to Vessel; and now is War proclaimed betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> our Prince, and all the Inhabitants of the Earth; and all Inchanters and Deceivers, and all such as have made Merchandize of Souls, are now made manifest; and now the Nations are angry, and the men of the Earth are afraid, and now <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> compasseth the Camp of the Saints about; and the Beast, upon which the Whore rides, and the false Prophets, and as many as have traded with the Beast and the Whore are troubled; for her sorrow is coming in a day, and all the Powers of the Earth cannot, nor shall not uphold her; for she shall be made desolate and burned with Fire: and now thou and the rest of the Merchants are troubled, and are petitioning to the Powers of the Earth to uphold you; I say unto thee, and unto all that joyn themselves against the Anointed, which is now appearing, who was dead and is alive, and lives for evermore, You shall all be broken, and your eyes shall consume in their Holes: Gather your selves together, howl ye Caterpillars, strengthen your selves, build up your batteries, cast up your mounts; for a mighty and terrible one is coming up against you; his voice is as the roaring of a Lyon, he is greedy of his Prey, he shall devour at once, and he is bringing about his Determination to cut off every one that withstands him, and no VVeapon formed shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper; the eternal VVord is preached, and the Angel is flying through the midst of Heaven with the everlasting Gospel, and by it shall Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ be consumed; And because this Gospel is declared and preached and witnessed, thou art angry: But that which thou calls preaching the VVord, is nothing but thy own Imaginations: This they have preached long enough, and what hath it done, all your divining? None hath been turned from his Iniquity. And as for thy Sacrament, thou wast complaining of the Pope's Emissaries, and here thou art one: Thou mayst return thy Word back from whence thou hadst it: And all who come to witness the word and the preaching of it; and the Body and Blood of Christ, which is the Saints Communion, and the Supper of the Lord, will deny all your Inchantment, and all your canker'd rusty worm-eaten Divination; and all powers which seek to uphold this which was and is Abomination to the Lord, they must partake of her Plagues; let all consider, God hath overturned all the Powers that have pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to establish Religion by a Lavv, whenas they have but established a Form, a Husk, and so Satan hath crept into that; and all the Priests in this Nation, have they not transformed into every Image, vvhat vvay soever Authority and the Povvers of the Earth bend, and so have made merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and sold that vvhich is not Bread, and so have deceived the People.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> They who are turned from the Light of Christ, are turned into Division; and they that have not the same Spirit, by which the Apostle spake, that said so, are divided from Christ, and from the Body, and from the Saints, and are in Contention: And here I charge thee and all the Priests in <hi>England,</hi> that you are divided from Christ, and turned from the Light, who <hi>prophesie for Hire, and divine for mony, who go in long Robes, who are called of men Master, who have the chiefest Place in the Assembly, and stand praying in the Synagogue,</hi> who go to Law with your Hearers, and who give Meanings upon the Scriptures, who add and diminish, who speak but that which you have gathered from other mens Words; there doth Sects and opinions, strife and division arise. And here thou art marked by many in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> (praised be the Lord,) to be one that is divided from the Light, and causes Division, who took away Four Oxen for five Pence Halfpenny; and so they have turned away from thee, and all vvho stand in that Nature wherein thou stands: And therefore thou art petitioning that thou might have a Law to bind us under thy Witchcraft, wherein the Nations have been deceived. And it is true, God hath overturned Kings, and Princes, and Dukes, and Earls, and Emperors, for the sake of his chosen Ones; and all they vvho have made an Image like the true God, and like the Gospel, and have made a Decree, and whosoever now make a Decree that any shall fall down to worship any thing which is contray to the Light of Christ in the Conscience, God hath hewed them down, and he will hew them down, who go about to limit the Holy One, who is Lord over all, and who will have Dominion over the Consciences of men; and the time is already, when <hi>Jezabel</hi> is to be cast into the Bed of Torment, and all who commit For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with her, whether they be Kings, Emperors, Dukes or Earls, they shall all go down with the Dukes of <hi>Edom</hi> into the Pit, and with the rest of the Uncircumcised, and the Saints shall rejoyce in their overthrow.</p>
                  <p>And thou sayest, <hi>There is yet little doth appear in</hi> England, <hi>but the old Beast under new Habits acts his old Tragedies</hi>; and thou tells of <hi>Satans Arrows which are brought into the Nations</hi>; and thou tells of Ranters <hi>and</hi> Quakers, <hi>and</hi> Seekers <hi>and</hi> Creepers, <hi>Creatures new come from the Pit</hi>; and thou sayest <hi>they resemble</hi> Samson<hi>'s Foxes, which burn up faith bred by hearing the word preacht.</hi>

And have you tried one another, and proved one another, and every one preached up what he would have had, and have brought nought to pass? what shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Reformers are ye? Can you not maintain with your Gommissions and all your petitioning for God's Ministers for the North; and you had your desire, they came as thick as locusts out of the South; and cannot

you all with your preaching preach down those contemptible Creatures that thou speaks of? And as for <hi>Ranters,</hi> I deny both thee and them; for thou and they spring both from one Root. And I am one thou calls a <hi>Quaker</hi> and <hi>Seeker</hi>; and blessed be the Lord forever more, that ever I was found worthy to bear the Name in Truth; for they that seek shall find, and they that wait shall not be ashamed. And thou blind Shepherd, thou might as well have uttered forth thy venome at <hi>David, Daniel, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> and the rest of the holy men of God, and have said, <hi>they came out of the pit:</hi> Thou proude blasphemer, God will plead with thee for deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Power of the Lord; and thou art that Fox thou speaks of, that would be devouring and have all consumed, that thy corrupt sensual filthy Will might be satisfied: And as for Faith, thou never came to the Faith of devils, who believe and tremble; and thy Faith and thy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which are but Imaginations and Traditions of men, the Day is discovered that shall burn them up and consume all; and you shall be left naked and bare, and have nothing to cover your Nakedness, but you shall be as a Stink and a Proverb.</p>
                  <p>And whereas thou saist, <hi>They preach down Ministry and means, and all but those that have Knowledge miraculously infused</hi>; and thou art offended, because we declare what the Prophets were, when they were called to prophecy; and what the Apostles were before they went to preach; and thou <hi>gathers thy</hi> Conclusions, <hi>that they will send Princes to beg, as well as the Ministry</hi>; and thou sayest, <hi>Nothing was more strongly charged upon</hi> Israel, <hi>then suppressing of false Prophets</hi>; and thou sayest, <hi>shall not Christian Princes also be zealous to Suppress them that would devour the flock of Christ</hi>?</p>

                  <p>And further thou tellest the <hi>Magistrates, That if any Hypocrite shall presume to speak a Word in the Name of the Lord, which he hath not commanded, even he shall dye, and it is an old Statute unrepeal'd.</hi>

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> If thou knevv vvhat thou spoak, thou hast given Sentence against thy self; I charge upon thee in the Presence of the living God, that thou never heardst his Word, nor spake his Word, but in thy ovvn Name; and I charge it again upon thee, when did he ever speak to thee? that Spirit by which the Prophets of the Lord spoke, thou dost deride, and call'st it a miraculous Infusion, and so thy Spirit is another, and not the same; and that it is an old Statute, thou shalt know, that thou hast spoken in thy own Name, and what thou hast learned by Tradition; but in Christ all the Law and the Prophets is fulfilled and all Statutes, who come to witness him; he is the Law-giver, Judge and King, and all is fulfilled as he comes to be witnessed, and all strange Gods put away, even the Idols of Gold and Silver, and all false Prophets by him come to be seen, judged, condemned and slain; and thou that would'st put it upon the <hi>Magistrate</hi> without, to kill Men by a Law, and so to usurp the Power which is given to the Son, and so make them guilty of innocent Blood, thou art a Murderer: And now further, who must judge of the false Prophets, of Heresie, Schism and Blasphemy? I know thou denyest Revelation, and the rest of the Priests in <hi>England,</hi> who trade with other mens Words; and I know thou darest not say, thou art infallible, and thou hast not discerning of Spirits; the Apostle exhorted them who dwelt in the Light to try the Spirits; but he bad not them who are led by the Prince of the Air, and were Children of Disobedience, as thou art, of a covetous earthly Mind, he bad not them to try, nor them who were carnal; and therefore stop thy mouth, thou canst not discern a Lamb from a Dog, not a Kite from a Dove: And let all <hi>Magistrates</hi> who fear the Lord, either in this Nation or else-where, take heed how they judge of Heresie and Blasphemy; not that I am ignorant but that there is Heresie and Blasphemy, but that none can judge who they are, but who have an infallible Spirit; therefore it is now as it hath been, many have suffered as Hereticks, as Christ for a Blasphemer, and the Apostles as Setters forth of strange Gods, and were persecuted to Death; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do and are like to suffer by this Spirit that dwells in <hi>Thomas Ellyson:</hi> And therefore all you who are <hi>Magistrates,</hi> that sit as Judges and Rulers, take heed what you do, and take heed of Zeal without Knovvledge; for so <hi>Paul</hi> persecuted, and so the <hi>Jews</hi> slevv Christ the Heir; and so many vvould have their Will satisfied, but thou must be judged by all vvho dvvell in the Light, &amp; thou that sittest as Judge over another, see that thou be judged in thy self; for to take your Knovvledge and Direction from such as these men, instead of planting you vvill be Destroyers.</p>

And were there not such that were Railers, and false Accusers, and blind Watchmen, and greedy dumb Dogs, and such as led into VVitchcraft, and Anti-christs, Deceivers? you might as well have called Christ, <hi>Paul, Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> Blasphemers and Hereticks, but you are made manifest to be them, and in the same nature that called Christ a Blasphemer, and <hi>Paul</hi> a Pestilent Fellow, and a Setter forth of strange Gods, and the Ministers of Christ Seditious, and thou mightst as well say, Christ despised a Governour, when he called <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox: And now, blessed be the Lord, the Hour of his Judgments is come; and we freely declare against all Deceit both in Magistrates, Priests and People, as they did that wrote forth the Scripture, and bear witness, to his Name, as they did, in our Measure; and we have suffered, and do suffer daily, by slanderous Tongues, such as you have; and Imprisonments, and cruel Mockings, and Stripes, and Bonds; and can truly say to the praise of his Name, <hi>We bear in our Bodies the Marks of the Lord Jesus</hi>; but we must pass through good Report and evil Report; and it is our Crown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to suffer for his Name; and now <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and all the Powers of the Earth bend themselves, and are angry, even the Nations that profess Christ in Words, and say, the Scripture is their Rule, but walk not according to it; and against all such hypocrisie are we VVitnesses, to the fulfilling our Testimony, and the laying down of our Lives, that he alone may be honoured who sits upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and of whose Government there is no End, to whom be Praise forever, who shall break all your Combinations and plots, and you shall be Ground to Powder, who set your selves against him, and be dashed to Pieces as a Potter's Vessel.</p>

or <hi>Right Worshipful,</hi> or ever any of the Saints of God did so? he that is Righteousness and Truth, unto whom all Honour and Worship belongs, God blessed forever, we own and worship; he is no Respecter of Persons. And you filthy Flatterers, who are in the Curse, respect mens Persons and so you are razed out forever from the Faith of Christ, and from the, Faith which all the Holy Men of God lived in, that you know it not: but you false Accusers, Magistrates we know, and they are for the Punishment of Evil-doers, and for the Lavvless, for Lyars and Slanderers, such as you are, and for the Praise of them that do vvell; and vve honour such in our Hearts, and obey their just Commands, and are not like him that said <hi>he would go,</hi> and vvent not, but are subject for Conscience sake to the Povv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that are of God, and are subject to every Ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; but vve cannot flatter nor respect mens Persons, and deny the Faith of Christ, but are brought from under the Povver of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by the mighty Povver of God, and are subject to all just Lavvs, vvhich stand not nor vvere made in man's Will, but obey them for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake; and if any Lavv, vvhich is not just and equal, be required upon us, that vve cannot do, vve suffer for Conscience sake, and resist not at all, as many of our Enemies vvill vvitness for us; and therefore you false Accusers be silent; they that are subject to <hi>Israel</hi>'s Common Wealth are righteous, and vvalk in Righteousness, in that vvhich is just, good and holy; and vve vvitness against all the <hi>Cananites,</hi> vvho vvalk in Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; and all vvho are Enemies to the Common Wealth of <hi>Israel</hi> must be broken to Pieces, and them that strive and contend against the Faith vvhich vvas once delivered to the Saints, and is novv witnessed (prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Lord) all such must be disturbed and broken to Pieces by the just, even all the unjust shall be broken: And as for that vvhich thou say'st vve say, <hi>We ought not to be subject to any Civil Government, but that which is within us</hi>; Oh thou Lyar, vvhen vvilt thou cease thy Lying? vvhere is that? I charge thee to prove vvhere that is spoken; yet this I say unto all, <hi>Moses</hi> received the Lavv from the Mouth of the Lord, and it vvas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him and in him, and then he vvought it vvithout, and vvas sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it: And all vvho make Lavvs novv, and do not receive them from God, they make them in their ovvn Wills, and such as do act contrary to the Lavv of God; but that Lavv vvhich is righteous, vvhich is according to that in the Conscience, vvhich is holy, good and civil, vve are subject both vvithin and vvithout to it: And all your Subjection, which is not from a Principle vvithin, is not in Truth nor Singleness of Heart, but vvith Flattery, and your Eye-Service, and your bovving dovvn in Hypocrisie, and saying, you are subject, vvhen there is no Truth in the Heart; and so you are not subject for Conscience sake.</p>

Your Shame is laid open to all; and now your Shame, I hope, will appear to the Parliament, whom you petition; what cry you out against Books, and printing, and Blasphemy, that cannot distinguish a Lamb from a Dog? would you judge Truth by Darkness? And you are offended that there are so many <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> met in the North Parts lately, Two Thousand; yea, blessed be the Lord, there are many Thousands that see you, and never will bow to <hi>Baal,</hi> nor worship in the House of <hi>Rimmon</hi> more; and many shall not only come from the North, but also from the South, yea, in <hi>London,</hi> that now see all your Deceit, and they shall enter, and you shall be shut out; and what Truth is this that cannot defend it self? and what Religion is that vvhich cannot defend it self, but you must have all bend to your Image that you vvould set up?</p>
                  <p>And now unto you who are petitioned unto, I say unto you, take heed and beware how you call or suppress any thing as Error, or how you med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the prescribing God a Way to walk in, for he cannot, he will not be limited; and I say unto you, it were better a Milstone were hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your Necks, then to hinder, stop, or make any Law to hinder the Passage of the Truth which is arising; and consider, the Lord hath thrown out all Powers before this, because they would needs limit the Holy One of <hi>Israel,</hi> and prescribe him a Way, and a Goverment, how he should be worshipped; and many have suffered, and what hath all come to, all the Rules that men have laid down? have they not been as the Untimely Fruit of a VVoman, and as Corn upon the House top? and for that all have

The Tower of <hi>David,</hi> Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> stands sure, and cannot be moved: O! who is a People like unto you, saved by our God that lives forever?

                  <p>O ye that are convinced of the Truth of our God, wait in that which doth convince, and keep your Minds to it, and love it, and follow it whither it leads you, and it will lead you to know the Gift of God, which leads to Repentance from dead VVorks, to serve the living God, who dwells in the Immortal Light; and take heed of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back at the Pleasures of Sin you have formerly lived in, but wait upon the pure Light of Christ Jesus in Patience, that so you may see the Enmity which is against God, and it slain in you daily; that so you may see him that is the Saviour of the Soul: and take heed of rebelling against the Lord, who hath given you a measure of his true Light, to lead you from Sin if you love it unto Righteousness, from whence it comes, even from the righteous Judge of all the VVorld, who judgeth every man ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>My dear Brethren of the everlasting Kindred, and Heirs of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Promise; wait all in Patience, having received an earnest of the Inheritance that never fades away; to the End abide in the Father's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and at Wisdom's Gate: Ye know what I say, I write not unto you because you know not the Truth, but because you know, and are made free in your Measures by him who is the Truth and the Way, in which all our Fathers, and you also have obtained a good Report, even of all the Houshold of Faith; and take heed of the Glory of the World, and look not at Hardship; for verily, all the Suffering is not worthy to be Compared to that Glory which is revealed, and to be revealed unto all that wait and abide in Patience and Faithfulness unto the end; but be ye as good Souldiers, endure hardship, that you may receive the End of your Hope, and the everlasting Price, and the purchased Possession, and the Crown of Glory, which God will give unto you in his own Day, which is coming on towards you, if you continue in the Hope, in the Faith, and in the Love unfeigned, which thinks no ill, by which, and in which <hi>Love,</hi> we have Victory over the <hi>Grave, Sin</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> which he hath freely shed abroad in our Hearts, unto whom be <hi>everlasting Praise forever and ever,</hi> to him which was dead, and is alive, and lives for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the Mediator of the new Covenant of <hi>Life</hi> and Peace, in which we have Access freely to the Throne of Grace, and are accepted in him, who

                  <p>From twelve Years old I set my Heart to know that God which the World professed, and which I did read of in the Scripture, which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Noah, Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, and the rest of the Fathers worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; and I did fall into the strictest Worship that was in that Part wherein I lived; and often I desired to be alone, and attended much to reading and Meditation; and then as I was sober, and serious alone, I began to see, <hi>that all the Sports and Pastimes, and such as Youth delight in naturally, were Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and they lasted but for a Moment</hi>; and while I was in Folly and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness, doing of them, the Nature which was run into Transgression had Pleasure in them, but as soon as I was come from among them, I was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my self for what I had done, and often made me weep; then I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in my Will, <hi>that I would never do so again,</hi> and for some time did restrain from the common Practice of those things that I had walked in; but as soon as I came amongst those again, I acted those things again, which before I did see to be Vanity, but long before that I was checked for many things; and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40634:37"/>
so I walked, often condemned in my self, when I was serious, and had no Peace; and then not knowing what to do, in much Sorrow, when I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, I had a Desire to be alone, where I might not hear nor see any Folly acted, and did not go to the former Exercises, although something in me hankered after it; but when I yielded not unto it I was glad, and had Peace; and then I began to oppose my Fellows, with whom I had walked in Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness; and then they began to revile me, and hate me, and scorn me; yet notwithstanding I mattered not; then I read much, and prayed in Words often, three or four times a day; but I knew not where God was, but in my Imagination imagined a God at a Distance, and so went on; and then I began to grow in Knowledge without (which is sensual) and then I was puffed up, for the World admired me; but still I was condemned for vain Words and Actions, and the Root of Iniquity grew in me; and then I followed a more strict Course, and often went five or six Miles to hear some more excellent Means (as they called it) and so did get more Words, but still I was the same, nay, worse, for Knowledge puffed me up; then along to about fifteen Years of Age, I posted up and down after the most excellent Sermons (so called) and so became acquainted with all the eminent <hi>Christians</hi> (so called) in the Region where I lived; and I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised of my Parents, and of the World made a Wonder, and great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach came upon me; but still I saw they knew nought, and it was no Matter; and so much Sorrow fell upon me four or five Years; and when I was turned within, I was judged for all my Iniquity formerly, and still my Heart was shewed to me, that it was corrupt; but as I kept within to the Light in my Conscience, I was restrained from many Actions, which I had a Will to do, and in the Instant, when I have been doing any Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in Actions or Words, in many things I was often stopped; and when I saw that I did it not, a great Joy arose in me; and when I had done any thing forwardly and rashly, I was judged; but this the Teachers said, <hi>was a Natural Conscience that kept from Sin, and did restrain it,</hi> and said, <hi>he that had but restraining Grace (as they called it) he was but a tame Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so I hearkned to their Imagination, and so slighted the Light, as too low a thing, that was but common Grace that did preserve out of gross Evils, but the Saints had a peculiar Faith and Grace; and so I hearkened to them, and still I was convinced of Sin; and then they told how <hi>the Saints did believe in Christ, and so Sin was not imputed, but his Righteousness was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to them, and so I must seek him in the Means, as Prayer and receiving the Sacrament,</hi> as they called it, and judged me a worthy Communicant; and in great Fear I was that I should eat unworthily; and none could direct me what the Body of Christ was; insomuch that one time I read all the Scripture that spoke of Christ's Suffering: And they said, <hi>I must believe he suffered for me</hi>; and I believed all that they called Faith, but yet I could not see how he dyed for me, and had taken away my Sin; for the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in my Conscience told me, <hi>I was a Servant of Sin, whilest I committed it</hi>; and they told me, <hi>I must not omit that Ordinance, for thereby Strength was confirmed, and Faith added</hi>; insomuch, on the one Hand they pressing it as a Duty, and on the other Hand I saw that the Scripture said, <hi>He that eats unworthily eats Damnation to himself</hi>: I was in Fear, notwithstanding none could accuse me without; yet then afterward a great Fear fell upon
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40634:37"/>
me, and I thought I had sinned against the Holy Ghost, and great Trouble fell upon me.</p>
                  <p>Then they said, <hi>I had not come prepared</hi>; and yet I had all the Preparation that they had spoken of; but still they were all Physitians of no value.</p>
                  <p>Then I fasted, and prayed, and walked mournfully in Sorrow, and thought none was like me, tempted on every Hand; so I ran to this man and the other, and they applyed Promises to me, but it was only Words; for the Witness of Christ shewed me, <hi>That the Root of Iniquity stood, and the Body of Sin whole</hi>; notwithstanding I was kept by a secret Power from gross Evils; but still Sorrow compassed me about, and I questioned all that ever I had, which they said was <hi>Grace, Repentance and Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then I told them there was Guilt in me; and they said, <hi>Sin was taken away by Christ, but the Guilt should still remain while I lived,</hi> and so brought me the Saints Conditions, who were in the Warfare, to confirm it; and so I said in my self, <hi>This was a miserable Salvation, that the Guilt of Sin and Condemnation still in me should stand</hi>; and so I was tossed from Mountain to Hill; and heard them preach Confusion, and so I mattered not for them, and said, <hi>Sure this is not the Ministry of Christ</hi>; and so I ceased long by Fits, and did not mind them, but kept still at home, and in desart Places, solitary in weeping; and every thing that I had done was laid before me, insomuch that every Thought was judged, and I was tender, and my Heart broken, and when I could sorrow most I had most Peace, for something spoke within me from the Lord, but I knew him not then; and they said, <hi>that it was Heresie to look for the Word of the Lord to be spoken now in these Dayes, but only the Letter</hi>; and so I regarded it not much, yet often I was made to do many righteous things by the immediate Power and Word of God, and then Peace and Joy sprung up in me, and Promises were spoken, <hi>That he would teach me himself, and be my God</hi>; and often I did obey contrary to my Will, and denyed my Will; but they told me, <hi>This was legal to obey out of Fear, and that was Slavery; but there was an Evangelical Obedience</hi> (as they called it) so I got above the Fear, and yet acted the former things, which they called Ordinances, and they said, <hi>that was Son-like Obedience, and Christ had done all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then there appeared more Beauty in them called <hi>Independents,</hi> and I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, and so joyned my self to them, and all the Money that I could get I purchased Books with, and walked with and owned them as more separate from the World, and they prest Separation; but at last I saw it was but in Words, that they would do things, and chuse Officers and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of themselves, and so made themselves an Image, and fell down to it, yet there was some Tenderness in them at the first, but the Doctrine was the same with the World's Words without, of others Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                  <p>Then they whom they called <hi>Anabaptists</hi> appeared to have more Glory, &amp; walked more acording to the Scripture, observing things written without; and I went among them, and there was something I loved among them; but after they denyed all but such that came into their Way, as <hi>out of the Fellowship of the Saints and Doctrine of Christ, I saw the Ground was the same,</hi> and their Doctrine out of the Life, with the rest of the Teachers of the World, and had separated themselves, and made another Likeness; but still all said, <hi>The Letter was the Word and Rule, and Christ, at a Distance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40634:38"/>
had done all</hi>; and some of them holding <hi>Free-will,</hi> others opposing, and all in the Will.</p>
                  <p>But still I lov'd them that walked honestly amongst all these; but though I had seen and owned all that I had heard (except the Figure, which I saw was outward, and that was their greatest Glory; and I saw they would have all fall down to it, else no Communion; in the midst of all these and much more, which is Death to speak on, but only that all honest-hearted may see themselves where they have rested, and also may not trust any more to a Reed of <hi>Egypt</hi>) after all this no Peace nor no Guide I found; and then the Doctrine of Free Grace (as they called it) some preached, <hi>That all Sin was done away, past, present and to come,</hi> and so preached Salvation to the first Nature, and to the Serpent that bore Rule, only believing this, and all is finished; to this I hearkened a little, and so lost my Condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but still whither ever I went, this was spoken in me, <hi>His Servant thou art to whom thou obeyes</hi>; and so I being overcome by Sin, I had no Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion witnessed in me, but Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Then some preached Christ within, but they themselves were without, had but Words, and yet they said, <hi>All must be within</hi> (unto which my Heart did cleave) and spoke of Redemption and Justification, and all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and of God appearing in Man, and overcoming the Power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and then that in my Conscience bore Witness it must be so, and I was exceedingly pressed to wait to find it so, and something breathed after the living God; and a true Love I had to all that walked honestly in what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession soever, and I hated reviling one another, and that they should smite one another, and persecute one another, and with the Sufferer I alwayes took Part; but still I saw, though they spoke of all things within, and of a Power to come, that they enjoyed not what they spoke, for the same Fruits were brought forth; till at last, I saw none walked as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, nor none that pretended to the Ministry had any such Gift, neither Pastor, nor Teacher, nor any such Members as were in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time.</p>
                  <p>So at last, having passed up and down, hurried here and there, I saw all the Teachers of the World, that they sought themselves, and fed poor People with dead Names and Deceit, and that they were not the Ministry of Christ; and so I saw them all in Deceit, who did not abide in Christ's Doctrine; and I got my self quit of most of them; for ever as I dissented from their Judgment, they hated me and persecuted me.</p>
                  <p>So at last there was something revealed in me, <hi>that the Lord would teach his People himself</hi>; and so I waited, and many things opened in me of a time at Hand; and sometime I would have heard a Priest, but when I heard him, I was moved by the Lord, and his Word in me spoke to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and often as a Fire I burned, and a Trembling fell upon me, yet I feared Reproach, and so denyed the Lord's Motion; and it was revealed in me to wait, and I should know his Counsel; and the Word of the Lord was in me, <hi>The Time was at Hand, when the Dead should hear the Voice of the Son of God</hi>; and it burned in me as Fire, <hi>That the Day was near, when it should not be, Lo here, nor there, but all his People should be taught of the Lord</hi>; but still my Mind ran out, and out of the Fear into Carelesness, for the Cross of Christ I knew not; and yet I say, <hi>I was wiser then my Teachers I met with in that Generation</hi>; I do not glory in it, for Condemnation is past
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40634:38"/>
on it all forever; yet still I had ever, as my Mind was turned to the Light, pure Openings and Prophesies to come, and a Belief that I should see the Day, and should bear Witness to his Name; and so when things opened so fast, the Wisdom of the Flesh catched them; and so I went up and down, preaching against all the Ministry, and also run out with that which was revealed to my self, and preached up and down the Country of the Fulness that was in the old Bottle, and so was wondred after, and admired by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who had waded up and down as my self had, and we fed one another with Words, and healed up one another in Deceit, and all laid down in Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row when the Day of the Lord was made manifest; for I was overthrown, and the Foundation swept away, and all my Righteousness and Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness was all judged and weighed, and all was found too light.</p>
                  <p>And immediately, as soon as I heard one declare (whose Name is not known to the World, but written in the Lamb's Book of Life forever, in eternal Record forever) as soon as I heard him declare, <hi>That the Light of Christ in Man was the Way to Christ,</hi> I believed the eternal Word of Truth, and that of God in my Conscience sealed to it; and so not only I, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds more, who thirsted after the Lord, but was betrayed by the VVisdom of the Serpent, we were all seen to be off the Foundation, and all Mouthes were stopped in the Dust, and so we stood all as condemned in our selves, and all saw our Nakedness, and were all ashamed, though our Glory was great in the VVorld's Eye, but all was Vanity.</p>
                  <p>And then after all this, I was ignorant what the first Principle of true Religion was; but as I turned my Mind within to the Light of Jesus Christ, wherewith I was enlightened, which formerly had reproved me for all Vanity, and also as I did own it, it led me into Righteousness, and when I turned to it, I saw it was the true and faithful VVitness of Christ Jesus, and then my Eyes were opened, and all things were brought to Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that ever I had done, and the <hi>Ark of the Testament was opened, and there was Thunder and Lightning and great Hail, and then the Trumpet of the Lord was sounded, and then nothing but War and Rumour of War, and the dreadful Power of the Lord fell upon me, Plague, and Pestilence, and Famine, and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and Fear, and Terrour, for the Sights that I saw with my Eyes, and that which I heard with my Ears, Sorrow and Pain; and in the Morning I wished it had been Evening, and in the Evening I wished it had been Morning, and I had no Rest, but Trouble on every Side; and all that ever I had done was judged and condemned; and all Things were accursed, whether I did eat, or drink, or refrain, I was accursed; and then the Lyon suffered Hunger, and the Seals were opened, and seven Thunders uttered their Voices; mine Eyes were dim with cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my Flesh did fail of Fatness, my Bones were dryed, and my Sinnews shrunk; I became a Proverb to all, yea, to them who had been mine Acquaintance, they stood afar off me; the Pillars of Heaven were shaken, and the Earth reeled as a Cottage, one Wo poured out after another; and I sought Death in that Day, and could not find it, it fled from me; and I sought to cover my self any Way, or with any Thing, but nothing could; for the Indignation of the Lord was upon the Beast and the false Prophet, and</hi> Babylon <hi>came into Remembrance in that Day, the Mother of Harlots, and the Sea dryed up, and all the Merchants that traded with her stood afar off, for the Cup of Fury was poured forth, and</hi> Cain <hi>was seen, and</hi> Judas <hi>that had betrayed the Lord of Life; and I would have run any Way to have hid my self, but nothing but weeping, and gnashing of Teeth, and Sorrow,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40634:39"/>
and Terrour; and I roared out for the Disquietness of my Heart and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was full of Darkness, I knew not the right Hand from the left, I became a perfect Fool, and knew nothing, and as a Man distracted; all was overturned, and I suffered Loss of all, in all that ever I did, I saw it was in the accursed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and then something in me cryed:</hi> Just and true is his Judgment! <hi>my Mouth was stopped, I durst not make mention of his Name, I knew not God</hi>: And as I bore the Indignation of the Lord, something rejoyced, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's Head began to be bruised, and the VVitnesses which were slain were raised, and stopped Heaven, that it rained not in the Dayes of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; and a great Famine there was, and the Sun was darkened, and the Moon turned into Blood, and the Stars did fall, and all the Grass of the Earth withered, and every green Tree, and all the Springs were dryed up, and a great and noysome Smell, and a Plague fell upon the Earth, and the VVaters became as the Blood of a dead Man, and the Heavens passed away with her Noise, and the Elements melted, and the Earth was scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Flame which proceeded from the Throne of God, and the Judgment-Seat of Christ was seen, and an Account was to be given, and then <hi>Esau</hi> was cursed, and <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and all the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanites</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> went to the left Hand; and as the Judgment was pronounced, something cryed, <hi>Just art thou, oh Lord, in all thy Judgments</hi>! And as I did give up all to the Judgment, the Captive came forth out of Prison, and rejoyced, and my Heart was filled with Joy, and I came to see him whom I had pierced, and my Heart was broken, and the Blood of the Prophets I saw slain, and a great Lamentation; and then I saw the Cross of Christ, and stood in it, and the Enmity slain upon it; and the new Man was made, and so Peace came to be made, and so eternal Life was brought in through Death and Judgment; and then the perfect Gift I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, which was given from God, and the holy Law of God was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me, and was written in my Heart, and his Fear and his Word (which did kill) now makes alive; and so it pleased the Father to reveal his Son in me through Death; and so I came to witness Cleansing by his Blood, which is Eternal, Glory unto him forever, and am a Minister of that Word of eternal Life which endures forever, Glory unto his Name forever, and have Rest and Peace in doing the Will of God, and am entred into the true Rest, and lye down in the Fold with the Lambs of God, where the Sons rejoyce together, and the Saints keep Holy Dayes, Glory unto him forever.</p>
                  <p>And these few things have I written for your sakes, who walk in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that you may see where you are; and also ye high Cedars, who trust in the Arm of Flesh, that you may cease your Boasting, and come down from off the Pinacle where you are exalted; for the same must come upon you, if ever the Lord you know in Truth and Righteousness, even through the Death of things, in the Curse of all Knowledge and Wisdom which is from below, yea, through the Death of Death that rules in you, which must be slain upon the Cross of Christ Jesus, if ever you come to true Peace, and witness eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And therefore cease you Diviners and Imaginers, who have feigned a Faith, and a Christ, and a Salvation in your Imaginations, and yet that you may live in the Lust and Filth of the World, and the Customs and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40634:39"/>
which perish: I say your Expectations shall fail, and you will lye down in Sorrow; for where Salvation is witnessed, the Life of Christ is witnessed; but you would have Salvation, and the Life of the Devil brought forth and lived in.</p>
                  <p>But unto all such I say, This will be your Sentence, <hi>Depart into the Lake</hi>; Therefore take Warning; for it is not your good Words, without the Life of Godliness, nor your swelling Speeches, that are accepted with God; for he accepts nothing but what is of himself, and by him wrought in the Creature by his own Will and Power; and this destroyes the carnal Will, Power and Righteousness; and this work, which he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of himself, and by his Power, and in his Covenant, is perfect, and is accepted of God; and so its no more the Creature, but Christ, who is all in his Saints; and so he brings all that follow him out of his Works of Condemnation (which are acted in the disobedient Nature, and are accursed, whether praying or plowing, or whatsoever, while <hi>Cain</hi> lives, which is in the Banishment, out of the Acceptance of God) and all who follow him, who is the LIGHT, and leads all that believe and follow him into the living Works of Righteousness wrought by Christ through Faith, and is accepted and well pleasing unto God; and here all boasting is excluded, for all is of him, and from him, that works both the Will and the Deed; and here the Lord is admired in all his Works and his VVorks praise him.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all honest hearted, who travell and are weary, and have found no Rest for your Souls, I say unto you, Arise, and come away, lye not groveling in the Earth, like Moles, nor seek not to know God in your fallen Wisdom; for the Well is deep, and if you know nothing but the old Wisdom, which is corrupt and natural, you cannot come to one Drop of the living Water; therefore dwell no longer among the Graves, and Tombs, where the unclean Spirits dwell, which trouble and vex all that pass in their Way, neither dwell among the Pits, where there is no Water; he is risen, he is not there, look upward, mind that which draws you from the Earth, the Covenant of Life is made manifest, <hi>Glory unto him in the highest</hi>; his Proclamation is, <hi>Ho, every one that thirsteth,</hi> come freely and receive of him freely, <hi>without Money or Price,</hi> or any thing of yours, or self; nay, self must be denied, and that you must deny if you will receive of him, that he may be all, and you nothing; for he gives freely, and his Gift is perfect and pure, without Spot, Stain, or Mixture; and all that receive his Gift, come by it to be presented perfect to the Father.</p>
                  <p>And this is making manifest to you also, who wait upon him, who is given for a Covenant of Light, and Peace, and Life, and all that receive this gift, shall come to hear glad-tidings, Peace on Earth, and Good-will to you, as you turn to the Light; and this shall be preached in you, by him who is the anointed of God, and the Messenger of the Covenant, and is sent to preach to the Spirits in Prison, and to open the blind eyes, and to set open the Prison Door, that the Prisoner may come forth, out of the Mire and Clay, to follow and wait upon him, who is the Rock of this Age, and all Ages, in which all the Fathers believed, and were justified, and did eat and drink of this Rock, and this Rock was and is Christ Jesus, the Light of the World, and hath enlightned every one that comes into the world with his true Light.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I say unto you who look after Righteousness, come hither,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40634:40"/>
who are weary, and I will shew you, where you may have true everlasting Rest, which he hath shed abroad in my Heart by his free Grace and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Love made manifest, after a long and a dark Night, in which I passed without a Guide, and so fell into the Pit, and stumbled, and then Sorrow and Trouble compassed me about on every side, as an armed man; but now hath he shed abroad his Grace in my Heart, which saves me from Sin, and leads out of the Works of Condemnation into his Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, where no unclean thing can enter; and this Grace hath separated me from Sin, and hath constrained me to deny my self, and follow him through the Death of the Cross, and through the Denial of all, both Country and Nation, Kindreds, and Tongues, and People, and from Wife and Children, and Houses and Lands, to publish his Name abroad contrary to my own will, and to make known unto you the Riches of his Grace, which all that wait in the Light of Christ Jesus shall come to see, and so you may see him whom your Souls love and long after, which hath long breathed after Refreshment, but none could speak a Word in Season to your Condition.</p>
                  <p>Return home again, ye that in your seeking have sought among the dead, and joyned your selves to Strangers, and have got nothing but a Husk, a Shadow, and live in a Dream; you are further off, in running out, and seeking in your earthly Wisdom and Comprehension, then you were before, and have got nothing but a Report of what Christ said, and did, and how they worshipped him; and so while your eyes have been without, you never found him, whom the Saints, and all that knew him, worshipped in Spirit, and witnessed him their Salvation in them, and was their Hope; and the Ground of their Hope was manifest in them; and he that manifested his Love in them then, and was their Redeemer, he changeth not, but is the same to his Seed forever: and all who wait in the Light of Christ, the Measure of God in you, this shall come to see.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, every one that thirsts, come unto Christ Jesus, who is near you, and wait to know his Word in you, which is in the Heart, which Faith comes by the Preaching of it in you, as you diligently wait, and keep your Minds unto it; and this which shews you Sin and Evil, is in you, and makes manifest all that you have acted contrary unto it; yea, even all that ever you have done, and will search your Hearts, and is the Eye that sees the Deceit in all its transforming in you; and it will let you see, it hath often checked and called, but you have not answered its Call, and so have chosen your own Way, and so have gone from the Way, which is the Light of Christ in you, and so you run into the broad Way; and that which desired after God hath not been nourished, and fed, but hath been famished, and another hath been fed, which now is for the Slaughter: But now as ye return home to within, to the true Light of Jesus, which is that one thing, which leads all men that own it, to be guided by it, you shall have true Rest and Peace.</p>
                  <p>Now Friends, there is something in man which must receive Christ, something of his own (learn what it is) which he comes to, and nothing can he joyn with, or be joyned unto, but that which is pure and undefiled; <hi>for the pure in Heart see God,</hi> and not the mortal Mind, that despiseth his Glory; for to that Mind that hunts abroad, he doth not reveal himself, <hi>that is</hi> Esau, <hi>the Blessing is nothing to him, nor that which the Covenant of God is

with, the Election he hates, and to him it is of no Price nor Value, that's the prophane Person, and</hi> Judas <hi>that betrayes him, selleth him for a Thing of naught, nor the Pearl is nothing to the Swine:</hi> Now read within every one, you that are painted with the Attire of the Harlot, trimmed and made beautiful in the Eyes of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> this is a small Thing to you and to that Seed which the Promise is to, and the Covenant established with, is trodden upon, and is famished in the Streets of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where Christ was and is slain, and his Witnesses suffer in the Streets, and none hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion; is this Thing nothing to you, all ye that pass by, to slight the Love of the Father, in sending his Son a Light to you? and him you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise; and as the <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To that of God in your Consciences I speak.</p>
                  <p>All therefore that see your Darkness that you live in, return home, and that which is low mind, the meek Spirit, and be not forward nor rash, but stand still in Quietness and Meekness, that the still Voice you may hear, which till you come down within, you cannot hear; for the loud Voices of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and Inchanters are so many, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Voice and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s is so loud; and you whose Minds are abroad, you thinks, as they thought, it's the Voice of God; but I say, be still, he shall not cry, nor lift up his Voice in the Streets, who you must hearken unto in you, that your Souls may live; and so be low and still, if you will hear his Voice, and wait to hear that speak that separates betwixt the precious and the vile, now that which you must wait in is near you, yea, in you, the Eye that seeth, and the Ear that heareth that is of the Lord; for that which is visible is natural and carnal, and the natural Ear cannot hear the Word of the spiritual God, for that which hearkens without, that Ear must be deaf, and that Eye blind: Now that which reveals the pure spiritual God must be in you pure and spiritual; <hi>For none knows the Things of God, but by the Spirit of God</hi>; and doth not <hi>his Spirit bear Witness alwayes unto their Spirits</hi>? and doth it not so now to all that know him? So in the Light wait, which comes from God, who is Light, and dwells in the Immortal Light, which the mortal Eye cannot behold, and it will lead you to know Christ, who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40634:41"/>
is Immortal, and not carnal, but spiritual and eternal; and as you love the Light, and keep your Minds inward, then you will hear the Motion of Christ Jesus in you; and so loving it, the Good you will come to see from God; which will lead out of Sin, and sanctifie you; and the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Year you will see, and the Day of Vengeance; and this is he whom the Father hath given for a Covenant, to bring Man out of the Alienation to himself again, and to reconcile man unto himself, even by the Blood of the Cross; and he who is the Light is the Covenant, and he who is the Covenant is the Light, for they are one in him; and this Covenant of Peace is tendered unto you who are afar off; and herein is the eternal Love of God made manifest to the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Greek,</hi> and the Life of his Son to be the Light of the World, and of men; and so in the Covenant of Life abide, and you will see he is near you, the Peace-maker, the Gift of God, which <hi>presents you perfect in himself to the Father,</hi> and this Gift is free, and offered freely to all that will receive it; and yet you cannot receive the Gift in your own Wills, but through the DENYAL OF YOUR OWN WILLS, for the Light is contrary to the Will; and so you will see the Will of the earthly man and God's Will contrary; and as you receive the Will of God, you deny your own Wills, and so do the Will of another, and another guides you and leads you, and this is God's alone Work, not of your selves, but wrought by Christ in his own Way and Truth; and so the Covenant of God comes to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished to the Seed, and the Foundation stands sure, and his Promise is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in you, as you come to witness the Seed which is one, in whom the Promise is fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>And Friends, thus must you wait to have Judgment set up within you, and this is he who is the Judge and the Light of the World; and so wait to see the Law set up within, which is added because of Transgression, to cut down, and the unjust destroyed in you, and the rebellious Nature yoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which hath had its Liberty in the earthly, where the Beasts of the Field dwell, and so it will come to decay, and the Law works Wrath upon the Deceit in you, which hath had the Preheminence; and so you will see the Thunder, as the Seal is opened, and the Earthquakes and Lightning, insomuch as you cannot behold and live; but the Transgressor and the Transgression, which is contrary to the Law, is cut down; and when there is a Time of great Sorrow, and great Trouble, and Tryal, and Temptation, wait in Patience in the Judgment, and let the Lord's Work have its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Operation in you; and so as you turn unto him that hath smitten and wounded you, he will bind up and heal; and give up all to the great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Lord, unto the Cross, all that which is discovered by the pure Law of God; and as the Earth comes to be plowed up, the Seed which is sown comes up, and the Rocks broken, the Water gusheth out, and so you will see some Promises will arise in you to the Seed which is comming up out of the Grave, and so the Love of God will appear in you, and you will be stayed, and see Hope in the midst of Calamity.</p>
                  <p>Then take heed that the Serpent get not that which is to the Babe, and so the carnal come to be exalted; but as you wait, you will see the Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Enemy; and Sin and Death rules till <hi>Moses,</hi> who was a faithful Servant in his House, and brings to the Law of God revealed in you, then Sin comes to be crucified, and to loose its Dominion over you, and in you,

and so you will see one brought forth under the Law, who fulfilled the Law, and now fulfils it in all those who walk after him in the Spirit, and fulfil not the Desires of the Flesh; and wait, and you will see some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies opened in you, and the Day-star in your Hearts, which leads to where Christ is, and Openings of the Inheritance which is to be received, and the Promise is to the Seed: And all wait in the Light, and keep in your Minds to it, and you will see <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry, the Water which wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and he is the Preparer of the Way; and turn to God, lest he smite the Earth with a Curse, and his Ministry breaks down the Mountains, and removes them, and makes a plain Way; and your Minds being turned to the Lord, and as you own the Gift of Christ given you, Repentance you will see unto Life, and then you will see something arising and shine in you, opening your Hearts, and there will be a Breathing after the Lord and his Righteousness; and standing in Obedience in the Cross, the Vail you will see rent, and you will see him that hath turned you from Sin by his free Gift made manifest in you, and he who is the Gift saves you from Sin; and so the Seals will be opened by the Angel of the Covenant and the Lamb: So all in Patience wait, and keep in the living Principle of Life, and things will open in you, even the dark Sayings of old; and that which spake Parables to the Serpent's Seed, will open the Parables to his own Seed, then you will see him whom you have pierced, <hi>even the Lamb who hath been slain since the Foundation of the World, and your Hearts will be broken, and Water will gush out of the Rock, and so Love will encrease in you, who abide faithful in your Measure, and the good and perfect Gift of God will be made manifest in you, and the Hope upon which the Soul comes to be anchored, will come to be witnessed, which Hope purifies the Heart</hi>; and as you stand in the perfect Law of Liberty revealed in you, revealed by the Spirit, which cuts down the Oppessor, and gives Liberty to his Seed, unto which the Covenant is and the Promises forever; and this Seed Christ took and takes upon him to redeem, even the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto whom the Promise was made; and so wait, <hi>that the pure Law of Righteousness, which is Life to the Righteous, and the Seed, may be set up, and you will see all chained under, and this binds and fetters the unclean Spirits, and shuts them up into utter Darkness forever.</hi>

                  <p>Now the Spirit of God is operative, and works a Change in the Ground, and translateth all that follow and hearken unto it into its own Nature, when all those things you so much strive about were but a Shadow; for the Word was in the Beginning, and gave Life, and is spiritual; and when it's known and witnessed within in the Heart, it separates from Death and gives Life to all that hear and believe in it: What Christ &amp; what Gospel is this you preach, which saves you not from Guilt and Condemnation? for the Word of the true Christ, where it is owned, cleanseth and takes away Sin; and blots it out, and destroyes the Root from whence it flows forth, and works a new Creation in Righteousness; and the Lamb of God takes away Sin, in which the Churches of Christ believed, and is Glad-tidings to all that do receive it; now none can witness Gladness of Soul where there is Guilt, which (you all affirm) is in every <hi>Christian,</hi> while in this World, and so you might see, that it's not the true Christ nor the everlasting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel you preach, but this you cannot bear; yet you say, he hath taken away your Sin; how much is Sin taken away? if you say, all, how comes the Guilt and Trouble that is in you? for if it be taken away, and his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice satisfied, this was to make God unjust, to charge it upon you again; but I tell you, when his Witness in your Conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth you, and manifests unto you, that you commit it, and reproves for it, I say, you cannot witness his Justice satisfied; for the Light is just, which is one with God, and when this condemns you, there is no God that will justifie you; but you use to say, It's all done in Christ; I ask, where, if it be not taken away? and unless you have the Witness of it in you, your Faith is vain; for he that believes hath the Witness in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which none hath, which walks contrary unto the Light, the pure Witness of Christ; for this convinceth you of Sin, and bears Witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you: Now shew your Witness within you, and your Assurance; I say unto you, while the Testimony of Jesus bears Testimony against you, it bears not Witness unto you, and so see your Confusion; but after you have believed in Christ (as you say) and have received all his Ordinances, if any thing after did judge you, and bring Trouble upon you, this you used to call a Temptation, and so put Light for Darkness and Darkness for Light; I say, there is no Guilt where Sin is taken away and crucified, but Peace and Rest in the holy God, who is unchangeable; and so his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is unchangeable, which judgeth and condemns the changeable; but you use to say, <hi>His Love is unc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Are not these Practices found in most of your Idols Temples, into which the Hirelings creep, and call a Church; and all those Practices among you are found, and we are ashamed of you and your Practices, that these things should be found among you, after so manifest an Appearance of the Lord's Wrath against them; and are these godly? to that in all your Consciences I speak: One haling, another beating, another punishing, and rending our Cloathes, and Prisons, and Revilings, and cruel Mocking, and false Accusing, and Stoning; are these God-like, or like God? Oh! be ashamed: And you that are so soon grieved, you are not God-like, who is long-suffering; and his Saints, who were God-like, did bear and forbear one another.</p>
                  <p>And these Parish Teachers, which you hold up in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I challenge them all in the Name of the Lord, who lives forever, that in all their publick Worship (as they call it) and them also, that they are not like God, not any of his Ministers, nor any thing that ever they practice: And therefore I say, Come forth and vindicate your Practice, and let your God come forth, and be tryed, and lay open your Practice and your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to the World, and stand by them if you can, and for shame never run to the Magistrates to help; you learned Rabbies, you great Orators, come forth, and stand and prove your selves before the People, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest your Strength and your weapons, and that God that answers by Fire,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40634:46"/>
let him be God; you have confessed our God answers by Fire, for its kindled among you, and the Word, which is Fire, we have declared, and many have heard it, and have believed, and answered it, and now it burns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you shall not be able to quench it; post and run as fast as you can, dig as deep for Counsel as Hell, call up all the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, you shall not be able to quench the Fire that is kindled, If we should hold our peace, the Stones of the Wall would cry out against you.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I say unto you, all you Parish Teachers, and all you that uphold them, arm your selves with all your Strength, call your Diviners together; for we proclaim in the Lord's Name (who hath rent the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and is come down, and his Tabernacle is with men) open War we declare, and sound the Trumpet of our God out of the holy Mountain, all the Earth shall tremble before him, and the Mountains shall melt before him, why should we not be discovered to you? we are sent forth to take Peace from the Earth, and to warn all to the Battel of the great Day of God; for now he is arisen in his Power and Glory, and his Kingdom is come, Glory unto him forever; and we are Witnesses of it, and it's not of this World; and we have denyed the World, and follow him who hath a Bow and a Sword, and makes War in Righteousness, and none is able to stand before him; therefore gather your selves on Heaps, O ye Potsherds, and make a Confederacy among the People, arm your selves, cast up your Mounts and Batteries, strengthen your selves, and trust in the Arm of Flesh, and say, <hi>None can come near us</hi>; Verily I say unto you, you shall be made level with the Ground, and all your Sorcery shall be laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and Anti-christ is discovered by the Brightness of the coming of Christ; our Eyes have seen the Lord of Hosts in his Glory, and all your Glory; ye Tellers of Dreams and Diviners, shall be made as a Dunghil, and your Renown shall perish from the Earth, the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
                  <p>And now a few Words unto you, O ye Heads and Rulers of the People in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who sit in Judgment; remember from whence you are raised, and how great Deliverance you have had, and how manifest the Lord hath appeared for you, to deliver you out of the Hands of your Enemies, who despised the Lord and all Righteousness, and they were numerous and great, when you have been in great Streights, and they said in their Hearts, <hi>We will swallow them up</hi>; and then the Lord in the Day of your Distress deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered you, and hath given you their Possessions, and Dominion over them, and hath setled you in Peace, and you that have been low hath he exalted to bear Rule, and expects from you Righteousness, Justice and Equity, and to be as Feet to the lame, and Strength to the weak, and to break off every Yoak of Oppression from the Neck of the poor and oppressed, and to relieve your Brethren, and entertain Strangers, remembring you were many of you Strangers in this Land, which now is given you to possess; I say, take heed unto your selves, how you act according to the Customs of the Nation and your own Wills, nor the customary Worship of the Nation, which the Lord laid by, and wasted and scattered all them that pretended themselves Teachers of the People; was there any of them that stood in the Gap, or turned People from their Iniquity, till the Lord
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40634:46"/>
broke out in his Wrath as Fire, and laid the Land waste, and the House of their God waste, which you burnt up; and will you now joyn with <hi>Moab</hi>? and will you build again those things which you have once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed? then you make your selves Transgressors; think not thus in your Hearts, that the Lord hath given you Dominion over the Nation, to walk after your own Wills, and joyn unto Deceit, and that you may establish those things again, which the Lord was wroth with; and if you hold up those by your Laws, and your Power, and your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and your Sword, which is the People of the Lord's Curse, I speak of the Teachers who are in <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Way, and greedy dumb Dogs, who can never have enough, and bestow the Nations Tythes, and Lands, and Riches, which is the Lord's Treasure, upon them, that they may cry up Deceit, and flatter you, both you and they will fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>And Friends, I am plain with you, the Hand of the Lord is against them, and all the Power of the Nations shall not save them from his Indignation: And therefore be wise, O ye Rulers, and do not you think to take Counsel against the Lord, and prosper, nor prescribe not the Lord a Way; for his Thoughts are not as your Thoughts, nor his Wayes as your Wayes; <hi>For he hath chosen the weak Things of this World to overthrow the Mighty</hi>; your Eyes have seen this without, and he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his Will to them and in them, whom you look upon but as weak things and base things, and in them he is making known his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power, to overthrow the World's Wisdom and Might, which is in the Fall and Curse, from whence all Heresies, and Blasphemies, and Sects, and Opinions flow and come forth, and he is bringing his own Work, his mighty Work to pass, even to overthrow and overturn all the Power of the Beast and the false Prophet, and shut them into the Pit, and the Decree is gone forth, and sealed, and shall not be altered, though all the Powers of Darkness joyn against him; and although you should make a Law, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, to take away the Life of Christ, yet it did but little avail them; for he hath carried on his Work through all Generations, notwithstanding all Opposition, and this is he in whom we trust; and do not you think that you are able to limit the Lord, by whom he must declare his Name, or how, or where, or in what time, but in his own VVay and Time; and if he command and will us, all mens VVills must be broken, though still the holy men of God suffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And if they were to depart from the presence of God, who fed nor the Saints, neither clothed them, nor visited them in prison, but were to depart with the Devil and his Angels into everlasting Fire; what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you, who instead of clothing encourage the people to rent them off us, and instead of feeding us, give Command to depart, because we are Stangers, and instead of visiting them in prison, you put them in

                  <p>And now, O ye Council at <hi>Dublin,</hi> your Order hath so gratified the Devil, and all the prophane in the Nation, that they judge your Order was not large enough, as that they had not Liberty to banish them who have been long Inhabitants in the Nation, and therefore they tell you their Readiness to fulfil your Orders upon this Account, and desire your Directions what to do further; yea, you have made all Lyars, Drunkards, cursed Speakers and prophane rejoyce, and have strengthned the Hands of the wicked, and so Judgment is turned backward, and Righteousness cannot enter; but all these things are recorded, and you shall one Day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what you have done.</p>
                  <p>And Friends, it's nothing to us; we lay down our Heads in Peace; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, if it had been done by them who had never professed any thing of Liberty of Conscience and Tenderness, it might have been born, but here your double Hypocrisie is made manifest.</p>
                  <p>Oh that ever you should be so led! but why do the <hi>Heathen</hi> rage, and the People imagine a vain Thing? for he will exalt his Son upon the Hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> and then wo unto them that have joyned their Power to uphold the Beast and the false Prophet; for all must go into the Lake together, where the Worm dyes not, nor the Fire goes out, to be tormented with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels forever.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I say unto you, Repent, and turn to the Lord, and seek Judgment and Righteousness, that so you may judge for the Lord, and break off all Oppression, and entertain the Strangers, who seek not yours, but the Good of the Nation, and that all people might know the Lord, and worship him in Righteousness, that so your dayes might be prolonged, in the Land, and the Lord of Heaven and Earth might rule over you in Righteousness, and that he alone might be exalted in the Nations, which hath not been known for many Generations, but only all have lived with the Name, without his Life and Power, in Deceit, and all Manner of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness, and the Lord is wearied, and will ease himself of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, and his Glory shall no longer be given to another.</p>

                  <head>A LAMENTATION FOR THE Scattered Tribes.</head>
                  <p>TO all you who profess the Name of our Lord Jesus in Words, and make mention of his Words, and of his Ministers Words, who had the everlasting Gospel and the Word of Reconciliation, and of those Practices which the Churches of Christ had in their Day committed unto them, after they were gathered out of the World, and had denyed it and its Nature, and were not comformable to it, but were changed in their inward man, and fruits of Righteousness were brought forth, and they were as Lights in the World, and did bear witness against the World, that they were evil, and said, <hi>they were of God, and had the Witness in themselves,</hi> and were bold to say, <hi>the whole World lay in Wickedness:</hi> To you, who are called separated Churches and Fellowships, under this or that Name, to you I write; my Soul pities you above the rest of the World; and in Love to those Desires which were once among you, I write; that so, if it be possible, you may come to see your selves, and the Foundation on which you stand, that those Desires which were after God begotten, may not wholly be slain, extinguished and betrayed, through the Subtilty of the Serpent, whose wayes are crooked, and whose Subtilty is great, to keep man under his Power.</p>
                  <p>This I have to say unto you, There was and is a Zeal in you, but not according to Knowledge; bear my Words, and judge that in your selves which would be angry: There was that which shewed you the National Way of Worship under <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which is one in the Ground and Nature that this was, the broad Way, and not according to the Mind of the Lord, neither was it according to Precept, nor the Practices of the Churches of Christ; which is clear from the Scripture: Now you seeing this was not accoding to Christ, nor his Ministers, nor the Churches, you began to separate from them into this or that Body, under this or that Name, as a Body separate from the World and their Worship, because you found in the Writings of that which is called the Gospel, People be gathered out of the World; now your Eyes being still without, you conformed to their Practices, as you judged both in matter and manner; and Practising those things which you read in the Scripture, that the Churches Practised; and so some Zealous did go forth and gather people together in this or that Form; and here was your beginning; and so here you set up your Rest, that you walk according to the most exact Pattern that is Visible or Written: yet since this you do not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40634:52"/>
agree, but are divided in your selves; one sets up this, and another that thing, which you in your Reason judge right: Now many things I might write unto you, which you cannot bear; but rather in Love a few Words, that you may see the vast Difference betwixt your Assemblies and Churches, and the Churches, which you say, is your Example.</p>
                  <p>And first of all, I will shew in the Ground how far you fall short, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may be you may hate my instruction, yet I say, Suffer me a little; for I am one who have obtained Mercy, after a long and a sore Travel, and tossed up and down in great Tempests, but at last entered into the everlasting Rest, and do not desire to contend with you; for out of Debates carnal I am brought; but rather in love to the Honesty in you all, which is not of this World, I speak.</p>
                  <p>First, they received Power from on high, and Commission given to preach the Gospel to all Nations, (I speak of the Ministers of Christ); and those things which they had heard, and seen, and felt, and tasted of, and had handled of the Word of Life, which Life was manifest in them, this they preached, and were sent to turn People from Darkness to Light, and from Satan's Power unto God's Power; and as many as received and believed the Word which they preached, which was the Word of Faith. and Faith was begotten by the Preaching of it, and they heard and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the VVord of Life; Faith came by hearing that VVord; and this VVord which they preached unto them, was nigh them, in their Mouth and in their Heart, which as People turned to it, and received it, and believed, so a Change was wrought in the Hearers of it; and they were turned from dead VVorks unto the Measure of the living God; and they separated from the Temple, and left Circumcision, and all those things of the first Priest-hood, which were commanded by God, and out of the VVorld's VVayes, Fashions, Customs and VVorships, and came to see the worshipping in Spirit and in Truth was that worship God required; and the Ground of their Separation was not from any literal Command or Precept; for all that was written there, was flat against it; but they which were Ministers of Christ, which had believed in him, preached him, the Substance, and the Measure of him and of his Grace which was in them unto whom they preached; and this was the Apostles Witness in their Hearts, unto which they did commend themselves in the Sight of God, which is a great Mystery; and they are not Ministers of the Letter, but of the Spirit: Now in these few words before written, with much more I could write, compare your Ministry and your Members gathered, and you will see you differ in the Ground in the first; for your Command you take from the Letter, and so are Ministers of the Letter, and not of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ye preach the Letter for the Word of Faith, which they did not, as is plain in their own Writings, without adding.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Them whom you gather, it's but into Conformity to the Letter, and to that which is visible, which all may be done in the Will of man, which is fallen from God; and see if it be not so with you, both Pastors and Members, not witnesses of that VVord which they preached, which did beget Faith in them that received it, and believed in it, which Faith was in them, wrought by the Power of God, which gave them Assurance, and their Assurance was in them, and their Hope in them, brought in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40634:52"/>
and wrought by the Operation of the Spirit; which the preaching of the Letter, Sound, or Declaration only of that which was in them, never works Assurance, nor true Faith, nor Hope: And now consider, where had your Ground of the Knowledge of God been, and your Gospel, and your Faith, and Hope, if you had not had the Letter? I speak not to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid you, but to the Light of Christ Jesus I speak, which will let you see how far short you are, and that you must come back again to the first Principle; and now you may see, if it had been the same Word or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it would have the same Effects as it had, and Change into its own Nature all that received it; now see whether a Change be wrought in you or not; some of you, yea, many running back after the Foot-steps of the Priests, preaching for Hire, and upholding the Idols Temple, if you can get into them, and in the Customs of the World; nay, most of you not come to yea and nay in your Communication, but one with the world in all or most of things, differ only in Words and Names; and your Gospel you have preached, hath not begotten such a Faith as was in them that had the Gospel; not to respect Persons; nor none dare own cleansing from Sin in the Body, but call that a Delusion; but the Word and Faith which they preached and received, gave them Victory over the World, Sin and Death, and by its Power made them more then Conquerors, and their Hope purified their Hearts; but you cannot believe that ever you shall be made free from Sin, nor have not hope in that, and therefore are ignorant of the Body of Christ you so much talk of, which made them clean and free from Sin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, your Doctrine is the same with the World; your Hope, your Faith, your justification is all at a Distance, grounded upon the Report of Christ dying at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and of their Report that knew him; and believing this, you call it Faith, and so are one with the Faith and Hope which the World hath; for the Report of Christ's Righteousness, what he did suffer, and wrought in the Saints, if this be the Ground of Salvation, then why have you separated from the World? If you say, <hi>Because the world hath not right to the Ordinances</hi>; I say, Doth not Faith in Christ give Interest to all his Ordinances? And if this be onely your Faith, the World hath as good an Interest as you; so why do you separate from them? And so you shall see the Matter is the same with the VVorld, of which your Fellowships consist: and the Name of Christ is a great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, which they were sent to baptize in, who knew his Name; his name is not Letters and Syllables, and using these; this with the lips speaking over, is not to baptize into his Name; And so Friends, in Love I spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k unto you: There was such as separated themselves, and were sensual, and had not the Spirit; and so there was no Difference betwixt them and the World; for they are Clouds without Rain; appeared VVells, but h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d no VVater in them, seemed something, but were but a Shew: Friends, your foot-steps I know, your ground I know, and your Compass and your Measure, yet I shall not glory over you, nor boast my self against you; but rather, to inform your Minds, that you may not build upon a Foundation which will moulder away: And now boast not your selves in your Ordinances, as VVater, bread and Wine, which is but elementary, and was never but a Sign; and in the Day of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Christ, the Elements shall melt with servent Heat; and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40634:53"/>
while you stand here, and have Confidence in these things, your Sun will set in Obscurity, and you shall know the old Heavens and Earth will pass away with a Noise; which when you come to know and hear, your Hearts will fail for Fear; for this I say to the highest of you, If you build upon any thing, or have Confidence in any thing which stands in time, and is on this side Eternity and Being of Beings, your Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation will be swept away, and Night will come upon you; and all your gathered in things, and taken on, and imitated, will all fail you.</p>
                  <p>Many more things I might write, time would fail me to utter; but these few among many, I have written, that you may compare your selves with the Ministers of Christ then; and the Gospel which they preached, which were separate from the World in the Ground and Nature; and if you see your selves in the Light of Christ in your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences not to be the same, neither in Matter nor Manner, let not a deceived Heart lead you aside any longer.</p>
                  <p>Further, I say, they were sent out for the gathering in of the Saints, some Apostles, some Prophets, some Pastors and Teachers; yet all was by the Spirit. Now if you deny the Command of the Spirit, or cannot witness it, but from the Letter take it up, and talk of it, because the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaks of it; then your Ministry is not that Ministry.</p>
                  <p>Again, this End was the Ministry sent forth for, for the perfecting of the Saints, which it did, which not one of you dare own, nor dare say your Ministry shall, nor never did; and so not the same, nor hath not the same operation; and so is not the same Faith nor Word which they preached.</p>
                  <p>And now to you who are called Members in all separated Societies, and yet in <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> spiritually so called, where the Seed is held in Captivity; I say, come forth of her, and return to your Maker, from whence you are erred, and cast off your Garments of Self-Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and those Coverings you hide your selves under, must all be rent; they will wax old; yea, your Heaven shall wax old as a Garment, and your Stars will fall, and your Towers will be demolished, and all your Buildings will fall; and your Strength will fail, and <hi>Egypt</hi> cannot save you; why gad you abroad? why trim you your selves with the Saints Words, when you are ignorant of the Life? return return to him that is the first Love, and the first-born of every Creature, who is the Light of the World, which Light will shew you, that to return back again is the Way from off the Mountains of Leanness and Poverty, where you feed upon Wind and Husks; and now return home to within, sweep your Houses all; the Groat is there; the little Leaven is there; the Grain of Mustard-seed you will see, which the Kingdom of God is like; and you will see from whence you have erred, from the true Shepherd Christ, the Light of the World, who hath enlightened you with his Light, which Light will shew you Sin, and let you see what rules in the Mind and Heart, which Light will let you see the Way out of the World, and will judge Sin in you, and bind it, and give you Power over it, and this is the true Shepherd; and if you say, you love him, manifest your Love unto him, by following his Light revealed in you, which leads into the true Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Sin unto the Lord, to see his Presence near you, who will guide you with his Eye; the Light is the Eye of the Body; and here you will

see your Teacher not removed into a Corner, but present, when you are upon your Beds, and about your Labour, convincing, instructing, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, correcting, judging, and giving Peace to all that love and follow him; therefore haste I say, come away, while the Lord is near at Hand, while his Grace shines with you; &amp; he waits, and hath waited long to be gracious; and you have kept him out so long, his Locks are bedewed with the Drops of the Night; his Spirit shall not alwayes strive, that that checks and strives against Sin is it, in Love follow it, let it lye in your Bosom Day and Night, make it your Comapanion; I pity you, I pity you, my Bowels are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for you, I am pained for the Seed's sake; therefore all slight not this Love, quench not the Spirit, put not that which reproves Sin away, own it, that Sin may be seen, and the Man of Sin may be revealed by the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ, whose Coming is as Light shines from East into the West, discovers all dark Pathes, and the twining of the Serpent, and the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wayes of the old Dragon by this Light; and if thus you wait, you will see the day revealed in you which the Scripture speaks of, which shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all things, and make manifest the hidden things of <hi>Esau,</hi> who hunts abroad, and is a Man of the Field, whose Mind is abroad; and you whose Minds are abroad, hunting after savoury Meat, to please the Flesh withal, you are of his Birth, you will be laid waste, and the Mount in which you dwelt: Therefore all prize your time and your Visitation; if you will return, come, that he may heal your Backsliding, and receive you; if you resist the Light, Misery will be your End, and you will lye down in Sorrow.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>This have I written in Love to all your Souls, who am one who did drink of the Cup of Fornication, and have drunk of the Cup of Indignation, but now drink the Cup of Salvation, where Sorrow and Tears are fled away, and yet am a Man of Sorrows, and well acquainted with Grief, and suffer with the Seed, and travail, that it may be brought forth of Captivity,</p>

And as for that you call your Supper and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which is but carnal and earthly, you have none of you the form; one of you is for eating before Supper, another after Supper, another for as much Bread and Wine as you can eat and drink; and so your God is your Belly, and you mind earthly things; and instead of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of Christ's Death, you crucifie him afresh, one with lust, another with envy, another with Pride; and so instead of coming to the Table of the <hi>Lord,</hi> you feed at the Table of <hi>Devils,</hi> and nourish the flesh, deceit and uncleanness; and as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> resisted <hi>Moses,</hi> by making likenesses, so do you resist the Spirit of the <hi>Lord,</hi> because it comes not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your carnal Will, nor your vain Conceptions; and so deceit leads you all, and the Cross of Christ you know not, and those things you have formerly declared against, you now take up; some pretend send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to preach, and take Tythes, others crying out against them in Words, and yet uphold them, and pay to the Priests, whom you say are

if thou regardest Iniquity in thy Heart, all is Abomination to the Lord; therefore keep unto this, and it will shew thee Sin and Evil before thou commit it; and as thou standest in the Counsel of the Light, thou standest in the Counsel of Christ; and his Power preserves thee, for the Light is Power; all that hearken not unto another are preserved out of Sin &amp; Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Pollution, and see an overcoming by the Power of Christ which is present; and here is a Guide to all your Minds, who have wandered here and there, and have found nothing; here you come to know the Doctrine and Teaching of Christ, which leads into all Truth all that believe in it and receive it; and so it will change you out of Pride and Wantonness, out of Covetousness &amp; Earthly-mindedness, and from Sin it will lead you, and from the Pathes of Unrighteousness into Righteousness, which is the pure Path of the Lord, which all come to enjoy Peace in, who walk in it; but the Cross of Christ must be taken up daily, or else you cannot walk in the Way of the Lord: And so to the Cross all come, and to the Yoak, that you may see the wild Nature bound under and limited, and your vain Thoughts judged out, and you may come to see the straight Way, where no Lyar can enter, nor no ravenous Beast, nor no unclean, but they come all to be kept out: And so as you love your Souls and the Way of the Lord, mind the Witness of Christ in you; and if you go from it, and despise it, it will follow and pursue you, and you shall never know Peace; while you stand in Disobedience to the Grace of God and the free Gift of God, you can never see Redemption, nor know God's Power, which he gives unto all that receive him; and you cannot receive his Gift, but self and self-will must be denyed; and so the Will of Christ, which is the Will that wills in the Light, and works in the Light, and reveals Sin by the Light, and declares Righteousness through the Light; and here the coming of Christ comes to be seen, and his Day comes to be known, which <hi>Abraham</hi> saw; but through Death this comes to be read and known: And so turn all to this here, the Word you will hear, which is pure and powerful; it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates, as you hearken unto it, and divides between the precious and the vile in you all who love it; and it's nigh thee, in thy Mouth and in thy Heart, and discerns thy Thoughts; and here thou wilt learn, as thou waitest in Patience of the Son, in whom the Father is well pleased; and if thou hearkenest to any other, it's the false Prophet, which leads thee to Error, and so the Displeasure of God will come against thee forever, until thou return: Blessed is he that hears, receives, considers and prizes the Offers of Grace and the Day of God's everlasting Love, and owns the Gift of God in him revealed, which leads to Repentance, and works a Change in the Heart and Mind of all that believe in it, and gather up into its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all that wait in Diligence, and believe in it; and so the Day of Redemption comes to be seen and known, out of Death, out of the grave, and Immortality comes to be brought forth, and Incorruption comes to be put on; and they that witness this can truly say, we have found him whom our Souls love, and do not look for any other.</p>
                     <q>Blessed is he that hears and considers, and waits to be made Partaker of God's Righteousness revealed, that Justifies all that receive it, and believe in it, &amp; they by it come to be Pillars in the House of God forever, &amp; follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes, where pure Peace is enjoyed forever and ever.</q>

                  <p>Because they have asked Counsel, and not at the Lord, and taken Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and not at the holy One; therefore Violence is set up as an Ensign, and Wickedness runneth down as a River, and Cruelty and Oppression as a mighty Stream, the whole Earth is full of Folly and Madness, and all the People thereof are degenerate and grown out of the Image of God into a monstrous and strange Nature; the Prophets are all Fools, the Diviners thereof are mad, and they being degenerate themselves from the Life of God, have led them into further Blindness, Darkness, Ignorance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and have made the Word of Truth of none effect through their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and have taught for Doctrine the Precepts of Men, and the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of them who are out of the Faith, and out of the Life, and out of the Power of God; and the Counsellors they have established Wickedness by a Law, they themselves being estranged from the Life of God; therefore Violence is broken forth into the Earth as a Flood: And now all Kings, Rulers and Potentates of the Earth, who have given their Power to the Whore, who sits upon many VVaters, and the VVaters are Kindreds, Tongues, People and Nations; yea, all Nations have been drunk with the Cup of her Fornication; and being all gone forth from the Life which

the Beast, and the false prophet, all have acted from that power, which is below the Truth, and below the Life, which power is at Enmity against the Truth and the Life, and against the Light; and this power overspread all nations, the Sun being set, night came over all, and the shadow of death over all Nations, and a Vail and a Covering hath been spread over all; and so out of the midst of thick Darkness all have acted this long and dark Night of Ignorance in the Apostacy, wherein the Dragon hath had power, and the Beast, and that power hath been admired and set up, which hath transgressed the Life; so that any who have been zealous for the Truth, and have kept the Testimony of Jesus, and the Spirit of prophecy, the false prophets in all Nations, who are from the Testimony of Jesus, have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Beast, to slay, and to kill, and to destroy the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which is clothed with the Sun; and so the Beast exercising his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is from below, hath killed and destroyed them who were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher power.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer thus, the Cardinals, Jesuites, and other Romish Priests had a Law made to protect their Idol, the Mass, and if any spoke to him that was sacrificing to the Image or Idol, then three Months Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but now if any declares against the Image that the Priests of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have set up, every one is to pay five Pound, or six Months Imprisonment in a House of Correction, and there be tortured, and whipt, and shamefully intreated, near to the Loss of Life; nay, it's now so much the more hotter now then ever.</p>
                  <p>None must come near the House of their Idol God or Image, but must be counted a Breaker of the Peace; nor speak to a deceiver, and say he is so; nor a Hireling, and say he is so; nor to a covetous Priest, and say he is so, and can for proof bring half of his Parish to witness the Truth of this; but if he speak the Truth never so clear, he must to Prison, or pay five Pound, or the House of Correction, and there be whipt, and stocked, and fettered, and chained and tortured; and so ti is manifest, that those Magistrates, who had a Hand in making of this Law, have outstript the Magistrates in the time of <hi>Q. Mary,</hi> when the Pope had Power in his height in these Nations.</p>
                  <p>And the Priests now, in these Nations, who have set up their Image of many Mixtures; and one Year they make one, and another Year ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what that Power likes the best, that is gone out of the Life and Power of God, that they present to the Authority of the Nation as an Image of a more comely Stature then the former, and then Authority mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And now they have manifested themselves to have no Faith, and to be without Faith, and are unagreed upon it; instance that which is called the <hi>humble Petition and Advice,</hi> presented to O.

ever they who should profess Godliness, should so shame themselves and all their Teachers; for the teachers are not agreed yet of their Faith, so they have either no Faith, or else many Forms which are feigned, and in this they are not yet agreed; and so being out of the true Faith, in which the Saints had Fellowship, in the unity of the Faith, they are all in Distraction and Confusion, Head and Tail in the Jarr, in the Strife about Words, and a form of Words: And how many Confessions, and Forms, and Images are there set forth, and people still Ignorant of the Mystery of Faith, which is held in a pure Conscience, and want that which is the <hi>Evidence of things not seen,</hi> and want that which should let People see him who is invisible?

                  </p>
                  <p>And what if all people in all Nations were constrained under a Penalty to hold such a Form of words, and to consent to such a Confession? Doth this any more but make Hypocrites, when a man is not first perswaded of those things in his mind by the Spirit of Truth? Is this any more, but Feignedness? How long hath the God of this World blinded the Eyes of People, whole Cities, Towns, and Countryes, because they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a formall Confession, made by a Priest, who is out of Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in the Steps of the false Prophets, and in the Practice of the false Apostles and deceitfull Workers; and when they have made a <hi>Confession,</hi> of a <hi>Catechism,</hi> as they call it, and have gotten over the Words, and can say them over, now judge they have Faith, and are sound <hi>Christians,</hi> when they are Ignorant of the first Principle or of Faith towards God, and so are carried on in the Mist of Darkness and Ignorance, and know not yet Repentance from dead Works.</p>

                     <p>And hence it is that there are so many several Laws, Ordinances, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, Traditions and Customs among Men in many Nations, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Regions, one differing from another, and Heaps of Confusion, that hardly in any Nation, or few in a Nation know what is Law, there is so much Variableness and Changeableness amongst the Law-makers, one while setting up, another while pulling down; and as Deceit advanceth it self in any particular Ruler, then there must be a Law made, and a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty upon the non-performance, as <hi>Death, Banishment, Torturing, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Racking, Imprisonment, Fining,</hi> to the utter Destruction of many; and all the Ground of this is, because the Rulers are gone from that of God in themselves, and then act in their own Wills, and by their Craft and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which stands in the Ground which is cursed, and call this <hi>Christian Policy and Wisdom,</hi> and Cruelty becomes a Law, and the Devil keeps his Dominion in the Earth, and Deceit gets a Cover, and hides it self.</p>
                     <p>Now it was not so from the Beginning; for as God is one, and his name one, his Law is one, which is pure, equal and unalterable, and endures forever and ever; now Man being made in God's own Image answered the pure Law of God, and being God's Image was one with the Law, and the Law was not against him, but was his Life and Joy, and he had Power to obey it, for he was of its own nature; for as God is pure and holy, and the Image which he brought forth Man in was pure and holy, and that which was Man's Guide and Rule was pure and holy; here was Unity and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and he that created, and Man that was created, were in Unity, and then there was no Wo, no Condemnation, no Sorrow, no Death, no Tribulation, Anguish nor Wrath, revealed against Man, who was the Image of God, and he stood in the Dominion of God, and had Dominion over that which was contrary; here was no Tyranny, here was no Cruelty, no Prisons, no Envy, no Persecution, no killing nor destroying, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40634:71"/>
no Jar, no Strife, no devouring, but all God's Creation at Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Man at Unity with God, being Partakers of his Dominion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the Earth was in Order, and in that Wisdom which changed not; and here Man had Dominion and Power, and ruled in God's Authority, and was guided by the higher Power, and while he was subject to it, Death had no Power over him; now this was before Sin entered, and before Death entered, and before Enmity had appeared in the Earth, but now was the Lord King, Law-giver and Judge, who ruled in Righteousness, and man being subject to him, there was no Law against him, nor no Guilt of any Thing; for Transgression was not known in the Earth, and there was no Curse, but all was in Unity and Peace, no Changeableness, but all was in the Covenant, all the Workmanship of his Hand was united unto him, and all that he had made was blessed, and all the Creation were Partakers of his Blessedness, and all stood in the Covenant, by which every Creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Power, Virtue and Dominion; here was one Mind, and here was no double, no Variation, no Mutation nor Change, but the Dominion of the everlasting God was felt, which endures forever and ever; and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thing was not seen in the Earth, but man crowned with Honour, Dominion and Dignity, wherein could be nothing but rejoycing and pure Peace and Joy; now no Evil was known, neither was there any such thing, but Goodness possessed the whole Earth, and Righteousness breathed forth it self in all Things in the Circumference thereof, and all the Works of his Hands pleased him, and Man made Partaker of his Pleasure, and was accepted and not rejected: Thus in Part I have shewed unto you the State of the Earth, and of Mankind, and the Glory of God's Creation, and the Blessedness thereof; but if I could declare unto the whole World, from Years End to Years End, I should fall short, and Words would be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to express the Felicity &amp; Happiness in which Man was brought forth, neither shall any be able to see into those Things, or to declare certainly of those things, who come not beyond time, to him who is eternal, who gave them a Being.</p>
                     <p>But after man had taken of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and had eat of the Fruit thereof, and consented to the Beguiler and to the Serpent, Sin entered, and Death by Sin, man lost his Dominion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came subject to another, and another had Power over him; and now the Course of Nature was set on the Fire of Hell, the Curse entered, and man dead while he lives; and in that Day he eat did dye, and Death breathed forth it self in the Earth, and <hi>Cain</hi> is brought forth in his own Image, to wit, in the Image of him who was gone out of God's Dominion, and he became a Murderer, and slew him that was accepted of God; and here appeared now the Enmity, and its Life was to destroy, and to murder, and to kill <hi>Abel,</hi> who believed and offered up a Sacrifice, and <hi>Cain</hi> offered in the Unbelief, and was not accepted; so <hi>Abel</hi> who was Just lived by Faith; but <hi>Cain</hi> who was in the Envy and in the Wrath, this Life was Death to him and to his Nature; and so all who are out of the Faith are dead while they Live.</p>
                     <p>Now after the Transgression, in Process of time, when the Seed of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len <hi>Adam</hi> began to increase in the Earth, being driven out from that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord, they spread over the whole Earth, and sought many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, being gone from that of God in themselves, by which they were
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40634:72"/>
united unto him, having broken his Covenant, and joyned in Covenant with Death, Death acts forth it self against the Seed, which is not of its Nature, and alwayes sought to imbondage it, and to kill it, as <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Esau Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Ishmael</hi> did unto <hi>Isaac</hi> and unto his Seed.</p>
                     <p>Now the Seed unto which the Promise was, received the Law from the Mouth of the Lord; and they that persecuted the Seed invented and made Laws of their own, according to that Nature in which they lived, and so became <hi>Heathenish</hi> in their Fashions, Laws and Customs, and Cruelty grew up as it was nourished, and leavened into its own Nature, and Unbelief grew into a mighty Stature, and Monsters were brought forth in such a strange Shape in every thing that the Enmity did appear in, as had not been seen in the Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h before; and so man being gone astray from the Life of Righteousness, every thing is abominable, and of a stranger Nature that he brings forth; yet take notice of this, that as the Seed unto which the Promise was, who were in the Faith, and obeyed through Faith, they had a Law, so they in Unbelief had also a Law; as the Seed worshipped the living God, through a lively and a living Faith, and so sinned not in so doing, the Seed of the Serpent imitated a Worship, and worshipped in Death and Unbelief; and as the Laws of one were equal, such as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the other were unequal, such as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam</hi>; and as the one set up Equity by a Law, the other made a Law to set up Iniquity.</p>
                     <p>And the Seed sought not their own Honour, but the Honour of him who was their Reward; but the Seed of the Evil-doer sought himself and his own Honour; and as the Spirit of the Lord breathed forth it self, and spoke the Truth in the Power of God, Deceit uttered forth Lyes in Hypocrisie, and in the Power of Death; and as the upright lived unto God in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Deceit lived unto the Flesh, and unto him who hath the Power of Death, which is the Devil; and as they fulfilled the Law of God, who were led by the holy Spirit of God into all Truth, the other followed their own Imaginations, and answered the Deceit and foolish Mind, and they whose Understanding was darkened loved them, and had Pleasure in them.</p>
                     <p>So it may be truly said, <hi>Many Nations, Rulers and ruled sit in the Region of the shadow of Death, and the living God is forgotten among them, and one against another, they are seeking one anothers Ruine, and all in the Violence and in the Cruelty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore all Rulers and Potentates of the Earth, Magistrates and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours under the whole Face of Heaven, hearken unto the Words of my Mouth, and listen unto Understanding, that you may be Partakers of the Happiness and Felicity which God is shedding abroad now in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he who is the desire of all Nations may be revealed among you.</p>
                     <p>He which must restore is not born of man, nor cometh not to a People or a Nation in the Will of man, neither seeks he himself, but the Glory of the Father, who hath sent him to seek and to save that which is lost, and to heal the Breaches, and to destroy that which hath made the Breach, that so all Nations who receive him, and believe in him, may be reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and one to another, that the Earth may enjoy Rest, and the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Quietness; therefore all be warned not to look forth in your Wills; for there you will not receive him, but slight him, as many before you have
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40634:72"/>
done, and so lye down in Sorrow, and weary your selves in Vanity, and lye down in Infamy, and never come to see his dignity.</p>
                     <p>Now he of whom I declare unto you is the Son of God, who is the Light of the World, and the Life of Man, and hath lightned every man that cometh into the World, which Light, wherewith all men are enlightened, is not contrary to the Law of God which indures forever, but one with it, and this will let you see Violence, Treachery, Murder, Envy, Wrath, Maliciousness, Drunkeness, Whoredom, Lying, Cursed speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Stealing, Defrauding, Cheating, Cozening, Riotousness, Pride, Arrogancy, Emulation, Contention, Strife, Hatred, Persecution, Cruelty &amp; Oppression; I say the Light which comes from Christ, by whom the World was made, will shew you that all these things is Sin and evil in the sight of God, and also will let you see there is a ground from whence these, and all other evils, proceed, which ground is in all the Sons of men, in the Transgression, till it be removed, and these things before mentioned, be the fruits that grow from it, and bud forth themselves in all Nations, and in every man, in every Nation; so the Earth is filled with Violence, and the Grapes are as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Fruit as <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> whom God overthrew, and till these things be done away, and these fruits wither, and the root from whence they arise be removed out of every particular man who is a Ruler, he cannot be a Blessing to a Nation, neither rule for God in a Nation, neither will he, or can he be a Terrour to all these things before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>While he himself is in those; for he cannot destroy his own Life, neither will Iniquity set up Righteousness, nor the Worker of Iniquity advance Christ.</p>
                     <p>Therefore listen to the words of my Mouth, and despise not Counsel, lest you perish among Fools, and go down to the horrible Pit, where there is everlasting Misery unto all Perpetuity.</p>
                     <p>Now God that made both Heaven and Earth, and all things that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are, he is Light, and with him is no Darkness at all, he never changes his Purity, nor alters his righteous Decrees, his Eye is pure, and alwayes fixed to behold all the Works of the Sons of men, and he search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the Heart of man with his eye, and pierceth through the secret places, and is near to every man, although man do not see him, he is invisible, and eternal, and his Law indures forever, and the unalterable decree, by which Sin is judged and reproved in the World, and in every particular man; and every man who hearkens and hears the Words of the pure Law, which judges all Sin in man, receiveth the Sentence of Death in himself, and is judged by the righteous Words of his Mouth; and so Sin in the particular comes to be condemned, and all these changeable things are trodden under foot, which are acted and brought forth from the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mind of man; and so all Laws, Constitutions and Decrees, which are made in the Will of man, come to be thrown down by his righteous Law, which proceeds out of the Mouth of the righteous God, who is Light; and so as his unchangeable and unalterable Decree comes to be set up in every particular Ruler and Governour, and himself judged with the just, he comes to bear his rule for the just, and answered that which is just in every man, and no longer can he act against well doing, but is a Leader, and an Incourager of it in all; and is a terrour to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40634:73"/>
and so comes to know the Dominion again which man lost through Disobedience and Transgression.</p>
                     <p>Now all you Powers of the Earth, wait, that you may come to see that, and feel it revealed in your selves, to wit, the Law of God from the Mouth of God, that so you following it, Sin may be judged in your selves; and you come to know the one Lord, the Lawgiver, which leads man back out of Sin and Transgression by his Son, whom he hath sent into the World, that all men through him might believe in the Father, and be restored out of Sin and Transgression unto Life eternal, where Death hath no Entrance: And so all who wait upon the Light of the Son of God, and are obedient to it, they come to feel his Power and his Decree, which cannot alter its Property or Verity; and all who come to be guided by it, you will come to see that which unites you unto God, and one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another, in the Covenant of God: Oh! that all your Eyes were opened, that you might see that which belongs to your Peace and the well-being of all Nations, that so the Power of the Flock might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed among you; and this I speak unto you, a Change must be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed in your selves, before you will cease acting in the changeable Mind; now the time draws near, the Lord will try you; for the Earth must be lest without Excuse, and he will have all warned, for God will no longer be limited; and therefore take heed how you gainsay any or resist any, who may declare unto you the Counsel of God, and cause them not to be persecuted or hurt; but all be calm and moderate, and learn Wisdom from above, from him who hath enlightned you, that you may come to deny your selves, and follow him who condemns all Self-actings and Self-will in man, and all Customs, Laws, Worships and Traditions, that are made in the Will of man, that so he unto whom all Power is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted may be feared, and worshipped in Spirit, in Life, Truth and Righteousness, that so all Sedition, Rebellion, Treachery and Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness may be cleansed out of the Earth, and that all quarreling, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, contention may end, and people come out of that which the sword is against, that so the Swords may be beat into Plowshares, and the Spears into Pruning-hooks, that so Violence may be done away, and Cruelty swept out of the Nations, that the Dominion of God may be set over all, and his Truth advanced above all, that the Kingdoms of the World may become the Lord's, and his Christ's; and blessed are they that stoop unto his Scepter, who judges the Nations in Righteousness, and the people with Equity, who is the Salvation of all his people for evermore, and a hiding Place in the day of Trouble.</p>

                  <p>IN Times past, in the Night of Ignorance, when Men groped in the dark as blind Men, since the Apostles Dayes, and out of thick Darkness have spoke darkly of the Things of God and of his Kingdom, and written many things about the Things of God and of his Kingdom, which have fed the dark Minds of many, who are unconverted unto God: And seeing how many People are confused in their Minds, and err in Judgment, and have lost the Key of Knowledge, which should give an Entrance into the Mystery of God's Kingdom, and open their Hearts; therefore in Compassion unto them who are thirsting after the Lord to find him, these few Things I was moved to write for the sakes of those who have no Place to rest in or upon, to the Intent, that all may wait in that through which God reveals his Mind, and manifests his true Knowledge in Man; and these Things that I have written, as they were revealed to me and in me by his pure Spirit, if thou waitest in the Manifestation of the Spirit, these Things thou wilt see to be Truth, though hid and vailed from the World that lyes in VVickedness, as thou comest out of its Nature: I have not written for to please Men of corrupt Minds, who glory in VVords and outward Appearances, and glory in natural Parts and in Sounds, and are erred from the Life; but to the simple-hearted, and for the strengthening of the weak, and for the understanding of the simple; and that which thou seest in the following Discourse which thou canst not close with, let it alone, and judge nothing before the Time, in thy Wisdom that is earthly, or in thy Reason; but in that, and to that of God in thee, I desire to be approved, and to nothing else, and shall be made manifest in the day of the Lord, that is dawning in the world, and many have seen it to appear in Power and Glory; wait thou in thy own particular, that thou may'st feel thy own Condition, and see thy own State; and that which lets thee see thy own Condition, will let thee see the Lord, and what I have declared of him to be true.</p>

Answer ye wise men, and ye litteral <hi>Rabbies,</hi> if that which shews sin and Temptations be not sufficient, then declare you, and let us see your skill in the Mysteries of God; but to return unto them, in whose Minds there is a Desire to be informed, seeing then that God's free grace, which is his pure Appearance, hath so far manifested it self, or God through it shews sin, and teacheth from sin, that which teacheth from sin is holy, and that which leadeth from worldly Lusts is pure, and that which saves from sin is grace, which is saving in it self; <hi>and God hath so loved the World, as that he hath sent his Son into the World</hi>; and he was and is the Light of the World, and hath shed abroad his grace, and hath made it appear to all; and all that wait upon it, and come to be taught by it, feel its Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; so all are left without Excuse: Therefore wait in that which hath appeared in thee, that which shews the Lusts, and Thoughts, and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto sin, this is God's gift, God's grace, this is sufficient, though all men in the World say, it is not sufficient, yet this makes not my Faith void; neither thine who hast received it; but thou hast the Witness of thy Faith in thy self, which giveth pure and perfect Feeling of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit of the Lord; and all are to wait within, to hear him who condemns sin in the Flesh within, which by his grace shews man his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression and Insufficiency in himself, and by the Word of his grace saves all them that believe in it out of Sin, and giveth Dominion over Sin; and this comes to be revealed in the Heart of man, and there must it be waited for in that which is pure, that it may be received, and there the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it comes to be known, and its Vertue partaken of by all that do believe in it, and receive it, and are subject to it, they see and feel God's Salvation revealed through it to their Souls, and know where their Strength lies, not in self-acting, but in the free Gift of God, the Gift of Righteousness, the righteous Gift, by which Justification cometh upon all that believe.</p>

                     <p>Therefore my Bowels and Heart are more open in this unto all, because many have erred for lack of Knowledge, and have wandred aside, because they have not found a true Guide: Therefore in dear Love unto all upon the Face of the Earth, where this may come, I write and let out my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som into this thing, that they may also be Partakers with me of the free Love of God, and the free Grace of God, by which I am saved, and know the Wall which is Salvation, and the Gates which are Praise, which the Saints are compassed about with, and entered in at; and for the sake of such who thirst after God and the Knowledge of him, I write for their Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and not to satisfie critical men, nor them who are in the Philosophy and vain Deceit, who are swollen big in their fleshly Understanding, and puffed up in their earthly Minds; for by such I desire not any Testimony, neither Acceptation.</p>

That Grace of God which brought Salvation,</hi> which had appeared, and doth now appear to all men, which taught them self-denyal, to deny worldly Lusts, and also to live godly, or like unto God in this present World, and now doth the same; is not this sufficient to believe in, and sufficient to save?
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40634:85"/>
Now I do not say but there is a greater measure let out unto them that are converted unto God, then is to them that are convinced of their Evil by the same Grace, yet still it is one and the self-same thing; one Gift, yet a greater Measure of one and the same pure Vertue and Power which is given to them that obey the Life, which is already made manifest by its Appearance unto all.</p>
                     <p>Object. But some will be ready to say, <hi>that this is Errour, and that which is contrary to the Scripture, and to orthodox Teachers, that the Grace which is saving, is near all men, and hath appeared to all men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that I answer, Though grace be saving in it self, even the grace that hath appeared to all men, and may be truly called <hi>saving grace,</hi> yet to them that believe not in it, neither are taught by it, it convinceth and shews Evil, and checks and judges for it; yet there is no Variation nor Change in the Gift of God, but as it worketh upon different Objects; for Faith and Unbelief are two different things, as Light and Darkness are different; and so the Word of his Grace is the <hi>Savour of Life unto Life,</hi> (that is to say) unto them that believe, and is the <hi>Savour of Death unto Death,</hi> unto them who are in the Unbelief, who indeed are dead while they live, yet here is the same Grace, and the same Word of Grace, yet here are different O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations; so <hi>the Lord killeth and maketh alive,</hi> yet the same Lord; the Spirit convinceth of Sin, and reproveth for Sin, and also consolates and comforts; here is <hi>Diversity of Operations, yet the same Spirit,</hi> which never alters.</p>
                     <p>Object. But further, some may say, <hi>If that it be saving Grace, or at least a degree, and a Measure of saving Grace, that hath appeared to all men, then how is it that all are not saved by it.</hi>

your Worship dead, Heaven rains not on you, the Bottles are stopped, the Dew falls not on you, you wither daily, as a Stick without Sap? what, have you found that which will last unto Perpetuity? Oh! nay, it's rusted already, it's cankered already, it's moth-eaten already, it's fading, the Glory is staining, the Renown of all earthly things is fading, and all terrestrial Appearances, though never so glorious, they are all to cease; a Consumption is coming, Blasting is near, there will be no more Glory in these things; they will fly away as a Shadow when the Sun arises, your Riches are wasting; when will ye seek after that which endures forever? I pitty you who have had Breathings after God, and have sate down at Ease in that which is not eternal; be warned, return home, consider, see what Corruption thou hast Power over now, which had once Power over thee; dost thou rest in that Faith, that thou shalt never be cleansed here? that Faith is curst, it's reprobate, it's rather properly Unbelief; it's not the Faith of God's Elect, by which they were sanctified, and overcame the wicked One in themselves by the Power of Christ, who is able to save, and manifest his Ability in all them that believe in the Light, which they are enlightened withal, through which he manifests himself to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and makes known his Power in the Creature, to redeem the Soul out of Death, and to redeem the Creature from under the Bondage of Corruption, to serve him in the free Spirit of God, in which the Sons are made free from Sin, from the Act and Guilt, they become the Temples of the holy Ghost; how far you are from this many of you consider, who are yet Temples of Uncleanness, and a Habitation for many noisome Lusts; repent, and mind that which empties you of your Thoughts and Conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, that you may know Poverty of Spirit, that the Kingdom may come unto you, and be yours in Possession, else you are everlastingly miserable; and this is the true State of many of you, own it, and repent, that if it be possible, you may find a Door of Mercy yet opened unto you, and that you may enter in thereat; for it is not setting up and conforming to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Practice without that will justifie you (while that which is in the Transgression, and hath transgressed the Life, and hath disobeyed the Light in your Consciences is Head in you, and above the pure) that will not recommend you unto God, neither can you have any Access or Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with God in that State, till you come out of the Waters, upon which the Whore sits, which are unstable and boisterous, and reel to and fro, and unsetled, which are all to be dryed up, and all the Springs cut off that nourish; and you must come to the Rock, before you know any thing that will endure, to build upon, which Rock is Christ, who abides for ever; but you are all gone from that which should give the Knowledge of him in your selves, and do not retain him in your Knowledge, neither that which gives the Knowledge of him, the Light of his Spirit, which shineth in your Hearts, making manifest in your Hearts the Intention of your Hearts, when Motions unto Evil do arise; this must you all come to, before God's Salvation or Redemption you come to know in your selves, or have the Witness of God's holy Spirit, without which there is neither Seal, nor Evidence nor Assurance enjoyed or felt of the Love of God: The Time of restoring is come, and many are restored again into God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and are delivered out of the Jaws of Death, and feel him who is the Healer of the Nations, and the Restorer of the desolate Places to dwell

Yea, it's like a Pearl hid in the Field; it's like a Grain of Mustard-seed among many great Seeds, which is not easily found; it's like a Piece of Silver lost in the House among much Rubbish, till that be swept away thou wilt not find it; thou must dig deep, sweep clean, search narrowly before thou find it; although he said to the Pharisees, <hi>The Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> he did not say, they were Possessors of it, or that it was theirs; but to the Disciples, whom he taught to pray in Faith, <hi>thy kingdom come</hi>; and they came to find it, that which they prayed for, that Pearl, that Groat, that Grain of Mustard-seed, which it was like: and having found it, and believed in it, he said unto them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Blessed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.</hi> And in <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.20. <hi>And he lift up his Eyes on his Disciples, and said, blessed be ye poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God:</hi> They had seen it, and were Possessors of it, it was theirs: And Christ said unto his Disciples, <hi>There are some of you standing that shall not taste of Death, till ye see the Kingdom of God come in Power:</hi> And his Words were fulfilled; they declared what they had felt and seen; and some of them say, <hi>The Kingdom of God is not in Word, but in Power</hi>: And <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> writes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. who were also made Partakers of the same Power and the same Kingdom, he spoke his Knowledge of, and said, <hi>Its not Meat nor Drink, but Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the holy Ghost.</hi> And the <hi>Colossians,</hi> who had waited for it, and believed in that through which it was revealed; the Apostle was in the same Faith, <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.12. and 13. <hi>Who hath made us meet Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light; who hath delivered us from the Power of Darkness, and hath transformed us into the Kingdom of his dear Son</hi>; and those things were seen in the Body, and witnessed in the Body: And the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> saith, <hi>He that believes in entred into the Rest.</hi> And this and all these things were feeled within by the Seed immortal, the Birth immortal, and they that witness the Birth immortal to live in them: One said, <hi>Who hath made us joynt-heirs with Christ, who is the Kingdom of eternal Glory,</hi> and they were Joynt-heirs with him of the Kingdom that fades not away: And all that ever come to see the Kingdom of God in the Spirit, which is spiritual, must wait in the Spirit, and in its Manifestation, that so God, and his Kingdom, and the things of God's Kingdom, may be felt, and seen, and enjoyed in the Spirit which is Glorious.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Saints looked not after any other glory but that which stood in eternal Life; and in the immortal Life, and in the uncorruptible Life; and the Country they sought after, was that which God was the Maker and the Builder of, and they looked and waited to receive of his Power, in which the Kingdom standeth, and did in this Life (I do not say the full Weight of Glory) and to know and injoy, and to be made Partakers of his eternal Dominion and Authority, is that which all his Saints in Measure witness, and in due time, came to enjoy through Faith; for by Faith they saw him who was invisible, and the things of his Kingdom, which are invisible, spiritual and eternal; but to speak of the carnal corruptible Life in the Flesh, who are dead while they live there, that Life, neither the Kingdom, nor the Power, nor the glory of God is revealed to them,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40634:89"/>
not till after the Death of that Life, and till after the Death of him who hath the Power of Death, which is the Devil, which ruleth in the Hearts of the Children of Disobedience, whom all the Mystery of God's Kingdom is hid from, their Eyes, and ever shall while in that state; and so let the Serpent be blind; and they that have an Ear to hear, blessed is that Ear; for the Kingdom of God is come nigh unto many, and the Salvation of God, and the Power of his Christ is seen by many, Honour and Praise unto him everlastingly, who is the only Potentate, that puts down all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority under his Feet, that God may be all in all; but first every one must come to feel in himself the Kingdom, which is as a little Grain, in himself, and in it believe, before any can come to know the Kingdom, or wherein it consists, and after it be known in its Measure, yet this is far short of glory in the Fulness; so many may come to be partakers of the power in some measure, yet this is far short of the eternal Weight of Glory; <hi>He that believes is entered into the Rest,</hi> and made Partaker of the heavenly Gift, and of the heavenly Power, and of the heavenly Grace, which is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and doth witness a heavenly Place in Christ Jesus, and yet many Enemies to be subdued, and much of the heavenly Habitation, which they see not, which comes to be revealed, as there is an abiding in the Faith, which stands in God's Power, in which the Kingdom stands, the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God and of his Kingdom, come in due time to be revealed; through Death they come to be known, (that is to say) through the Death of Death; for <hi>Israel,</hi> the true Type, after they passed over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and had taken <hi>Jericho</hi> and <hi>Aie,</hi> and had made an Enterance into the land, yet there were many Enemies to be subdued, and much Land and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they were not made Partakers of long after, even so after there be of the true Rest enjoyed and possessed, and an Enterance made into, yet there are many Enemies to be subdued, and much of the heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to be enjoyed by them that stand in the Power which giveth Dominion over Sin, the Devil, Hell and the Grave, and they come to be made Partakers of God; and so the Enmity being slain, man comes to enjoy God, who is eternal Life, and comes to receive the Crown immortal, which God the eternal Power and Strength giveth in due time to them that wait in Patience and in Faith, through which the immortal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance comes to be revealed to all the Children of Light.</p>
                     <p>And so to conclude in few Words, this I say unto all, who are longing after God, and waiting to feel his Power, keep in your Minds to the pure Measure of God's holy Spirit, and therein wait to see his Kingdom, and his Dominion, and to be made Partakers of it, which brings the World to an End; and will let you see to the End of it too, before it was, and him who is now glorified with the Father in the Kingdom of God, with the same glory he had with the Father before the World began; and whoso comes to the End of the World, and to the Beginning again, comes to see him and his glory, and the Kingdom of glory which fades not away, which whoso come to enjoy, are eternally happy.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40634:90"/>
would have entred through Deceit and Craft any Way into the Vineyard of the Lord, and have spoiled the Plants, and would have subverted from the Faith, we could give no Place unto that, no, not for a Moment</hi>; to them who have made the Offence of the Cross to cease, and glory in the Flesh, and would lead all thither again, and have made Havock of the Flock of Christ, for whom he dyed, and would have had them to have lived and reigned who put him to Death, and counted that which cleansed from Sin a vain and a low thing; unto such I am wholly without Compassion, but wait to see the righteous Indignation of the Lord fall upon them, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the Holy Ghost, and have done Despight unto the Spirit of God, Misery and eternal Vengeance will be the End of such, and the upright shall rejoyce. Therefore, dearly beloved of the Lord, who are obedient unto the Word of his Grace, these things are come as a Tryal, that none may henceforth glory in Man, nor in any thing, but in the Lord, the Life it self, and in them who are in the Life, and every one may keep to their own singly, and so they will not be easily moved; and you whom the Lord hath kept in the Hour of Tryal and Temptations, that you joyned not with the Error of the Wicked, prize his Love, and keep low, stand in Awe of the pure presence of the Lord, else you will know his Wrath will be kindled against you again; but the Fear, Awe and Dread of the Lord keeps you clean, clear and pure in his Sight; mind all the first Love, and that which keeps your Hearts open and tender to the Lord, and one to another; put away all Strife and Contention; watch not for one anothers halting, for that which would rejoyce in that is in the Transgression it self; dwell in Love and Peace one with another; take heed of Security and Carelesness and Ease in the Flesh; for then Poverty, Dryness and Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will be among you, and the Womb will be shut that brings forth the Children which the Lord delights in; but all feel the Life and the Power of God, and let your Faith stand in it alone, and they that trust in it shall never be moved; for there you will be preserved out of the Changeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and changeable things, which adulterate the Mind from God, who never changeth; for God, who is, pure stands off at a Distance from that Heart which goes a whoring after other Lovers; there the Bed is defiled, there he will not lye, nor his Love he will not manifest to the unchast Heart, nor to the strange Flesh; for Whoremongers and Adulterers he will judge, and the Mother of Harlots must be cast into a Bed of Torment, and they that commit Uncleanness with her; but the Virgin feel, the Bride wait to know, the Lamb's Wife, who is all glorious and pure, without Spot, and there you will see the joyning and betrothing in Purity and Righteousness, and the Marriage which is honourable, and the Bed undefiled, where the Lamb lyes in the Bosome of his Spouse all Night, there Unity and Purity in the Love undefiled and eternal is seen: The things I write unto you are spiritual, and as you wait, you will feel and know in the eternal Wisdom the Mysteries of the Kingdom, and you will know the Holy Ghost, &amp; the Womb of the Virgin which he overshadows, and see the Conception, and feel him who is conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin, who was and is called the <hi>Immanuel, who saveth his People from their Sins</hi>; and then you will know Christ formed in you, and him that forms, and the Womb in which he is formed, the first born of every Creature, which is a great Mystery; but through Death this is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40634:90"/>
seen, felt, heard and understood: But he that hath the Key of <hi>David,</hi> opens the Door of the Treasure-house of Eternal Wisdom, and unto every one he gives a Measure, according to the good Pleasure of his Will, who wait upon him, and are faithful, of his Wisdom and Knowledge, and past find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out by the Children of Disobedience, whose Wisdom is corrupt; but unto all, and in all, and upon all that believe, he pours out of his Spirit of Life, of Wisdom, of Purity and Power a Measure, and in the Measure all that wait have Unity with him, who is the Fulness of all Things, and of his Fulness receive Grace for Grace; and his Righteousness, Love, Wisdom, Mercy and Fulness are revealed, from Faith to Faith; and as you believe, so are you near to him, whose Wayes cannot be measured; and more and more as you grow in the Faith of him and in him who hath enlightened you, and shined in your Hearts, more of his Love, of his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Holiness, Wisdom and Glory you will see, feel and understand of him, and from him, who is invisible &amp; eternal, blessed forever &amp; ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So Friends, all pass on towards the Mark, that you may know Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatness in him, who is all fair, and not one Spot in him, altogether lovely; and you who know his Love and the beloved, hold him fast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and let him not go, nothing can separate but an unchast Heart; and as you joyn unto any strange Flesh, or Idols, or other Lovers, and so draw your Love from him, be sure of this, he will hide away his Countenance from you of Love, and then Sorrow will fill your Hearts: So look not into <hi>Egypt</hi> again, nor to what you have parted with, nor the Glory nor Pleasure of <hi>Sodom,</hi> left you be turned into a Pillar of Salt (remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife) there are many of the same Nature with her, which are near you in that City, which are as Examples, that ye may forever beware, lest the same Root of Bitterness spring up as hath done among many, upon whom nothing is to be expected, but a daily fearful looking for the just Judgments of God in flaming Fire, as a Recompence of Reward for their ungodly Deeds and hard Speeches against the Truth and the Servants of it: But all abide in the Cross, that the Nature out of which the Lusts and the War arise against the Lord, and against your Souls, may wither, dye and be worn out; and so you will see more Rest and Peace in and with the Lord; and he that hath begun will finish, he that hath brought to the Birth will bring forth, for in him there is Strength; all Power is committed to him, both in Heaven and Earth; he will work Righteousness in the Earth, and preserve all in Peace in heavenly Places in himself forever, who believe in his Power. And so Friends, this I must needs say, If you be straitned, it is in your own Bowels, as sometimes I have said when I was present with you, even the same I write now, Destruction is of self, and Barrenness is of self, and Deadness and Disobedience is of self; but as you believe in him who is near, and in his Grace and the Word of his Grace, self is judged, and bruised under, and you will feel him who is the first and the last to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large your Borders, and make your Mountain strong, and your Heritage goodly, and your Ground fair and pleasant, where the pleasant Fruit of Righteousness is brought forth, which grows in the Valleyes of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, where the Beds are green, and the Garden is which gives a sweet Smell, and where all that dwell, live and abide are fresh, beautiful and lovely in the Sight of the Lord, &amp; in the Sight of all the Children of Light forever.</p>
                  <p>Friends, above all things keep low, and none to judge of your selves
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40634:91"/>
nor think of your selves above what is meet; take heed of Conceitedness, and Pride, and Exaltation, and Presumption, and of gainsaying and resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them who have laboured amongst you in Word and Doctrine, whose Example you have daily as a Pattern before you; let no Boasting be, nor Contentions, nor Strife, nor Emulation, nor Surmising, but in Singleness of Heart all dwell, and bear and forbear one another, and let the same Mind be in you as was in Christ Jesus, and so Peace will be in your Dwellings, and Rest and Prosperity in your Habitations, and Plenty and Riches from above of the heavenly Wisdom will be multiplyed in your Meetings, and the pure Presence of God and his Power will compass you about, who are of an upright Heart to the Lord, that so you may be as Examples and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Holiness and Righteousness in your Generation, that your Enemy may confess God is among you of a Truth: And so the Power of the Lord Jesus Christ rest and abide amongst you all, that you may continue to the End, which is the Desire of him that shall rejoyce in nothing more, then in all your Prosperities in the everlasting Truth of the Son of God, Heir of all Things, blessed forever and ever, World without End.</p>

                  <p>IN the End of the primitive Times, when the Apostles had finished their Testimony committed unto them, and had gathered many out of the World, and converted many unto God; and many were established in the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ (which purifieth the Heart, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Victory over the World) and were led to the Beginning, before the World was made; and the Churches which were in God, which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Anointing, by which they knew all things, even the invisible things of God, and the Mysteries of his glorious Kingdom, which God, through the Spirit did reveal unto them, which Spirit they had received, being begotten of God, by which Spirit they called him Father, and by which Spirit of Truth, which was manifest from the God of Truth in their Hearts, they were led into all Truth, and became Sons of God, and Heirs of the Promise; and this Spirit was their Direction, and led them to worship God aright, to obey and glorifie him and his Name, which brought Salvation unto them; and into this Spirit they were all baptized by the one Spirit into one Body; and in this one Spirit they met and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped God, and were of one Heart and of one Mind, and did know their Director near them and in them; and the Time did come when they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped neither at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> nor at <hi>Samaria,</hi> but in the Spirit and in the Truth, wherein the Father was glorified, and came to see that fulfilled which the Prophets bore Witness of, even him in whom all the Prophets end in, Christ made manifest in them, the Hope of Glory, whose Voice they heard from Heaven, by which they were quickened and raised from Death to Life, by the effectual working of the mighty Power of God, which wrought in them that did believe; and they were in the Unity of the Faith, by which all their Hearts were purified who held it, which is a Mystery held in a pure Conscience, by which they received an Assurance, and were made Partakers of the Promises, and became Inheritors of Life, Light and Immortality, and Heirs of the Promise, and Joynt-heirs with Christ; and they sate together with him in Heavenly Places, and eat with

him, and drank with him in the Kingdom of God, which stood in Power and in Righteousness, Joy and Peace, and did not look like the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> lo here or there, but first felt it (as a Grain of Mustard-seed) in themselves, or as a Corn of Wheat, which afterwards springs up as a Blade, or as a Ear of Wheat to Ripeness, to a full Corn; and they did walk from Faith to Faith, from Strength to Strength, and did appear before God in <hi>Sion</hi>; and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were come to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> from whence God shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out in perfect Beauty, who became their Satisfaction and Peace, who had revealed his Son in them, whom God had made unto them Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sanctification and Wisdom; and so they knew one God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one Faith, one Hope, one Baptism, the one Spirit into which they were all baptized, into which they all did drink, by which all that did believe were sanctified, and did receive the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among the Saints in Light; and this was the Church that was in God, which was begotten by God the Father, and preserved in Christ Jesus, in the lively Faith, and in the lively Hope, by which their Souls were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored, and they established in the Truth, that made free, and they had received the Spirit of Prophecy, and did speak one by one, according to the Revelation of the Spirit (which led out of Confusion into Order) and they being in the Power of God, did walk by its Order, in the Order of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>And now was the Woman cloathed with the Sun, who had the Crown of twelve Stars upon her Head, and the Moon under her Feet, who stood in that which was unchangeable and immutable; and now was the Man-child brought forth which was to rule the Nations, and was revealed to the Church which was in God, and he was the Head by which all the Members of the Body were united together in one, and reconciled to the Father in one, and by his Obedience Justification did come upon all that did believe.</p>
                  <p>But since the Woman fled into the Wilderness, and the Man-child was caught up unto God, the Midnight of Darkness came upon the whole World, and the Sincerity was lost, and the Image of God lost, the Heir caught up out of the World's Sight; Faith was lost, Hope lost, the Spirit lost (the Saints Rule and Direction) and then the Whore appeared, and made all Nations drunk with the Wine of her Fornication<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered and reeled to and fro, hither and thither, having lost the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all Waters and unstable; and all the World wondered after the Beast, which then arose after the primitive Times, and after the Apostles Dayes, and admired him, and worshipped him, who killed the Woman's Seed, and made War against it.</p>
                  <p>And then the Whore made Decrees (who was gone from the Law-giver) and she made Confessions of Faith, and Articles of Faith, being out of the Power of God, who is the Author of true Faith, being guided by the Power of the Dragon, she made Orders of Worship, and gave Directions for Worship, having gotten on the free Womans Attire, the Outside, the Scriptures, the Form of Godliness; but afterwards became more abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, having both lost the Power and the Form, worshipped the Devil's Power and the Dragon's Power, and came forth in the Image of him, and reached out the Cup of Fornication, and made the Nations drunk with her Inchantments and Sorceries; and she drunk the Blood of the Martyrs, the Blood of the Prophets, and them that kept the Testimony of Jesus,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40634:93"/>
the Spirit of Prophecy, and then prescribed Forms of Worship, Forms of Prayer, and made Creeds, and Faiths, and Articles of Faith, and many Faiths; having lost the Order of the Gospel, she made many Orders, and sent out many Merchants to carry abroad her Traffick and her Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize to the Nations; and whole Ships were filled full of it, Vessels full of it, which went upon the Sea, and rode upon the Waters, upon Kindreds, Tongues, Nations and Peoples, who received of her Merchandize, and bought of several Sorts of Merchandize, which the several Merchants traded with, who had several Orders prescribed then (as Popes, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Jesuites, Fryars of many Orders, and Monks of many Orders, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites of many Orders) and all these carryed their several Wares and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick; and many more Tradesmen, many more Merchants, whom she sent out with her Merchandize, who have been made rich by her Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize; and other Merchants were Bishops, Arch-Bishops, Deacons, Arch-Deacons, Pryors, Covents, Vicars, Commissaries, Chapters, Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Vice-Chancellors, Doctors of Divinity, Batchellors of Divinity, Doctors of Art, Masters of Art, Batchellors of Art, Priests and Curates, by which they were made rich, and abounded in Treasure.</p>
                  <p>And the Beast, whom all the World wondered after, compelled all to worship him, both small and great, upon which the Whore rides, the scarlet-coloured Beast, which hath guarded all her Merchants, and made all Nations buy their Ware, and hath compelled all People to buy the Whore's Sorceries, even all the invented and <hi>heathenish</hi> Trumperies which the Whore hath patched up, and their Merchants painted over, which they have patched up, some from the <hi>Jews,</hi> some from the <hi>Heathen,</hi> some from the Saints Words, mixt with their own Imaginations and Deceit, and have holden forth these as the publick Worship in the Nations, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Tongues and Peoples, their many Creeds, many Confessions of the Faith, many Catechisms, and many Forms of Worship; and when the People are weary of one Sort of Merchandize, then brings another in more deceitful and worse; and the Beast hath compelled the Nations to buy it, and to hold it as the publick Profession of the Nations, though never so unsound and rotten, though damnable Doctrines, and Doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, though invented and heretical Opinions, invented since the Apostles Dayes; yet cryes the Beast, The Church had ordained it, and the ancient Fathers have agreed upon it, and the Councils have confirm'd it, and the Divines have ratified it, and the Bishops, and Arch-Bishops, and reverend Fathers have confirm'd it, and recommended it for Orthodox and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick.</p>
                  <p>And therefore sayes the Beast upon which the Whore rides, (the false Church) the Mother of Harlots, If you will not agree to it, you are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; for the Church has Power to censure you, to excommunicate you, and to curse you, and to deliver you up to Satan; and then the Beast ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made Laws for the Sale of the Whore's Sorceries and for the guarding of her Merchants, and their ships, If you consent not to the Articles of the Faith, and Confessions, you break the Law of the Nations, and are not subject to Authority; and now you are not punished for Religion sake, nor for Christ's sake, nor the Gospel's sake, but as Evil-doers, and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors of the Laws of our Kingdom or Nation: And thus the Mother of Harlots which got up since the Apostacy, who hath drunk the Blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

of the Saints, and shed the Blood of the Martyrs, and slain the Witnesses, and hath put many to cruel Deaths, She saith, I am clear, we kill none for Conscience sake, we persecute none for the Gospel's sake, nor Christ's sake, nor for Religion sake; but you suffer as Hereticks, and you have transgressed the Law of Kings, Emperors, Councils, and Parliaments, and are Enemies to States, and Governments, and Rule, in breaking their wholsom Laws (cryes the Harlot, who hath lost the Savour; and her Merchants, which calls that which stinks and is corrupt, wholsome; and so saith the Beast) We persecute you not for Religion, neither in Persons, Liberties or Estates; but the Church hath recommended this Doctrine; these Articles of Faith, these Creeds and Pater-nosters, this publick Worship, or that Mass-book, or that Common Prayer-book, or this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, and are not they the fittest to judge of Religion, who have the Tongues, and the Original? and are fittest to give Meanings and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the Scripture?</p>
                  <p>And therefore we make a Law, that the Mass-book shall be holden out for the publick Profession of these Nations, as the Pope, Cardinals, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites and Fryars think it fit; and that the Common Prayer-book be holden forth as the publick Worship, which the Bishops, Arch-Bishops, Deacons, Arch-Deacons have recommended unto us, as that which is consonant and agreeable to the primitive Times, and to the Church which hath been established so many hundred Years, and whosoever will not consent and perform all the Rites and Ceremonies, let him be indicted, and let him be presented, and let him be cited and appear before a Bishop, and let him imprison him, and fine him, and take away some of his Estate, and excommunicate him; and then it's fit that the Secular Power take Notice of him for transgressing of their Law, and pillory him, or cut off his Ears, or stigmatize him, and banish him, and let his Estate be confiscate to the King or Prince, against whom he hath transgressed; for he suffers as an Evil-doer, and hath brought this upon himself, because he would not be subject to our Church-Orders, and to the laudable Customs of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Country.</p>
                  <p>And say, some other of the Whore's Merchants who are of another Order distinct from the rest, and carry other Sorts of Ware, and traffick with other Sorts of Merchandize, and some newer Fashion, which is liker to bewitch People; they cry out to the Rulers of the Earth to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their Trading and their Merchandize, and say, It were fit that some Doctors and Orthodox-men were called together to consider and consult about their Trade, and what Sort of Ware or Traffick will most bewitch People, and inchant their Minds, that so her Ships may go on the Sea; for if Kindreds Tongues and People will not buy her Ware, her Ships cannot go, and their Trade will go down; if ever Nations come to the Rock, or People come to some Estability, or know the precious Treasure, and the heavenly treasure in the earthen Vessels, they will buy no more of us; if the Sea be dried up, that no more a gallant Ship can pass thereon nor never a Gally with Oars, then we shall all turn Bankrupts, and then may we cry, Alas, alas! we that have been made rich, are now become poor; therefore what do we do? let us take Counsel together; and if any tell, <hi>That they have obtained the heavenly Treasure, and are come to the durable Riches, and to the Treasure that cankers not, and they have found it in

                  <p>And let this be agreed amongst us, now when many of us are assembled together, whose Lively-hood and Riches stand only in the merchandizing of our Mother Church, that to whatsoever Place we sail in our Ships, if any be heard to say, <hi>That the Spirit of the Lord ought to move first, before any Teacher, Minister or Believer ought to pray, that so they may pray with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in the Spirit, in publick and in private, whether with many or few, that so without the Spirit none can be edified</hi>; let us all agree to this, that it be voted down as an Error; and let us do what in us lyes to prove from Scripture, that set Forms of Prayer are lawful, and are an Ordinance of God; and let us bring the Lord's Prayer, called by our Mother-Church the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> and see what that will do, and also <hi>Hosea</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take with you Words, and turn to the Lord, say unto him, take away our Iniquity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us graciously</hi>; so with a Deduction from these and the like Scriptures, we may happily prove, that a set Form of Words, invented by our Church (or any of us that trade with her Merchandize) that this is an Ordinance of God, and ought to be practised publickly and privately, and is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God, although the People have not received the Spirit, as they had in the primitive Times; and if this will not satisfie, then use some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Argument, as our reverend Brother and Fellow-merchant with us, Mr. <hi>Samuel Bolton</hi> in the like Case in Hand used this forcible Argument. <hi>Though you cannot command the Wind</hi> (said he) <hi>yet you may spread your Sails</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and see what such an Argument as this will do; but if they will not be content with this (as it may be they will not) in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and some other Parts, who are more quick-sighted then some other Places where we merchandize; if we cannot stand it out against them, that none can pray to God aright, but he that is come to the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and knows by the Signification of it what to ask, then let us grant them the thing, if we cannot help it, if Common-prayer, Forms of Prayer will not go off as they use to do amongst our Customers, then let us agree to them (but let that be the last Shift) that without Faith or the Spirit it is impossible to be accepted or heard of God; yet before this be granted, let us strive as much as in us lyes by forcible Arguments from the Scripture (if so be they will not allow the Authority of ancient Fathers, nor of our Cannon-Books) how that there is a Platform laid down in Scripture, and the general Heads of true Prayer are laid down in an Orthodox Method in the Scriptures, that is to say, Confession, Petition, Intercession, Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, with giving of Thanks; and if this will not stave them off from speaking so much of Prayer by the Spirit and with Understanding (for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And furthermore let us agree, reverend Brethren, in Unity and Peace, and strive all with one Consent to be furnished with such Merchandize as will sute with the Countries and Regions where we traffick, as Kings, Princes, Protectors, Parliaments, and Councils, Noble men, Gentlemen, and also take in the common People (if happily we can please them all) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that by the last mentioned we receive much of our Subsistance; yet if any of them do not like our Merchandize, it is the least matter of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for then we have a King, a Prince, a Protector or a Parliament to appeal to; and if we can but satisfie them with Merchandize, upon Petition they will make us a Law, and set a Compass upon every one of our Ships to ride in at Sea, and they will command every Parish to buy our Merchandize, and if they will not buy it, at the worst compel them to give us our Price, whether they receive our Merchandize or Traffick or not, but if they will not (having a Law to guard us) we can take it from them, whether they will or no; and if at any time any seem obstinate, and refuse to pay us Easter-Reckonings and Midsummer Dues (which may be come to the Value of 18 d. or 2. s.) we can take a Pot worth 7 or 8 s. or a Pan, or a Kettle; and if they shall neglect to pay us a Mortuary, which hath been an Ordinance ordained by our mother <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> seven or eight hundred Years ago or upwards, if they will seek to disannul such a laudable Custom, then we can sue them for it in a County-Court, and get 20 or 30 Shillings Dammage; and if any of the common People refuse to pay us our Tythes, which belong unto us Church-Officers, which were given
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40634:96"/>
unto us by our Mother, who sate upon the scarlet-coloured Beast at the least 13. hundred years ago, that if our Tythe come to 40. s or 3. l. we can go to a Chapman or two, who resents our Commodities, and they will give us a Warrant for treble Dammages, and then we shall get some Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs (who are our Church-Members) and take away a Yoke of Oxen worth 8 or 10 Pounds; or a Horse or a Cow worth ten or twelve Pound; and if the Tythe come to 5 or 6 Pound, then we can take five or six Cows, and a score of Sheep, and half a score of Swine, and thresh the Corn out of his Barn, and take it away, and take away the Feather-Beds, and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Court-cloaths, and Blankets, Rugs, Sheets, Kettles, Brewing-furnance, or the Rayment which the Family wore; and if we judge it too little to satisfie our insatiable Desires, take Pin-cushions, or if it be but half a Cheese, as our reverend Brother <hi>Alexander Bradly,</hi> in the Parish of <hi>Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> from <hi>Robert Minter</hi> of the same County and Parish; And in thus doing there will be little loss or detriment to us: And if any refuse to give us a Tythe-cock of Hay, or a Shock of Corn; (having the Power of the Earth of our Side) we can pull down the Hedges, and break open the Gates, and fetch away a Wain-load or two, or as much as we think fit, as many of our reverend Brethren of our Order have lately done; which are good Precedents to Posterity that may come after us; and if any with whom we have traded (who are Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) do think much at us, we can call them Hereticks, and say, they are Enemies to the Church and Common-wealth, therefore why do you pity them?</p>
                  <p>But reverend Brethren, it is not with us now in the North Regions of the World, as it hath been in time past, about two or three hundred Years ago, neither as it is with the rest of our fellow-Merchants in <hi>Italy, Rome, Jerusalem, Arabia, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungaria, France,</hi> and the rest of the Regions, where our Mother sits as a Queen, the People being all as asleep at Midnight, any old, dark, rusty cankered Ware will go off there at a good rate, and for <hi>Ave-maries,</hi> or <hi>Pater-nosters, Te Deum,</hi> or a <hi>Magnificat Anima,</hi> or the like, or some other Charm in an unknown Tongue, or a Story of St. <hi>Damisen,</hi> or St. <hi>Benedict</hi> about Images, or a story of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of his converting of Wolves and Bears; or speaking an Hour from some old-Fathers, and call it the Word of God, and meddle not with the Scripture at all; for a story of the Lady of <hi>Laurette,</hi> or the image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of what Miracles they have wrought, which the Members of the Mother-Church believe for good Doctrine, and receive these or the like, as Crosses, Crucifixes, Pictures, Beads and Images, and such other like Merchandizes of the baser Sort, are all brought and received, without Question, as Merchandizes of great worth, and things belonging to Happiness and Felicity; but alas! it is almost Day, and the Night is far spent, and the People in these Northern Regions are come past Mid-night, some towards the dawning of the Day, and they question our Merchandize, and with some the Night is quite over and they are come to the Day-break, and to the rising of the Sun, and with those there is no hope of trading, (though with the best of all our Commodities) though with Cinamom and Odours, and Oyntment, and Frankincense, yet they will buy none of our Ware, nor there's no Hope of trading with them any more; for they are come to know the Pearl
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40634:96"/>
which is more precious then Rubies, and the heavenly Treasure that doth not rust, and the Word which is sweeter then the Honey and the Honey comb, there's no Hope of them; but this is the Misery, they will not be content with what they have found, but impart it to others, and so beget a Dislike in other Peoples Minds to the best of all our Merchandize.</p>
                  <p>However, them that are gone from us, and deny our Mother and her golden Cup, and deny all her Merchants, great and small, not only them that trade in Wood, and Vessels, and Brass, and Iron, but even them that trade with the best Merchandize, as Gold, Silver, precious Stones, Pearls, fine Linnen, Purple, Silk and Scarlet; however let us excommunicate them, and give them up to Satan, and let us call to the Beast with his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heads and ten Horns, who is scarlet-coloured, dreadful and terrible, and let us accuse them of Heresie, Schism and Blasphemy, and call them Seducers, Deceivers and false Prophets, and let us brand them with Names of Reproach, as Sectaries, and say, they are seditious and rebellious and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous, and they are Enemies to Church and State and all good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Peace-breakers, factious and pestilent Fellows, that bring all the Nations into an Uproar; and if that will not do, let us petition to Kings, Princes, Dukes, Parliaments, Protectors and Councils, that some speedy and effectual Course may be taken for suppressing of these Hereticks, and for stopping of these blasphemous Doctrines, as that <hi>the Steeple-house is not the Church, and sprinckling of Infants no Ordinance of Christ, and singing of Psalms by Tradition no Part of the true Worship of God</hi>; and it may be shall get some Law or Act of Parliament against them; or call them Vagabonds, and get them whipt abroad, and put in Prisons, while we take away their Oxen and Goods at home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so by this Means it will stop others (whom we traffick withal) that they will not dare to hearken unto them; for if they will not buy our Wares, and take our measures by a Glass in Love to it, yet because of Fear of Imprisonment, or Loss of their Goods or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, they will be constrained to trade with us.</p>
                  <p>But alas! it is otherwise with us now then it was in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Dayes, when <hi>Mass, Mattens</hi> and <hi>Even-songs, Processionings, Ave-maries, Creeds</hi> and <hi>Pater-nosters</hi> took up most Part of the Time, and went off among Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for spiritual Worship at a good Rate; neither is it with us now, as it was in the Dayes of Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> our great <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and the rest of our Mother's Merchants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then would <hi>Common Prayer</hi> translated out of the <hi>Mass-Book</hi> into the <hi>English,</hi> and <hi>Creed, Letany, Pater-noster,</hi> with a <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us,</hi> or <hi>we beseech thee to hear us good Lord,</hi> forty Times over in a Quarter of an Hour, with some of <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms turned into Meeter by <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold,</hi> Masters of Musick, sung with Organs, with Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risters and Boyes, with bowing to the Altar, and such like Merchandize, which was then precious in the Eyes of our Mother's Children; then who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever would not be obedient to all the Rites and Ceremonies, we bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them with the Name of <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> and haled them before Sessions, Courts and Magistrates, cited them to appear before the Bishops, served them up to the <hi>High-Commission-Court,</hi> before the Lords Spiritual and Temporal [falsly so called] and there the Flesh was gnawn to the Bone, and Ears cut off, stigmatizing and burning with Irons, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment and Banishment: Now as People came nearer the Day, they began to suspect all this, as not to be the spiritual Worship of God, having
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40634:97"/>
no Ground nor Footing from the Spirit of Truth, nor Example from the Scripture, nor from the primitive Churches; then they over whom our mother once reigned, began to question her, whether she was the Lamb's Wife, yea or nay? And whether our Predecessors and Brethren were the messengers sent out by the true Church, yea or nay? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ordinances and Practices were the Institution of Christ and his Apostles, yea or nay, in the primitive Times? And the Day dawned upon them, and the Spirit came to be revealed, and did shine into their Hearts, and they began to search the Scriptures, and to compare the true Church (which was cloath'd with the Sun, and crown'd with the Crown of twelve Stars) with our mother <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi>; and they began to compare the Apostles and ministers in the primitive Times, with our Predecessors, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>'s merchants; and also compared the Institutions and Ordinances which were delivered to the true Church, with the Institutions, Rites, Ceremonies and Inventions of our mother <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi>; and so they found all out by the Revelation of the Spirit, and by searching of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they found out the Rise of our mother, after the Woman was fled into the Wilderness, and that she sate not as a Queen upon Nations, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Tongues and Peoples, till after the Woman did fly away upon the Wings of an Eagle into the Wilderness, for a Time, Times and half a Time; and likewise they found out, that our Predecessors and Fellow-merchants were not like the ministers of Christ in the primitive Times, neither our Doctrines and Ordinances like the Ordinances and Doctrines which were once delivered to the Saints, before ever we merchants set sail, or floated in a Ship on the Sea: And so finding our City to be raised up in its Glory, since the Glory of God was lost in the Earth; and finding our Queen <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> ruling in our City, since the Lamb's Wife fled; and finding us merchants to receive her Traffick from her City, since the Faith was lost that once was delivered to the Saints; and did see our <hi>Creeds,</hi> and <hi>Beliefs,</hi> and <hi>Pater-nosters,</hi> our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and our <hi>Hymns,</hi> that they are quite another Thing, which was Part of her Traffick, they have concluded, (and that upon infallible Grounds) warranted by a Cloud of Witnesses in the Prophets and Apostles, that our mother is a Whore, and her Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors are her merchants, and that our Ordinances are, and Traffick hath been invented by some of our mother's children, which are Apostates, and they have found us out: And now alas! a Ship will be hardly able to ride any more upon the Waters, nor the Sea will hardly bear up our Vessels any more; the Nations, the Kindreds, the Tongues and the Peoples are almost dryed up, especially in the North Regions they will not buy our merchandize any more, our Ships are like to stand still, and our merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize is like to be all shipwrackt; therefore let us take counsel, lest all the Sea dry up, and we all sit down in Solitariness, and our Song be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wo worth the Day, misery and alas.</p>
                  <p>Therefore now it behoves us all, reverend Brethren, who are of this last Edition (tything <hi>Presbyters</hi>) to deny our mother in her greatest Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Adultery, since she hath committed Fornication with Kings and Nobles, and since all Nations have drunk of her cup; but yet let us own her three or four hundred Years after the Ascension of Christ; for then though she was inclining to Adultery, and it lodged in her Heart, yet it was not so openly known then, but only to a few, and then she held Part
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40634:97"/>
of the Form of Godliness, and had Part of the true Church's Attire and Ornaments on the outside; and so let us all agree to stick close to her here, and vindicate her then and her merchandize (the Form of Godliness) for if this Traffick will not go off, we are at an End; for either this must serve in the North Regions of the World, or we must pull down our Sails, and let our Ships stand still on dry Land; let us put on a Resolution, there is some Hope that this may serve a while; for that our Mother was a true Church three hundred Years after Christ, hardly any in this will gainsay us; and let us deny all the Popes, Cardinals, Legates, Fryars, Monks, Jesuites, Seminaries, and all their several Orders (which are one distinct from another) and let us deny the rest of our Fellow-merchants, or rather Fathers (which did ordain us to be Merchants to trade at Sea) seeing that kind of Merchandize which they then traded with (which they received from our Mother) will not go off now; for Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People now will not buy that kind of merchandize which hath not the Face of Purity upon it; and though we were made Ministers by them, yet now when they are grown out of Date (a Parliament having voted them down) it's not safe for us to hold them up, nor none of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship nor Merchandize; so we having a distinct Order of our own, and are ranked into another Fellowship, distinct from the Fryars and the Monks, let us keep our Fellowship one with another; and so we may set up our selves, and so may bring Honour to our mother <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Name; and so let Bishops, Arch-Bishops, Arch-Deacons, Deans and Chapters, Prelates, Vicars and Curates be denyed; and seeing the traditional Traffick (before mentioned) will not go off, and all the Forms of publick Worship have been contrary to the Scriptures, and contrary to the primitive Times, and seeing we cannot hinder People from seeing of it, therefore we must let it all pass, and deny both them and it (at least in the hearing of them whom we trade with) therefore let them merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize with it in some other Country, for our mother, where she hath more Reputation, and where the Beast hath more Power; and the Time may come, if we can but perswade People, that they cannot understand the Scriptures, nor come to know the mind of Christ without our Original, <hi>Hebrew; Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> in some Time, it may be, this Traffick will go off, if we can keep People but ignorant enough, that so we may be a means to bring our mother and her messengers (that she hath sent forth) into more Reputation then they are: Notwithstanding, though the Day be dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every man's Work made manifest of what Sort it is, yet it is well enough, that we receive the maintenance which our mother <hi>Mystery Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> gave unto our former merchants, as <hi>Tythes, Oblations, Obventions</hi> and <hi>Offerings, Easter-Reckonings,</hi> and <hi>Midsummer-dues,</hi> and <hi>Mortuaries, twenty Shillings for a funeral Sermon, ten Groats at the Grave, twelve Pence an Hour for ringing of Bells,</hi> and such other like Commodities that befall us; and besides all this, we have got something out of Bishops Lands, and Deans, and Chapters, and Prebends Lands, some good Augmentations out of those; so that all the merchandizing and Traffick lyes in our Hands, and all the Wages that our mother gave to other Officers and Ambassadors of several Orders (which to speak plainly, is the very Reins and sinnews of our Gospel which we preach) and therefore, if we cannot keep the People blind, but they will see our Error in most Things; yet while we have the Powers of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40634:98"/>
the Earth to make us a Law, that all may be forced an compelled to pay that unto us which our mother, the Church gave us, when she was in her Exaltation, while this is kept up, we shall carry about her Ships, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize; though the People have no great Heart to it, we shall cry out to the Magistrates, to compel them to buy it, or else the People will turn <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and however get our Price.</p>
                  <p>Yet now, reverend Brethren, seeing we cannot keep the People in Ignorance and Darkness, nor hinder the Day from dawning, nor the Sun from rising, while it is but even yet Twy-light, let us work and carry about our Traffick; for the best Sort of Merchandize which our Mother hath, will hardly please now; for now it comes to that, <hi>that nothing but spiritual Ordinances will be accepted among People now</hi>; therefore we, which are of the tything <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Order, though we have denyed our Mother in some of her Sorceries, and though we have denyed the Bishops, our Fathers, and Ordinances, and their established Form of Worship, we being Heirs app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again, how many thousands of our Fellow-merchants denyed the <hi>Mass-book,</hi> or publick Profession, Doctrine and Discipline, and joyned to the book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Letany,</hi> as the publick Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Worship of God; and now of late Years we have denyed it our selves; and so we which are of this Order can dispence well enough with this, seeing that we trade with some of our Mother's Merchandize under another Name, and so the Matter is less grievous, because the Orders and Ceremonies about Worship are retained still in our <hi>Directory</hi> under another Habit and Guise; and having these Witnesses before mentioned for our Example, and if any seem to contend with us, this will take the Edge off People, (seeing it's no new thing with us, to set our Sails which Way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Wind blows) and it may be, we may bring them a Scripture or two, and an Inference from it, for a Cloak, as, to <hi>submit to every Ordinance

of man for the Lord's sake,</hi> and <hi>let every Soul be subject to the higher Power</hi>; so <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. while he stood, he was the higher Power, and so <hi>Mary, Elizabeth, James</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> they were the higher Power, while they stood, and they did ordain, that sometime the <hi>Mass-book</hi> should be the publick Worship, and some time the <hi>Common-Prayer-book</hi> should be the publick Worship, and now the <hi>Directory</hi> a Plat-form of publick Worship; it may be, these and the like Arguments (to them that are dim-sighted) will take Place for some time. But there is one thing above all, which ought to be considered of by us, who are allowed to be publick Merchants (seeing that we must go under the name of Reformation, for that is our Flag we carry in our Ships) seeing that generally People of the most under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing will not allow of any preaching to be effectual, to the converting of Souls, but that which is ministred by or from the Spirit; for the reading of old <hi>Homilies</hi> which served in our Predecessors Dayes, will not serve now, or if we should speak some <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> in an unknown Tongue, they will conclude, that is rather the Wisdom of the Flesh, and from natural Wit, rather then from the Spirit; and therefore it is not much amiss, if we conclude to let some of the Ancient Fathers pass, and not mention them, because it is holden generally, that they lived in an Apostatizing time, and so it will not be effectual in the Audience of People: And so for <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Cyprian, Jerom</hi> and <hi>Beda, Origen</hi> and <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin,</hi> their Traffick will hardly go off, for they will conclude, it's rather by Art and Study that we preach, then by the Spirit; and so we being fallen into such a dangerous time as this is, now in the break of Day, when men begin to be quick-sighted, and will not onely espie Hills, but also Motes; therefore, all we which are Merchants of this Order and Rank to our Mother Mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> had need to trade with the best Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, as Gold, and Silver, and precious Stones, and fine Linnen, and silk, and Scarlet; and so let this be agreed upon by us all, that we study hard, and read the Scriptures, and other modern Divines, which are Orthodox, that so, if need require, every one may preach <hi>extempore</hi>; for else it will not go upon the Account of the Spirit, and so have Words to fit at all Times, Occasions and Seasons as before Protectors, Parliaments and Councils, or Noble men, or Classis, or Synods, or the like; and every one labour by Study and Art to raise many Doctrines from one Scripture, and make many Uses, and Tryals, and Motives; and so carnal people's minds will be affected with such dex-Tterity and Readiness, so that we shall clear our selves from Clamour, (which some of our Merchants have fallen under, because of their Negligence) and if any should accuse us for studying and patching up our Sermons out of divers Authors mixt with Scripture, and our Inventions, then bring such a Scripture as that, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Study to shew thy self approved unto God</hi>; it may be, some blind Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will take that for a good Proof; and such a word as that, <hi>Study to be quiet</hi>; and because the word <hi>Study</hi> is found in Scripture, therefore with a Consequence or two we may prove in the Ears of people, that studying of Sermons is lawful; and if any question our set Wages and Heir, be sure, that all with one accord do study to vindicate this; for this is the Life and Sinnews of the Propagation of our Gospel.</p>

Was not a Psalm in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God, when it was sung in the Spirit, and with Understanding, as good as Interpretation? And was not Prophecy as acceptable as speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Tongues? If your expounding, so called, of the Scripture be by the Spirit of God, why should that give Way to sprinckling of an Infant, till the Spirit cease to speak in him that spake by it?</p>

And in the Conclusion of all the whole, a Sacrifice must be offered up for the Defects of your whole Service; what pitiful blind Merchandize is its? before it was a Seal of the Vocation and Election, eternal Life, and Pledges of Adoption; and by it the Comers thereunto are not made perfect, but are full of Defects, and sinful, and your whole Services full of Iniquity, and Sin, and Defects; will not any, who hath but the least Sight, abhor your hypocritical Sacrifice, and your mouldy, rusty, cankered Traffick? And now their holy Ordinance and their most holy Things are ended in Defect, in Sin and Iniquity; and these Worshippers the more they offer, the more they sin; and how the rest of their Ordinances will end, thou may'st judge, before thou pass any further.</p>
                  <p>Direct. And now I come to the Sanctification of their Sabbath, <hi>The whole Day</hi> (you say) <hi>is to be celebrated, as being the</hi> Christian <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If you intend the first Day of the Week, where is that called the Christian Sabbath? The Sabbath in the first Covenant was given for a Sign of the Christian Sabbath, which was to be revealed, when they cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from their own Works, Words and Thoughts, then the rest was to be known, the Christian Sabbath; and whether is the Christian Sabbath a visible or invisible thing? But stay Sirs, do you keep this Day (which you call a Christian Sabbath) holy to the Lord? Is not this your Market Day, upon which you sell your Traffick, one or two Glasses for twenty or thirty Shillings a Day, besides what you get for sprinckling of Infants? Do you not speak your own Words, nor think your own Thoughts, nor work your own Works? If you say, you do not, how comes it to pass that there are all these Defects in your Performances, and all this Iniquity in your holy Things? I hope you dare not say, that Defects are from God, or that Iniquity or Sin is of God; and if you have not a Male in your Flock, let sacrificing or offering alone, and do not think that God will be pleased with your lame, blind, maimed, defective Sacrifices, neither with your strangled Things, nor your Swines Flesh; so I say unto you, repent, and learn to be reformed in your selves, before you prescribe Rules for others, lest both you and them that follow you fall into the Pit; &amp; because the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of this Rank and Order do love to be medling with every Thing, wherein there is Hope of any Thing to be got, they will try all kinds of Merchandize, and so present they their Direction about Marriage to any who will take their ignorant Counsel.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If you mean by Sacrament an holy thing, then Marriage is either holy or unholy; if unholy, then fit to be done by none; if holy, why is it not proper and peculiar to the Church of God? if they who are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of God may marry (in the Lord, and in the covenant in which man was made) the male and the female; then what hath any to do with it, who are not of the Church of God? and what hath the Church of God to do with them that are without? and what hath a Priest to do with this? where was <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Sarahs</hi> Priest when they were married? and where was the Priest to solemnize the marriage of <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebeccah</hi>? and of <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi>? and because you say it is not peculiar to the Church of God, whether were these of the Church of God before mentioned? but what hath the Priest to do to publish it three times, like a Bel-man for the loss of a Horse or Cow through the Market? or rather, why ought not the Man and the Woman both, in the fear of the Lord (if they be moved thereunto by the Lord) publish their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions? And moreover, their joyning together in the Church of God, when the members of the Church of God are present; but this frustrateth the Priests 5 or 10 s. and his Clerk 6d. or a Shilling more or less as they can get.</p>
                  <p>Direct. Further more, they say, <hi>It may be done any time of the Year, but on a Fasting-day, or on the Lord's Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Why are these Dayes prohibited? if Marriage be a holy thing, or an honourable thing, why may it not be done in the Fear of God, and the Power of God, why not on any Day? were Dayes made for man, or man made for Dayes? your ignorant Predecessors, the <hi>Pharisees</hi> judged as you do, that it was not expedient or convenient, that he should heal a Daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom Satan had bound, on the Sabbath day; And now they say, that the honourable Estate of Marriages, is the Covenant of their God; and before it was laid, It was not peculiar to the Church of God if entering into a state of Marriage be the Covenant of God, and if the Covenant of God be peculiar to the Church of God, then what is the reason (you Reformers) that Marriage is not peculiar to the Church of God? And now take their directions (who hath a desire to Trade any more with their Merchandize) concerning the visitation of the Sick.</p>
                  <p>Direct. <hi>The party sick is to send for the Minister timely and seasonably before their understanding fail them; and if the Minister suspect the party of Ignorance, he shall not examine them in the principles of Religion, especially touching Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith, and to make known unto him the danger of deferring Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If he be such a one who is the sick, as hath traded much with the Priests Merchandize, if he be capable of understanding, there is some hope he may give the Priest 5 Pound, or ten Pound; and it hath been high time for the Minister to have shown him the danger of deferring Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance before now, (when he is like to go out of the Body) not to have deferred his exhortation till this time; and if the party be ignorant, it were more time to inform him about the Principles of Religion, and Repentance, and Faith, then to have him make answers to that which he knowes nothing of; and then you conclude, if desired the Minister shall pray for him to this Effect.</p>
                  <p>Direct. <hi>Confessing and bewailing Original and actual Sin, and the miserable condition of man by Nature, and that God would give him an evidence of an interest in Christ, and the Seal of Eternal Life by Christ.</hi>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> In Sin you began, and in Sin you will End; complaining of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and actual Sin before you know what it is, and holden on till you come to the Grave, and never depart from it; and what! must not the Minister pray except he be desired? it seems they alwayes must please other mens desires, rather then mind the Spirits motion in themselves; And what! is interest in Christ yet wanting, and evidence, and Seal of eternal Life yet wanting, and it may be the party 40 or 50 Years old? What, was not this man baptized when he was an Infant; and have not you said, in the 48 page and 45 page of your <hi>Directory,</hi> that Water-baptism is the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, and of being ingrafted into Christ, and of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Adoption, and eternal Life; and what, is the evidence and Seal lost now; useth not this to be the doctrine amongst you, once in and ever in Christ, and whom he loves once, he loves to the End? and hath not this man partaken of the Sacrament, and eaten the Flesh of Christ, and drank his Blood, and a Church-member (as you call it) and is his Evidence now to seek, and the Seal now wanting? utter Darkness is your dwelling Place.</p>
                  <p>Direct. And now we come to the <hi>Directory</hi> for solemn Fast, <hi>That when some great and notable Judgment is inflicted upon some People, or apparently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or when some special Blessing is to be sought or obtained, then solemn Fasting is a Duty that God expects from a Nation and People, and they are to abstain from all Food, and from worldly Labour, and Discourses, and bodily Delights, and rich Apparel, and Ornaments, and such like (although lawful at other Times) and gorgeous Attire, and lascivious Habits, and if any such Thing be, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister may reprove them at a Fast.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> To fast unto the Lord, is not to set a Day apart by the Will of man, but by being moved thereunto by the Lord, and not to hang down the Head for a Day like a Bulrush, nor to smite with the Fists of Wickedness, but to loose the Band of Wickedness, and let the Oppressed go free: And as for gorgious Attire, Rich Apparel and Ornaments, it's no where found so much as amongst you Steeple-house Fasters; and for Delights and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and these Things, which you say is lawful at other times, that which so judgeth, will not forsake them in your set Times; and if they be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at any time, then the Apostles Exhortation is made void, who said, <hi>Not in Gold, nor costly Array<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor broidered Hair</hi>; that which abstains from them one day, and takes them up another day, is Hypocrisie and Deceit: And as for your Abstinence from one set Meal in a day, and it may be go to a Banquet or a Riot the next day after, this is Abomination to the Lord: And how should the Minister reprove any for Pride, when it may be hath as many Points at his Knees as a Beasom, Ribbons and Cuffs, and a long Robe to his Heels, and a broad Hatband, enough to cover one most Part down the Waste, if it were spread out; and who do you think will receive this man's Reproof for Pride, that thus is gorgiously attired? And what do you judge this man will have on the Thanksgiving day?</p>
                  <p>Direct. The next comes on the Performance of the Worship, <hi>which is reading, preaching, with singing of Psalms, fit to quicken the Affections, and especially Prayer, wherein Sin is to be confest, with several Aggravations, and with greater Inlargement then at other Times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> You that have nothing to quicken your Affections, but to turn <hi>David</hi>'s Cryings and Tears into a Song, and sing, <hi>You roar for the Disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40634:103"/>
of your Hearts, and as Men distracted,</hi> when your Hearts are whole and unrent; and you that think to be heard for your feigned Confessions, and if you speak from your Hearts (as you say the Ministers ought to do) there is no such Hypocrisie and Deceit among any People, as among you, who do that which is forbidden, and leave that undone that is commanded, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously sin against the Light of your own Consciences, as you confess, and do not so much as endeavour to receive Christ into your Hearts, nor so much as endeavour after Mortification and Newness of Life: And how can you think for your multitude, and Inlargement of Words, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Importunacy, God will hear you for your much Babling? many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Fasts have been made, which I have observed, as well as some other men, what would be the End thereof, the Beginning thereof was Feignedness, and the Performance thereof like them that <hi>Amos</hi> speaks of, <hi>that howled for their Corn, Wine and Oyl, and mocked God, and drew near with their Lips, but their Hearts were far from him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Direct. But to proceed, <hi>Such Texts ought to be used for preaching, that may best work the Hearts of the Hearers into Humiliation and Repentance, and the Minister is to exhort before they depart, that their Assembly may improve their whole Life to the Glory of God, by re-inforcing themselves and their Families in all private Resolutions towards God, which they professed in publick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> You that have no other things to bring people to humility and repentance, but by a Text (as you call it) of Scripture, which you may judge in your carnal minds will do it, and pick and chuse too, the Scripture where you like: What! was not the Scripture spoken forth by the Spirit of God, and cannot be broken? And one Scripture is as good as another, and is as effectual as another; but none is effectual without the Spirit, which is that which leads to Repentance, and brings down the Pride of the Transgressor; and except People come to receive the Spirit, and believe in it, which convinceth them of Sin, and leads them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, all your stirring up, and composing, and re-inforcing, will do no Good at all; and re-inforcing of self began your Fast, and there it will end, without Christ, which whoso comes to follow, deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and otherwise taught, then to take the Kingdom by Force: And concerning their humiliation, thou hast heard, and mayest judge, Reader, what their Thanksgiving will be like the rest.</p>
                  <p>Direct. <hi>The Minister is to make some pithy Narration of God's Deliverance, and sing some pertinent Psalms, and choose a pertinent Text to the Occasion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Thanksgiving doth not arise from any Sensibility that people feel in themselves; but it arises from the pithy Story, as they call it, of the Minister, and likewise from his devised Sermon, which hath fed the carnal Minds, to rejoyce in Words without the Life, and then ring the consecrated Bells, and get Bonfires, and eat and drink, and satisfie the flesh; and these are the Thanksgivings, and the Rejoycings that the World makes over the Witness in themselves.</p>
                  <p>Direct. And now I come to the singing Psalms, and their Mass-house, the place of their Worship, and so I have done with their Traffique: First, they say, <hi>that singing of Psalms publickly in a Congregation, with a tunable Voice, is a Christian's Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Where it was injoyned by Christ, or any of his Ministers, I am ignorant, and yet the Scriptures I know, but no where read in it, that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40634:104"/>
singing of Prophesies, and Prayers, and other mens Conditions, turned into Ryme and Meeter by Poets and Masters of Musick, in an inverted Tune, (in the same Mind which invents Tunes for Ballet-mongers) and to sing such Conditions amongst proud, wanton and disdainful People, covetous, envious, and such as have not so much as endeavoured after Mortification, or newness of Life, (as generally your Parochical Congregations are) as you have confest in your <hi>Directory</hi> for publick Worship; this is no way accounted as a <hi>Christian</hi>'s Duty; for whose Souls are not brought out of Death, cannot praise the Lord; and you confess, Ministers and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that you are blind in Mind, hard in Heart, full of Unbelief, Impenitency, Luke-warmness, and Barrenness, not endeavouring to receive Christ into your Hearts, your State is Howling and Lamentation, and not rejoycing; yet singing with the Spirit is owned, and with understanding.</p>
                  <p>Direct. And now we come to the place of publick Worship: They say, <hi>It is not unlawful or unconvenient for</hi> Christians <hi>to meet together in the place which was dedicated to Idolatry, or consecrated to an idolatrous Use, yet we hold it requisite, that the Places of publick Worship should be imployed, and continued to that use.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> And upon what Account, do you count it lawful, convenient and requisite to meet in an Idol's Temple, or a Mass-house? your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will be but slender and poor, which will be without Example from the Saints: Did <hi>Josiah</hi> or <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when they had broken down the Altars of <hi>Baal,</hi> and thrown down the high Places, did they say, it's requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and convenient, that our Priests, and the <hi>Levites,</hi> and the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, do meet at the Altar of <hi>Baal,</hi> or at the high places? Or did the Apostles bid the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who did believe, go to their Idols Temple again, and say, it was a convenient Place to worship the true God in? And have you forgotten that Exhortation or Precept, <hi>Abstain from every Appearance of Evil</hi>? And though some know an Idol is nothing in the World, how be it there is not in every man that Knowledge; and is it not yet called by most of you yet, <hi>The House of God, House of Prayer?</hi> But as you did begin, so will you end, to carry no Traffiqe, but for your Mother, Mystery <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus, Reader, I have led thee through many things, from the rise of the Whore, and through the most of her merchants, and through the most of her Traffique merchants, of divers orders and Ranks; but I find them all to trade with nothing but Inchantments and Sorceries, which hath long bewitched the Nations; but the time is come, that she is manifest, with her Merchandize and Sorceries, and turned from, by me and many thousands more, which is my exhortation to thee, that so thou mayst come to the Church, which is in God, and to the Elect assembly, and to know the Seed which is heir of the promise, and of the Life which is without end: Which Mystery Babylon, with all her merchants, have sought to Destroy, since she got up to ride upon the Beast, who hath compelled all, both small and great, to worship him, and also all Nations to buy the Whores Merchandize and Traffique, which hath deceived the Nations, and bewitched them; but the time is come, that she shall be hated of her Lovers, and they shall forsake her; and her Merchants shall say, Alas! alas! which day is dawning and dawned, which discovers the Whore, the Beast and false Prophet, with all their Sorceries, and the Lamb shall reign, and the holy men of God and Prophets shall rejoyce over her, when the smoak of her Torment ascends up forever and ever; which the Lord hasten saith my Spirit, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <head>AN EPISTLE TO THE Reader or Readers</head>
                  <p>TO the upright-hearted Reader in all the Regions of the Earth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this may come, who have walked in the Thick Fogs and Mists, which have arisen out of the bottomless Pit, which have been raised up since the Transgression, which have dimmed your Eyes, and hurt your Sight, so that you could not behold the pure caelestial Being, nor him that dwells in it, whose Presence gives Life, nor any thing within the Vail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Vail hath been spread over all Nations, and it hath been so thick, that it hath been hard for any to rent it; and the Night of Apostacy and Darkness hath been so long, since the Woman fled into the Wilderness, and since the Manchild which was born hath been caught up to God, that few or none for these many Ages past have come to see the End of the Night, but have mourned without Hope, and few or none have seen or have been able to discern the time of the Woman's Return out of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness again, into which she fled; and few or none have seen to the End of the times, after which she should return; &amp; Mens Sight in the Apostacy hath been so dim, and in the Vexation, that when the Man-child, which was caught up unto God, would appear again, few have had Faith to believe, or Sight to behold him, or an Understanding to discern of the times: But Praises be to the Lord God everlasting, who hath opened, and is opening the Windows of Heaven, and showring down his Wisdom as a mighty Rain, and his Knowledge as the Morning Dew, and an Understanding is pouring forth, as the Water out of the Bottles of Heaven, and as the Water Spouts, so that Ages, Times, Things, Dayes and Years are mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured and seen.</p>
                  <p>And him that was before all things is beholden, by whom all things were made, who hath been as in a far Country, all this long Night of Darkness; but the time is fully expired, and now is he returning, and his Appearance is as a Morning without Clouds, as clear as the Sun, and as pure as Christal; and now is he scattering the Clouds, Fogs and Mists, as with the East Wind; and his pure Breath clears the Air; and by his Arm which is mighty, is he renting the Vail of the Covering, according to his Promise, and revealing himself in his naked Glory, that the solitary may rejoyce, and the feeble may be comforted, and them that have erred may come to a good Understanding; what I have writ thou must read me only in that which is invisible and eternal in thy self, else I am sealed from thee, my Words are a Riddle; the Dreamers of this Age in the Apostacy say,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40634:107"/>
Immediate Revelation is ceased, and not to be looked for; yet I must needs bear my Testimony against them all; for what I have here written I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received of Man, nor from Man, nor Books, nor other Words, but by the Eternal Spirit, who saw these things, and was an Eye-Witness of them, and God through it hath revealed them in me and to me, that I might bear my Testimony of the hidden things of God, which are eternal; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have made Use of the Scriptures, and the Saints Words, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some, it is not for my sake, but thine, who readest, that so every Truth may be confirmed by two or three Witnesses; if thou wait to know and find the Key of <hi>David,</hi> who opens, in what I have declared, thou wilt see the State of things before the Fall, and after the Fall, and how all Men in the Fall have corrupted themselves in all Administrations; thou wilt see the State of the Church before the Apostacy, in the Apostacy, and what shall be after the Apostacy; and if thou cannot reach into the things, as they are declared, judge them not before the Day appear in thy self; for till then, they will be obscure to thee; but as it appears in thee, thou shalt bear me Witness that these are holy faithful and true, and have and shall be fulfilled, in that which is immutable, I bid thee farewel.</p>

but it shined upon all, in all, over all, and above all, was not hid; as I said, there was now no hiding Place, that could or did overshadow the Mystery of Godliness; for the Eyes of all things looked upon him, whether Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial or Terrestrial, and all and every thing, according to its Kind rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Light of his Countenance, and of his Power was glad, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in him, for then there was not another; he that can hear let him: Now the Earth rejoyced, and the Floods clapped their Hands; now the great Deep smiled, and all things that were therein, the Springs thereof laughed, which flowed forth as though they had issued out of a Womb; now every thing that had Breath and lived, praised the Lord, neither was there any thing but bowed and submitted to their Maker, and he Lord and King over all, yet in eternal Glory; yet let the wise in Heart understand, this was in the Beginning, and though it was in the Beginning, yet this was when the Heavens and the Earth were created, and all Things that therein are, even then the Lamb of God was alive, and the Son of God glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the Father, and Man in Happiness and in pure Perfection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin, in Innocency; for nothing that was nocent or hurtful had yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, neither was there any such Thing in all that God had made.</p>

No; For as the Soul, Spirit and Body was moved by the <hi>Power,</hi> out of which <hi>Power</hi> he was not to stir, then I say, he had Ability to perform the will of his Maker in the Body; for as he was created by the <hi>Power</hi> in the inward man, that led about the natural and earthly or outward form according to its will which Will was pure, and kept the Body acting in its Place in the <hi>Power,</hi> for then I say, all was good, for the Celestial <hi>Power</hi> in which he was made, moved the whole man, according to its Will; and while he stood in the <hi>Power,</hi> he was in Innocency, and Purity, and without Blemish, and in the <hi>Power</hi> was his Health and Peace, and he knew no Evil.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This declares that there was such a thing in being, to wit, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body, and an earthen Vessel, and yet without Sin, as he stood in the power; for the earthen Vessel was good, as all the rest of God's creation was in its Place to serve the <hi>Power,</hi> as the rest of God's Creatures did in the Beginning; and who ever comes to know that state again, may come to glorifie God in Soul, Body and Spirit, though in the Body, in this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle;

but take their own Phrase for the clearing of the thing, not to be freed from the committing of sin in this Life, I say, in the corruptible Life or the Life of Unrighteousness, which may be properly called Death, there is no freedom from Sin, neither of Soul or Body or Spirit; but who comes to know Regeneration or the Life of men, in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created in the Beginning, in that incorruptible Life, there is no Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and if he live in man; the Body is dead because of Sin, and I know none who have preached any other Life, who have spoken by the Spirit of God, in which freedom from all Sin is obtained, but onely the Life of Christ, and whosoever comes to know the Lord from heaven, who ruled over all in the Beginning, and was the Life of all, and all moved in his Life, before the fall, whether they were things visible or invisible, and that same <hi>Power</hi> or Life of Christ, the <hi>Lamb</hi> of God, who was alive then, if he live in man, and man come to be guided by his <hi>Power,</hi> as in the beginning he living in man, the Soul, Body and Spirit being quickned by his <hi>Power,</hi> and raised from under the Bondage of Corruption, then Death hath not power over man (but Life) and because he lives in them, they live also, their Souls to praise him, and their Bodies, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof to be Servants of righteousness, and so that unbelieving Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the World is turned into the Pit, and Truth is set above it.</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> But further it will be objected, <hi>That our Bodies are not like</hi> Adams, <hi>in innocency, we are in the Fall, and therefore we say, they hinder from being freed from all Sin, and ever will, while upon Earth.</hi>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40634:111"/>
the redemption of their Souls, and also the redemption of their body; For I deny redemption in the Grave, or in Death, or after this Life; for the holy men of God never mention a cleansing from Sin in the Grave, nor after men be Dead, for they that have served Sin in their Life time, &amp; served the Devil as long as they live, and have yeelded their Bodies to be Temples, for Uncleanness, while they live upon the Earth, eternal Misery will be their Portion, and not redemption: Think on this, you who are holding this forth for an Article of your Faith in the World, among poor Ignorant People, that they must not expect redemption from all Sin in this Life, and so leads them on to Perpetual Misery, Misery will be your End, and in the day of the Lord you shall Witness this to be true; But to return to the Beginning again, where there was no sorrow, but pure Joy and Peace both in Heaven and Earth, but I go hither and thither, as the Spirit leads, and shall speak as it gives Utterance, though but here a little and there a little, yet shall it be in Truth and Righteousness.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I say, he was made by the Word which abides forever, and in it which was in the Beginning with God, and was God, and God's Son and his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, and his Throne is established in Righteousness forever and ever, and in it self it is what it was ever, and after the Fall retained the same Power and Authority in it self, and so will do forever; Man's Power stood in it only, out of it he had none, so going out of it, dyed to it, and not any more Power to do, or to will, or to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or to rule any things but by it; but he lost the Feeling of it, and the Guidance of it, the Virtue of it and Life of it, and became dead to it, and alive in his Heart and Mind to another Power, to wit, the Power of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and to the Power of him which hath the Power of Death, which is the Devil; so God is clear, no Fault in him nor in the Power, nor Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Dominion and Authority which he had, but Destruction meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wholly and only of himself, and he is to bear his own Burthen.</p>
                     <p>Thus man receiving in the Devil's Conceptions, who was gone out of the Truth, and became one with it, feeding upon Knowledge without the Life (this was evil) thus Sin entered, and Death by Sin, man cut off from the Power, from Life, from the Dominion which he had in the Power; now man is dead while he lives, and in the Day he eat he dyed, dead to the Power, dead to the Life, dead to Good, dead to Truth, dead to Purity, dead to Righteousness, estranged and alienated from it; the Grave covers him, Death hath Preeminence, and bears rule, and not Life, and he gone into its Nature, and loves it and imbraces it.</p>

                     <p>I shall not deny but <hi>Peter</hi> baptized with Water, and <hi>Paul</hi> two or three Families, and thanks God he baptized no more; and said, <hi>he had declared the whole Counsel of God</hi>; and he makes not mention in all his Epistles, that Baptism was any Part of his Command; neither in all his Counsel to the Churches any where, doth he exhort either to <hi>Timothy, Titus</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or any of the Brethren, to baptize with Water; but as for <hi>Peter</hi>'s baptizing with Water, I know no more Command he had then <hi>Paul</hi>; as for the Commission which <hi>Matthew</hi> writes of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. &amp; 19. and that <hi>Mark</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. there is no Water; and so it's the Baptism of <hi>John,</hi> I grant, and Christ bearing Witness to <hi>John,</hi> that he was a Prophet, and did baptize many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore he or they, in Honour to <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry might baptize some, as well as <hi>Paul</hi> did circumcise <hi>Titus,</hi> and then in 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 7.19. said, <hi>It was nothing</hi>; and again in another Place, <hi>Neither Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion nor Uncircumcision did avail, but a new Creature</hi>; and because it was a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure which People did not idolize so much then, as they did Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the Weakness of the People for a time; and the wise in Heart may understand, that when any Representation or Figure outward was set up, it was not easily denyed again, nor an easie Thing to be laid down, when the thing signified was come; for many of the <hi>Jews</hi> believed in Christ, and were said to be Brethren, and yet they came from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and troubled the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and would have brought them under the Figure

I would ask the moderate a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether Water be not an Element, and pertains only to the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Part in man, which is to pass away and be dissolved, when the Seed is raised up, whose Nature is not elementary, but caelestial? I shall say no more to them at this present who are contentious, who are so zealous for their Water upon so weak a Ground, but take heed, that while you are striving about your outward Water, you neglect not the washing of Regeneration and the cleansing of the Spirit; many have been baptized, but which of you have received the holy Ghost? there is not one among you dare own or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness an infallible Spirit, but count it an Error, that any should speak, or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or look to enjoy any such thing in these Dayes; well, I say unto you, your Day is a Day of Darkness, and Gloominess you live in, and thick Darkness covers your Tabernacle; for whoever have received the holy Ghost or Spirit of Truth in any Measure, are led by that which is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not fallible; and if you look not for this, ye are no Sons, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all your washing the outside; <hi>For as many as are the Sons of God, are led by the Spirit of God</hi>; and this is witnessed, Praises to the Lord forever; the Lord is unto his People an everlasting Light; and this is the Sum, that Water is owned to be a Figure of the one Baptism, and was an Element, and pertained to that which is elementary; but the Elements shall melt with fervent Heat, and be dissolved in the Day of the Lord, and then the Seed comes up, which is Heir of the Promise, which is nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the VVater of Life, which is not an Element nor elementary, but is caelestial, and springs up in them that believe unto everlasting Life, and come to be born of the Water and the Spirit, and enter into God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Dominion, Power, Life, Wisdom, Excellency and eternal Glory; happy is he that believes and abides in Patience unto the End.</p>

                     <p>And the Protestants, they are setting up the Bread and the Wine, and contenting themselves therewith, and are making an Idol of it, and come not to discern the Body of Christ; but one saying, he hath <hi>a carnal Body</hi>; and another, <hi>a Fleshly Body</hi>; another, a <hi>Mystical Body</hi>; and another sayes, <hi>his Body is divided from his Members</hi>; and so speak out of thick Darkness, their own Imaginations, and have no communion with the Body of Christ, neither know the Flesh of Christ, <hi>which is the Bread of Life, which is given for the Life of the World, John</hi> 6.51.</p>
                     <p>And as Godliness began to work, and the Mystery thereof in the dayes of Christ and the Apostles, wherein the Lord discovered much of his Wisdom and Power, and manifested his pure Presence, and poured out his Spirit plentifully upon Sons and Daughters, and fulfilled that which <hi>Joel</hi> prophesied of, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. which came to be fulfilled after Christ's ascension, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. and <hi>They received the Holy Ghost, and spoke the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Things of God, as they were revealed by the Spirit,</hi> which shed it self abroad among them that waited for it; so also the Mystery of Iniquity began to work even in that time, and as the Apostles laid the Foundation of Truth, and declared the Truth, Christ to be the Foundation, even so the Mystery of Iniquity did Work, and a Beginning, or a Foundation of error was laid by them, who were gone out of the Truth, the false Prophets, Deceivers Anti-christs, who were Professors and Preachers, but they were such as were <hi>Covetous and Greedy of filthy Lucre, and made Merchandize of Souls for dishonest gain, and denyed the Power of God, Christ, and were Enemies to the Cross, and gloried in the Flesh, and spake Swelling words of Vanity, and did all live in the Lust of the Flesh, and were proud Boasters, and denyed the Lord that bought them</hi>; for denying the Power of God, they did deny Christ, though in Words they preached him, as this Generation, who are their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>springs do out of Strife and Contention, as the Apostles writes, and <hi>they held the Form of Godliness but denyed the Power</hi>; and they were they that once were Convinced of the Truth, and came into the form of Truth, but denyed the Power of Truth; but were in Craft and Deceit, and <hi>they subverted whole Houses from the Faith, and led them back into the World,</hi> into Unbelief, in the Apostles dayes, and yet had a worship, and did Worship, but not in the Power, not the Life, and this began to work, and wrought more cunningly, and Subtilly in the latter Times: And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in many of his Epistles, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> declare against them, and <hi>Paul</hi> prophesied of them before his departure, <hi>of grievous Wolves, which should spring up, which should not spare to make Havock of the Flock of Christ</hi>; so the false Apostles, Deceivers, Anti-christs, and deceitful Workers, they went out then, and did what they could to lead Disciples after them into the World; <hi>inwardly they were ravened from the Spirit, and were gone from it into the Earth, into the world, and served not the Lord Jesus

                  <p>Now when the Lord in this the day of his Power is appearing again, and the man-Child that is to rule the Nations with a rod of Iron.

                     <p>THe first particular, <hi>That the Nationall Ministers do maintain the true worship of God, and the Doctrine of Christ according to the revealed will of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> So saying, and so doing were something; the true Worship of God is in Spirit and in Truth, which is not <hi>Lo here, and lo there,</hi> nor in outward Observations, but in Life, in Power, and in Truth: But to be brief, both the Doctrine and Practice of the National Ministry in general, is contrary to the Scripture, which thou callst the Word of God; (as for Instance) their sprinkling of Infants, their teaching Men to Swear, and calling it part of the Worship of God, which is contrary to the Doctrine of Christ, who said, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> Their singing <hi>David's</hi> Psalms put into Meeter, by Poets and Ballad-mongers, singing them in their inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Tunes, which pleaseth the carnal Mind; their studied discourses, which you call Sermons, Invented from the strength of natural wit, and not speaking as they are moved by the holy Ghost, which the Ministers of Christ in all Ages did.</p>
                     <p>In these, and many other things which I could instance, they are out of the Doctrine of Christ; And in a word, your whole Worship differs both in matter and manner, from the Saints Worship in the Primitive Times.</p>
                     <p>But seeing we have denyed the National Ministers divers Years ago, and have laid down our Grounds and Reasons to the World, wherein we have charged them, that their practice is contrary to the Scripture; unto which Grounds and Reasons, not one Parish-master in <hi>England</hi> hath yet Vindicated themselves these six years. And unto that Book called, <hi>The Grounds and Reasons why we deny the Priests,</hi> if the Reader be not satisfied concerning them, there he may see how they err, both in Doctrine, and Practice, contrary to Scriptures.</p>

                        <p>And as for Ministers bringing Offenders before Magistrates, that is an usurped Authority, to make a Minister a Magistrate; but <hi>Edward,</hi> what was the offence? because a company of People came to <hi>Cressage,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Word of Truth in your Streets; and what if it had been in your Assembly; this was no offence in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where all might speak one by one, although it's become an Offence in your Mass-house at <hi>Cressage</hi>; but the Reader may judge in whose steps thou and thy Priest walkes; you have done the offence, and then accuseth others to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates as Offenders; Let shame cover your Lips, you Impudent men.

                        <p>In the fourth and fifth Particular thou saist, <hi>We have charged to be Envious and Bitter, and Malicious against the most eminent Ministers of the Land.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Them whom thou calls eminent Ministers, have charged us with many false things, and have written many false things against us, for which thou and they, in the Dreadful day of the Lord, shall give an account: Envy, Bitterness, and malice is put away from us, and we Envy no man, but speak the Truth in Soberness; and yet to say, a lyar is a Lyar; or a Deceiver, a Deceiver; or an hypocrite, an Hypocrite, when they are so, is neither Railing nor Malice: Christ, in whom no Guile was found, he said, <hi>They were a Generation of Vipers, and they were of their Father the Devil,</hi> who were in Envy, and went about to Kill him. And the Apostle was not envious when he said, <hi>O full of all Subtilty, thou child of the Devil,</hi> to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40634:131"/>
one who was doing the Work of the Devil; and many such workers we find, and many Venomous Spirits who shoot out poysoned Arrows, even bitter Words, and these we must reprove sharply.</p>
                        <p>And those things which thou layest to our charge, take to thy self; for the ground of Iniquity is in thy Heart, from whence thou hast uttered forth all these Disdainful, Proud, and Scornful words, of which thou shalt be Convinced, and also reproved when the Lord searcheth thy Heart, when he brings Anguish and Perplexity upon thee, then shalt thou confess to his righteous Judgment; and so thy five Principles I have answered, which thou sayest, thou hast <hi>brought into thy Book to fill up the Blancks</hi>; they had better have been blancks still, then have spoiled so much Paper with thy Lying, Disdainful, Scribles, which are not worth the answering.</p>
                        <p>In the third page thou saist, <hi>Thou wilt restate the reputation of the Ministry of</hi> England <hi>to be Minister of Christ</hi>; And for proof, thou hast brought <hi>Col.</hi> 1.7. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. Those words prove that <hi>Epaphras</hi> was a faithful Minister, and that <hi>Paul</hi> was a Minister of Christ to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; but what hath this proved as to the National Priests? nothing at all; and if thou hast no better proof then this, to bring them into Reputation, instead thereof thou wilt bring defamation upon them; and when thou shouldst prove them Ministers, thou provest that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Epaphras</hi> were Ministers; will not the least in the Truth see thee to be a busy-body? but Fools will be medling: Then thou art offended that we call them Priests for receiving of Tythes; I say it's the most proper; for none but Priests and Levites did receive Tythes, and how long since is it, since they generally called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi>? For never Minister of the Gospel, nor of the word of Reconciliation, either received Tythes, or commanded that they should be payed, neither reproved any for not paying; but said, the Priest-hood was changed, and the Law was changed by which Tythes were due; but thou goest on, and makest a sound Argument as thou judgest, and sayst, <hi>Abraham paid Tythes to</hi> Melchisedeck <hi>before the Law</hi>; And thou askest, <hi>how he did give it, either by the Law of Nature, which is called the Law of Reason, or by the Light within, or by Revelation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thou speakest thou knowst not what; where readest thou of the Law of Nature, called the Law of Reason, except it be in the devised Fables and Stories of the Priests? But what doth this prove? <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the tenth part of the Spoil which he had taken from his Enemies, but <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> first brought forth Bread and Wine to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and greeted <hi>Abraham</hi> and his company Kindly, and Blessed him, and <hi>Abraham</hi> freely gave unto him the tenth part, <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> desired none; But dost thou judge, that if <hi>Abraham</hi> had given him none, that he would have taken by Force the tenth part of the Spoil from him?</p>
                        <p>Now what doth this prove for the Tything-Priests of this Nation? they must first do as <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> did, if they will have <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> for an Example, he Blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and brought forth Bread and Wine unto him and his Army; but which of the Priests have done so, which have received Tythes; which is not a gift of the People, but a forced thing from them? If this must be thy proof for Tythes by the gift of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then let the Priests cease forcing and taking them, till People be freely willing to give them, and then there will be no complaint: But let us Reason a little further of this matter; Would <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> have taken the tenth,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40634:131"/>
if <hi>Abraham</hi> had not given it him? Or when did <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> or any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law take away the Peoples Oxen, Cows, Horses, Sheep, Pots and Pans, and Bedding upon which poor people lie, three-Fold, four-Fold, and sometimes ten-Fold; that they claim, or sue People to Courts, throw them into Prison till Death, as many Evidences we have in this Nation? either give us a Precept, or an Example before the Law, or under the Gospel, or else stop your Lying Mouths, and clamorous Tongues forever. Dost thou and the rest of the Priests think that we are so Ignorant, that we know not the Original of the Tythes in these Nations? a thing invented to fill the Popes Coffers, and the rest of the Clergies budgets, seven or eight hundred Years after the Ascension of Christ? All which Tythes and Oblations, and Obventions were invented in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, since the dayes of the Apostles, and since the Woman fled into the Wilderness: And the man-Child was caught up to God, when all the World wondred after the Beast, then they had their rise; And when the Kings and Rulers of these Nations did drink of the Whore's cup, then they made Laws to compel the Nations and the People therein, to pay the Whore's Merchants; and the Pope's Locusts, which he sent over the Nations, to fill the Earth with their Deceit, which Laws stand yet in force as though they were some Divine institution; but both the Tythes and the Law, by which they are compelled to be paid, we deny, and bear our witness against, as to be things which hold up the Devil's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the Gospel which the National Ministry holds up and preaches, hath no more ability in it to procure a Maintenance for them, then the Papists Gospel did for them: So, to be brief, the Priests have the Popes Wages forced by a compulsory Law, made and ratified by them who owned the Popes Supremacy.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore we assert, that Tythes were never due by divine Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only to the Priests and Levites in the first Covenant, nor never were commanded to be paid but in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; and whoso upholds the Ordinances of the first Priest-hood, denyes the Ordinances of the second: So this Commandment to pay Tythes now to them, who are neither of <hi>Aaron's</hi> nor <hi>Levi's</hi> Tribe, and by us who are not in <hi>Canaan</hi> temporal, nor of <hi>Israel</hi> according to the Flesh, the Commandment by which Tythes were due in the first Priest-hood, reaches not unto us. And after Christ's Ascension, not one of the Apostles either commanded or required any such Practice of the Saints, either to <hi>Colossia, Corinth, Antioch, Philippi, Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> or the rest of the Churches in <hi>Asia.</hi> So that it's evident to all judicious men, that this is quite another thing got up in the Apostacy, which no Minister or believer ever did own, who were Witnesses of the second Covenant; but any who are not satisfied in this thing by what I have said, which much more I could say, concerning this thing; but I refer them that are not satisfied, to a Book called, <hi>The great Case of Tythes stated,</hi> published by <hi>A. P.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In thy fourth and fifth page, thou art pleading <hi>for Master-ship for thy Ministers,</hi> and so by thy own Argument thou hast proved them out of the Doctrine of Christ, who said, to his Ministers, <hi>call no man Master, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ye called Masters</hi>; but to oppose this, thou brings <hi>John.</hi> 3 10. how Christ said to <hi>Nicodemus, art thou a Master in</hi> Israel?

but Christs. In some Translations it is <hi>Ruler in Israel.</hi> In another, <hi>Teacher in Israel:</hi> But it may be, some who coveted after mastership as thou dost, have put in Master for Ruler &amp; Teacher; but grant the word Master Christ testified that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> that they were called of men Master, and reprehended them for it: And if he did say to <hi>Nicodemus, art thou a Master</hi>? he spoke but in their Language, not with approbation of their being so called; for it's manifest he gave a contrary Command to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the Commands of Christ did not contradict one another. And as for <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> and <hi>Samuel Smith,</hi> whose Works thou sayest, do witness for them beyond thy Testimony.</p>

                        <p>In thy sixth and seventh page thou sayest, <hi>The Pharisaical Quakers make void the fifth Commandment, because they do not put off their Hats to Political and spiritual Fathers,</hi> as thou callst them; and thou heapst up a great deal of Scripture to no purpose, not one word in them all doth prove any such thing, as putting off Hats either to Fathers, Spiritual or Temporal, and so thou art a preverter and a wrester of it to thy own Destruction; and thou cites <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. to prove putting off Hats, render to all their dues, <hi>tribute to whom tribute; and this is the Tribute of the Nation,</hi> thou sayest. And the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of Man,</hi> this thou bringst. Ignorant Block, shew us either plain Scripture, or example from the Saints, where it is commanded or commended, or from any Ordinance of man, or else cease thy foolish Clamour, and learn a Bridle for thy Tongue, and cease thy foolish Inferences. If the Magistrates had no better Tribute then putting off the Hat, they would soon be poor Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: And whereas thou callest it <hi>Civil worship, doffing the Hat, and bowing the Knee,</hi> I know no more civility in it, then if thou shouldst put off thy Coat or thy Doublet to every one thou meetest with; And most of this which thou calls civility, is the most practised by them who are the Rudest, Vainest, and the Phantastickst proud Anticks in the Nations, who are full of Flattery and Deceit, and vain Complements; and to a proud Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with a gay Cloak, or powdered Hair, and a deal of Silver lace dawbed upon his Cloaths, then off goes the Hat, and the Knees bow, <hi>and your Servant Sir, and your Servant my Lord, or your most humble Servant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <p>
                           <pb n="227" facs="tcp:40634:132"/>The customs of the Heathen are vain, and many in <hi>Israel</hi> who feared the Lord, were not to walk after the Customs of the Nations; for this Deceit was not from the beginning and who ever comes to be a follower of Christ, who received no Honour of men, neither respected Persons, will deny this deceit. Take him for thy example, rather then a company of Fidlers, and Roysters, and Ruffins, who are without the fear of God; and Christ, who is the Saints Example, he said, <hi>How can you believe, that seek and receive Honour one of another</hi>: So then, they were Unbelievers who sought and received Honour one of another; and wouldst thou and the rest who live in deceit, bring the custom of Unbelievers, and the practice of Unbelievers among the Saints, who are believers, and follow Christ their example? I say, we have no such Custom, nor the Churches of Christ.</p>
                        <p>The next piece of Deceit thou art pleading for, is bowing to one another the Knee, and Titles of Honour, wherein the Devil hath a great hold among people. <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.14. This thou bringst to prove Bowing; <hi>Judah</hi> and his Brethren came to <hi>Joseph's</hi> House, and they fell on the Ground; This is an example indeed. Wilt thou take another; the same Brethren of <hi>Joseph</hi> sold him when he was a Boy; was that a good act? If thou sayst nay; I say one is as much commanded and commended as the other; for that same that doth Violence, it's the same that respects Persons; but <hi>Abraham</hi> bowed to the Children of <hi>Heth</hi>; what of that? So did <hi>Joseph</hi> Swear by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and both <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> were good men but they were never the better for these Actions, neither the one nor the other: But then thou brings a Scripture, and thou saith, it must stop our Mouthes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.8.10. And thou saist, this may Teach us, if we be of <hi>Jacob's</hi> Seed and houshold, <hi>To bow to the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>our King; and why should this stop our Mouthes? But the Scepter shall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Law-giver from between his Feet till</hi> Shilo <hi>come</hi>: So he was to Rule, to wit <hi>Judah,</hi> till <hi>Shilo</hi> came; why should this stop our Mouths? <hi>Shilo</hi> is come, and hath opened our Mouths, and the Scepter is departed from <hi>Judah</hi> long since; both them that bowed to <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> that was once Bowed unto, they are both Bowed under, and <hi>Shilo</hi> is set above, and now he must be bowed unto; go learn what that means.

Correct thy Pen, and let no such Popish Phrases come in Print again, lest thou shamest thy self more, instead of shaming of us: And thou concludest, <hi>If any say, here he is, or there he is on Earth, believe them not.</hi> Where learnedst thou this Article of Faith, I pray thee shew me? Is he not both in Heaven and Earth? How should he restore the Earth and all things into their purity, if he must not be manifest in the Earth? What! wilt thou confine him to, or in a place? Doth not his Presence fill Heaven and Earth? Is he divided from his Presence?</p>
                        <p>But may be thou wilt say, as thy Generation doth, that he is in the Earth by his Spirit, and in Heaven in his Body or Person, distinct from his Spirit. If so, then you divide Christ, and a Person without a Spirit, and not Christ. I will aske thee a Question; <hi>No man hath Ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, the Son of man which is in heaven</hi>; Where was the Son of man, or the Man Christ, when this was spoken?</p>
                        <p>If thou canst see this, thou mayst be ashamed to shut Christ out of the Earth, or from among his Saints, where his Presence, his Arm, his hand and his Power is, which is not divided from his Body; but I know thou art deaf, and canst not hear what I say, and thou bringst <hi>Heb.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. <hi>After he had offered one Sacrifice, sate down at the right hand of God</hi>; that is, saist thou, <hi>In his human Nature.</hi> The shame is come upon thy self, who hast added thy own Imagination; and let all see whether the Scriptures speak of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature; but thy folly must be manifest to all.</p>
                        <p>Thy third Particular that thou namest, and as thou sayest shamest, is, <hi>If we say we are without Sin, we deceive our Selves.</hi> Thou hadst better have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired perfectly whether we said so or no, before thou hadst undertook to reprove upon so doubtfull terms, and thou bringst <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>For who can say my Heart is clean.</hi> He can say so, and speak Truth, whose Heart God hath cleansed by the Blood of Christ from all Sin: And then thou bringst <hi>Job</hi> 9.20. <hi>If I justifie my self, my own Mouth shall condemn me.</hi> That's true, we justifie not our selves, neither self; but deny self, and self is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and Christ, God's Righteousness is become our Justification. And then thou bringest <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, but follow after, that I may apprehend.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What of that? he was in his growth, and was come to that which was perfect, and did believe to attain to the Stature of a perfect man.</p>
                        <p>And then thou saist, <hi>I tell you, you are not perfect, your contempt of the Ministers of Christ, and perverting the Doctrine of Christ are characters of Sin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That shall stand for thy self, and thy Masters whom thou art joyned with, who set up Popish trumpery instead of the Ordinance of Christ; and set up the precepts of men, introduced in the Apostacy, for the Doctrine of Christ: And then thou concludest, the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, all in the first <hi>Adam</hi>; but I hope the Scripture doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all under Sin in the second <hi>Adam</hi>; neither doth conclude him under Sin that's born of God, who Sins not. And if thou makest any such conclusion, thou givest thy verdict for the Devil, and not for God: then
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40634:136"/>
thou sayest, <hi>I am not pleading for Sin.</hi> Thou art pleading for nothing else but for Sin and Imperfection, in which the Devil's Kingdom stands; and thou sayest, thou hast cause to cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am</hi>! So thou hast indeed; hast thou repented of thy Drunkenness? How long is it since thou fell'st off a Bridge, being Drunk, and broke thy Leg? but it is like, for thy good Service done to thy Master, in writing this lying scrole, he will give thee an Absolution for that Transgression.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Particular which thou call'st our Tenet, is, <hi>That we deny the Scripture to be the Word of God</hi>; And thou hast brought many Scriptures to prove that they are; but they are as impertinent to the thing, as thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer about the Steeple-house, or Mass-house. Thou hast brought many Scriptures, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37.8. how they are called the words of the Lord, who ever denyed that? but the Word spoke the words, and the Word is greater. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by divine In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then thou may be wilt conclude, I deny the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy.</hi> I deny the Word <hi>Is,</hi> it is an Addition of the TRANSLATOR, which Word alters and varies in the true sense of that Scripture; but all Scripture given by Inspiration of God, is profitable for Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But knowest thou no dinstinction between Inspiration and Tradition? You have it by Tradition; the Saints by Inspiration. It's a dead Letter in it self, and as it is spoken from your Mouthes, who speak of it by tradition; but from them that were Inspired, the living Spirit uttered forth living Words; But what is all this to prove the Scripture or writings to be the Word of God.

It is granted, they are the words of God? and the Words of Holy men Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: So in thy own words, I say, take thou notice, though thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident and presumtuous, in this thou hast shamed thy self, and not us; the Word was before either Scripture, Writings, or Bible was; which Word is greater, and gave them a Being: And thou that wouldst set that which is brought forth by the Father, above the Father, art out of the Apostles wisdom, speaking a similitude; He that builds a House, receives more Honour then the House. Now to call the Scripture the Word, is to give as much honour to the House, as to him that builded it; but in a word, this I say, whatever the Scripture doth testifie of it self, or call it self, that I own it to be: And if any man call it another thing, it shall testifie against him; and so thou that hast gone about to set up the Word which were spoken in time, above or equal with the Word, that was before all time, art Ignorant, and Unskilfull in the Knowledge of GOD, and silence would better become thee.</p>

                           <pb n="235" facs="tcp:40634:136"/>I say, we have declared more in the World then they do receive or believe, and we have published the Will of God to the Earth in many things, and shall further proceed as the Spirit of the Lord shall direct us: And that which we would have, is, the old Dragon chained, and the Whore burnt with Fire, &amp; her Merchants cease Trading, and the Sea dryed up, upon which she sits, and upon which the Merchants Trade, and the Beast and all the false Prophets, Deceivers, and Anti-christs, which have all had their rise since the Ascension of Christ, we would have these be all shut in the Pit again; and we would have the Lamb to Reign, and the everlasting Gospel to be preached again, the Power of God; and we would have the Earth restor'd; and we would have everlasting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to reign in the Hearts of People, and Laws as at the first, and Counsellors as in the Beginning, who judge not for rewards; and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, such as were in the Primitive times, who will preach without Tythes, Hire, and set Wages, and without the Popes maintenance. If thou canst receive these things, I will shew thee further, it may be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if I hear any more from thee. And we are the men that are raised up for the Work, to declare against Pride in the Ground, and also in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as against <hi>Lace, Cuffs</hi> and <hi>Ribbons</hi>; And thou askest, if there be nothing else? Hast thou denyed these, and the Spirit that leads to the abuse of God's Creatures? when thou hast, I will shew unto thee there is something else to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if thou dost not obey that which is manifest, why wouldst thou know more, to add to thy Condemnation? And we do not say, that casting off these things is all that is required to Salvation: thou bidst us declare if there be any thing else; so I shall, so that thou hearken to it, and receive it, else thy Condemnation shall be greater then if I had written nothing. Thou must repent of all thy Sin, and turn from it, and know the Judgment of God for it, and deny thy self in every thing; and lay down thy Life also, and take up his Cross daily, and be Crucified to the world, and cease from all thy own Words, actions and Thoughts, and come to taste of Death, before thou come to know him to live in thee to be thy Salvation; canst thou do this? when thou witnessest this done, then thou shalt know further what God requires; but a Terrible day will come upon thee, before these things be fulfilled in thee; though thou be more stout then thy Fellows, I know him who is able to break thy Horn which thou hast exalted against the Lamb of God and his followers.</p>
                        <p>And for thy Exhortation, <hi>Not to feed on Husks,</hi> take it home to thy self, for thou hast nothing else to feed upon; the Words of the Saints at best, without the Life, or else some innovated, invented Trumpery of the Whore, of whose Cup thou hast Drunk, makes thee speak forth all these Venomous words against the Life and Power of God in his People.</p>
                        <p>And thou concludest, <hi>What thou hast written is as much for Conversion as Refutation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Both alike indeed, for thou hast done neither; but hast conceived and brought forth wind, and spent thy time for nought. Alas poor man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tellest thou of Converting, who art not come out of the Gross pollutions of the world, who art not ceased from Drunkenness, and art pleading for Mass-houses, Tythes, Hirelings, and Popish inventions, and art offended we should declare against Ribbons, Cuffs, and Lace? what

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40634:144"/>
and your Enterprizes cursed; what is not your Gospel able to defend it self, but you must take up the Beast's Weapons, <hi>Cain</hi>'s Weapons (the Murderer) the Devil's Weapons, to defend your Church and State, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weapons, hellish Weapons, the Dragon's Weapons? Hath your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Merchants, the hireling Priests) made you believe that this is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox received Opinion? They received this out of the bottomless Pit, and the Weapons (with all that handle them) shall go down thither again, and the Lamb shall reign over the Beast and his Followers; though you have established Wickedness by a Law, and think your selves secure, yet God will provoak you, that the Rottenness of your Hearts may be brought forth, and that all your Deceit may be made manifest, that all that fear the Lord may come out from amongst you, for Wo and Misery shall compass your Tabernacle, and the Dread of God is against you.</p>
                     <p>AND the next thing whereby the Devil and his Ministers fortifie themselves, are certain Articles exhibited by them (like the Pope's Inquisition, although they are full of Ignorance and Blasphemy) and these they intend to impose upon any man, and if they answer not according to their blind Understandings, then they say, <hi>They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed as Hereticks, and must be sent to Prison, and if they do not retract, banished and whipped in the mean Time, and his Estate made Havock on, and then banished, not to return upon Pain of Death, and if he do return, to be put to Death</hi>; and this is the Fruit of their Orthodox received Principles, and of the laudable Custom of <hi>New-England.</hi> And now I come to the Articles.</p>

the Shepherds by the Star which led them where the Child was; and so for thee to conclude all like thy self, is Presumption without Knowledge; and Christ was revealed by and through his Spirit to the Saints in Light, and yet the words testifie of him; and many have the words; and yet they are a sealed Book, and are not any way or means unto them, as to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Christ, so that Christ said unto a learned Generation, <hi>You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God;</hi> and yet they were frequent Readers of the Scriptures, yet ignorant of the Spirit through which God maketh manifest his Mind, and maketh known his will, by what way and means he pleaseth, to the Sons of Men: Yet this we say, that God may make manifest his Son by his Spirit what way he will, and yet the Scripture is not excluded, for the things of God are spiritually discerned; and the natural man may have the words, as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had, without the Spirit: But this is the Sum, all this striving is to set up the words above the Spirit, and the Scripture above the Life.</p>
                  <p>And thou goest on, and sayest, <hi>That thou wonderest that men should not be able to distinguish Christ to be the way, and the Scriptures to be the way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say, there are not two wayes, but one way and one Life, and none comes to the Father, but by the way, and he is the way and the means too; for he is said to be the Leader of his Flock, and of the Sheep of his Pasture, unto whom he giveth eternal Life; eternal Life is found in him, out of him there is none; and them that seek without him, shall never find the way to Rest; and thy many Distinctions of way and way do cast a Mist before Peoples Eyes, and do darken their Understandings, and would lead them from the one way of Life.</p>
                  <p>And thou askest how those Scriptures can be reconciled? Cor. 1.11. <hi>Other Foundation can no Man lay then that which is laid, Jesus Christ.</hi> Ephes. 2.20. <hi>And are built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being chief corner-Stone,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>in whom ye also are builded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These two Scriptures are reconciled already, and were never at Enmity nor at Discord; for he which had the word of Reconciliation committed unto him, write them both; dost thou think he laid one Foundation to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and another to the <hi>Ephesians?</hi> Christ was the Foundation to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and no other could be laid; and were not all the Saints Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the Houshold of God, builded upon this Foundation, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Habitation of God through the Spirit? But thou would'st have two Foundations, as thou hast laboured to prove two Wayes, and eternal Life to be found in two distinct things, as that eternal Life is found in Christ, and that eternal Life is found in the Scriptures; and then hast brought all this striving to nothing, and say'st, <hi>That we must not imagine that eternal Life lyeth in Words or Sentences</hi>: I say, if thou had'st not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined so thy self, thou would'st not have made all this Contest for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Writings, consisting of Words and Sentences except thou judgest, as some of thy ignorant Brethren have done, that eternal Life and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is inseparable; or that the Scripture and the Spirit cannot be separated: And if thou judgest so, then these that have the Words and Sentence of the Scripture, have eternal Life and the Spirit, and such dark Doctrines the Land hath been filled with; thou wouldst make Distinctions betwixt way and way, Light and Light, and put Distinctions where there are none,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40634:152"/>
and yet where the Spirit distinguisheth, thou either cannot or wilt not; that doth not distinguish betwixt a visible &amp; an invisible, betwixt that which is given forth in time, and that which gave forth the words, which is Life it self, which was before all time.</p>
                  <p>Next thing thou comest unto, <hi>The Scripture is the Gospel, and the Scripture is the Word of God</hi>; and this thou countest great Ignorance for any to oppose: and thou sayest, <hi>Thou supposest that we do not know what the word Scripture meaneth; is it not the Gospel, that</hi> (thou say'st) <hi>was preached by Christ and his Apostles? and what they preached was written, and may be called the Word of God, for it is full of Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may more then be supposed that thou art ignorant, for thou hast really manifested it, that gross Darkness covereth thee, and Blindness hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to thee through thy Unbelief; and it's really apparent, that thou knowest not what the Word Scripture meaneth, who callest it the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi>; hast thou not learned to distinguish betwixt the Subject declared of, and the Declaration; betwixt a man which speaks, and the Words which come from a man; betwixt that which is visible, and that which is invisible; betwixt that which may be seen which is temporal, and that which is everlasting and eternal?</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures are writings, which may be seen and read with a natural Eye or Ear, but that which the Scripture declares of, cannot be seen with a Natural Eye; neither heard with a Natural Ear: Knowest thou no difference betwixt a Creator and a Creature? Is not that which createth greater then that which is Created? And was it not the eternal Power that gave the words a being, or thou hadst never had them? And were it not ignorance for any man to say, that the Creature were the Creator? Judge in thy self: For thee to call that which is brought forth, by the Name of that which brought it forth, is great Ignorance: And is it any Derogation unto the Creature to call it by its own Name? But it is dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the Creator to call the Creature by the Creator's Name; so for thee to call the writings the Power of God, or the Gospel, or word, is to attribute that to the Declaration, which properly belongs to the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of, which is far greater in Magnitude, in Glory and Excellency, in Power and Virtue; insomuch that the Apostle said, when he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken largely of the Power of God, and of his unsearchable Riches, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>O the Height, and the Breadth, and the Length, and the Depth thereof was to speakable,</hi> or could not be spoken, <hi>which was unsearchable, and past find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out!</hi> The Declaration or the Scripture may be enjoyed, and not the Power of God, which is the Gospel of Christ.</p>

                  <p>Thou sayest, <hi>Thou wilt remove a gross Mistake from us, who think that you cry up the Letter of the Scripture, and separate the Word from the Spirit; for we own the Spirit going along with the VVord, for the VVord and the Spirit are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the instrumental Cause, and Christ and his Spirit in the Gospel is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cause.</hi>

Spirit and Love and Truth, in Joy and gladness of Heart, even as when <hi>Israel</hi> kept the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>
                  <p>And now I shall come to let the Reader see, how thou hast falsified our Words which thou hast added thy own Imaginations to, and then hast quoted our Books to make People believe they are our words, whenas they are thy own forged lyes, the which I shall return upon thee.</p>
                  <p>First, Thou sayest George Fox, <hi>In Truth defended</hi> saith, <hi>that Preaching the Word, Praying and singing are no Appointments of Christ,</hi> whenas he saith no such thing, but the Hireling Priests divinations and feigned Prayers and other mens words in Rhime and Meeter are the Inventions of men, and not the Ordinances of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thou saist, E. B. <hi>In Truth defended</hi> saith, <hi>The Priest taking Tythes in the time of the Law was Evil, and proved them to be false Prophets and Deceivers</hi>; Whenas he saith quite contray, that the Priests took Tythes under the Law, according to the Command of God, but now the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was changed, and the Law was changed; and them what Preach for Hire, and seek for their Gain from their quarter, or take Tythes, are in the steps of false Prophets and Deceivers, and no Ministers of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That it's dangerous for the ignorant and Unlearned to read the Scripture, and the Ministers of it are the Ministers of Death</hi>: Now thou hast detracted from the Words; There it is said, that it is dangerous for thee to take the Scripture to War against the Saints withal, and to make a trade with it, and give carnal Exposition, and then sell them for Money.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thou tellest of one Master <hi>Kellet</hi> in <hi>Lancashire</hi> and his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; <hi>Whether did not Christ Institute his last Supper with Bread and Wine</hi>? and <hi>R. H.</hi> saith, the Bread which Christ called his Body is his Church, which words thou hast mangled and perverted, as thou hast done the most thou hast medled with, and there is no such man as Master <hi>Kellet</hi>; the words are these in <hi>Truth's Defence,</hi> p. 103. <hi>Christ did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>E. B.</hi> In answer to <hi>Firmin,</hi> his words thou hast perverted, and would bring this as a contradiction of <hi>R. H.</hi> thou saist, <hi>He allows only the Wicked and Ungodly to read the Scripture, such as the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Pharisees <hi>and not the godly</hi>; And not the godly is thy own Addition: he spoke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who thought to have Eternal Life in the Scripture, he saith, this was spoken to the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and not to believers, yet Believers are not excluded from reading the Scripture, for them it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to, and they understand it; but thou art like the Spider where the Bee gathers Honey, gathers that which is corrupt, and in thy conclusion of thy Story thou takest in Hand to supplicate God; and thou saist it is <hi>for the help of them that need it,</hi> this thou might have spared till the old Prelates had come up again, it may be some Synod of them will add to the Book of Common-Prayer thy late Service and Worship; dost thou think the Lord will hear thy Hypocrisie and Lyes, without returning his Judgment on thy Head?</p>
                  <p>Thou tellest of some that <hi>set light of Christ, and his Blood, and Word:</hi> thou art one of them that set light of Christ, and count his Blood as a vain thing,

as thy own Words in thy Book shall testifie, where the Reader may observe, when we have testified of <hi>the true Light, which lighteth every Man that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the World, who is the Way to the Father,</hi> thou hast set down out Words for Blasphemy and Error, when divers of them are the Words of Scripture, and none of them but the Scripture will testifie unto against thee; and as for the Blood of Christ, and the Blood of the everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant thou countest a vain thing and an unholy thing, even which clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from Sin, and bears witness against it, and subdues it, and makes them that receive it Conquerers over Sin; but thou that cryest out against Perfection or Freedom from Sin, and countest this Error and Blasphemy, thou denyest that which sanctifieth and cleanseth from Sin, and countei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40634:174"/>
are more sound then thine, though thou wouldst bring them to strengthen thee, that the Son of God hath not enlightned every man, they confess, the Man in the fall is in Darkness, and Darkness is over him, and in that he is not able to comprehend the Light which is in him; and as to the Improvement of it, in the Darkness man hath not Power to improve it to Salvation, but what doth this invalidate the Light which is in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? the Power of improving is in the Light, being turned to again and received; and what if I say, it is the Light of Life in its self, though thou deny it? I knowest what I speak; for in him was Life and is Life, and that Life is the Light of men, and the Light of the World, and so that Light, which every man is lighted with, is of the Life and from the Life, and so may truly be said, to be the Light of Life in it self, though man in the Transgression doth not feel it so as to him, but may truly say, it is the Light of Condemnation, because he feels it so in the Operation thereof, being in the Transgression, it convicteth, reproveth, accuseth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth for Evil, and therefore it cannot be the Light of Life to him, till it be received, closed with, obeyed and followed, and then the back is turned upon the Transgression, and man is come out of the Darkness; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle spoke well, and understandingly, according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that which was ordained for Life wrought Death in him, that was because the Law was against him, and he in the contrary Nature to it, the ignorance of many wise Men (so accounted) in this Generation is such, that when they see or feel contrary Effects, they judge there must needs be contrary Subjects or Objects, because there are different Effects; for now the same Light which shews Evil and accuses for it, and Judges for it, there is one Operation, and excuses him that loves it and obeyes it, here is another Operation, that which Convinceth the World of Sin, of Righteousness and of Judgment, and that which consolates and gives Peace to the Believer, is the self same Spirit; so here is not two Spirits or two Lights; so that he which kindles a Fire in the Earth, and appears in flames of Fire, and rendereth Vengeance upon all them that obey not the Gospel, which is the Power of God, here is one Work or operation of Christ, the same bringeth Peace, Joy, and gladness, and refreshment, and makes the springs of Life to bubble up in them that believe, here is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Operation, yet the same Christ; these things I write to inform thee, and all where this may come, that that is truly an Appearance of Christ, which sheweth Sin and condemns it in a measure, and he alone is the Judge of the Quick and the Dead, and if all Judgment be committed to the Son, then to be Judged for Lying, for Stealing, and for wronging any man, it is the Work of Christ, and the Work of the Son. Oh man! thou hast much to Repent of, and thy Ignorance is great, which hast called, Christ the Light or the Light of Christ, or the Light of Life, Darkness, and contra-distinct to the Spirit, and worse then gross Darkness; so this is thy conclusion against the first of <hi>John</hi> &amp; the 9th, that Christ hath not enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every man, or all men that come into the World, but all men so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of every sort; so then by thy conclusion the first of <hi>John</hi> and the 6. verse gives an uncertain Sound, like the 17th of <hi>John</hi> and 22th so then its Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of men that procures Light from Christ, and so its not of Grace but of debt, but if it be of debt, which is owing unto a Person so qualified,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40634:175"/>
then it is not of Gift, but thou err'st in thy Judgement, for it is by the gift of Righteousness that Justification comes upon all that believe, it is not this or that Qualification before their conversion, which is any cause of God's enlightening them, but it is the free Love of God unto man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Exceptions, or respect of Persons that he hath lighted every man, to the intent, that all and every man might see his Error and depart from it, and turn to him that shews him it, who would have all men saved and come to the Knowledge of the Truth; and such is the large Love of God unto whole Man-kind, which thou wouldst restrict and bind up to such and such Persons so Qualified, as though Qualifications of Persons were a Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause, wherefore Christ was Bound to give them Light, this is rank Popery, and not according to the Doctrine of Godliness.</p>

and deliver up to Satan, as you say, yet you being in Satan's Power, that which is against you hath Power over you; and therefore you are fain to Cry up the Beast's Power, which alwayes made War with the Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of Hereticks, and you say, that in exercising of his Power is but defensive; I say, yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is offensive and destructive to the Goverment of Christ and his Prerogative, unto whom all Power belongs both in Heaven and Earth, and the Goverment lyes upon his shoulders, who is a wonderful Counsellor, of whose Goverment there is no End; and he is able to defend his Church; and furthermore to take away thy Objection is willing, and furthermore hath promised to keep his Church that the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it; and therefore thou who wouldst have the Civil Magistrate to intrude into those things which belong not to him, would have them Usurpers and Traytors unto Christ the Prince of Peace, and the King of his People, and head of the Church his Body, unto whom absolute Power and Soveraignity belongs and Glory, which he will not give to another: And as for all the proofs which thou bringst of the Magistrates under the first Covenant, they are all invalid, as to the second Covenant, for all the Kings &amp; Magistrates in the first Covenant what as they did in and about Religion, as to the punishment of the false Prophets, and them that had familiar Spirits and Wizards, they were but Typical as in reference unto Christ the second Covenant, who hath another way to kill the false Prophets and to make War against Heresie and Blasphemy, and against all Sorcerers, Deceivers and Anti-christs, by the two-edged Sword, which proceeds out of his Mouth, with which his Enemies shall be slain, who will not that he should Rule and exercise his spiritual Power against his spiritual Enemies; Is not Heresie an Errour, an inbred thing? And is an outward Sword like to reach to that? Therefore though thou mayst press the Magistrates, or them whom thou callst so by their Cocerive power, as thou callst it, and promise to them divine Benediction, like the <hi>Pope,</hi> for making of Laws against that which thou and others may Judge Blasphemy and Heresie, and Execute them with Whips and Ropes and cutting off Ears, and destroying the Creature, yet this doth not reach to Heresie and Blasphemy, and all the Balm and Physick that you have in <hi>New-England,</hi> wherein your Hope standeth, as hath yet appeared, are your Knotted whips and pitched Ropes, Banishment and Death; here is Balm and Physick indeed with destroyes the Creation; And what! was <hi>Paul</hi> a Magistrate who Censured <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>? or else what dost thou bring this for?</p>

                  <p>Thou sai'st, <hi>Liberty of Conscience, and Liberty for Errour and Heresie are two things; and the Errour of Conscience is a Liberty to Bondage,</hi> and thou bringst, <hi>They shall put you out of the Synagogues,</hi> John 16. <hi>and to think to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Saints was Service unto God, was not from Conscience but Errour of Conscience</hi>; but the Object thou sai'st, <hi>Subjected to the Coercive Power must be some act of the outward man</hi>; and further thou sai'st, <hi>There is a difference bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween quiet Heresie and turbulent Heresie, Schism and Sedition.</hi>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, Liberty of Conscience, and Liberty of Error and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie are two things, but these lye both without the Power and the Line of any Civil Power, as Civil Power to reach unto, the one he should encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that is to say, them who exercise a pure Conscience towards God and towards Man; and as for the other, Error in Judgement, it's beyond the Power of the Civil Magistrate to rectifie, but as it puts forth it self in outward Acts of Wickedness, as to kill, steal, murder, adultery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding, cozening and cheating in outward things, then the Sword reacheth to the Act outward, but can reach no further; and as for Heresie, Schism, Sedition, turbulent and quiet, as thou makest distinctions, they are all in the Ground, and you have had too many such Thoughts in your Hearts, as that you did God service with all your whipping, cutting off Ears, beating with Ropes, casting out of your Assemblies, and not only so, but out of your Country, and banishing them from their Wives and Children, and all this you have done, and think you have done God good Service, and have cast them out and said (as the Prophet spoke of your Generation, whose Hearts were hardned) <hi>let the Lord be glorified</hi>; these things you have to repent of before you know or will feel Remission of Sins from the Lord, though thou saiest, you know it belongs not to the Magistrate to compel any Man to be a Believer, nor to punish any for not believing, but Hereticks, turbulent Hereticks, we believe belong unto him to punish; and who must be Judge of turbulent Hereticks? is not an Heretick an Unbeliever? and if the Magistrate ought not to punish an Unbeliever, then not a Heretick; for a Heretick is an Unbeliever; and they who are in the Power &amp; Authority of God, can deny such a one, and judge him out by the Power of God; there is his Punishment according to that which thou callst Gospel-institution, and beyond that, or any further Act upon such a one, we do not read of in all that which is call'd the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, neither that Christ, his Apostles or any of the true Churches or

                  <byline>This is presented by him who stands off and from all Self-Interests and Parties, and wisheth that the Wisdom of God may guide you all, and Division and Destruction may cease.

                  <p>WHat, is there not a wise Man among you, who seeks not himself, but the Good of all, that you so blow the Sparks on every Hand, and exasperate the Spirits one of another, and rather are for Strife then for Healing? And would ye have the Fire kindled, to rise up in such a great Flame, as both to destroy your selves, and many innocent People in the Nation? What, is every one seeking to gratifie his Interests and Party, and to satisfie his Will? And is there none that seeks that the Will of God may be done in Earth, among the Sons of Men; that God might once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do us good, and settle these Nations in Peace and Freedom, as men and as <hi>Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:40634:180"/>I. Consider; hath not this been the End which hath been proposed by all good men, who have not sought themselves, but have ventured all, that this might be accomplished, which if it had been, or were, or could be attained unto, would be a perfect Recompence and Satisfaction of all, and to all, who have sought it in their Heart, <hi>viz. Freedom from Oppression in their Persons and Estates,</hi> which hath not been, by Reason of the many wicked Laws which have been imposed, to satisfie the Self-Interests of some particular Men, which did imbondage all other: Secondly, <hi>Liberty and Freedom of Conscience in the Exercise of their Consciences to Christ, who is God's Anointed, according to the Manifestation of his Light and Spirit to them, unto whom and before whom all must give an Account, and be judged</hi>; but this hath been hitherto hindered by them who have re-assumed a Power, and have usurped Authority to themselves, and have made laws to the imbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daging of the dear and precious People of God in these Nations, though you have been talking of the <hi>Good Old Cause,</hi> these are not revocated and over-turned, by which very many suffer to this Day.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is not Names, Titles, Denominations and VVords that we look after, and which will effect the Thing proposed, which while some have been contending after, have let got the Thing in Hand, and have lost it, and so set up a particular Interest, and it clothes it self with the Words and fair Speeches, but nothing is brought forth; and so by fair Speeches and Flatteries the People have been deceived and cheated.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Should not all Rule and Authority be for the Good and Safety and well-being of a Nation or Common-wealth, and not to set up an <hi>arbitrary Power in their own Wills, to rule in Tyranny and Oppression, to satisfie their own to the imbondaging of all the People</hi>? And when any Power or Authority have deviated or swerved from this, they became no other but Tyrants and Oppressors; for the Thing intended being lost, the Ruler or Rulers rule no more for God, neither he account them such (whatsoever they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themselves) and therefore hath raised another Thing to overthrow that Power, as hath been evident in this Nation, in these many Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, although that Power which was first in being, which was ordained for the End aforesaid, being swerved from the thing, might say to that which rose up against it, <hi>That it was Rebellion and Treason,</hi> and declare it to be such in the Ears of the People, as hath been done by divers, which is in the Memory of most, so that I need not instance, when I say it was not so accounted by the Lord; and he hath given a Testimony of this by the overthrowing the former, and raising up the latter, and hath stood by it, while it stood in his Counsel.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Was not <hi>Israel</hi> governed sometime by Judges, sometime by the Elders, and sometime by Kings? And while they stood in the Counsel of the Lord, and the people hearkened to them, was not the Lord among them, and sometime raised up unlikely Means, as to Man's Wisdom, as <hi>David</hi> a Shepherds Boy', and <hi>Gideon</hi> a Thresher, and he was made a Judge, and a Redeemer of <hi>Israel</hi> out of their Slavery; but mind this still, while
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:40634:181"/>
they stood in God's equal Counsel, which led to do equally to, and for the Good of all, according to God's Institution and Appointment, then they were blessed; but when either Ruler, Governour or Governours went from the Power of the Lord, in which they only had Authority to rule, and to do justly, when they went from that, and became corrupt in their Minds and Hearts, and Blindness came upon them, as it is said, <hi>Blindness happened to</hi> Israel <hi>through their Unbelief</hi>; and what was the Effect thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>The Judges judged for Rewards and Gifts, the Prophets prophesied for Hire, and the Priests divined for Money, and the People loved to have it so,</hi> and the End thereof was Misery; for God raised up another Thing, and overthrew the Judges, Prophets, Priests and People, the Ancient and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that were the Head, and the false Prophets, which were the Tail.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Is not the same Blindness happened to <hi>England?</hi> When will her Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Judges, Prophets, Priests see their Error? Is it ever like to be a free Nation till all act freely for God, without imposing heavy Burdens, and giving as much to one Officer, imployed in the publick Service, as would serve twenty, and make so many of them too? When will these Things be done away, that every one may be approved &amp; manifest, how he loves his Nation, or how he seeks the Good thereof, by laying out himself freely, and acting freely, without so much Chargeableness to the Nation, I do not mean the Souldiery, but Men employed in civil Affairs, and the Ministry, who would be counted godly and painful, to publish freely, or else be silent.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. So now many are so doting on the Name of a Parliament, as though it were essential, or the Name to be the Foundation of Government, and cry up the Priviledge of Parliament, as some have done Prerogative, and would fight about a Name in their Heat and Passion, and loose the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, though they be the Representative of the People, to do Good to the people, and not Hurt, thy are accounted as good Servants to God, and to them that elected them; but if they would so soon as got together, set up a particular Interest, which serves to the imbondaging of the whole, and then cry up their Priviledge to do what they list; then it is no Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in God's Account, neither in the Account of Just Men to call them away, when they do not perform the thing intended; but if they will not hearken to the Cry of their Masters (the People) but it may be call them Rebels or Traytors, if they should be turned out, because they have clothed themselves with the Name of HIGHER POWER, when alas! they are gone from that in which their Power, Priviledge and Authority stood.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. And this I have to say to that Part of the Army who stand so much on the Name of Parliament, and would seem to oppose all the rest, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Army or the People from whence their Power did at first arise, when they accomplish not the End that they meet for, neither intended so to do, but to set up some and make the rest alwayes Sufferers, if you should take part herein, and manage your VVeapons for a Sound or a Name, or for

                  <p n="9">IX. And as for the long <hi>Parliament</hi> by whom God did Good Things, &amp; Great Things, in the overthrowing that power which was deviated from the aforesaid End; yet the Ax must not boast it self against him that hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only with it for a time to accomplish his End, and when he pleaseth take up another Instrument, and let the first lie still: VVhat they did, they had the Approbation of God and good men, yet they went not through with the work purposed and intended; and though they were called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a time of Straits, when that which had obstructed through Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Ambition was taken away, yet still you who were the members of the <hi>Old Parliament</hi> remaining, were called together for to help to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the aforesaid End, and to carry on the <hi>Good Old Cause</hi>; but truly you sticked in the Mire, and did not run cheerfully, but had your Ears open to them that could complement and flatter, and their Business you would hear, and return them thanks, but them who had been your dearest Friends in your former Straits, coming in all Love and Humility, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented their sad suffering unto you, of their long Imprisonment, and how above twenty dear precious men suffered till Death in prison for that Grand Oppression of Tythes, these could not be heard: And again, when a Representation came unto you from many Thousands, who were faithful Men to the <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> and had alwayes been, it was laid by as waste Paper, or as a thing of no validity and worth, when others received
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40634:182"/>
thanks from you in Words, and a seeming Approbation of things of far less Importance.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, certain who had been Officers in the Army in the Nation, and in <hi>Ireland,</hi> this fourteen or fifteen Years, came to you to present the Sufferings and Grievances of that Nation unto you, and in seven or eight Weeks Time you would neither hear nor regard their Suit unto you, neither take notice of it, neither return an Answer; but when a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of greedy hireling Priests came from <hi>Leicester-shire</hi> to sound their trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in the House, and to tell you they had not engaged with the rest of their Brethren in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> and <hi>Lancashire,</hi> with <hi>George Booth,</hi> they were immediately called in, and thanks returned, as though they had done some great Service for the Nation, but them who were your real Friends, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> when diverse of them represented the sad sufferings of the People of this Nation, from diverse Parts thereof; not only from one Sort of People, but all except one (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) instead of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the heavy Yoak thereof, the Oppression whereof hath reached Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even to the Throne of God, and he hath considered it, though you would not, but instead of removing it, have established it, for which he was wroth with you; you have lost your Crown, and he hath laid you by, as men who would not accomplish his End, and let his People go free; and let me tell you, it was rashly and proudly done of you, after so many valiant Officers, who had waded through a Sea of Troubles, though I shall not say but they sought themselves too much, which I hope God will give them to see: They had done great Service for the Nation, and considered what might best conduce, for the welfare of the Army, and for the Nation's good and Safety, and to present it to you, desiring your Concurrence therein; and though they did send among their Quarters for subscriptions, they knowing before hand except it carried some bulk, or at least seemed a matter of Concernment, you would take less notice of it, that you should in your heat and passion, being filled with Jealousies, vote out these Officers at their return from performing the faithful Service to you &amp; the Nation, it was an unworthy Gratification, and to put in others less ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, only to exalt your own Power and rather to draw back to Bondage, then going forward to perfect the business aforesaid; for these and many more Instances that I might lay before you, it was just with the Lord to remove you, and not to prosper you, and to overturn you, because you stood not in his Counsel, neither hearkned to them who would have wished you well, with whom God's Counsel is, and it is just you are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out; and let me advise you, and despise not my Counsel; for the Counsel of the mighty hath failed; take counsel at a Shepherd, or a Man of low Degree, be you quiet and seek not Revenge, neither blow the Sparks, nor kindle heat in Peoples Minds, neither provoke the Army t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And you of the <hi>English</hi> Army, who were dissatisfied with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the late Parliament against you, I wish there be not too much Self in you in the thing, rather for your own Advancement and particular Interest, then that the <hi>Good Old Cause</hi> (profest) was not carried on by the Parliament, according to your Desire and the Peoples Expectations: If Self-Interest was the Cause, as it is to be feared there was so much of that, you will be crossed in your Expectation; for that is the thing which hath obstructed the thing intended all along, since the thing was asserted, that will soon be made manifest; and there remains a Ground in your selves, which I believe will hinder the End proposed, which must be done away, before you can do much for God, though you may profess and declare in Words much, which may take with some for a while, yet it will not satisfie long: I wish in my Heart Good to you all; but there is something stands betwixt you and good things; you would, like the rest, please all Men, but that cannot be; stand to the Good, and let your Actions answer the Witness of God in the worst: And you say in your Declaration, <hi>You have an Intention to take away Tythes, and settle some Way for a godly preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi>; I say, they will need none of the State's or Common-wealth's Maintenance: And if you shall take them away, and settle any thing by way of Compulsion upon the People for any Ministry, you leave us in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and we must declare against that, as against Tythes, and we cannot pay, neither the one nor the other for Conscience sake: And you who are the <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> newly erected; yea, many of you have seen, or at least might have seen what hath hindered the End proposed; you have a Day of Visitation, God will try all Sorts of Men, if any will be faithful to the End: therefore this I say to you and the rest of the Army, throw down all those corrupt Laws made about Religion, Mass-houses, Clerks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wages, forced Maintenance, and meddle not with it; for that thing broke all Parliaments and Councils hitherto, and so will it do you, if you meddle with it; leave all People free, without Imposition of any Maintenance to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or else you do nought; let everyone be free, let every Judgment maintain their own, &amp; leave People free as to the VVorship of God, only to Christ, who is Head and Ruler of his Church, and Lord over the Conscience, and is his alone Right, which if you shall not do, he will throw you down al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: Therefore let him have Room and VVay, or else that which resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth will be cut off: And this is God's VVord unto you all, <hi>Take Heed of gratifying any to the imbondaging of others; let Tythes and forced Maintenance go down; and if for the Good of the Nation or Common-wealth (as in Things civil) all with a free Heart will most readily and willingly assist you for the Good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Stand not puzling about Business not worth mentioning, nor striving who shall be greatest, but remove the present Oppressions, and that which is the Cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; satisfie the Nation with Deeds, Words will not; with Things, not with Names, that will not; and it is not a King, a Parliament, a Protector, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or Senate we look at, will do the Thing: Neither People be ye wedded and glewed to Names; he that purposeth Righteousness and Equity in his Heart, and walks after it, is that which God will bless and prosper; for when Kings, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Councils are gone from the Power of God, they are for the Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a Nation, and not for its Liberty; but this I fore-warn you, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do, meddle not in the Things of God, or about Religion, let that alone, and you will more readily serve the Necessity which the present Affairs call for, and

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> What Confusion, and Lying, and Blasphemy is here? hath R. I. adventured voluntarily in his own Wilfulness and Perversness, to take part with those Contenders against the Truth, in which the <hi>Quakers live and worship,</hi> and God must be made the Author of this, and all the Heap of Lyes and Confusion, which is declared and uttered forth in his <hi>Ignis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus,</hi> which if no more were said then hath been, were answer enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his railing Discourse; and yet what Impudency this Man hath to say, <hi>he was moved of the Lord,</hi> when as he hath confest, he hath <hi>voluntarily took part with the Contenders</hi>? so that it is manifest to all reasonable men, who set thee on work, and whose Work thou hast been doing, for which thou shalt be sure to receive a Reward, in the mighty Day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And R. I. saith, <hi>Forasmuch as their counterfeit Coin hath been offered to me for good S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>st, that it might not decieve others, and instead thereof I have here made a tender of other Money (viz.) this ensuing Treatise, which I doubt not, but it may pass with Truth's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> That which R. I. calls <hi>counterfeit Coin,</hi> was made publick by our selves, and it hath been and shall be received by them that know God's I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and the inscription of the Spirit, and though R.

                  <p>Wherefore Reader, saith R. I. <hi>Have not so great Regard to the Authority of the writer, as the Truth of the Matter written by him, who was moved of the Lord, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed the Authority of a writer, or of that which is written, is of no great moment, seeing he is but one of <hi>Anti-Christ's Voluntiers,</hi> who hath not only belyed them that feared the Lord, but also hath uttered forth many damnable Doctrines, and yet would fasten all these upon the Lord so that his Deceit might be of more Authority, and none might question
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40634:191"/>
the matter thereof, because the Lord alwayes <hi>moveth to Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> and so R. I. is one of them that hath taken the Name of the Lord in vain, which will not be <hi>holden guiltless,</hi> but will be found guilty, when the Searcher of all Hearts shall make all things manifest.</p>
                  <p>And then R. I. further saith, <hi>That sprinkling of Infants is commanded by the Scrptures, and is a Seal of the Covenant; and Baptism of Inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nts is that which answers to Circumcision; for Mortification of the Flesh and Remission of Sins, and Admission into the Church, are sealed unto Infants by sprinkling, or that which</hi> R. I. <hi>calleth baptizing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say, Baptism of infants is a <hi>Popish-Tradition,</hi> as hath been proved by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, so that of it I need not say much; but where it is commanded in the Scripture as R. I. saith, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2.11, 12. is but a bad Proof for R. I. for the <hi>Collossians</hi> were circumcised with the Circumcision made <hi>without Hands,</hi> and they were <hi>buried with him in Baptsim, baptized into the Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ,</hi> such a Baptism as the Priests never Administred with their Hands, and the Spirit of the Lord was wont to be the Seal of the Covenant to them that do believe, but now it must be turned out of doors, for <hi>visible Water</hi> hath taken up its Place in R. I. his Judgement, which is currupted; &amp; how doth sprinkling answer to Circumcision, the <hi>Males</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were circumcised, and not the <hi>Females?</hi> and why do you sprinkle <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males,</hi> if Baptism must <hi>answer</hi> to Circumcision, and if the Extent of the one must be as large as the other: And as for Mortification of the Flesh and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins; that which mortifies the deeds of the Flesh hath <hi>Life</hi> in it, and that gives a living Testimony <hi>within,</hi> &amp; Remission sins of is in the Blood of Christ, and the Seale thereof is by the Spirit unto them that believe, but this popish tradition hath taken up all in R. I. his Account, if his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be true; nay the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves, who are as zealous for sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Infants as R. I. or any of his Brethren can be, yet one of their own Bishops (at a Council in <hi>France,</hi> of both <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> at <hi>Pisoy</hi> 1561.) <hi>Claudius Espencius</hi> saith, <hi>many Things are to be believed by Tradition only, as the Baptism of Infants, which cannot be proved from Scripture</hi>; but this R.

                  <p>The next Thing that R. I. goes about to vindicate, is <hi>Swearing,</hi> which their Ministers teach Men to <hi>swear</hi>; which ought to be in <hi>Rightousness and Truth,</hi> and for his Proof he brings <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. and saith, <hi>Christ only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits rash and vain swearing, and superfluous Oaths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Unto this much hath been said and answered already by many pens, and so that in the Answer thereof I shall be brief; in the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it was lawful to swear in Truth and Righteousness, and likewise all rash and vain Oaths under the Law were forbidden; but <hi>Christ who is the End of the Law for Righteousness,</hi> who is greater then the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and greater then <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and greater then the <hi>Angels,</hi> unto whom they all worship, he saith expresly, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>; now whereas R.

                  <p>These and many more things you differ in, both in matter and manner, which largely hath been declared by other Pens, and so in this I shall be brief; neither had the Ministers of the Gospel their Maintenance by force; neither had they Easter reckonings, Midsummer dues, Mortuaries, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for Churching of Women, Marriages, nor for the Burials of the dead, nor Money for funeral Sermons, neither did they preach over the dead: All these and abundance more of such like invented things, was never practised nor found amongst the Churches before the Apostacy; which things considered may cause R.I. to blush that ever he durst be so impudent, as to say, they differ not, neither in the whole nor in part, in matter nor in manner, from the Primitive Churches; and until such Time as R. I. and his Brethren contenders can clear themselves of these things, let them not think any whose Eyes God hath opened can receive them for a Church of Christ; nay, most of the parish Ministers hold up those practices which the <hi>Papists</hi> did deny, as money for Marriages and Burials, Baptism, the Sacrament, or the Ground in which the dead were buried, this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and condemned by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the height of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, 1547.</p>
                  <p>Saith <hi>R. I. It seems these Tythes are a great matter to many, or rather a great trouble for them to pay the Ministers, though</hi> Abraham <hi>paid Tythes of all to</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck <hi>before the Law; and this proves E. D. his Argument,</hi> as saith R. I. <hi>That it is contrary to the Light and Law of God to with-hold them from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, because they were given by</hi> Abraham <hi>before the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, it is great matter with many to pay Tythes, and a great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble too, because he that confesseth Christ is come in Flesh, cannot uphold the shadows of the first Covenant, which belonged to a changable Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, having no other Portion among their Brethren, which was given unto them for the Service which they performed unto the Lord, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise were a Twelfth Tribe, and near a Twelfth Part of the People; and now the Law being changed, and the Priesthood changed, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ended, and the Ordinance thereof abolished, that such a Company of covetous Men, as the <hi>Parochial Priests</hi> generally are, that they should claim the Tythes that belonged to this Priesthood, and not to do the Work that they did, and yet have a Portion among their Brethren in this Land, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they the Three Hundredth Part of the People; &amp; that such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I say, as these should claim the Tenth Part of all the Encrease in the Land, this is a great matter, and a thing not consistant with the Law of God, neither Equity or Reason,</p>
                  <p>And it is but a poor and feeble Argument neither of E. D. or R. I. that <hi>because</hi> Abram <hi>gave the Tenth part of the Spoil to</hi> Melchizedeck <hi>before the Law,</hi> that therefore it must be a <hi>binding thing</hi> to all Generations to pay the tenth part as due to such as are neither after that order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> neither after the Order of <hi>Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I. would have Condemned for runnagates, if he had lived in that time: But without all Controversie, if it be a duty now to pay Tythes unto the Ministers of the Gospel, then it was a duty in the Apostles time, that though the Rulers were Persecutors, yet the Apostles would have minded them, whom they had begotten into the Faith, of their duty but we find no mention neither by Commandment, Reproof or Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto any of the Churches, about any such thing, and so thy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument R.

                  <p>And R. I. saith, <hi>The Apostles took whatsoever was given them, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Apostles took nothing but what was given them, then this shames your forcing, and also you seek it of them who receive you not, which manifests you are out of the Apostles example, and though it satisfies your Consciences to take Tythes (which thou sai'st, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates give you) both of them that own you, and them that own you not; yet I believe it would not have satisfied the Apostles of Christ, if any Magistrates would have sent them back to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who Believed not, or the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who received them not; this they would not accounted as a free Gift; though this divers hundred Years many Rulers have Drunk of the Whore's cup, and have given their Authority to the Beast, and have forced and compelled to a Worship, and also to give to the Whore's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, yet this is but bad proof that they ought to have done so; and the Apostles never counted this living of the Gospel, to live of Tythes &amp; forced Maintenance, which none of the Ministers did receive, or ever will.

                  <p>The next Thing that <hi>R.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Then all your parochial Ministers, by thy own Exposition, fall under Condemnation; for this is a Point of our Faith, that if we be moved of the Lord and by his Spirit, to come into your Assemblies, to speak the Word of Truth, that we ought to speak it, and you ambitiously would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate unto your selves Superiority over our Faith and Religion; like as we believe, that we ought not to give flattering Titles to Men, neither to give Maintenance unto them, of whom we are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and do believe are no Ministers of Christ: And in these and many more Things that pertain to Religion, Faith and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, you ambitiously and proudly have arrogated unto your selves Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over Religion, Faith and Consciences: Therefore repent of it, and see you do so no more, lest you fall into Condemnation: And as for calling any man Master, who is our Master we own, and it is the Practice of such as are Servants; but to call him Master who is not our Master, is to speak an Untruth, or else to give flattering Titles, and we have not so lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christ; but enough of this hath been spoken by divers, so that I shall pass on, and touch a Word about Complements, and doffing off Hats, and bowing of Knees, a Thing that <hi>R.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> A pitiful lame Argument; we eat not, nor drink not because it is a Custom, nor wear Apparel, but because of their Service and of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40634:193"/>
and yet I would have <hi>R. I.</hi> know, that we have learned to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish betwixt a thing that may be customary, and good in it self, and a Custom which is vain; and the Saints did not salute one another because it was a Custom, but because their Hearts were joyned to one another in Love and in Truth; but for doffing the Hat, and bowing the Knee to a Fellow with a Feather, or a Woman with a Fan, or a Gold Ring, or poudered Hair, this is a vain Custom, and the Antiquity of a thing doth not prove the Goodness of it, neither Customariness the Worth of any thing, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Multitude of Roysters and Ruffins do practise such things, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are lawful; for we know <hi>broad is the Way that leads to Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and many there that enter in</hi>; and we have learned not to follow a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to do evil, though R. I. be untaught.</p>
                  <p>But saith R. I. <hi>When Salutations are observed with a good Decorum, they are like a Hand-dial, which shews what Order the Wheels observe within, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of any Thing doth not abolish the Use thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Now what R.I. doth count a good Decorum, Reader, thou may'st judge by what he hath before pleaded for, for doffing off Hats, bowing the Knee, and saying, <hi>Your Servant Sir,</hi> or <hi>if it please your Highness, or if it like your Excellency,</hi> with such feigned Practices, and this is the Decorum which is counted civil; and so Reader thou may'st observe how the Wheels run within.</p>
                  <p>It so came to pass that I was amongst a Company of these that would be called Ministers of the Gospel, in Number no less then ten, and in the Room I was when they all came in, and they courted, and bowed, and scraped with their Feet, with their Hats to the Ground many of them one to another, and reeling up and down the House in this Manner, and one striving to outstrip another in Complements; and though they had all Intentions to sit down, yet they strave among themselves who should be last, and in this Posture they continued half an Hour together, at the which I admired, and indeed was ashamed, that men who professed Godliness should be found in such Transgression; and it is like R. I. will count these Civil Salutations with a good Decorum; and now Reader, observe again how the Wheels went within, and what they did drive after, but to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie one another in Deceit, with these kind of Decorums, like Stage-play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Fidlers; and <hi>thou errest, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God</hi>; when that which was commanded by God came to be abused, they came utterly to be abolished; as the brazen Serpent came to be idolized, it was taken away, though there was no Command for so doing, but they might have pleaded the former against them; likewise the Temple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be built by God, and was to have continued forever, yet being abused and made an Idol of, it was utterly abolished, and was left unto them desolate, and the Glory of God did not appear in it as before; and because of the Iniquity of such a Company of Priests, Sion <hi>became as a plowed Field, and</hi> Jerusalem <hi>became Heaps, and the daily Sacrifices ceased, and not one Stone left upon another</hi> of the Temple that was not thrown down: And so for thee or any other to plead Custom or Antiquity and Examples, which were neither commanded nor commended, as to be standing and a binding Rule to all Generations, demonstrates thy great Ignorance and Blindness,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40634:194"/>
and manifests thee to be one who pleases the Spirit of the World, in whom the Love of God dwells not.</p>
                  <p>The next thing that R. I. falsly accuseth, and impudently affirmeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Quakers</hi> is, <hi>That they deny honour to Superiours, and to them to whom it is due, and so blaspheme the Name of God and his Doctrine</hi>; and further say'st, <hi>Charity, though shooting at Random, cannot miss the right Mark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is one thing what God accounteth true Honour, it is another thing what R. I. counteth Honour: True Honour is to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Superiours, who rule in the Power of God, and this the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, submitting to all the just and equal Commands which are required of them that rule in the Power of God, and this is not to blaspheme the Name of God and his Doctrine; but this Fellow would have accused the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, as his Generation did, who put them out of the Cities, charging them to speak no more in the Name of Jesus, and then when the Apostles return'd plead their Authority, saying, <hi>Did not we command you to speak no more in his Name, and now you are disobedient, blaspheming the Name of God and his Doctrine:</hi> Is this Good Reasoning R. I. <hi>And Charity shoots not at random, neither misses the Mark,</hi> but it is pure, and singles out its Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And saith R. I. F. H. <hi>labours to disgrace, if not to deface our Churches, he like a cunning Gamster knows how to alter the Course of true Cards, the Scripture,</hi> as R. I calls them.</p>

                  <p>And saith R.

Many of the Brethren who were scattered abroad in the Persecution that was at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> went every where preaching the Word of God, and when or where were these ordained? And who ordained the Brethren that were persecuted after <hi>Steven</hi>'s being put to death, who travailed as far as <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> preaching the Word, and the Hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and were turned unto the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.19, 20, 21. yet these things I bring not as to deny but that many went out with the consent of the Church, and many were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; and many were ordained Elders who were grown up in the Truth and established, who had received the holy Ghost, by whom many were confirmed and strengthned in the Faith; but what is all this R.

I. would have to be Ministers, who have learned an Art to speak, and this must be called a Gift, and a Qualification, and a fit Man to be a Pastor, and thus they have ordained one another, and have set up a Trade of preaching, and with their confused Stories have filled the World with Darkness.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning an infallible Spirit, saith R.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40634:195"/>
the <hi>Evil one touched them not,</hi> and they spoke from it, and ordered the Church in it in the wisdom of God: But what do these Men minister from, who wait not to be made Partakers of this, but deny that ever any had it, or ever shall have, &amp; so are but a company of Dreamers, and tell their dream that they dreamed in the Night, or at best steal the Words from their Neighbour, and say, <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> when God hath never spoken to them.

                  <p>And further R I. saith, when the Lord said by <hi>Joel,</hi> that he would <hi>pour out his Spirit upon all Flesh, and his Sons and his Daughters should prophesie; the Prophet speaks not of a ghostly Power to open the Kingdom of Heaven, given by Christ to his Apostles and Successors but of an extraordinary Measure of enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Grace, and a more copious effusion of the Spirit, and also to Pastors to whom more is given, more is required; and this Text doth not prove that all Sheep shall be Pastors, and all Schollars Teachers.</hi>

I. doth, and how should he do otherwise, seeing he hath denyed the infallible Spirit, from which all the Ministers ministred, and all the Prophets prohesied, and spoke as <hi>they were moved by the holy Ghost</hi>; but R. I. saith, <hi>the Prophet spoke not of a Ghostly Power to open the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven</hi>; if by ghostly Power he means the Spirit's Power, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he will not deny, then was it not by a spiritual Power Sons &amp; Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters prophesied; and did not this Power open the Kingdom of Heaven? and if it be a <hi>more copious Effusion of the Spirit</hi> which is given under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel then the Law then how is it that <hi>R.

of the Spirit, if any at all, who speak from the Strength of natural Parts, and deny the unerring Spirit, and so shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against Men.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>R. I.</hi> is so grieved at this infallible Spirit, or this Spirit of Prophecy, that he cannot endure that a Daughter should prophesie, or speak by the Spirit of God in the Assembly of the Saints, and the main stress of his or their Argument is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Let your Women keep Silence in the Church; for it is not permitted for them to speak; and if any Woman speaks in the Church it contradicts the Spirit, and though they have a Gift, they ought not to improve it in a disorderly Way.</hi>

What, must <hi>Priscilla</hi> go out of her House in which was the Church if she had any thing to speak by the Spirit? was it lawful to speak without doors and not in the House? and if she might speak in her House, then she spoke in the Church, and <hi>R.

                  <p>And the further R. I goes on the lower he sinks towards the bottomless Pit, and there we shall find him at last before we have done with his Book, and speaks out of thick Darkness, like a Man that never saw the Sun, who hath altogether taken up his dwelling Place in Death's Region, and as though that were the Land of his Nativity, as thou shalt see Reader by what ensues.</p>
                  <p>R. I. saith, <hi>Though it be said, he that commits Sin is of the Devil; not that the Devil can claim him for his own, or that he is in his Possession, but he is Captivated of the Devil, and over-Powered.</hi> And for his proof he brings, <hi>Peter was cryed up to be a Saint, and at that same time when he was Cryed up to be a Saint, Christ called</hi> Peter <hi>a Devil, and that must be understood a Saint hath Sinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> He that is Captivated by the <hi>Devil,</hi> hath gone from the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and he that commits Sin doth the Devil's Work, and he may claim him for his Work-man; and he that is over-powered is brought into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and he that carryes into Captivity hath the Captive in his Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as it is written, <hi>his Servants you are to whom you obey,</hi> and he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Sin is the Servant of Sin. And these black confused Distinctions R. I. maketh to make People believe that they are Saints of God, when they are the Devil's Captives, and that they are in the Possession of Christ, who yet do the Works of the Devil who is an Enemy to Christ, &amp; thou know'st no more for Saint then thou know'st of a Devil, who saith, that <hi>Peter</hi> at the same time that Christ called him a Saint, <hi>called him a Devil</hi>; for thou must know, that <hi>Matthew</hi> recorded many things, it may be in one Chapter, which were acted and done, and spoken in many Dayes and Weeks, for when <hi>Peter</hi> confessed Christ to be the Son of God, he was in the Faith, and Christ said, <hi>Flesh and Blood had not revealed that to him,</hi> but at this time had spoken little of his Sufferings; and it is written, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.21. <hi>from that time forward began Jesus to shew unto his Disciples, how that he must go unto</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and suffer many Things, and be Kill'd, and rise again the third Day</hi>; So that it is manifest, that here was distance of time and space betwixt <hi>Peter</hi> Confession of Christ, and of his rebuking of him; however the Unbelief was gotten up in <hi>Peter,</hi> and he that had need to be taught, came to be a Rebuker of him who was a Teacher, this was another State then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but of these things R. I. is ignorant, and let the Serpent feed upon Dust, for I desire to give him no other food.</p>
                  <p>And further, R. I. saith, <hi>Though Saints Sin not Devil-like unto Death, yet if any man say, he hath not sinned after the Similitude of</hi> Adam'<hi>s Transgression, he,</hi> saith John, <hi>is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him, for when all is done the best men are Men still, and the best Earth is Earth ever, and will bear Nettles and Brambles; and if these things were well considered by</hi> F. H. <hi>he would not accuse me and</hi> E. D. <hi>for pleading for Sin or Satan, for we plead against those who say, they have no Sin.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This R. I. is so in love with Sin, that by his Arguments which

I. would make, at the best they are still but sinners, and unsanctified; but they that are called to be Saints, who are begotten by God the Father, and preserved in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, they are sanctified and made clean through the washing of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and through the Sanctification of God's holy Spirit, which dwelleth in them, by which they have Power to mortifie the Deeds of the Flesh, and to overcome, and to be made Partakers of the Promises; but here lies the difference in R. I. his Account, betwixt his Saints and his Sinners, <hi>The Sinners sin Devil-like, yet the Saints sin not Devil-like</hi>; I say, they that sin are in one Nature, notwithstanding R. I. his blind Distinctions; for they that sin are liker the Devil then God, and liker his Image then God's I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; for God's Image consisteth in Righteousness and true Holiness; and the Devil's Image consisteth in Unrighteousness, Sin and Unholiness; and now Reader thou mayest judge whose Image R. I. his Saints bear, and if thou be one that canst plead against them who are born of God and sin not, and who are cleansed from all sin by the Blood of Christ, then R. I. will ranck thee with E.

                  <p>And these became great Teachers, and the whole World went after them, and proselyted many into their false Faith which was <hi>Fained,</hi> and into that Hope which was but as a Spider's webb, and into a Profession of Christianity without the Life of Christ, and those went into the World, and those that were in the Perishing state wondered after them, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, and set them up, who admired them because of <hi>Advantage,</hi> and received them, and so held up one another in Deceit, and so grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Body, and got the Name of a Church, though they were adulterated from the true Faith, and run away from Christ, the true Husband after other Lovers, and yet because the Name of Christ and Christianity had a good Sound, therefore they retained the Name for a Cloak that they might not be discovered; And so many Children and false Christians which were not begotten and Born again of the <hi>Light Immortal,</hi> and of the <hi>Immortal Word of Life</hi> were brought forth, and these were adulterated Children, and Children of Fornication, and Children of falshood, who would Lye, as the Prophet said, <hi>as the Mother was, so was the Daughter, and so are the Children.</hi>

among them who were <hi>the Servants of Righteousness,</hi> the other amongst them, <hi>whose Throats were as an open Sepulchre, whose Feet were swift to shed Blood, and Eyes full of adultery, who could not cease from Sin</hi>; the one among them who <hi>took up the daily Cross of Christ, and denyed themselves,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among them, <hi>who followed their own Wayes, and not the Cross of Christ,</hi> but denyers of it; the one amongst them, <hi>who were Crucified to the Flesh and the deeds thereof,</hi> the other among them, <hi>that were alive in the Flesh, and following the Affections and Lusts thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much more I might say, according to the Wisdom given of the Lord, but by what hath been said herein you may see the differences betwixt <hi>the true Church of God, and the Mother of Harlots,</hi> betwixt <hi>Jerusalem</hi> which is above, <hi>a Mystery,</hi> and the <hi>Mystery of Babylon,</hi> and betwixt <hi>The Bride of the Lamb</hi>'s <hi>Wife, and the Harlot that hath run from her Husband,</hi> and the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Members of each Body, and the differences between each Seat made manifest by their Effect and Fruits which is brought forth by each sort; so read your selves, whether you are <hi>in the Apostacy,</hi> or <hi>out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy,</hi> whether of the Members of <hi>Christ</hi> and of his Body, or of <hi>Anti-christ,</hi> and so Members of the <hi>Harlot,</hi> and of her Body; to the Measure of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in all your Consciences, as you take heed to it, will give you a true Understanding.</p>

every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> hath all Power committed to him; so for any to intrude or take upon them to do that which the Father hath committed unto him, is absolute Usurpation; and though the false Church and the Merchants thereof, and many which would be counted <hi>Rabbies</hi> in it, have spurred on and pressed on Princes to their Hurt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to usurp Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over mens Consciences in Faith and Doctrine; this will be their Reward certainly from the Hand of the Lord at the last, <hi>VVho hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this at your Hands</hi>? For <hi>Paul,</hi> an Apostle of Jesus Christ, whose Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority was great, as to the Things of God, went far beyond any temporal Prince, who had begotten many to the Faith, who said, that he and some others were not <hi>Lords over their Faith,</hi> nor over mens Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but as it is said, left <hi>every Man to be fully perswaded in his own Mind</hi> by God's Spirit, him which he had testified of, which he said, <hi>God had given a Measure of to profit withal,</hi> and <hi>none knows the Things of God, but by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God</hi>; then good Reason it is, that all should be left to that which is the absolute and only means, by which God, and the Things of God, and the Worship of God comes to be known: what will the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> say to this, or the Pope say unto this, who sayes that he is <hi>Peter</hi>'s Success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor? Are not Things imposed upon People, as to be believed, which are contrary to the Scriptures, &amp; for which there is no Scripture nor Example, but only because <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successor hath said so, and the Church said so? and if another believe not so, he is then counted an Heretick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hath been proceeded against as an Heretick; instance that one thing about <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>VVine,</hi> which is called a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath held for Doctrine these many hundred Years (to wit) <hi>That after VVords of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration by a Priest, the natural Bread and VVine becomes substantially the real Body and Blood of Christ,</hi> which Doctrine is so inconsistent with the Faith of God's Elect, and so contrary to the Scriptures, and also to sound Reason, that none but they who are wilfully ignorant can believe; and yet because many could not believe this Doctrine of Transubstantiation, many have been racked, tortured, burned and put to cruel Deaths; and is not this to be Lords over mens Faith, and to Lord it over mens Consciences, and so intrude and rule in mens Hearts, and regulate mens Judgments, which only belongs to God, the Judge of Heaven and Earth? And therefore all Princes, Governours and Rulers, learn Wisdom and Understanding to rule with the Wisdom of God, which comes from above, and cumber not your selves with that which God expects not from you, neither doth he require of you to be Lords over his Heritage; neither do you meddle nor intrude into those Things which he would not have you to meddle withal; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let any perswade you, under any Colour to drive on their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, promising to you in so doing, therein you do God good Service, or press you on to persecute any about spiritual Matters.</p>
                  <p>Now I say unto you in the Name, and Power, and Authority of God's Spirit, they that compel to any Worship, or force to any Worship, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or false, or punish and put to Death any for not worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping truly, or for worshipping falsly, he is to this Day under the Anti-christian Reign, who hath exalted himself, and sets himself in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and sits as Judge thereof, that which belongs only to the Lord's Christ, and so intrenches upon the Soveraignity which belongs to Christ,

the <hi>King of Righteousness,</hi> and such will do Violence to the Subjects of Christ's Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all Kings, Princes and Potentates of the Earth; who profess the Name of Christ Jesus, cast off those heavy Yoaks, which the false Church and Harlot have perswaded you to put your Necks in, only to raise her City, and to put off her Merchandize, and to make the Church of the free Woman, the Church of Christ, suffer; and this above all Things hath brought great Detriment and Hurt unto you Princes and People of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> for they have been led by a blind Zeal to do that which they have been perswaded unto by her which hath sate as a Queen, and as the Lady of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and a Mistress over God's Houshold, to do that which hath provoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord against them, whereby their Dominions have been rent from them, and many of the dear Lambs have causelesly suffered, and many of their Subjects have been evily entreated, and some have been put to Death, so thereby have lost the Hearts of the People by such Actings, only to satisfie the blood-thirsty Mind of her that hath drunk the Blood of the Saints.</p>

                  <p>And all ye Princes and People in <hi>Germany,</hi> who are called <hi>reformed,</hi> who have denyed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in some things, and who judge you are come to a good Degree of Reformation, I must needs say unto you, that the Reformation, &amp; your Departure from her is yet but weak, poor and feeble, and you are come but a little way; I may say unto you as the Prophet said, you must <hi>rise and go</hi> from that which you are now in, which you judge to be the Worship of the true God, <hi>for it is not your Rest</hi>; indeed you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and cast off some things which are but circumstances, you stick still in the old Ground, and if you take not heed, the Leaven of the Whore's Sorceries which is yet among you, may quickly leaven you all again into one Lump, and bring you back again within the Walls of that <hi>bloody City</hi>; and you that are Princes will not want Temptations to draw you back to associate your selves again with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that now thereby you may be strengthned against the <hi>heathen</hi>; for if you should enter into any Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation

                  <p>Therefore ye that are called <hi>Protestant</hi> Princes, or <hi>Reformed,</hi> and to all People within your Dominions look not back for help from spiritual <hi>Sodom</hi>; Oh let it never enter into your Hearts; you are yet in the Suburbs of that City; therefore come further off, and out from it, for you still retain too much of the Government of that City, and too much of their Form, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Institution and Doctrine, and judge them to be <hi>Apostolick</hi> and <hi>Catholick,</hi> but wait you to know the <hi>Power of God</hi> in your Assemblies, which changes the Mind and Heart <hi>within,</hi> for <hi>bodily exercises profiteth little,</hi> you have had Tryal enough of that, but what Life and Power do you enjoy, which was from the Beginning before the World began? Is there no forcing and compelling amongst you about Religion, and Hire for your Ministers? And do you not limit and stop that which the generality cannot agree unto, and brand it for Error and Heresie? and is there no killing about Religion, nor making men suffer about matters in Religion? may every one speak freely of the things of God, what he hath received freely of the Lord, as they did in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> when the Church was in Purity? Forcing ought not to be amongst you, and you put too great a Price up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on outside things, which at the best are but Shadows of spiritual things which are to be revealed <hi>in the Heart</hi>; and know you this, that they that worship the Lord aright, worship him <hi>in Spirit and in Truth</hi>; and they who come to witness the New Covenant, come to know the Law of the Spirit of God, and the Life revealed <hi>in their Hearts,</hi> by which the Sons of God are led <hi>into all Truth,</hi> and they need not go back to the Tables of Stone, nor to literal Precepts for a Rule; for their Rule <hi>is within</hi> (to wit) the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which the Father hath promised <hi>to pour forth upon his Sons and Daughters,</hi> by the Mouth of his Prophets, and that they need not say, <hi>know the Lord, for all shall be taught of him, from the least to the greatest,</hi> who are come to the everlasting Covenant, and to the Blood of sprinkling which purifies the Heart, and sprinkleth the Consciences, <hi>which speaks bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things</hi> to all them that receive it, <hi>then the Blood of</hi> Abel.</p>
                  <p>There hath been in those Parts some stirring of the Lord amongst you, but the Power of God hath been much abused, and great runnings out have been amongst you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many have followed their own devisings, and one hating another, and have erred from the Spirit, and there have been Factions and great Breakings amongst you, and many seeking themselves until Darkness hath come over again, and so are come to be setled into a <hi>dead Form,</hi> so that little of the Presence of God is found in all your Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; nevertheless though all these things are so, yet the Lord's Love is reaching towards you again, and a Visitation, and a Day of Mercy there

is yet held forth; <hi>Oh happy and blessed will you be if you do not despise nor reject it,</hi> and be not offended in the lowest Appearances of Christ to the Sons of Men, wherein a greater Glory is revealing, and shall be revealed, then hath been since the Apostates entered in.</p>
                  <p>Now the Way wherein God doth purpose to make known his Mind, and his hidden Riches, and communicate his Heavenly Mysteries, will be in a more <hi>hidden, secret and spiritual invisible manner, then yet ever hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared</hi>; for hitherto Deceit hath transformed it self, and Satan's Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have conformed, and Antichrist hath imitated, and the unconverted have been worshipping, observing and practising of outward things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the moving of the Life; so that Antichrist hath gotten into every out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side Appearance, and by this means hath sheltered himself with a colour and shadow; and the Devil the Enemy of all Mankind hath kept his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom whole by covering himself with the Words, Shadows and Outward Performances: And now take but a View over all those Kingdoms that are called <hi>Christendom,</hi> and see how much of the Life of Christ is brought forth, and how little of the Image of God is manifested, and the Kingdom of God revealed among people which stands in the Power and Life of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; therefore the full time of the Lord is come, wherein every Word and Work shall be tryed, and the Secrets of every man's Heart shall be made bare, and the root and ground of every Action shall be weighed: <hi>And Wo will come upon all who are covered with the words and outside shews, and cloathed with outward Performances, and not with the Spirit of the Lord God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore Friends and People, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, of these things we have a blessed <hi>Cloud of VVitnesses,</hi> whom God hath now raised up in this the Day of his mighty Power, wherein God hath shined forth in Brightness: From his holy Habitation are these things seen which have lightned the Earth, <hi>from his dwelling Place he hath given forth his Word, and great is the Company of them that publish it, and there shall be many more; for a numberless number shall hear it, yea the dead that are yet in the grave shall hear it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by it shall come to live</hi>; and we are a great Number who have travailed through many dry Places and barren Wildernesses, who have had the tryal and tast of all outward professions, and visible Worships, and external Performances, and visible Ordinances which are contained in hand writings, and we have waded through all these things with a great deal of Diligence, and strict Observancy; and we have travailed many Years with great Pain, that so we might have found Rest and Refreshment to our Souls, that so we might have sitten down in it, and as <hi>Seekers</hi> and <hi>Travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> who are weary, were willing to lend an ear unto any who have but said, <hi>come hither and here is Rest</hi>; and one hath cryed, <hi>lo here,</hi> and another hath cryed <hi>lo there</hi>; and so we wearied our selves at last, from Mountain to Hill, and spent our Strength for nought, for none could truly inform us where we should find him whom our Souls loved, and whom our Hearts panted after, and our Bowels yearned.</p>
                  <p>Until at the last the Eyes of many were opened by the Lord, who saw that eternal Life was not to be found in any external visible thing, and do know that all they who are exercising themselves after those things in the exactest &amp; strictest manner, cannot be made <hi>perfect</hi> as pertaining to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>; and all these great Talkers of the Fame of Christ, and of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

and Power, Miracles and Works, and of his Death, Obedience and Sufferings; the bare Report and Sound of these things doth no good at all, to him who feels Sin hath full Power and Dominion in his Heart; so that the Life of Christ must be felt <hi>within,</hi> enjoyed and possessed <hi>within,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed <hi>in the Light,</hi> or else he cannot stand justified in the Sight of God, nor clear when he judgeth, neither can he find Rest nor Peace for his Soul, so I am one who have found Mercy and Favour at the Hand of the Lord, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many Thousands to be a Witness of that Life which was with the Father before the World began, which is now manifested in the Hearts of Thousands of his People, destroying the Works of the Devil, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in everlasting Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>So the Love of God which is shed abroad in my Heart, through the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Compassion which I have unto all Mankind, knowing that all in the first <hi>Adam</hi>'s State are lost in the Fall; I do now give forth these Lines, and say unto all, <hi>seek not the Living among the Dead,</hi> not in dead Forms, not in dead Graves, not in dead Worships, neither in dead Performances; <hi>for the Lord is risen out of all these things, and is sate down in Glory, in a living holy Habitation,</hi> and now his Appearance unto the Sons of Men is in a more <hi>spiritual manner,</hi> for I have fully tried already what is in all these external things; and because I know and have seen his Appearance, therefore I speak to the informing of all, how they may come to find him who is the Desire of their Souls, and the Salvation thereof, I say, listen and hear, that your Souls might live; for Christ is that eternal, incorruptible, pure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, immortal Life, which hath ligtned every man that cometh into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1. yea, he that hath enlightned every man with his true Light, he is that eternal and immortal Life; so that I say unto you all, high and low, who desire Rest unto your Souls, cease from your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, cease from your running, cease from your own Performances, cease from worshipping you know not what, and cease from seeking in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which the Lord hides himself from, and come ye to learn of Christ, and sit at his Feet, even at the lowest Appearance of him, even at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er End of the Table must you come, before you can be exalted; for thou must be contented to sit down there, that which climbeth high, and exalts it self, God will bring down, and that which manifesteth Sin is Light, and that which reproveth Evil is the same, and what is reproved in the Heart of man, is manifested by the Light of Christ; so keep in all your Minds to this, and stop all other Motions in your Minds, and keep down all Thoughts and Reasonings in the mind; and so keep to few Words, and be slow to speak, and swift to hear, then will you come to know the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Voice of Christ, the quickning Spirit, which divideth assunder, and separateth betwixt the precious and vile in THOUGHTS WORDS or DEEDS; and shews you the Ground of each; and as you love this Light which Christ Jesus hath enlightned you withal, and bring your Deeds to the Light which Christ hath placed in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, which is God's faithful Witness,, if unto it you take heed, then you will feel his Power in you at all Times near at Hand to help you, and to subject every vain Thought and every vain Desire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bring them into Captivity; and this is the Word of Faith which is nigh in the Heart, which doth discern the Thoughts and Intents and Purposes of the mind, before ye

                  <p>And whoever receiveth Christ, must receive him as the Father hath tendered him; for he is given for a Covenant of Light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in whom the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should trust, and to rejoyce at the Brightness of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and the Isles should be glad, and wait for his coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Leader of his People; and Justification is not felt in the Heart of any man, but where his Leadings are known and obeyed, and none can come out of the Regions and Shadows of Death, but as Christ is closed with, the <hi>true Light, who hath enlightned every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> for he is appointed of the Father a Leader out of the World; and all that follow the Light that they be enlightened withal, deny themselves for it judges self-Love, and self-Actions, and self-Righteousness; and here the Cross of Christ you will come to know; which slayes the Enmity, that which crosseth the carnal corrupt Part in man, and takes it up and bears it; and herein you will come to know what it is to be crucified to the World, and the Lusts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections thereof, and the World within; and the Cross being known and loved, which is the Power of God, the carnal Mind, which is Death, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be slain within, and dyeth to the Fashions of the World, and the goodly Noise thereof that passeth away; but that which maketh it pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way endures forever, the Word of the Lord, which was in the Beginning: So mind that which endures forever, and take diligent heed, and watch against the carnal Mind and worldly Thoughts, and keep them down and so Power you will come to receive in the Light, to rule over all that which hath ruled over you; and then you will come to know a transforming of your Minds, and that which quickens and enlivens your Hearts to God and crucifies you to Evil; and here is the Way in Part declared by which all must come to the Father, to the Kingdom, to the Power, and to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there, which is by Christ the true Light, who hath enlightned every man that cometh into the World, who is the Way, the Truth it self, the Love it self, who is one with the Father.</p>

                  <p>GReat hath been the Wisdom which God hath shed abroad in the Hearts of his People, and made known unto his Servants through Ages, wherein he hath made known his Mind and Will at sundry times, and in divers manners, sometimes by Types, sometimes by Shadows and Representations, sometimes by Dreams, sometimes by Visions, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Prophecy, &amp; there was not the least Ministration, but it had a Glory in it; and the one living God manifested his Mind unto the Sons of men, who feared his Name in every Generation, and shewed unto them, and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mind unto them, what he was, and shewed unto them, how he would be worshipped; and they that were obedient unto that which was made manifest in every Age and Ministration, found Acceptance with the Lord, and the Peace of God in their Hearts: After man had transgressed and gone from his Maker, and lost the Guide of his Youth, and broken God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, then Blindness came upon him, and a Vail was betwixt him and his Maker, and man increased and grew in an earthly Part, and lusted after earthly Things, which fed and increased that Part, and the Image of God was lost, in which the Creature delighted; yet notwithstanding such was and is the Love of God towards his Creation and to his Workmanship, that he did not utterly cast off man forever, but followed him, to draw him back again out of the Transgression, to have Unity with him who was his Maker; and when man was gone unto Darkness, the Lord stooped so low as to come near him, and to that State he was in, and made a Covenant with man (when mans Heart was outward upon outward Things) and gave him Commands outward, and Statutes and Ordinances outward, that he might worship therein, which were Shadows and Types of some better Things to come; and these were the Ordinances of the first Covenant, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the changeable Part that was above the Seed, but they typed forth more heavenly Things, which were to be revealed in due Time; and when the Seed came to be manifested and raised up, they had an End, and the Cloud passed away, and the Day did spring forth in Clearness, and he brought forth which restored all that believe unto God (<hi>viz.</hi>) Christ Jesus, then did God more clearly manifest himself in the Earth through his Son, who had the Will of the Father, and declared it, who rent the Vail, and put an End to the Shadows, and blotted out the Hand-writing, and ended the Types and Figures; and all that believed in him, who was the End of them and the Sum of all, he overthrew the Nature in them which was changeable, unto which they pertained until the Time of Reformation, which was when he was sacrificed up a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, and they that did believe and received him, came to be the Sons of God, and declared the Mind of God as it was revealed, and as the

Spirit gave Utterance; and many did believe, and did grow up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of one Heart, Mind and Soul, and worshipped God with one Accord, and in the Spirit and in the Power of the Father, and separated from the <hi>Jewish</hi> Worship and the Form thereof, and met together in the Power of God, and glorified God, and spoke of the Things of his Kingdom unto all that waited for it freely, and the Lord was honoured by them, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in them: But soon after the Mystery of Godliness was brought forth, the Mystery of Iniquity began to work, and opposed the Work of the Lord, and transformed into the Similitude and outward Appearance and Form, and yet lived in the Flesh, and there began to be an Apostacy and a Devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that Glory and Power which was once revealed, and Anti-christ wrought with Signs and lying Wonders, and got the Words, and hated the Life and Power, and them that appeared in it; and then they that were under his Government and Reign hated the Reign of Christ, and said in their Hearts, <hi>We will not have him to rule over us,</hi> though in Words they confess him, and then persecuted and drove the true Church into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and set up Imitations, and Inventions, and Traditions, and vain Customs, which they have called Apostolical and holy Institutions, which are contrary unto primitive Institutions and Ordinances, only brought in by them when Darkness began to spread over the Earth, when the Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops in the first three hundred Years after Christ began to contend about Dayes, and Times, and Meats, and Drinks, and <hi>Rome</hi> began to claim Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over all Churches call'd <hi>Christian,</hi> &amp; the Pope became as a Law-giver.</p>
                  <p>I have led thee through divers Ages and Times, as briefly as possible may be, to single out the Original and Beginning of those things, and who were the first Ordainers of them betwixt this and the Apostles Dayes, which are now accounted as holy Institutions: The State and Glory of the true Church in this Treatise thou wilt see before the Apostacy, and the State in the Apostacy, how she fled into the Wilderness, and how <hi>Mystery-Babylon</hi> was raised, and the false Church called her self visible; many of her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Practices which are contrary to the primitive Church are here discovered, and the Authors and Formers made known, whereby thou may'st come to see a Difference in the Ordinances of the true Church, and the Traditions and Inventions of the false Church, which are too much contended for in this Day by them who say, <hi>They are come to the true Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, according to the Primitive Times</hi>; but thou wilt see (as thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parest their Practices with the Primitive times) to be quite contrary, and to be but Smoak, and that which has darkened the Air, clouded Peoples Understandings, and hath led them into Ignorance and Darkness, so that the Way of Truth hath not been discovered unto many; but the Lord is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risen, and that which comprehends time is made manifest, and all that which hath got up in the Apostacy is viewed and seen, and laid open to the View of all, that they may depart out of these things, which are but the Inventions and Traditions of Men, in which Eternal Life is not to be had: Read with Meekness, and in that which is spiritual in thy self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through which the things of God are made manifest, for with that I have U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and in that as thou livest and walkest, I bid thee farewell.</p>

                     <p>GOd according to his determinate Will, and everlasting Counsel, in the Fulness of time, sent his only begotten Son into the World, to be the Light of the World, and to be a Leader to the People, and to be a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World; who obeyed the VVill of the Father in all things, according as it was testified of him by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, and as it was said by <hi>David</hi> concerning him, <hi>In the Volumn of the Book it is written concerning me, I come to do thy Will O God,</hi> Psal. 40.7. and so he did as it was written of him, he fulfilled all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and ended all the Types, and Figures and Shadows, and VVorship of the first Covenant, as the Apostle testifieth of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.21. The Law was changed, and the Priesthood changed, in that they were but Figures and Shadows of good things to come; and in regard that they were faulty, and did not make the comers thereunto perfect, as pertaining to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but the bringing in of a better Hope did, and the better Covenant, to wit, the Covenant of Life and Peace, which the Prophets by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had testified of from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and till <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> likewise bore Testimony of him who was the Lamb of God, that took away the sins of the VVorld, <hi>John</hi> 1.29, 36. And now he being come to whom the Prophets testified, who was not made by a carnal Commandment as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the rest of the Priests under the Law, but after the Power of an endless Life, offered up himself once for all (putting an End to all the

                     <p>First, Thy Ministers are not according to the Ministers of Christ in the primitive times; their call not such, their practice not such: They were made Ministers in the primitive times by the holy Ghost, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but yours by natural Parts, Tongues, Arts, Philosophy and Study, and packing up old Authors together to make a little discourse of, and this must be called the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Ministers of Christ they preach freely, not for Gifts and Rewards, and Tythes, but you have brought in Judaism, Tythes which belonged to the first Priesthood, your Oblations, Obventions, your Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries, and these Invented and introduced things, to maintain your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters by.</p>

                     <p>Furthermore, as to the practice and Discipline of the Catholick Church (as it is called) which pleads for Authority, we find it not consonant and agreeing to the Church in the Primitive times, the first hundred Years after Christ.</p>
                     <p>As for the vestiments your Priests wear at certain times, one on this manner, another on that, your Ecclesiastical men, or Church Officers of several Ranks and orders, such we find not in the Primitive times, in that which may be truly called Primitive.</p>
                     <p>And for the invented Holy-dayes, and their Eves, for Fasting and Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we find no such in the Primitive Times, and such a Service for such a Day, and such a Worship for such a Day, we find not in the first hundred Years after Christ.</p>
                     <p>And for your Lent, which one of your Fathers invented, and this was his Ground, because God had the tenth of the increase of Tythes due to himself, and for his Ministers under the Law, therefore it was necessary that the tenth part of Dayes should be allowed as Tythes to the Lord: Oh!

                     <p>And now I would ask you a Question or two, seeing <hi>John</hi> saw the true Church flee into the Wilderness, the Woman that was cloathed with the Sun, who brought forth the Man-child; what cause have you to boast of Visibility, or Universality? Now when were you in the Wilderness? if your Church hath not been so, then it Demonstrates, that your Church is not the Woman cloathed with the Sun, for she did fly into the Wilderness as with the Wings of an Eagle.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Whether hath your Gospel been universally &amp; publickly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these sixteen hundred Years, or nay? And is it the very same that was Preached in the first hundred, or two hundred Years, seeing that <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>that all Nations did drink of the Whore's cup of Fornication?</hi> And then Nations were Waters, seeing he saith, the Gospel shall be preached again to Nations, Kindreds and Tongues; which clearly demonstrates, there was a time when the everlasting Gospel was not preached to the Kindreds &amp; Tongues, which are the Waters, upon which your Church is Situated; And it is evidently manifested, that yours hath been another Gospel then that which was preached in the Apostolick Church, and in the Catholick Church, the first hundred or two hundred Years after Christ was manifested in the Flesh: Much might be said, to Demonstrate the Truth which is in Hand, that there hath been an Apostacy, the Beginners thereof came forth in the Apostles dayes, and afterwards grew into a Body and became like a great Sea, which according to the best Ecclesiastical writer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Years; but in five hundred Years or less, the very Power of Godliness was denyed, and very much of the Form. And though your pleads Antiquity for a Thousand Years for these things aforementioned, which they would be hard to prove; For although it should be granted them, yet we will joyn issue with them in this thing, and are able to prove

all these Doctrines and Practices, not to be as it was in the first two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, (except they will own such as taught the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and taught the Doctrine of Devils, and went in <hi>Cain's</hi> and <hi>Chore's</hi> Way) for an Example.</p>
                     <p>It were not hard to prove the introducing of all these things before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and how they have come in by degrees, one Council that rose out of the Waters, ordaining this, another ordaining that; and so have risen up into this great Body of Darkness, some of the Practices borrowed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and some from the Heathen, and some invented of themselves in latter Ages; so that the Worship that was in the Spirit and in Truth, in Christ's and the Apostles dayes, is turned from, and such a numberless Number of vain Traditions, Ave-maries, Creeds, and Pater-nosters, and such a deal a do as there is about their unbloody Sacrifice of the Mass, that they are glad to be counted by their beads on strings, as many very well know. By all that which hath been said, may easily be Collected, that there hath been a great Deviation and Apostacy from the Doctrine and Practice of the Primitive times: thus far as I am descended, I leave it to the Reader to judge, and compare these things with the Churches Doctrine and practices in the first hundred Years after Christ, and if these things be found invented, and without footing or Ground, then let them that are informed depart from them.</p>

                     <p>THis I have to say to you, which is my Judgment and Belief, and that upon good Ground, that you are in many things in the Apostacy, as hereafter I shall demonstrate; and to tell you nakedly and plainly, we look upon the Reformation which was made in denying the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be but very weak, and poor, and feeble, and imperfect, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively with the Doctrine, and Practice, and Order in the primitive times, insomuch that we judge upon good Grounds, that it cannot be parallel'd with the Church in the primitive Times, which I have spoken of before, in that you have denyed the Pope to be the Head of the Church, and so are called <hi>Protestants</hi>; so am I, knowing that Christ is the Head of the Church, and ought to rule by his spiritual Scepter, and his eternal Power in the Hearts and Consciences of People, and in and over the true Church which is his Body, whereof he is the Head; and let all take heed who do intrude and take upon them that which belongeth to the King of Kings and King of Saints, as to matter of Headship, Regulation or Government, for all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is committed unto him in Heaven and Earth, and the Father hath given it to him, and will not have any other have that Glory; but whosoever

                        </gap>cipline and Order (as they call it) I find to be upholden, practised and contended for, which are found in the former, I have mentioned.</p>
                     <p>First of all, to instance that which is generally holden out by the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Protestants,</hi> is, that the Writings of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and several Epistles, is the Gospel which the primitive Disciples and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters preached and published, and which people did receive, and by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sound thereof were accounted <hi>Christians</hi> and Believers.</p>
                     <p>We would have all to know, the Gospel was preached to <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Matthew</hi> or <hi>Mark,</hi> or any of the Apostles writ a Word: Moreover, we would have all to know, that Christ had preached glad tidings to the captives, and some of the Disciples had preached the Word of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, before <hi>Matthew,</hi> or <hi>Mark,</hi> or <hi>Luke,</hi> or <hi>John</hi> had wrote a Word; my Reasons are divers; <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> must needs hear and see that done which they testified of, before they writ; and if <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> be the Gospel (the Writings of them I intend) then the Disciples could not preach it before it was given forth; and if the Epistles be a part of the Gospel, this the Disciples could not preach before it was written; for <hi>Paul</hi> succeeded and was converted after divers of the Apostles had preached the Gospel; so then doubtless the Disciples and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had something to say and declare and publish, before any of the New-Testament was written; and it is manifested that they were not sent out to preach the Law, nor the Ordinances of the first Covenant, after Christ was offered up, the End of the first: So then there was something and is something which was preached by them, and is to be published now to all that are made Ministers by the holy Ghost, and that is in few Words, the Power of God, which was before the New Testament (so called) though the Words declare of it, but is not it: Now they went and discipled in the Name of the Father, Son and holy Ghost, which is a Ministry far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the written or declarative Sound, or indeed is a spiritual and invisible Thing, which the Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. declaring his Message which he had received by the holy Ghost, saith, <hi>I was sent to turn them (viz.</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and them of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and else where he soiourned) <hi>from Darkness to Light, and from Satan's Power unto God's Power,</hi> that they that believed in the Light, and received the Power of God, which he preached to them, might receive Remission of Sins; for Remission of Sin was only preached in his Name; <hi>and there is no Name under Heaven, by which Men can be saved, but by the Name of Jesus</hi>; though the Apostles spoke according to the Motion of the Spirit, in divers Words, calling him the Gift of God, the free Gift of Righteousness, the unspeakable Gift, the true Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the World, the Power of God and the Wisdom of God, which Wisdom and Power they had received; and because the Son of God was revealed in them, the Apostle said, <hi>I am a Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

                     <p>Largely I might speak of this hidden Mystery, as to demonstrate what the Gospel of Christ was and is, but in what I have already said, they that are any thing spiritual minded will judge, that the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and the Epistles, were not the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gospel, but it was a thing beyond and above, and before any of these writings were, although they all in their several Ages, bore Testimony of it (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Power of God, which condemns Sin in the Flesh, and mortifies the Deeds thereof, and gives Victory over it, and taketh up all that believe in it into one Life, Power and Virtue, into pure Peace, and heavenly Contentment, and perfect Satisfaction: So you who are calling the Letter the Gospel, or the <hi>New Testament</hi> writings the Gospel, I would ask you a Question also, When was there a time since the first hundred Years after Christ, or in that time till now, that these Words and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings have not been spoken and preached, bought and sold as a Gospel, not only in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but also among them that are separated from her, even until now, this hath been preacht to Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People; and if the writings be the everlasting Gospel, then how doth <hi>John</hi> say, or why did he so say, that the everlasting Gospel should go forth again, and be preacht again after the Apostacy, or to bring out of the Apostacy? But it clearly implies the Word had been preached, and published; and the temporary Writings which were given forth at divers times had been preached up for Gospel these many Hundred Years, which many have received by tradition; but the Power of God, and the Gift of God, by which and from which the Ministers of Christ in all Ages mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, hath been wanting, if not altogether lost, for the most part among them that are called <hi>Christians</hi>; then what is the Quarrel betwixt you and the <hi>Romanists?</hi> it is but in translation at the most, and while words &amp; translations and Versions have been contented about, the everlasting Gospel hath been hid, therefore all People are upon heaps, and the Nations like waters rowling up and down in Instability; now the reformed Ministry (so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) are in many things in the same practice with the former: You deny an immediate Call, and set up an outward Ordinati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

maintenance, as lawful, and will make People believe it is according to Gospel-Institution, when alas! it is but the <hi>Pope's Tythes, Oblations, Obven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Mortuaries and Prayers for the dead,</hi> keeping up the Wages, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Work; And <hi>Tythe</hi> of all things, as <hi>Pigs and Geese, Hens and Egs, Apples and Cherries, and Turnips, and all, nothing excepted</hi>; this is a feeble thing, as to hold out to People for Gospel-ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And why is one Day preferred before and above another, and some counted holy-Dayes, as though some others were unholy-dayes? and why such a <hi>Collect,</hi> and such a <hi>Gospel,</hi> and such a <hi>Chapter,</hi> and such a <hi>Psalm,</hi> mincing and cutting and severing the Scripture in Pieces and Shreds? Is this like Apostolick Doctrine? truly Friends many things we have to say if you had an Ear to hear, and that upon good Ground we can speak, that we look upon all these things to be feeble, and poor, and beggerly things, and have no agreement, or congruity with the primitive times.</p>
                     <p>And should People be limited or stinted to such a certain Form of words, called Service, or Prayer, and divine Worship? was that ever reckoned divine Worship that was not from the divine Spirit? But it may be you will say the Words are good, or some of them; I am not speaking about Words, but the Spirit, from which every Service ought to be performed to the Lord God; and the primitive Christians prayed in the Spirit, and with Understanding, and sung with the Spirit, and with Understanding, 1 <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now, I say, if it be divine Worship, or any thing wherein God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and the People bettered, nothing of it ought to be wanting.</p>
                     <p>But these things the primitive times do not countenance; but when the power was lost, and the Life gone from, and the Spirit erred from, these things have come into the latter dayes, which have been very peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

                     <p>SO far as God did appear in any Age or Generation, or manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto the Sons of Men in any Shadows, Figures, Representations, or outward Appearances, the evil Spirit, and Serpents Seed, and Evil-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, alwayes took up the Form of the Thing, when it came into Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as largely might be demonstrated and instanced through all Ages and Generations, till the Closure of the Apostles Writings, something whereof hath been briefly hinted at before, so in this I shall be very brief.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> held up the Types and Figures of the first Covenant, and the Ordinances thereof, and opposed Christ, the Light, the everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and also the Publishers thereof: Moreover, when the Name of Christ came to be spread abroad, then false Apostles and deceitful Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, who were Enemies to the Cross, and to the Power of God, they preached Christ out of Contention and Envy, and for filthy Lucre, and by wicked Practices made the Name of <hi>Christians</hi> odious among the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> as it is this Day, and caused the worthy Name by which the Saints were saved, to be blasphemed by their ungodly Practices, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24.</p>
                     <p>When the Apostle gather'd together many that believ'd, and setled them in the Order of the Gospel, and the Order came well to be accounted of, and the Conversation of the Saints of good Account amongst many, divers false Prophets and deceitful Workers got up; and as the Apostles met in Houses, and the Saints met together in Houses, the false Apostles they crept into Houses, and held the Form, as I said before, and denyed the Power, and they were to be turned away from by the Apostle's Exhortation to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now since the true Church fled into the Wilderness, the false Church came into Visibility, and to sit as a Queen upon the Waters, the Nations and Peoples, other things have been brought in, other things are brought in and invented, which were not constitutions of Christ or the primitive Churches; and these the World hath wondered after in the dark Night of Apostacy; and the Worship hath been made up and compacted, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the <hi>Jews</hi> Worship, partly from the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and partly from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, being corrupted, and the Scriptures perverted every Way to prove all this Deceit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="409" facs="tcp:40634:228"/>Now many have judged to relinquish the former superstitious Practices, and to come and to take up the Form and Practice again in the outward, as it was in the Apostles Dayes, is to come out of the Apostacy; let all know this, the outward Court of the City was given to be trodden under Foot of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to pollute and defile it; and many may wait there, and look there in the polluted Court, and in the outside, that hath been defiled; and many may visit the Sepulchre, and wait for Christ when he is risen, and so look for him to appear in that which he is risen out of; the <hi>Jews</hi> at their Temple, when it is left desolate; the <hi>Crhistians</hi> (so called) may glory in their outward Court, though it be defiled, and so defiled as God will not appear there again; for he hath another Way manifested himself unto the Sons of Men.</p>
                     <p>And now that Worship that God requires, that Service that he requires, and that Glory wherein he will manifest himself, is, and will be in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which all People are to wait for, which come to witness Restoration, and to come to the End of the Night of Error, to the Bride, the Lamb's Wife again: Now a Measure of God's Spirit being given to every one to profit withal, which shews them Sin and Transgression, and will lead out of it, which shews formal Worship, and how Deceit hath transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and leads them that believed in it out of that which is polluted, and out of Deceit, to Christ, the sure Foundation and mighty Power of God, and to know God's Peace and Good-will to all Men: And that which must restore all People, and bring them out of the Apostacy into Purity, and to have Fellowship with the Father and the Son, and one with another as it was in the primitive times, is the mighty Power of God alone, which must be waited for, and believed in, and received, and made manifest in the Hearts of the People, or else they cannot come out of the Apostacy, nor see to the End of those Things that are to be abolished; and this is that which must be witnessed by every Man that comes to be a living Stone of the holy City, and a living Son of the free-Woman, and true Member of the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which God hath caused to descend, which is the Mother of all the Saints, and the Womb that brings them all forth, and the Breast at which they all suck, and are satisfied and nourished up to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life.</p>
                     <p>These Sayings are faithful and true, and blessed is he that heareth, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and receiveth them.</p>
                     <p>And this is a Testimony of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom God hath brought out of the Apostacy to the Beginning again, to see the Brightne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Furthermore, it is manifest how many Things have been introduced and brought concerning Worship and Ordinances, and are taught to be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the primitive Times, whenas they be brought in by Men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Minds in latter Ages, which had lost the Faith once delivered to the Saints, and had lost the Gospel-Order, and compelled People by outward Law to submit unto them; and yet all those Things they would fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scriptures, and bring some Scripture, which they pervert, as a Cloak and a Cover to blind People withal; but I shall descend to some Particulars.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. Concerning sprinckling Infants.</head>
                     <p>AND first concerning Baptizing or Christening Infants (as it hath been called) which is without prescribed Command or Example, commanded or ordained by Christ or his Apostles, although many in these latter Ages have wrested the Scriptures, thinking thereby to make their own Inventions to be reckoned or accounted to be the Ordinances of God; and the main Ground which the greatest <hi>Rabbies</hi> have given, hath been from these or the like Scriptures, <hi>Go teach and baptize all Nations,</hi> Mat. 28.19. But this is nothing at all to prove baptizing of Infants; here Teaching was to go before Baptizing, or Discipling, as the Words may be rendered, for they were not like to be Discipled which were untaught; now Infants not being capable of teaching, so are not capable of being made Disciples; now to baptize Infants, or sprinckle them with Water which are untaught, and not capable of being Disciples, is a ridiculous Thing, and to do it so as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> uses it, and they who are separated from them, is contrary to the Scriptures; and there is no mention made of Water at all, nor Infants; and their other Scriptures they have offered for Proofs, to prove this an Ordinance of Christ (and why) only because Christ took up Children into his Arms, and blessed them, and because he said, <hi>Whosoever enters into the Kingdom of God, must enter as a little Child</hi>; these Scriptures have been tendered for good Proofs, but the spiritual-minded will judge of the Weakness of them who offer these Things for a Proof: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it hath been said and accounted Orthodox, that Baptism came in the Room of Circumcision; but how they will prove it is yet unknown to many; for the Scriptures make not mention of any such thing; for one Type did never type out another, but every Type typified a Substance: Now Circumcision was a Type or a Figure, and cutting off the Fore-skin, was a Figure of Circumcision and cutting off the Fore-skin of the Heart; now Baptism with Water is a Type or Figure, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. which typed out the spiritual Washing or Regeneration; and if Baptism of Infants came in the room of Circumcision, then how do they agree in a Parallel? the Males were only circumcised, and why are the Females now baptized, if Baptism came in the room of Circumcision.</p>
                     <p>Another Thing which hath been alledged for a Proof, is that which Christ spoke to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> John 3.5. <hi>Except a Man be born again of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God</hi>; from whence it hath been inferred by many, that Baptism of Infants was absolutely necessary to Salvation; Christ spoke of that which did regenerate and make anew, and cleanse the Heart, and of the clean Water which the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> spoke of, which he would pour upon his People; visible Water cleanseth not the inside, neither doth regenerate; but the Water which Christ giveth to every one that thirsteth, to drink, is the Water of Life, and this wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the inside, and cleanseth the Heart, and this is the washing of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which whosoever comes not to know, cannot enter in the Kingdom

                     <p>LIkewise the Sign of the Cross, and the Chrisme, are invented things which are in the Apostacy, and therefore you who Profess your selves Reformed, for shame leave off these things, and come out of them, and deny them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Parishes, and Parish-Churches, which were Ordained and builded in the Apostacy, and dedicated unto Saints, which stand to this day both in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the reformed Churches so called, and Church-Yards, which they call Holy and Consecrated Ground to bury their Dead in, this is an invented thing and Superstitious, and yet it stands as an Apostolick order both among Papists and Protestants in the Primitive times, in the dayes of the Apostles; the Scriptures make mention of the <hi>Jews</hi> Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Idols Temples in which they Worship; the Apostles and Ministers of Christ, who published the Word of Reconciliation, and Christ the substance of all Figures, they gathered them that did believe of the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Temple and Temple-worship, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from their Temples and Idols, to Worship God in the Spirit, and they met together in Houses; we read of no Parish-Churches dedicated to Saints, nor Consecrated Ground, for they knew the Earth was the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, and was clean and good and Blessed to them that believed, and there was no dividing into Parishes then, nor no compelling; then <hi>Corinth</hi> was not divided into a Parish, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Philippi, Thessalonica, Philadelphia</hi>; and <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and the rest, were not all made into Parishes, neither were them that believed not, compelled or forced to come to the Christians Meeting at <hi>Antioch, Philippi, Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica, Philadelphia,</hi> or any other place that we read of in the Scriptures; and the Apostles were not confined, nor their Spirits were not so strait as to stay over one hundred or fifty Families twenty Years, and call that their Parish between such an Hedge and such a Ditch, and such a Water, and such a Way, as Parishes are now divided into; though I say, they had Houses to meet in, and preached the Word, and brake Bread from House to House, and sometimes by the Sea-side they Congregated, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on an Hill, and at certain places they met together to Worship God, they went not back to the <hi>Jews</hi> Temple nor <hi>Gentiles</hi> Idols Temples, neither forced any of their Maintenance as to minister unto them; by which all may see that these invented Churches and Church-Yards for Holy ground, and Parishes, are not Apostolical, nor was no Catholick nor Universal thing then in the Primitive times, neither was there any command given to the Christians to do any such thing, neither Reprehension for not doing such things.</p>

                        <hi>Domitius Nero</hi> began his Reign about the sixty seventh year after Christ, he Reigned fourteen years Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> under him was the first of the ten <hi>Roman</hi> Persecutions, he caused the Christians of all Ages, Sects and sorts to suffer; he commanded <hi>Rome</hi> to be set on Fire in twelve places, and to avoid the infamy thereof, he accused the Christians with it, and caused them to be persecuted and put to Death; and in the latter end of his Reign, <hi>Paul</hi> was put to Death for the Testimony of the Faith of Christ. In the year sixty nine, this <hi>Nero</hi> was afterwards proclaimed by the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> an Enemy to all Mankind, and condemned to be drawn through the City, and to be Whipt to Death, for fear of which he fled, and afterwards slew himself, and the Church had Rest for a season from Persecution af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</p>
                     <p>In the ninety sixth year began <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour to Reign, who began the second Persecution, who was a Blasphemer against God, and an Idolater; In his dayes was <hi>Simon</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> crucified, and <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist banished into the Isle of <hi>Patmos</hi>; but after the Death of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> he was released by <hi>Pertinax</hi>; this <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour fearing the coming of Christ again, commanded that all that could be found of the stock of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Jewry</hi> should be slain, and many false Accusations were brought against the Christians, and the Inquisition was this, Swear the Truth, whether thou art indeed a Christian, and if they confessed, they were condemned, and put to Death for that alone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clement</hi> succeeded <hi>Anacletus</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and after him <hi>Everistus</hi> who was martyred under <hi>Trajanus</hi> in the 102 year after Christ. In the Reign of <hi>Trajanus</hi> the Emperor, began the third persecution of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, <hi>Simon</hi> who was said to be Christ's kinsman, was Bishop of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> who suffered Martyrdom in the Reign of <hi>Trajanus,</hi> in the year 111. with many other of the Christians who were destroyed in this persecution; the churh of <hi>Rome</hi> was not so highly exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as afterwasd she usurped Authority; neither were the Officers thereof nor Bishops so corrupt as afterwards they came to be both in Doctrine and Practice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcus Antonius Verus</hi> began the forth Persecution, in the year 162. in whose time a great number who professed Christ, suffered cruel Deaths in <hi>Asia,</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> and other parts, among whom was <hi>Polycarpu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> the Bishop of <hi>Smyrna</hi>; this persecution continued thirteen years: The church had some rest under the Reign of <hi>Lucius Antonius Comadus,</hi> and then the Christians began to wrangle and jangle about the celebration of Easter, and about Observations of Times and Feasts, and run into things outward, and contended about them, and so weakned themselves, and hurt one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> succeeded <hi>Everistus,</hi> and <hi>Telesphorus</hi> succeeded him likewise, and <hi>Higinus,</hi> and <hi>Pius,</hi> and <hi>Ansatus Soler,</hi> and <hi>Elutherius</hi>; all these were Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> but many things began to creep in in their time, but being kept under by the Roman Emperors, they did not get much outward Power, because they had no outward compelling Laws, to force their Institutions in divers things which were contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the former Apostles Practices, yet notwithstanding there was something of Truth, and of the Power of it kept, and they testified against the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Heathen, and so suffered death.</p>

                        <hi>Severus</hi> succeeded in the Empire about the year 195. under whom was the fifth Persecution against the Christians, who reigned eighteen years; in the beginning of his reign he was somewhat favourable to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but afterwards through the malicious suggestions, and accusations of wicked men, he was so enraged and incensed against the Christians, that by proclaimation he commanded through the Empire, that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians any more should be suffered, whereby a great number were destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and killed, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith in his 6<hi>th.</hi> Book about the year 205. This <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> the Emperor was slain in <hi>Brittain</hi> about the year 214. and was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>York.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aurelius Alexander Severus</hi> began his reign about 224. at this time the Church had gotten some rest from Persecution, at this time the Christians had gotted some House or Place to meet in, in this time of rest in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Cooks and Tiplers challenged it to belong to them, the matter being brought before the Heathen Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> he judged it to be more honest and reasonable, that this Place should be continued to the Christians to worship God in, then that the Cooks and Victualers, and Tiplers should enjoy it; by this all may understand that there was no great Minsters, Steeple-houses, or Places called Churches erected in <hi>Rome</hi> unto this time for the Christians, although there is so much ado in this time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Steeple-houses, and Minsters and Parish-churches, within this latter Age, by them that are run into visible things have been so strongly pressed for a house of God. and a holy Church; so that in this time the Christians had no Mass-houses with Steeples, and Crosses, and Bells, and Organs, standing East and West, which are pleaded for to be decent and holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, yet notwithstanding the Moderation of this Emperor, <hi>Galistus</hi> and <hi>Urbanus</hi> Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> were put to death, but yet the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> did not arrogate to themselves to be universal, and these were not called <hi>Popes,</hi> though divers superstitious things crept in, and were allowed by the said Bishops, and they were declining from the Doctrine and Practice of the Apostles in the first century, and this was about the year 226.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximinius</hi> the next, was chosen Emperor rather by the wilfulness of Souldiers, then the Will of the Senate, he caused the sixth Persecution which was great against the Christians, especially against the Leaders and Teachers, hoping that when they were smitten, the Sheep would soon be scattered, this was in the year 237. <hi>Pontianus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Emperor, and many more christians suffered under this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and were put to death, and more it is likely would have suffered, but the Lord shortned his dayes, and his Tyranny, for he reigned but three years.</p>
                     <p>The next Emperor was <hi>Gordianus</hi> in the year two hundred and forty, who was more moderate towards the christians, so that the sixth Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ceased, but after he had reigned the space of six years he was slain by <hi>Philip</hi> the succeeding Emperor,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Philippus</hi> who slew <hi>Gordianus,</hi> who was called the first christian Emperor who slew <hi>Gordianus</hi> and began with blood, he with his Son <hi>Philip</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Empire seven years; about the year 246. it is said this <hi>Philip</hi> with his Son and Family was converted by <hi>Fabianus</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi>; it is said that both he &amp; his Son were slain by <hi>Decius</hi> one of his own Captains, and though

being the first that brought in Christianity into the Imperial seat, but the name of Christianity would not save him, being out of the Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with blood, it was required at his Hands, and <hi>Anthetius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> after <hi>Pontanius; Damasus</hi> saith, that this Bishop was put to death, because he recorded the deaths of the sufferers, and here was the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that which they call the Legend of Martyrs in the Chucrh of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>The seventh Persecution began by <hi>Decius</hi> who succeeded <hi>Philippus</hi> in the Year 250. by whom was moved a terrible Persecution against the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which is noted to be the seventh Persecution. <hi>Fabianus</hi> being a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man, and had a Wife, was chosen Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; this Doctrine of Devils forbidding to marry was not yet brought in, which the Apostle to <hi>Timothy</hi> prophesied of, no not in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor for two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Years after Christ; so the Emperor <hi>Decius</hi> put him to death, and gave forth a Proclamation that all that professed the Name of Christ should be put to death. <hi>Origen</hi> suffered many bonds, wrackings, torments for Religion, yet afterwards it is said he sacrificed to Idols, and was exco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="447" facs="tcp:40634:240"/>
were much more justified in the Sight of God then the Heathen Emperors, who came all or most of them to a woful End of their Cruelty, and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Murder; for the Hand of the Lord who distributes Justice equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to every man according to his Works, found them out; and <hi>Gallianus</hi> the Son of <hi>Valerianus,</hi> who joyned with his Father in persecution, had many earthquakes, and thirty Rebellions and Insurrections raised in his time, in the Empire in nine years time, and this stopt their persecuting of the Christians somewhat; and after <hi>Gallianus</hi> the Emperor succeeded <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> who reigned two years, and after him <hi>Quintilianus</hi> the Brother of <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who continued only seventeen Dayes, about the year two hundred seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four, in this time the Christians had some rest from Persecution.</p>
                     <p>The nineth Persecution began under <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> who began his Reign mildly, but soon after moves the nineth Persecution, about this time many Christians suffered, and some of the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onysius,</hi> and many others in the middle of his Reign, there was a Council of the Christians at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Emperor seeming not to be against it, nor them, but afterward he was about to seal an <hi>Edict</hi> for further Persecution of the Christians, but he was so terrified with thundring and lightning, that it stopt his Tyranny, in the sixth year of his Reign he was slain about the year 276.</p>

                        <hi>Carus</hi> with his two Sons <hi>Carinus</hi> and <hi>Numerianus</hi> succeeded <hi>Probus</hi> in the Empire, the Reign of which Emperors continued in all but three years <hi>Carus</hi> was slain with lightning, and <hi>Numerianus</hi> was also slain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; <hi>Carinus</hi> the other Son reigned alone in <hi>Italy</hi> with much Wickedness, who afterwards was slain by the hands of the Tribune at <hi>Rome</hi>; so that from the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Valerianus,</hi> unto the Reign of <hi>Dioclesian.</hi> there seeming to be about forty four years, in which there was little Persecution of the Christians, but they had rest and enjoyed their Worship in quiet, and they were kept under Sufferings, and the Law, and did not exercise Authority over the Consciences of the rest, as afterwards they did, when they came to have Power in their hands, although as I said before, divers things were brought in by the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> in this time, which were much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing with the Apostles Dayes, yet they held part of the true Worship, and bore a Testimony against the open prophaneness, and cursed Idolatry, and pride of the Heathen Emperors, who killed one another for the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Seat; and in this Testimony that they bore for God, I believe they were accepted, and had peace with God.</p>

                     <p>And all this fasting was but from some Meat, as though some had been clean, and some had been unclean; some abstained only from Flesh and fed only upon Fish, and all other creatures; others upon Fish and Fowls of the Air, affirming their Original is of the Water, and so no Flesh; and other some fasted till nine of the clock; and then eat of divers Sorts as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and here was their <hi>Fast</hi> and their <hi>Lent,</hi> about which was all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Stir, all which Practices are condemned in the Apostles Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and such Ignorance and Hypocrisie; for the Kingdom of God stands not in Meats and Drinks, and yet the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and they that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Reformed, will needs press these things as holy Institutions, whenas it is manifest, when the Christians in former dayes began to judge one another about these things, and strive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bite one another, and devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they lost the Power, and then <hi>Mystery-Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and is now accounted the greatest Violence and Torture, and the greatest Tyranny and severest kind of Persecution upon the Earth, insomuch that many <hi>Papists</hi> abhor the very Name and Mention of it, and to the Death withstand the bringing in of this Slavery amongst them; the Extremity and Rigor of this Inquisition until the year· 1609.

Many more vain Practices and Doctrines, which have been brought in since the Apostles Dayes, might be mentioned; but in that which is said already, the understanding will see that there hath been a great Apostacy, both in Life, Doctrine and Practice from the Apostles Time downward until now, and that which is called the Catholick Church in <hi>Rome</hi> is in it; and likewise divers of them who are separated from her stick too much in these Things because of the Custom, Tradition and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of them.

was changed when Christ came to be manifest, the end of the Law for Righteousness; now, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and the rest of the high-Priests were but Types and Figures of the everlasting high Priest, so the Judges and Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were Types and Figures of Christ, the King of Kings, and King of Saints, and Law-giver, and Judge; and their outward Power which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued but for a time, in compelling to the true Worship under that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or restraining from Idolatry, did but continue until the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was but a Type and a Figure of Christ, and his spiritual Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Weapons, and spiritual execution upon his Enemies, who are not subject to his Government or Power, seeing the Father hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Power unto him in Heaven and in Earth, and <hi>Moses</hi> the Mediator of the first Covenant which stood in outward Ordinances, both the Mediator, the Covenant &amp; the Ordinances had an end (when the better Covenant was given, the Covenant of Light, and Christ the Mediator thereof was manifest) &amp; this Covenant &amp; Ordinances pertained unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the compelling unto the Worship and punishing for Idolatry pertained unto the <hi>Jews</hi> only, who were under that Covenant, and not to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as it was written, <hi>To Jacob he gave his Law, and to</hi> Israel <hi>his Statutes</hi>; to every Nation he did not so.</p>
                     <p>So they which would bring People now under this Covenant, and the Power thereof, deny the second, the everlasting Covenant, and his Power; and they that would preach up compelling and forcing to worship, and bring those Scriptures of the first Covenant to be their Ground, are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the times unto which they were spoken; and upon this false Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation hath the false Church persecuted about Worship this many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and this Doctrine is in too much credit with many in these dayes, who say they are under the Gospel; and this hath made People to hate and persecute one another.</p>
                     <p>And the Ministers of Antichrist have pressed it upon Kings and Rulers, that God hath required it of them to enforce, and enjoyn all People unto a Worship, although they themselves are divided among themselves, one while for this thing, and another while for that; and because the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> did so, and had Power to do, therefore they have concluded that Princes and Judges ought to do so, and so have made them put their Neck in a Yoak which is too heavy for them to bear, which the Lord hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their Hands, and because of this compellings and forcings, many Hypocrites have been made, and many of God's Peoples Consciences wounded, and burdned, and many Kings and Rulers have lost their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and they have been taken from them because of this, by the Lord.</p>
                     <p>So all that have intruded upon Christ's Prerogative, and Soveraignity in this thing, are sure to be reckoned as no other but as Usurpers, and Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into that Power which the Father alone hath given unto his Son, which Power, Dominion and Glory, he will not give unto any other, as to be Judge and Law-giver in the Hearts and Consciences of his People.</p>

                     <p>Further it may be objected, ought not Blasphemy, and Idolatry, and Adultery be punished, is this to be suffered now, seeing it was punished, under the Law?</p>

                     <p>IN the Beginning when God Created the Heaven and the Earth, and all things that are therein, by the Word of his Power, and set the Bounds and the Habitations thereof, and separated betwixt Light and Darkness; And when man was created in his own Image, in the Image of God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he him, Male and Female created he them: Now the Image of God consists in Righteousness, Holiness, Equity, Long-suffering, Patience, Goodness, Mercy and Truth, the Glory thereof is unspeakable, man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Image there was no Transgression nor Sin, nor Sorrow, man was bound unto his Maker by the Power in which he was made, yea, he was in a capacity to Fear, Love, Honour, obey and Worship his Maker, from the virtue of that Power and Principle which God had placed in him, which some ignorantly call the Law of Nature; (but that is not the intention of my discourse to contend what it was) but to shew that man was at Union with God, and bound unto him by that which God had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in him, in which his Wisdom, Power and dominion stood, to rule over all Creatures, Life was in him, there was no Death then, in this the Obligation stood, not in outward written commands or Ordinances, but it stood in that which was eternal and Invisible, this was before the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, here were no Oaths yet, nor outward Covenants made, nor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances.</p>
                     <p>But after man had Transgressed, and eaten of the Tree of Knowledge of good and Evil, and gone from the Power, and broken the Covenant, he lost his Wisdom, and Folly entred; he lost his Dominion, and Weakness entred; he lost his Knowledge, and Ignorance entred, and an earthly part and a mutable came to have Dominion, not that this was Evil in it self, being subjected by the Power and Word in its place, and in the State wherein it was good; but Man being gone from the power, and from the Covenant, joyned to something out of it, and out of the mind, and listened to that which should have been ruled over, that became a Leader which God never appointed, and this led man's Heart from the invisible God of Life, and Light, who is immutable, to lust after Visible things, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and earthly things, and into instability: And so his Heart and mind and affections became more and more to be alienated from the Lord, and his understanding more darkned, yet such was the love of God unto mankind that he did not wholly cast him off here, but followed him with his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Promised the <hi>Seed of the Women shall bruise the Serpent's Head,</hi> and so it did; yet the Adulterers Generation in the Transgressing Nature were great and fast, and there were but few before the Flood, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the Multitude who bore the Image of God, and few in a Generation, as <hi>Abel, Enoch, Seth,</hi> and the rest went after the Imaginations of their own

                     <p>But to return to the Levitical Priesthood, no Tythes did the Priests re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive under the Law of the People; for those belonged to the <hi>Levites, Exod.</hi> 13.2. that were appointed over the Tabernacle, to bear it, and to take it down, and to set it up, to serve <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, and to keep the Instruments thereof; and for the better ordering of things, they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three parts, the <hi>Coathites,</hi> the <hi>Gershonites</hi> and the <hi>Mararites,</hi> and these received Tythes of the People, and delivered, the Priests did not all; so our Tythe-taking Priests are contrary to the Law and first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the Gospel also, and therefore to be looked upon as no other then Anti-christians; but to return to <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Priesthood in the first Covenant, they grew and multiplied, and then the Priests were divided into twenty four Ranks or Courses, of which our Prebends, Deans and Chapters take their Example or Imitation, so to serve by their Turns at Cathedrals, as they are called, or else from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is worse; but the latter I am rather enclined to believe, because there was no such Name of any Ministers among the <hi>Jews,</hi> neither in the primitive Church, truly so called; but the Priests gave Attendance to execute their Office, and burn Incense, as his Turn came; and hereupon <hi>Zecharias,</hi> who is said to be of the course of <hi>Abiah, Luke</hi> 1.

                     <p>The Priests and the <hi>Levites</hi> being separated for the Work of the Lord in the Tabernacle and Temple, ministred according to the command and ordinances of the first Covenant, which were only Figures of things to come, and Shadows of things that were but to continue until the time of Reformation, and then they all had an End, both the Priesthood and the <hi>Levites,</hi> and their Service, and Office, and Maintenance, and Tythes ended, as the Apostle saith to the <hi>Hebrews, The Priesthood is changed, and the Law is changed,</hi> by which they received these Tythes for the Work afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said; but to descend, and to come unto the primitive time, we shall see whether Tythes were paid or no to Gospel-Ministers in the second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

                     <p>Christ Jesus when he had finished his Office upon Earth by fulfilling all Righteousness, he offered up himself through the eternal Spirit a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto God, without Spot; the Apostles and Ministers who were made Partakers of the Divine Nature, and of the Word of Reconciliation, did not look back to the former Ordinances of the first Priesthood, but testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an End was put to them, and witnessed against the Temple wherein the Priests ministred; <hi>Paul</hi> and likewise <hi>Stephen</hi> were stoned, and against Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, saying, <hi>It was not that of the Flesh,</hi> and against all the outward Ordinances of that Covenant, and called them <hi>Carnal,</hi> and preached up Christ Jesus and his Doctrine, the new and living Way, which was not manifest while the first Tabernacle was standing; they preached freely the Everlasting Gospel, and did not desire or require setled Maintenance, but were ministred to only by them who had believed their Report, and were turned to Christ Jesus, and were made Partakers of spiritual things, though they often denyed that which was given unto them; here was no Tythes spoken on, either to the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> who believed.</p>

ninth general Council held at <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> the second, 1119. mentions Tythes, but speaks only of such as had been given to the church by special consecration, for at that time people being led to believe that their Tythes ought to be given to the Poor, did dispose of them to the Heads and Rulers of religious Houses who kept open hospitality for the Poor and for strangers, they were esteemed Holy and good treasurers for the poor, who took care of distribution of them, as is testified by <hi>Cassian</hi>; But the Council held under Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, <hi>Anno</hi> 1180.

                     <p>There was no Law, Canon or Constitution of any General Council as yet found, that did command Tythes, or expresly supposed them a duty of common right before the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> held in the Year 1215 un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, about which time the Pope's Power was grown great and powerful; But still the People had greater mind to give them to the Poor, then to the Priest, and made <hi>Innocent</hi> complain and cryed out against those that gave their Tythes and first fruits to the Poor, and not to the Priests, as hainous Offenders. At a Council held at <hi>Lyons</hi> under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 10 in the year 1274. it was constituted, that it should not thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be lawful for men to give their Tythes at their own pleasure, as they had done before, but to pay all to the Mother-Church.</p>
                     <p>But the great Decree which speaks most plain, and till then nothing was given forth which did constitute them, but rather supposed them as by former right, was made at the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> under Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4th, about the Year 1560. They commanded Tythes to be paid under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of Excommunication about the Year 800, 900, 1000, and after Tythes were called the Lord's Goods, the Patrimony of the Poor, according to <hi>Ambrose, Jerom,</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom's</hi> Doctrine only, borrowed from the <hi>Jews.</hi> So thus in short I have shown, that Tythes were never reckoned as due to the Clergy for a thousand Years, but they did give them as they would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how much they would, and that without compulsion, till the height of Popery and the power of Darkness spread over all, and since for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>About the year six hundred or soon after, <hi>Gregory</hi> the first, then the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> sent over <hi>Augustin</hi> the Monk into <hi>England,</hi> by whom <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> was converted, as they call it, but it was but to Popery; he and his <hi>Clergy</hi> long time after followed the Example of former Ages, living in common upon the offerings of their Converts, and those that received them, joyned into Societies according to the primitive Practice by <hi>Gregories</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that they should in Tenderness to the <hi>Saxon</hi>-Church, still imitate the Primitive times, that that might not make their Religion burdensom;
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:40634:258"/>
but afterwards having brought a great part of the Nation to their Faith, they began to preach up the old <hi>Roman</hi>-Doctrine, that Tythes ought to be paid, and having taught People that Pardon of Sin was merited by good works and the Torments of Hell avoided by Charity, then it was no hard mrtter to perswade them to give their Tenths, and Lands, but also their outward Riches, and the Clergy had almost got a third Part of the Land into their Hand.</p>
                     <p>As concerning Laws and Canons for Tythes among the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it is reported, that in the Year seven hundred eighty six two Legates were sent from the Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the first, to <hi>Offa</hi> King of <hi>Merceland,</hi> and <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolf</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who made a Decreee, that the People of these two Kingdoms should pay Tythes; by this it may be seen that Tythes were not reckoned as due for many hundred Years, and indeed were never due in the second Covenant: So these things that are so pleaded for by these hireling Priests of this last Age, which have no better plea then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity for their tythes and forced Hire, may be convinced, that Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without Truth is nothing, and yet the Antiquity of the Churches in the primitive times condemns these practices; so that let all <hi>Protestants</hi> deny these introduced Institutions, and the <hi>Popes</hi> Wages, forced tythes and hire, which is Antichristian.</p>
                     <p>A cloud of Witnesses might be brought out of the Ancient Fathers, who testified against them; and divers Martyrs, as <hi>Walter Brute</hi> and <hi>John Wickliff,</hi> who suffered Martyrs for testifying the Truth against the Idolatry and Superstitions of that Age.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>History of Tythes,</hi> saith, that before the Year eight hundred, or there abouts, there is not any general Law that yet remains in publick, and is of credit, which ordained any payment of Tythes in the Western-Church, for the Eastern never any Law that hath been observed, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons them; So the first giving of tenths was by the perswasions of some of the Fathers fore-mentioned, for the poor and Service of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they were only the free Offering or free Gift of the people, as Alms, which were brought into the common treasury, first disposed of by Deacons for the Service of the Church; but they being sound faulty, it was ordered or decreed in a Council, that the Bishop or Overseer should dispose of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, the Offerings; but they were not compellable, who did not offer this or that part, but were left to do as they had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Freedom, only exhorted and threatned with the Judgements of God, if they suffered the poor to lack or be in want.</p>
                     <p>The Predecessors of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> the <hi>Bohemians</hi> being descended from the <hi>Waldenses</hi> fore-mentioned, did profess that all Priests and Ministers ought to be poor, and to be content with the free Gift, or what the People freely offered them, so saith <hi>Eneas Silvius</hi> in his <hi>Bohemian</hi> History, and it is one of <hi>John Wickliff</hi>'s Articles, for which he was censured, viz. <hi>That Tythes were a free Gift as among Christians, or only pure Alms, and that the Parishi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The best manner of walking is, that which the Lord directs and leads into, which is pure and holy and incorrupt; and the Saints practice, who were taught of God, is the best Example to follow, and their Manners and Deportment among the Sons of men are chiefly to be followed, although that which is from below, doth and hath ever disesteemed their Way, and the Honour that comes from above; although the Heathen had many Lords and many Gods, yet it was said to <hi>Israel, Thy God is but one, and him shalt thou bow unto alone, and reverence his Name; Israel</hi> was not to follow the vain Customs of the Nations, neither follow their Example, who ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the living God with their Hearts; and Multitudes are not to be followed in doing Evil; Custom without Truth is but a bad plea; Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with Unrighteousness is but bad Proof; that which leads into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is not to be minded, but that which leads into Restauration and Innocency.</p>

                     <p>As for Parish Churches which I mentioned before, some say it was the Decree of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council in the Year 1180.

                  <p>And though we have given publick testimony, both in Word and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (in divers Nations) in Doctrine and Practice, yet such hath been the Envy of many Professors, who have denyed the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they have accused us for holding <hi>Popish</hi> tenets, yet now on the other Hand by this <hi>Popish</hi> Author we are condemned as Hereticks and Sectaries, and to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Salvation: And thus they who have been under the Beast's Power in the Apostacy, have tost us upon their Horns from one to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have pushed us this Way and that Way; and every Party and Sect hath reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned us and joyned us with them whom they judged to be Transgressors; but it is a small thing to us to be judged by Man's Judgment; for our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is with the Lord, and he judgeth in Righteousness, and unto him we appeal, who in his own Day, when Righteousness comes to be revealed in Peoples Hearts, they shall come to know us as we are, and the Truth which we believe and walk in, as it is in Jesus.</p>
                  <p>But that such a Heap and Bundle of false Doctrine, and superstitious and idolatrous Practices may not go unreproved, God hath put it into my Heart to bear my Testimony against it, and all the confused Heap of Darkness, which is laid down for Catholick Doctrine, and to discover the Deceit thereof, lest any should be beguiled, and led into the dark Paths of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Error, and should become an Inhabitant of that City which hath shed the Blood of the Prophets and Martyrs, where now Christ is crucified.</p>

                     <hi>First,</hi> To be the Harlot, because she was never in the Wilderness: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because her Seat hath been so universal and catholick, as Nations, Kindreds, Tongues, Peoples and Languages have been the Seat of your Church, which are the Waters which <hi>John</hi> saw, and so truly may be called the great City.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Infidels being oblieged to joyn to you,</hi> this hath been because you have forced and compelled by your Power and outward Force, where you had Dominion, and to escape your Tortures, rather then by sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or an holy Example: Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because your Religion hath stood in so many Formalities and Ceremonies, which have been very pleasing, and so near unto the Heathens Nature.</p>
                  <p>And thou say'st, <hi>That one cannot be bound to seek that which is invisible</hi>; I say, through Faith God hath been seen, who is invisible; and Christ said, <hi>Seek, and ye shall find</hi>; and the Kingdom of God is spiritual and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and the natural and visible Eye never discerned it; for the Church is in God, and God is a Spirit, and Christ is the quickning Spirit, who is the Head of the Church, which is his Body; and the spiritual and invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eye is that which discerns the Head and the Body; and you that look gazing after Things that are visible, have never discerned the Members of the true Church of God as such, neither have known them, but have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them as Hereticks in all Ages, as your Generation hath done, who have been in <hi>Cain</hi>'s Way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If <hi>Unity, Holiness, Universal</hi> and <hi>Apostolick,</hi> be the marks and signs of a true Church, then yours is not the true Church, no more then they you count Sectaries and Hereticks, which thou saist, are no more one then Cats and Dogs: The comparison is odious, and like a Sn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, If <hi>Holiness</hi> be a sign of the true church, you are without this sign also more then the Sectaries, as you are pleased to call them: What cruel Murthers, Massacres, Tortures, Blood-sheds have been acted by your church, and that by Commission from his Holiness, (so called) Christ's Vicar, against them that have dissented from you upon good and warrantable Ground, only upon the account of Religion, because they could not acknowledge the Pope to be the Head, and Christ's Vicar, and receive all Decrees, though never so repugnant unto the Doctrine of Christ; yet because for Conscience sake many have denyed such things, nothing but Fire and Sword hath been threatned, and the force thereof hath been known in many Nations, as for instance, in <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries, France, Pyedmount, Holland, England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> of late years many Thousands Massacreed (not in War) but in Holes, hundreds of Houses burnt, Men, Women and Children; Children taken from their Mothers Breasts, and knockt against the Walls, toss'd upon Pikes Spears, wounded with Swords, thrown into Lakes and Rivers, stript Naked, starv'd in cold Seasons, through such like in human and Savage cruelty: Commissions given from your Nuntio's and Agents to Rob, to Steal, even Servants from their Masters, even upon this account only, to weaken and enfeeble the <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as you stile them, to advance your Holiness's Chair, and to propagate your holy, or rather Unholy Church and Religion, which things remain fresh in the memory of many Nations to this Day; besides, doth not your Church tolerate <hi>Stews</hi> and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Houses in the Cities where you have Dominion?

And thou saist, In <hi>Asia, Affrica</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> all is coming to an End. There is that risen, and arising in <hi>America,</hi> which must spread over the Nations; the Breath of the Lord bloweth, which will daily dry up the Waters, which is the Seat of your Church, which you so much Boast of: And what, have you converted all the <hi>Indians</hi>? nay, have you not hardned their Hearts against the Name of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of your cruelty and unholy conversation among them? So that the Name of <hi>Christ</hi> and christian, is become as Odious unto them, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> is unto you; And so you are without this Sign, as that you are the true church.</p>
                  <p>Lastly. That your church is <hi>Apostolick,</hi> if this be the Mark of the true church, then you are without this also; for you are neither <hi>Apostolick</hi> in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine nor Practice; your Weapons are carnal, theirs spiritual; their Head was Christ the Light of the World; your Head is visible and carnal, which darkens the World; they turned People from Darkness to Light, and to the Word of Faith in their Hearts, and to know Christ in them to justifie them: But one of your Rabbies told us lately, you had no such Doctrine in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Christ in you</hi>: The Apostles turn'd them to the Anointing, and to the Spirit, to be taught by it, and to be led by it into to all Truth, and to worship in it; and you turn them to Images, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Crucifixes, Beads and Altars, and so keep People in outward things, which feed the Sensual and corrupt part. Lastly, they said, <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exercise profiteth little</hi>; and most of your Worship stands in observing of Days, Meats, Drinks, Washings, Sprinklings, Altars, Tapers, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bearing Candles, Bowing, creeping to the Cross, turning wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this way and that way in all time and parts of your Worship; so that there is no time left for the Heart to be exercised towards God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And so you are not Apostolical, and so are without this true sign of being the true Church of God. But I shall descend to particular things, which are assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and seem to be proved, but very weakly: But we can expect no Wine but such as is in the Bottle.</p>
                  <p>It is asserted by this Author, <hi>That the Pope is the Head of the true Church, in which Salvation is only to be expected</hi>: And his proof he brings, is this; <hi>Christ hath so ordained it, in saying to</hi> Peter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18.19. Upon this Rock will I build my Church; <hi>and Christ hath given Power to him and his Successors, to be a Head, to rule and govern the Church; and as there is an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to be the Head of the Empire, and a King of the Kingdom, so</hi> Peter <hi>and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostolick Church hath this Doctrine,
<q>That Christ was given to be the Head of the Body, which is the Church, which is spiritual, though in the World, yet not of the World; and the Father hath committed all Power in Heaven and Earth to the Son, and hath ordained him to be a Leader, a Teacher and Feeder of his Flock, and to be his Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, and his Glory he will not give unto another.</q>

Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him which was reveal'd unto <hi>Peter</hi> by the Father, the Son of God which was the Rock which the Fathers eat of, and drank of, Christ the Rock of Ages; and <hi>another Foundation can no man lay</hi> (said the Apostle) <hi>then that which is laid already, Christ the Rock and Corner-Stone,</hi> and not <hi>Peter</hi>; for Christ is unchangeable, and abideth for ever, and so was not <hi>Peter,</hi> though <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles received Power from Christ; yet in the 22<hi>d.</hi> and 23<hi>d.</hi> verses of the same chapter, he was gone out of the savour and discerning, and Christ said unto him, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan for thou sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourest not the things of God</hi>; and what though it could be proved that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> a Pastor, an Elder, or a Bishop, who fed the Flock; and did feed the Flock, and so might be reckoned as an Elder, and worthy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in respect of his Labour and Diligence in the Work of Christ; is the Promise so entailed to <hi>Rome</hi> or to any Place, that the next that succeeds in that Place must needs receive the same Honour, when he doth not the same Work, which is worthy of Honour, neither is in the same Power? but this I am sure of, though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> lay claim unto <hi>Peter</hi>'s Bishoprick, as they say, yet they have not done his Work.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, If <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Pastor yet he was not a Lord; for Christ reproved that when they strove which should be the greatest, and said unto them, <hi>The Gentiles exercise Lordship one over another, but it shall not be so amongst you</hi>; and though <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles who were in the Power of God, had that which did open into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and shut out that which did defile, yet this we are sure of, he sold no Pardons nor Indulgences for Gain and filthy Lucre, as many have done, whom you call <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successors, and Christ's Vicar, and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Bishop, and visible Head; but it is manifest how the <hi>Pope</hi> became visible Head, and Universal Bishop, not because of any Work or Labour in the Doctrine of Christ, or the Work of the Gospel, but by means of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor; for while the Christians were under Persecution and Suffering, there was no talk of visible Heads, or much of Universal Bishop, for then <hi>Rome</hi> had no more Priority then the rest; for the Churches at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at <hi>Caesaria,</hi> at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> for the first three hundred Years, they had as much Power in their several Churches, as <hi>Rome</hi> had, and often the Elders or Bishops of the afore-said Churches did reprove sharply the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; but at last above five hundred Years or upwards, <hi>Phocas</hi> to aspire to the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> he murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own Master <hi>Mauritius</hi> and his Children to attain unto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; so at that time <hi>Boniface</hi> the third was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Phocas</hi> somewhat fearing, and willing to have <hi>Boniface</hi> his Favour, condesce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God accepts not Prayers by number or tale, nor for multitude of Words, which are without understanding, and without the Spirit; this Christ counted as Evil, and reprehended the Pharisees, and said, <hi>It was like the vain repetitions of the Heathen, who thought to be heard for their much babling</hi>; and the Salutation which the Angel gave to <hi>Mary,</hi> is no prayer: And that which is called the Apostles <hi>Creed,</hi> is no prayer; and them that are unconverted unto God, may prattle and prate over the Words, in the unbelief, and never have any acceptance of God: And though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did pray seven times a day, it was according to the motion of God's Spirit in his own Heart, which shewed him his State and necessity; and what is this to imitators, when they pray not with the same Spirit, neither in the same words?

As for your Beads, which are neither <hi>Jewish</hi> nor <hi>Christian,</hi> but meer <hi>Heathenish,</hi> as to reckon the number or tale of that which you call your Prayers by; and though Kings, Popes, Cardinals and Bishops do the same, this is but a small proof as for Authority; Kings have drunk of the Whore's Cup, and Popes and Cardinals have usurped Power that Christ never gave, as to exercise Lord-ship, and be Law-givers unto others; for the Lord is the Saints Law-giver, and the Saints Life and Judge, and he will not give his Glory to another; for Kings have drunk of the Whore's Cup of Fornication, and Popes have usurped Authority, and Cardinals have exercised Lord-ship over mens Consciences, yea and over great Kingdoms and States too. And if they pray by Beads, as others do set Forms by number and Tale, they are as much Idiots as the rest are, who know not the Spirit to pray by. And so this is no Authority to prove your Practice Apostolical and holy; as for variety of Prayers and Worships, it delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the carnal mind indeed; but they that worship God in Spirit and Truth they Pray by the Spirit, and in it, as <hi>David</hi> and Christ prayed, whether seven times, five times or three times, and with understanding; and that which they prayed in, was not various, but one; and it's by that one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is not various, by which the Sons of God cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father; and the variety of your formed charms, Bablings upon your Beads, God hath no regard unto, but is a Smoke in his Nostrills all day. And they that have exercised themselves in these things, have not the Witness of God in their own consciences that they are accepted of God; and so I shall proceed to another Doctrine called Apostolical, and Holy; and that is about Meats, whether they may be lawfully eaten at all time.</p>

have the sole Power to tolerate the reading of Scriptures; for he is a Man of God who is born of the Spirit, which sanctifieth and leadeth into the clear Pathes of Equity and Righteousness, who walk not after the Flesh, neither fulfil the Lusts thereof; and such there are and have been, which have been unlearned in Natural Tongues; but this is the Way to keep your Church in Reputation, to believe as you believe, and every Man to put out his own Eyes, and live by anothers Sight, and hang his Faith upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Shoulders, this is not like Apostolick Doctrine; for the Apostle said, <hi>Let every one be perswaded in his own Mind</hi> (not by other Mens Minds) <hi>and he that believeth hath the Witness in himself,</hi> and hath it not to seek among the literal Rabbies, who darken <hi>Counsel</hi> through Words; and it is not for Want of Natural Learning that one understandeth the Scriptures this way, and another that way, but because they want the Understanding of that Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures, which Spirit universally is given to all Men and Women (a Measure of it) to lead into Truth, and through which the deep Things of God are revealed: And its not your Traditions, Inventions, Natural Learning, Schools and Colledges, Fryeries and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, in which the Spirit of God is only limited; but every one that seeks finds, whether learned or unlearned; for of a Truth God is no Respecter of Persons: and so the Mind of <hi>Christ</hi> is manifest unto them that believe, and the one Spirit, into which the Saints were baptized, is that which opens the Scriptures truly as they are, and discerneth the Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and fulfilleth it in the Hearts of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But then your Doctrine, Worship and Practice would be soon manifest not to be Apostolical, nor consonant and agreeing to the Practice of the true Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And now I come to the effectual Arguments and pregnant Wayes which the Author tells of, <hi>which will work upon the Sectaries, to make them return to the Catholick Church, which</hi> (he saith) <hi>they have groundlesly forsaken</hi>; and now I shall come to try his Arguments, and search the Force of them which he layeth down, as the most efficacious VVay to convince all Sectaries (as he is pleased to stile them) to come to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; but the Hope of this Man will be like a Spiders VVeb; for all whose Eyes God hath il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated in any Measure, will come to see the VVeakness of this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy and vain Deceit, which he hath laid down as a chief Instrument to convince all, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the true Church, and that Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is only concluded in her.</p>

That church which hath alwayes been so Visible and Universal since the Apostles dayes, as hath had its seat over Nations, Kindreds and Tongues, is not the true church of Christ, but the Harlot; but the church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been Universal over Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People, therefore the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Harlot, and not the true church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But I shall not traduce thee in thy vain Deceit, but return thy Arguments upon thy self, which thou chargest upon others.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To the first; If that church is not to be heard, neither her censures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, whose Authors and Teachers have been cozeners and Impostors, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not to be heard, nor her censures regarded, because the chief Authors have been Cozeners, Cheaters and Impostors, who have been out of the Power of God, and have taught for Doctrine the Traditions of men; as Purgatory, Prayer for the dead, only to cozen and cheat by, to fill the Bags and Coffers of the Popish Clergy; which Doctrine is contrary unto the Doctrine of Christ &amp; the Apostolick church, therefore the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not to be heard.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath the Marks of the true Church, and no other as Antiquity, holiness of Life, Miracles, and Universality</hi>; This is false; there were Churches before <hi>Rome,</hi> that had these Marks; and there have been since, and are now, more then the church of <hi>Rome: Antiquity</hi> some of them called <hi>Sectaries</hi> will allow you a Thousand Years to be called a Church, and yet prove you apostates both in Doctrine and Practice.

And as for Miracles which are wrought by the true Power and Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, there have been, and are more amongst them called <hi>Sectaries</hi> then in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> The blind have received their sight, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers have been cleansed, the Lame have been made to walk, and the deaf have heard, and the Dumb have spoken, the dead have been raised, and many that have bound by <hi>Satan</hi> fourty Years, are loosed, and there are thousands that are Witnesses of it, and can testifie the Truth thereof, even in this time, and in this Year, in <hi>Scotland, England, Ireland, Germany</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> 1662. So there is a true <hi>Church</hi> which hath the Marks of the true <hi>Church</hi> of Christ, more then the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> church is not the alone true <hi>Church.</hi>

And how you are in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Way, is known to many thousands that you do not walk in it at all, neither take up the Cross of Christ, which is to crucifie the Lusts, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and desires of the Flesh, but taketh up outward Crosses, and bear them on your Necks, or Pin them on your sleeves, or hang them about your Necks, and all because Christ was crucified on the Cross: And here you are honourers of <hi>Pilate</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> who crucified Christ upon the Cross as a Blasphemer, rather then honourers of Christ, and the strait and narrow Way you are ignorant of, and Christ's sufferings you are all strangers to: What! your Popes are as Emperors, your Cardinals as Law-givers, your Ecclesiastical Officers as Lords of great Possessions in the Earth, except some begging Fryars, which you have prest into a Voluntary humility, without necessity. And how do you love your Enemies? How many <hi>Indians</hi> have you destroyed and killed as Dogs? and how many that have professed the Name of Christ have you Burned &amp; destroyed, as though

they had been Wood, and only Fewel for the Fire. And how can you say your <hi>Pater-Noster,</hi> about which you make so much ado, and say, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our Trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us</hi>; if the Heathen have trespassed against you, if them you call Sectaries have trespassed against your church, how do you forgive them? and how do you fulfil the Law of Christ, and keep his counsel, seeing that you are out of his Doctrine; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with such Deceit and Hypocrisie, God hath found it out, and is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by his Saints, who rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the Flesh, nor in fleshly Traditions and Imaginations, but live in the Power of God, and walk in the Spirit; and therefore because you walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the command of God and Christ's Counsel, and are out of the <hi>narrow Way that leads to Life,</hi> your church is neither to be heard, minded, nor heeded.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Argument, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the true Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they keep their Sabbath of the Sunday by Tradition, and not upon the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, as the</hi> Jews <hi>did; and therefore the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is to be heard, because they have Tradition and solid Reason on their side.</hi> Thy Speech bewrayes thee, which bespeaks thee rather a Heathen then a Christian; for the Heathens had a day that they celebrated to an Idol made like the Sun, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sunday,</hi> and another day which they celebrated to an Idol called <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> called <hi>Saturday</hi>; and in this your Church is not to be heard, who is out of the form of sound Words: but the Seventh day was the <hi>Jews.</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which none that profess Christianity ought to keep, seeing that Christ put an End to the shadows: and the Saints Sabbath is a stranger to the church of <hi>Rome</hi>; he that hath overcome the World and the Devil only knows God's rest, and the true Sabbath, of which the <hi>Jews</hi> was a Figure; and the Sunday thou callst, it is no more a Sabbath reckoned by the Lord of Life then that which thou callst Saturday; for every day is kept Holy to the Lord by him that witnesses the work of Redemtion, and this is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apostolick Doctrine; and if because of example the Christians whom you are pleased to Stile <hi>Sectaries,</hi> do observe the first day of the Week in the Power of God, for his Worship, then they are as much, if not more to be heard then you, and have as much Solid reason on their side as you; and thou must not think to carry the Matter on with such fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Arguments as this, to advance <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi>; for this is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Age blessed be the Lord, wherein the Wisdom of God is revealed, and that which comprehendeth all shadows, Types, Dayes, Times, Years, Meats, Drinks, Washings, and other Figures, they are all seen over, and he is come &amp; manifest which is Head of the true church, (and not the Pope) who was, is, and is to come, Life it self, Truth it self, Power, Strength, and everlasting satisfaction to thousands, and ten thousands, who have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, (and to a numberless Number which are yet to be gathered into God's Sheep-fold, and into the narrow way of Christ) which will deny, and doth deny upon good Grounds, and infallible Testimony from the Eternal Spirit, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is either in whole, or in part, any part of the true Church of Christ.</p>

                     <hi>Whether any can clearly shew that any Teachers, Doctors or Ministers are sent of Almighty God to preach and reform the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick Church, and that they are not some who say, the Lord saith, when the Lord hath not spoken unto them; neither sent them</hi> Ezek. 13.2.</p>

                  <p>And so God hath manifested himself in this his Day of Power, and hath discovered the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be contrary in Doctrine and Practice to the true Spouse of Christ, and hath stirred up and moved many by his Power and Spirit to preach the everlasting Gospel, and to declare also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Defection of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her apostatizing from the Faith, and they are not of those whom the Prophets spoke of, which ran, and the Lord sent them not; for them were the false Prophets in <hi>Israel,</hi> and they were manifest by their Fruits, of which there are great Store in <hi>Rome,</hi> who are manifest by their Fruits, and they are such as are in <hi>Cain</hi>'s Way, who would kill, and such as are Seekers of Gain from their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and such as take the <hi>Jews</hi> Tythes; and these the Lord n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and if they beat them upon the one cheek, turn the other; but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is out of this Faith and Doctrine, and hath renounced this Faith of Christ, and hath denyed the Power of God, and placed it into a Man, to wit, the Pope, that Infallibility is in him; And this is in the Apostacy.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. This is an Error in the Faith of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who teach and are taught, That there is a place called <hi>Purgatory,</hi> in which Men are cleansed from some light faults, or venial Sins; and this is contrary to the Faith of the true christian churches, and is no less then Heresie; for the true church, or churches of Christ, taught, <hi>That the Blood of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone cleanseth from all Sin,</hi> and that <hi>he is</hi> (to wit, Christ) <hi>the Propitiation for Sin, and the everlasting Sacrifice and Offering</hi>; but you have other Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, as the Sacrifice of the Mass, which you call an unbloody Sacrifice, which is contrary to the Faith of the christian church in Christ's and the Apostles dayes, and therefore is Heresie.</p>
                  <p>Again, praying for the Dead, and praying to Angels, and Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, is absolute Heresie, and contrary to the Faith and Doctrine of the true church of Christ.</p>

<pb n="533" facs="tcp:40634:283"/>
they were unanswerable, I return this short Answer, which if I hear any more from the Author may be amplified.</p>
                  <p>For Instance, In the Year 287. there was a Council of Bishops called at <hi>Sinuessa,</hi> where the Pope was condemned (which your Church hath taught could not err) for sacrificing to Idols.</p>
                  <p>A Council held at <hi>Cartage</hi> decreed, that Clergy-men should not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with temporal Affairs.</p>
                  <p>At a Council held at <hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> a Decree was made, that Priests should not marry; and these were called Christians, and some of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Visible Universal Church.</p>
                  <p>And this was against reproved and condemned in the first Council held at <hi>Tolledo</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> they decreed that Priests should marry: and now <hi>Rome</hi> look to thy Unity.</p>
                  <p>Again, at a Council held at <hi>Caesar August<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> accursed all them that eat not the Sacrament in the Church; but the Church of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me</hi> hath decreed, that it may be kept, and ready to carry abroad to sick People, and upon other Occasions, out of the Church.</p>
                  <p>At a general Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi> decreed, that <hi>Mary</hi> shall be called the Mother of God, as though God were generated by natural Generation, which is Blasphemy.</p>
                  <p>The Council of <hi>Armenium</hi> decreed for the <hi>Armenians,</hi> that Christ was not God.</p>
                  <p>The Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> (which was one of the four Councils that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> compared to the four Gospels, and that their Decrees were sure and certain as the Scripture) yet, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> did not stick to condemn it, and of them as unadvised, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole Council.</p>
                  <p>So Councils have erred, as is evident, and that which some have decreed for apostolick Doctrine since the Apostles Dayes, other Councils have condemned as Heresie, though called <hi>Christians,</hi> as well as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet they have condemned that which some Councils did allow.</p>
                  <p>So the Pope hath erred, the Councils have erred, as is manifest in what I have said, that I shall not trouble my Reader in large things, which I could and might do upon another Occasion, if I hear any more from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>By what Authority she (viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome) is reproved.</hi> In short, <hi>Leo</hi> the fourth, the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> made void the Acts of <hi>Adrian,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome: Stephanus</hi> made void and abrogated the Decrees of <hi>Formosus</hi> and <hi>Sabian,</hi> Christ's Vicars so called, commanded that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> (another Vicar, so called) his Writings and Decrees should be burned: And all these before-mentioned did say, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds it as such, that they were <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successors: So here one Father or Head of the Church, as they reckon the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath confounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nicene</hi> Council determined, that Images were not only to be placed in the Churches, but also worshipped; and the then Pope said, that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were Lay-mens Calendrs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lateran</hi> Council under <hi>Julius,</hi> did repeal the Decrees of the <hi>Pissan council:</hi> The <hi>Basil-council</hi> decreed, that a <hi>council</hi> was above the Pope; but
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:40634:284"/>
the <hi>Lateran-council</hi> decreed, that the Pope was above the <hi>council,</hi> that he that should think otherwise, should be counted an Heretick; yet the <hi>Basil-council</hi> aforesaid decreed, that they that judged that a <hi>council</hi> was not above the Pope, were Hereticks: and yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> layes claim to Visibility and Universality over all the World, and yet one as distinct from another, as black is to white, and is as unsuitable as Snow is in Summer, or Rain in Harvest.

                  <p>And so much of General Councils, and of the confusion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; a few Words more of Synods, and I have done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bernardus</hi> saith, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was polluted with many Superstitions, that the Bishops were Biters of the Sheep, rather then true Shepherds; sometimes</hi> (saith he) <hi>I have admired that there should be a Traytor among the twelve Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; but now I much more wonder, that among so great a Company of Bishops, and Prelates, one upright Disciple cannot be found,</hi> Apop. Chr. Lib. 13. p. 260.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregorius Theologus,</hi> who lived about three hundred Years after Christ, did determine never to come more at Councils or Synods, <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>there comes more Evil then Good out of them, for the Contention and Ambitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Bishops is above Measure,</hi> said he, anno 300.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>D. Paraeus</hi> said, <hi>Often hath the Truth suffered Wrong in Synods, because all that were assembled agreed in one Error, so that Truth came to be passed by with Silence,</hi> Iren. pag. 57.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Gregorius Nazianzenus</hi> used to say, <hi>That he had never seen any good End of any Council or Synod,</hi> Vide Inst. clav. 4. lib. 9. cap. 11.</p>
                  <p>And some Synods have said, <hi>Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So the Author saith, <hi>Whose Company did the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>leave? and from whom did she go forth? and where was the Church that she did forsake, that she should be counted Heretical and Schismatical</hi>?</p>
                  <p>I say she left the Company and Society of the primitive Church in Christ's and the Apostles Dayes, and she went forth from the rest of the Churches that were planted, as I instanced; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year 193<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> did excommunicate all the Eastern Churches; <hi>And where was the true Church that she did forsake?</hi> saith the Author; not only one, I say, but many, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Doctrine that the Apostles had laid down and preached at <hi>Antioch,</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the rest of the Churches of <hi>Asi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is proved to be an Apostate, in the Apostacy, in Heresie, in Schism; so that there is an absolute Defection from the Life and Power of God, which was manifested in the Apostles dayes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Church.</p>
                  <p>What I have said, as to the Doctrines and Grounds which have been laid down by the Author, I shall refer it and the Answer unto God's Witness in every Man's Conscience; and if I hear any more of the Author, his great Boasts or ambitious Challenges, which may reach to all that do dissent from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to be Hereticks, I shall engage in the Strength
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:40634:284"/>
of the Lord to vindicate the Truth, however opposed, and shall further (if God permit) be ready to give a more large and full answer unto the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Practices, and Worship of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and prove them to be contrary to the Scriptures, and the Apostolick Doctrine, and the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints.</p>
                  <p>So in what I have said, I hope may convince the Author of his vain As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions, and them that are enclined towards <hi>Babylon,</hi> it may put a Stop to that which would too readily close with every thing which goes under the Name of Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>But in what I have said upon the whole Matter, I hope will be sufficient unto all who read with a single Eye, without Prejudice; and unto such I say, the Lord give them an Understanding, that they see and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Way which leadeth to Life and Felicity, from that which leadeth to the Chambers of Death, and the Pathes that take hold on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>

Dear Friends, hear my Brotherly Admonition and Exhortation; for the Lord moved in my Heart to write unto you; and in the Bowels of his kind and tender Love, and Motion of his heavenly Spirit, to stir up your pure Minds and Consciences unto Stedfastness in the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ; and so much the more that you all be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, seeing the times be perilous; for now the Adversary goes about roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ravening on the right Hand and on the left, to destroy and devour that which God hath brought forth in you, that so he might regain you too under his Power and Government, and that ye might revolt from the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, that stands in Power and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is come, and hath been of a Truth manifest in great Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is an Hour the Power of Darkness is let loose, to try the Faith and them that dwell upon the Earth; and he is let loose for a Season, blessed are they that hide themselves under the Shadow of the Almighty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Wings of Christ Jesus, who is given for a Redeemer, a Saviour and a Preserver of Men, that the wicked One touch them not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now the Devil rages, because he knows his Kingdom is but short, and but for a small time is like to stand in many, because a stronger then he that rules in the World is come, and hath began to dispossess the strong Man, and bind him, and cast him out, and now he rages and stirs up all the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within and without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all his Instruments to joyn with him, to make War for him, that he might not rule who is the Heir of all things, and

given for a Leader, and to be the Head of the Body, his Church, in which alone he hath Right to rule, because the Lord of the whole Earth, yea, of Heaven and Earth, hath put all Power into his Hands, to bind and to lose, to bring out of Captivity, and to lead Captivity Captive, that Life and Immortality might again inhabit in the Sons of Men, that Truth and Righteousness might sway, that Mercy and Love might sit on the Throne, that his Salvation might take hold on the Ends of the Earth, and his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er made known from Sea to Sea, that all that wait for him, and love his Appearance now when he is made manifest, might rejoyce in his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Life, and may be made glad as <hi>Ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh dear Friends, look above all visible things, and stand out of them all, and loose from them, that the Enemy do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare you; what, is not the Earth the Lord's and the Fulness thereof? and hath not he given the utmost Part of the Earth for a Possession to his Son?

Was not <hi>John</hi> the beloved and faithful Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Christ banished into <hi>Patmos</hi> for the Testimony that he held? Was not <hi>Shadrach, Mesach</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> Children of the Captivity, cast into the Furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> too among the Lyons, for the Testimony they held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the common Worship of Nations, commanded by a Law? Did Christ endure the Death of the Cross, and the Contradiction of Sinners, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the most? Did not the believing <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who were banished, wander in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins, in Holes, Dens and Caves of the Earth, for the Hope they held, and the Country they looked for? Did not <hi>Moses</hi> through Faith forsake <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, and became a Companion of poor Brick-makers in Captivity: A Cloud of Witnesses might be brought, even of them who dyed in the Faith, and yet were not made Partakers of the Promises, who many of them saw not what you have seen, nor heard those things that you have heard, nor enjoyed that which God hath made many Partakers of; and have we not a great Cloud of Witnesses in this our own Age, some who have not loved their Lives unto the Death for the Testimony they received, believed, and held fast unto the End unto Death? have not many dy'd in Prison with hard Usage? have not some been hang'd, and dyed a shameful Death, and finished their Course with Joy and Peace? have not many endured great, hard and long Imprisonment for Years? and are they yet weary? nay, have not many suffered great Spoil of their Goods? and have not they a Reward seven-fold into their Bosom: Oh let the Consideration of these things dwell upon your Hearts, and provoke you unto Suffering and Long-Suffering with Joyfulness, that in the midst of all Tribulations, as it abounds, you may feel (according to the Promise of God) your Joy much more abound, to carry you above it; indeed, now is the time come, and he that will manifest himself to be on the Lord's Side must

                  <p>The Divines about this time have had several determinations and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines about this Point, some have held it, that the tenth considered <hi>quoad quotam Partem,</hi> or as it is determined, part devoted from that number is only due by <hi>Law Positive and Ecclesiastical,</hi> but as it is for the sustentation of the Clergy, it is due <hi>by the divine moral Law as they call it,</hi> and so they interpret it from the <hi>Levitical Commandment</hi> of Tythes, but others say it

                  <p>The second Opinion among the Divines is of those that held tythes to be <hi>meer Alms,</hi> and not to be payed to the Ministers of the Gospel by any Parochial right, as a necessary duty to the Evangelical Priest-hood, but that they might be detained and disposed of at the owners will, especially if the Pastor did not well perform his Office; of this were both some of the Religious Orders in their Preaching, and also others opposite enough to them in Doctrine, <hi>The Dominicans and Franciscans,</hi> who began about the year 1210. and had in their Monasteries great store of School-mens Writings, made it a gainful Doctrine to themselves, though there was a Truth in it, they determined that it was not due by <hi>divine right,</hi> but only due as <hi>Alms,</hi> or due of Charity, not of Justice or Judicial Law but to be arbitrarily disposed of accordingly, to such as took any spiritual labour, and with them agree the <hi>Mendicants.</hi>

                  <p>Great and large are the Testimonies that might be given, both out of Ancient and Modern writers, who were the clearest in their Judgments against tythes, how that they were no Gospel-maintenance, neither of Divine right doth belong to any Minister under the Gospel, who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Christ come in the Flesh. But what I have already said in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular might be sufficient, seeing so large things to this have been declared by others Hands; But I am the more willing to instance divers Authors, who by our Protestants are owned as Orthodox, that they may be thereby throughly convinced that this is no new Doctrine, for which we suffer the Spoiling of our Goods, and our persons Imprisoned; but that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness of the Clergy and Tythes have been testified against by many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and constant men in Ages past, who died in the Faith, who though they be dead, yet their Testimony still lives, and will stand for Ages.

                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> having by these means brought in Tythes, and the Priests made a pretended title, by prescription they set up Courts, called <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Courts,</hi> which remain to this day (amongst them that say they are reformed) to recover their tythes by, and the Priests came to be the <hi>Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of the Court, so people might easily understand what might be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from them; yet them that did not pay, no greater punishment could they inflict upon them but Excommunication: Yet notwithstanding this general Decree, the <hi>Pope</hi> did dispense, and did give exemption to divers Orders of his Clergy (so called) to free them from payment, as the <hi>Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitallers, Templers,</hi> and generally to all Lands which belonged to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Persons and Houses, which is the reason that divers at this day, who have any Land which sometimes belong'd to the <hi>Monasteries</hi> now dissolv'd, say, they are tythe-free.</p>
                  <p>Now when the <hi>Pope,</hi> by colour of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Laws (by which tythes were given to the Levitical Priesthood) had gained an Universal payment of tythes to all his Clergy; he in further imitation of that earthly taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, sets up a new building after the former Pattern; and therefore to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he claims first-Fruits and tenths, as a Successour of the <hi>Jewish</hi> high-Priest, Sins also he under takes to Pardon, <hi>Cardinals</hi> are appointed as Leaders of the Families, <hi>Miters</hi> are ordained for the Head, as <hi>Aaron</hi> had, <hi>Synagogues</hi> they Built, now falsely call'd <hi>Churches,</hi> with <hi>Altars</hi> like the <hi>Jews,</hi> with <hi>Organs</hi> and Instruments of <hi>Musick,</hi> with <hi>Singers</hi> and <hi>Porters,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>That Tythes were never till of late pretended a civil Right is plain; for as they were imposed by the Pope, so they are tryable in his Courts; &amp; those very Statutes which do plead, made by late Parliament, appoint them to be tryed in <hi>Ecclesiastical Courts:</hi> And the Act of 42. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.

                  <p>This was the old Device of the <hi>Pope</hi>; first to preach that <hi>Tythes</hi> were due, and then to limit them to Monasteries and Parishes; when forty Years were past, to claim that a Debt, which before was payed as Charity, or at the most as the free Offering of the Owner: And thus the <hi>Pope</hi> got first Fruits, and Tenths, and <hi>Peter</hi> pence, and great Sums of Money out of this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, and he might as well have pleaded his Prescription, as any of his Branches can do now; is any so blind as not to see what poor Shifts are now made to uphold so great an Oppression, that hath no better Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port then this, <hi>that it hath been so long payed?</hi>

persons as will do it effectually to the Priests mind, they take away some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 6. or 7. yea oftentimes ten Fold dammage, what I say in this particular I can prove by many Witnesses in this Nation within this ten Years; and though in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Courts</hi> the ordinary might not examine a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Oath concerning his own Tythes; but now such as make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of Swearing, which Christ forbids, or that they cannot themselves tell what Tythe they had, are cast into Prison for contempt, and there may lye as long as they live, and many have dyed in Prison upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. O what Reformation is this? what! Compel a man himself to set out the Tythe of his own Goods to maintain a Hireling Priest, it may be a time-server, a prophane one, or a turn Coat, and so to make a man Sin against his own Conscience, or else take ten Fold as much, and not only so, but force him to Swear, or commit him to Prison, there to lye without Hope of any relief: O Priests! is not this the Wag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O did but the <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Magistrates</hi> know and consider what Havock is made through the Nation, what driving of Goods, Oxen out of the Plow, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses out of their Teames, the Cows from poor &amp; indigent Children, &amp; what carrying of Pots, and Pans, and Kettles, and fetching away the Cloathes off poor Peoples Beds, methinks it should make the Nation ashamed of such cruel Practices; or else of such Priests and Tythes as are the cause of all this: manifold instances I might give about all these things up and down this Nation, but that I would not trouble the Reader too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have been publickly made known before by other Hands and Pens.</p>
                  <p>There are some other that have claimed Tythes and a propriety in them, as that they are right by a divine right, and for it plead <hi>the Law of Moses</hi>; but as to that I shall not say much more, nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Others have pleaded the Decrees, Canons, and Constitutions of <hi>Popes</hi> and General Councils, Bishops and Convocations, and these have said, that Tythes are due by an Ecclesiastical Right, and by that right generally under the Papal power they claimed them, and others paid them: And this continued in <hi>England</hi> till the Popes Supremacy was cast off by <hi>Henr.</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> and then he received first Fruits and Tenths. But of this plea many are ashamed, or few will own, as judging the Ground too weak to claim it by, an Ecclesiastical right.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, The main and great plea of the Ministry of this last Age is, That Tythes are not due by the Law of God, because it was limited only to the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to the <hi>Levites,</hi> only they say, the equity of the Law is still in force, which obligeth all to give a competent Maintenance for the Ministry; and to maintain this, they bring in all the Scriptures of the New Testament which seem to encline that way; and because they know of no other way for Maintenance, but by tythes, as they are supposed now to be established, many have ignorantly gone about to make inferences and Conclusions from them, as to prove their assertions. But to all which I return this answer.</p>

                  <p>It is answered, that Christ spake this to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> in the time when the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood was not ended, and they were bound by the Law, whilest it was of Force, to observe this Ordinance amongst the rest which were in the first Covenant, which was faulty, which continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the time of Reformation, <hi>viz.</hi> till Christ was offered up, and said, <hi>It is finished,</hi> and was the End of the Law for Righteousness unto all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; but it is manifest that the <hi>Jews</hi> then, unto whom Christ spoke, were not Believers, but were such as withstood the Son of God, and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, who was the Sum and Substance of all the Types and Shadows of that Covenant; and so this is great Ignorance to conclude, that because these Scriptures are written in the New Testament, so called, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Tything is a Gospel-Ordinance; for it is manifest that these Scriptures had Relation to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were under the Law, and not under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; and so their Plea, as to this, is made void: But though Divine Right hath been long pleaded, and is yet by some, but few are now left that will only stand to it; for if Tythes be absolutely due<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as by the Law of God, no Custom, Prescription, Priviledge, Exemption, Dispensation, Law or Constitutions of man or men can acquit any from the utmost Penny of the tenth Part; but scarce the tenth Person in <hi>England</hi> payes Tythes in kind, and many plead that they are Tythe-free, and pay none at all; but if any will stand to this, and plead Divine Right, then they are to be payed and received for the End and Use for the which they were commanded, for the <hi>Levites, Strangers, Poor,</hi> the <hi>Fatherless</hi> and <hi>Widdow,</hi> and then where is the Impropriator's Share?

                  <p>Other Scriptures they seem to plead for the receiving of their Tythes, as Rom. 13.7. <hi>Render therefore to all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due:</hi> And Mat. 22.21. <hi>Give unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things which are</hi> Caesar<hi>'s, and unto God the things which are God's.</hi>

                  <p>Other Scriptures are brought to plead for Tythes, or at least some Part of them, and forced Maintenance, as 1 Cor. 9.9. <hi>Thou shalt not muzzel the Mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>Who plants a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and eats not of the Fruit thereof? and who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk of the Flock</hi>?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Unto all which I answer, that they which do believe, and have received spiritual things indeed, that they are enjoyned by the Doctrine of Christ and of his Apostles, and not only so, but even from natural things all that believe are largely taught their Duty therein, to distribute and communicate freely unto them who labour in Word and Doctrine, and are sent out in the Work of the Lord, that they be comfortably provided for by them that are Partakers of heavenly and spiritual things from the Lord, as to go in the Warfare of the Lord, and to plant in the Vineyard of the Lord; yea, and it is agreed that the Ministers of Christ did not do these things at their own Charge; but if they might not be muzled that tread out the Corn, yet they may be muzled that tread out no Corn, but run ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping through the Lord's Fields, and spoil the Corn, these ought to be muzled.</p>
                  <p>Again, they that watch over a Flock, though they may eat of the Milk of the Flock, yet they that kill them that are fed, and feed themselves with the Fat, and cloath themselves with the Wool, and worry the Lambs, they ought not to eat of the Milk of the Lord's Flock; and of such as they reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Unbelievers and Hereticks, and they look upon belong to another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and not to the Fold of Christ, they ought n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, other Scriptures they bring, in which there is as little Ground or Footing as in the former, but that they are necessitated to get a Shelter and a seeming Cover for their Practice, to blind People withal, that they may get their Money; and so they bring 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10, 13, 14. <hi>For it's writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or saith he, It's altogether for our sakes, no doubt, this is written, that he that ploweth should plow in Hope, and he that thresheth in Hope, should be made Partaker of his Hope.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>And do you not know, that they who minister

                  <p>I take my self little concerned, or that People with whom I am joyned in the Fellowship of the Gospel of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> who are Nonconformists to the World, and ever resolve to be, (according to the Apostles Doctrine) and to all Hypocrites and Time-servers, and them that serve not our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ, but their own Bellies,</hi> of which this Generation is full, who will Transgress for a morsel of Bread, and conform to any thing, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing for the smiles of the World, ease and Liberty in the Flesh, but the Followers of Christ have not so learned Christ, for whoso will Reign with him, must suffer with him.</p>

and they neither add to, nor diminish from his Goodness and Vertue, but seeing it is a Quarrel not only against us that are alive, but against the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sufferers, who laid down their Lives in Flames of Fire, and the very Foundation of God, which is the most sure thing is struck at, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God turned out of doors, in regard of its Office, of certainty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, and the Scriptures of Truth laid aside as an insufficient thing, except the Interpretations of Men be added to it for its Authority, and the Constitutions of fallible and Erring Men set up for Rules, and Men, as Men, set up as Law-givers and Judges over mens Consciences, and Lords over Faith, and to be the most certain thing for any Christian Man to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to believe, as the old phrase is, as the Church believes, to pin ones Faith upon others Sleeves, and to hang ones Hope of anothers Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to put ones Eye out that God hath given them to see with, and then see by anothers, may be led into any Hole or Ditch, and this to be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such confidence, as the only infalliable Guide, to which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are to submit, would make a <hi>Man</hi> half Dumb to speak and stammer forth some thing as a Testimony against such palpable Error, and manifest Darkness, put off with such confidence, and Usher'd in among Christians in such an Age as this, when Light and Life is broken forth as a Morning without Cloudes in <hi>Goshen,</hi> where <hi>Israel</hi> the true Seed inhabits, I could not but say something in Vindication of that certain, sure, everlasting Truth which the Devil is out of, by which the Saints are made free indeed in their inward man from Sin, and Non-conformists to the World, its Error, ways and Worship, and also to shew the mistakes of the Author, and how easily he hath been drawn aside to lean upon a broken Reed, all his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which are of any weight or moment shall be considered and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Righteous Ballance of equity, and answered in their due place: for the Confirmation of them that do believe, and for removing the stumbling Blocks out of the way of them that doubt to Stagger, lest they fall in such dark Pits as these, (<hi>viz.</hi>) as to deny the Spirit of God to be a sufficient Guide, and take away its infallibility, and place it in Men that have Erred, do err, and may Err; and call them the only sure infallible guide for all Christian men to follow.</p>

                  <p>First, Whether that any can be certain that the <hi>Christians</hi> in General are more true then the <hi>Turkes, Jews,</hi> or any other, and whether any can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly assured of this, that it is possible for one to mistake in this; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the answer amounting to no more then this, you conceive you are in the right, you hope and believe you are not mistaken; but it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you may be mistaken in this, for every <hi>Man</hi> is a Lyar, and every <hi>Man</hi> and all Men and every Church is fallible and subject to Error; and with these and the like Words <hi>R.E.</hi> was extreamly troubled as he saith, and knew not how to answer without shuffing.</p>

                  <p>But an old Plea comes to my mind, which some of the Members of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have alledged to me in the dayes of my Youth, when I was conversant with them, and among them, in a Friendly, Neighbourly, and sober discourse, of things of this Nature before mentioned; it was said unto me, <hi>The</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick Church is that Church whereby Christianity hath been conveyed to all Nations, and the great Oracles thereof delivered unto us, and the Scriptures also came from us, by which you know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, and the Knowledge thereof came unto all, and all her Children ought to be subject unto her, as the true Mother that brought them all forth; and if any went astray either into Heresie, or Schism, which might not only hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but also others, ought not the Mother in Natural love to her Children to correct them? and ought not they to bear her correction, and submit unto it? and hath not she Power to correct her Children when they go astray?</hi> unto which is Answered, Christianity, that which is truly such, and them whom God will own to be Christians were dispersed through the Nations by the Power of God; and we say, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath begotten Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into that Mould and Frame into which they are now cast, more by force and awe then any sound Doctrine; and as for the Scriptures coming from her, that we deny; We know they came from the Apostles, and from the Primitive Christians, according to the will of God, and have been preserved to this day, though through many polluted hands they have come; and we know how much your Rage was kindled that ever it should be Translated into the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, and many felt the Effect of it to the loss of their Lives, as I hope many in <hi>England</hi> do well consider: But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a true Mother hath many Children, and suppose some do Swarve and go astray from her precepts, and under pretence of correcting of them, she shut them up in Goals, and nasty Holes, and afflict them with sundry kind of Torments, and at last of all kill them and destroy them, what Judgment will be given by reasonable Men of such a Mother, but this, <hi>that she is become unnatural and Cruel, and Hard hearted, and degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Nature of a loving and tender Mother, and deserves not to have or ever to have had any</hi> Children; and such a kind of Mother hath you Church been, to all that have dissented from her; that I may say of her, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> said, especially in these l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> as they say, and had given unto him the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever he bound on Earth was bound in Heaven, and whatsoever he loosed in Earth was loosed in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and because Christ said, (giving an Answer to <hi>Peters</hi>'s Faith) <hi>upon this Rock I will build my Church</hi>; therefore all the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Popes</hi> as heirs apparent suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, in laying claim to headship, and do none of his Office, nor none of his Work, and this foolish foppery and private interpretation hath been put off at a very great rate, for Catholick Doctrine, which brings to my mind a pleasant Story, I have some time read of a certain poor Man meeting a certain Bishop at a certain time, in great Pomp and Glory, which the poor Man beholding, took up a Laughter, and being enquired of by the Bishop wherefore be laughed; said he, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>should be such a Fool as to live such a poor miserable Life as he did, and Persecuted in the World, and to leave his Successors so Rich, to inherit such Pomp and Glory:</hi> With that the Bishop replyed and said, <hi>Thou fool, I am not in this Glory as I am Bishop of such a place, but as I am Duke of such a place:</hi> at that the man smiled again, and said, <hi>When the Duke was in Hell for his Pride, where then would the Bishop be.</hi> But to let this pass, I am sure them that lay claim to be <hi>Peters</hi> Successors as to <hi>Patrimony and Riches</hi> (which he was never endowed with, for sometime he said, <hi>Silver or Gold have I none</hi>) but do little of his Work in Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Souls, or feeding of the Flock of Christ, and do lay claim unto his Priviledge and Power, but will not come near him in <hi>doctrine, labour and Suffering</hi> for his Members; and therefore I say to thee in thy own Words, lay aside thy Folly, with the consequences of it, as destructive to the Church of God, to hang all their Faith upon such uncertainties, but even to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man societies, which I have mentioned, and might instance more, but that I would not be too tedious to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Yes, some have some other Testimony, by which Spirits are try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and may be tryed to be of God, otherwise then by Force, carnal Sword, a strong Party or Success, that's thy own and not ours; we have the holy Unction which is poured forth, whereby the Saints knew all things, <hi>and tryed the Spirits, whether they were of God or no, and he that confesseth not that Christ is come in the Flesh is Anti-christ</hi>; and he that confesseth that Christ is come in the Flesh, only in Word, and because others have said so, and doth not witness Sin condemned in the Flesh, and turned from, and to have Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over it, the same is a false Witness, and is an Anti christ also; and also we have other Things to try Spirits by, we know a proud, angry, hasty, perverse Spirit is not the Spirit of God, a persecuting lording Spirit is not the Spirit of God; and again, they that teach a contrary Doctrine to the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, they have the Spirit of Error; again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they whose Practice and Conversation is not suitable to the Practice and Conversations of Christ and the Apostles and primitive Christians, that they are in the Spirit of Error; again, they that would force a Faith by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny human Constitution or Law, which is repugnant to the Law of God, or by Force of the Sword, or any carnal Weapons, they have the Spirit of Error; for the Weapons of the Lamb and his Followers are not <hi>carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, but spiritual, and yet mighty through God to the beating down of the strong Holds of Wickedness,</hi> and to prevail over the Powers of Darkness; again, the Testimony of God in every Man's Conscience, which is an unerring
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:40634:334"/>
Testimony, this savours the things of God, and by this things that be not of God are discerned, and this will put a perfect Difference between the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth and the Spirit of Error; but what can be said to a man in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that hath closed his Eyes?</p>
                  <p>The next thing which <hi>R. E.</hi> saith he considered, was, <hi>That the Natural Reason of every Man could not possibly be the Rule and Judge that I sought for; for</hi> (saith he) <hi>if Reason were to be Rule and Judge, then it would follow, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Scripture, that it's not impossible to please God without Faith, and it would likewise follow, that every Religion would be Truth, consequently, Contradictions would be true; consequently, there would be many Religions, and no Faith at all, for Reason excludes Faith,</hi> as in the 26th Page of his Book.</p>
                  <p>Thy Tongue is thy own, and thou art at Liberty, and goest whether thou wilt, and speakest what seems Good in thy own Eyes, and hast never yet known another to gird thee, and lead thee whither thou would'st not; I stand not to vindicate every Man's Judgment, neither to prove other Mens Conceptions; but seeing thou hast taken in Hand to lay all Mountains waste before thee that stand in thy Wayes, thou hast raised up some in thy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course for others to stumble at, and hast spoken many false things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinguishing and putting a Difference between Light and Darkness, between Natural Reason and Spiritual Reason, I could not chuse but say somewhat.</p>
                  <p>Although it is no Part of my Belief, that the Natural Reason of any Man or every Man is able to be Rule, Judge and Guide to any Man in the things of God, yet Faith is not in Opposition unto pure Reason, neither is pure and spiritual Reason in Opposition to true Faith, but in Harmony with it, and one with another, as they are the Gifts of God; but the Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of all the fallen Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> is corrupted, and is too short, and too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, too cross and too perverse to be Rule and Judge in the things of God; for the Natural Man by all his Endowments in the Transgression perceives not the things of God, for they are spiritually discerned; and the things of God that are spiritual and eternal, are above the Reach of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and yet thy Consequence is false, for Faith doth not exclude pure Reason, and Faith doth not make blind the Understanding, but enlightens it; and though it is impossible to please God without Faith, yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that that Faith should be without Reason; the Apostle desired to be delivered from unreasonable men, that had not Faith; so it is manifest, they that have Faith have Reason, and they that have no Faith are unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable; and where thou hast borrowed this Rule I know not, <hi>That a man must believe that he doth not understand,</hi> seeing the Apostle saith to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> even of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had not the Law nor the Scripture, that <hi>that which may be known of God was manifest in them</hi>: for by that it is manifest they understood the Mind of God, and knew him; for <hi>Paul</hi> saith further, <hi>When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, but were unthankful, &amp;c.</hi> and again, <hi>He that believes must know that God is,</hi> for none can believe in that which is not; for to perswade any to believe in Uncertainties, which are not manifest in the Understanding, doth rather beget Unbelief and Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then true Faith; but thy Paths are so full of Darkness I shall not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, and thy Consequences are false; for pure Reason teacheth not Contradictions, neither doth teach that there is no Faith at all, neither is
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:40634:334"/>
Faith excluded by pure Reason, as thou ignorantly say'st in the 26th Page; and is it not Reason that I should believe in him, whom I know is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Governour of all the World; and pure Religion is so far from exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Faith, that they that have true Faith have Reason, and stand not in Opposition to Faith; but this I conclude, that the Reason of fallen men is corrupted, and is an uncertain thing to rely upon, and so not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge in Matters of so high Concernment, as touching everlasting Salvation.</p>
                  <p>The third thing which thou treatest upon, is against them who have pleaded, that the sole Scriptures are sufficient of themselves to teach true Faith from time to time, to direct, rule and govern us, and to be Rule and Judge, and to supply the Place of Christ and the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>As I said, it is not my Intention to vindicate other mens Quarrels, which is no Part of my Faith; notwithstanding I should be sorry but that every thing had its true Weight and Measure, and shall not in the least detract from the Price, Value and true Worth of the Words of Truth, to wit, the Scriptures of Truth, which were spoken forth by the Spirit of Truth and by the holy Ghost, as it gave Utterance; but as men erring in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, run sometimes to the right Hand, and sometimes to the left Hand, and walk not in a straight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Path; some men are setting them up above that which they were intended for, and placing them in the Stead of God, Christ and the Spirit; and others are too much debasing them and dis-esteeming them, as that they would set up the Judgment of Variable and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable Men, who hold and teach Things in Contradiction to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and repugnant to the Mind of the Spirit in them that spoke them forth.</p>
                  <p>But first of all, I say not against thee in this thing, that the sole or whole Scriptures are not sufficient of themselves to teach true Faith, and give the Knowledge of God without the Spirit; for many have got the Words, and yet have not received the Spirit, nor the Power which the Scriptures declare of, such wrangle and contend with the Words, and oppose the Life and the Power; the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Scriptures, and knew by them where Christ should be born, and knew by them what his Works should be when he was manifest, and yet rejected him, unto whom all the Prophets bore witness, from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and from him to <hi>John</hi>; and they were never intended by God, as to be set up as Judge &amp; Guide, to wit, the Words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Power and Spirit of God; yet notwithstanding, though I cannot set them up in the Place of God, Christ and the holy Spirit, nor contend ignorantly, as some have done, that they are the Author of True Faith, and that they are the Eternal Word of God, which the World was made by, that they are the Light and the VVay, the Truth and the Life, and that they are the Decider of all Controversies, and sole, and absolute, and only Judge of all Matters of Faith, and of all Matters that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver have been, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall be in Controversie to the End of the VVorld, without the Spirit of God; neither am I of that ignorant Mind, as some are, that the Letter and the Spirit are inseparable, as that whosoever hath the Scripture, must needs have the Spirit, or whosoever hath the Scripture, must needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible without the Spirit; all that are of the aforesaid Judgment are but
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:40634:335"/>
VVranglers for the most Part about VVords, and Contenders against the Power of God and Godliness, and bring the VVords to oppose the Life, and them that have the Spirit, and walk in it; for a natural man may read the Scriptures, and yet not perceive the things of God, neither perceive the Mind of the Spirit, but wrest to their own Destruction, as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, because they are unlearned and untaught (by the Spirit's Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) though otherwise learned enough in Languages, Tongues and Speeches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Yet I cannot detract from them, neither undervalue them, or dis-esteem them as uncertain, or of no Use, or of little Use; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever themselves declare themselves to be, that I own them to be, to wit, the <hi>Words of God, the Words of Christ, the Words of the holy Prophets, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, and Apostles,</hi> who were endued with the holy Ghost, and spake forth the Scripture as they were moved thereby, in several Ages, of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, and unto several States and Conditions, as they were led there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the holy Spirit; and they are a certain Declaration of things that were done, and believed, and practised by the <hi>Jews</hi> under the first Covenant, and by the Apostles and primitive Christians in the New Covenant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain many <hi>precious and holy Precepts and Commands, Doctrines, Examples, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, Admonitions, Reproofs and Instructions,</hi> and are as lively Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and holy Patterns for all the Saints in Light to follow, by which we are given to understand what Faith, what Hope, what Patience, what Love, what Mercy, what Long-Sufferings, what Consolation, what Virtue and what Inheritance the Saints in Light were made Partakers of, through Faith in Christ Jesus; likewise, what Doctrines were held forth, and what Practice they used in the primitive times, when they walked in the Order of the Gospel, and had Fellowship with God the Father and the Son, and one with another in the Light of the Gospel, which is the Power of God, through which they witnessed Salvation &amp; Remission of Sins, and published it unto others that they might believe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Scriptures testifie of Christ, and <hi>were written, that they might be believed, and received, and read, that thereby every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved might be made wise to Salvation, through Faith in Christ Jesus,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. <hi>and instructed in Righteousness, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished with all good Works</hi>; and whosoever doth teach any Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the holy Men of God, who spake as they were moved by the Spirit of God, which dwelt in them; the Scriptures are Witnesses against such, that they have not the Spirit of God, but are led by another Spirit, which brings forth contrary Doctrine, and another Faith then was once delivered among the Saints; and whosoever brings in, sets up other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Constitutions, Orders and Practices in Point of Worship, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and contrary unto those Practices which were held forth in the primitive times, and would set up other Traditions then the Apostles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered either by Word or VVriting, such are manifest to have the Spirit of Error, and are Innovators and Bringers in of other things, as necessary in Point of VVorship among Christians, which the Apostles and Ministers of Christ did not see necessary then, and yet they wanted no Part of the Counsel of God; for <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>He had declared the whole Counsel of God</hi>; and

                  <p>That there hath been a Church of God, and a peculiar People whom God hath singled out, as to be Objects of his Love, which feared him in their Hearts, and bore a Testimony of him, and worshipped him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Manifestation of his Spirit unto them, whether by Word or Revelation, which was certain and infallible unto them that received it, is granted, and this was alwayes but little in Comparison of the Multitude of the fallen Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the rest of the Nations, and People that served and worshipped strange Gods, and never made such a Boast of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality and Visibility, as this supposed Catholick Church hath done, sinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>R. E.</hi> saith, <hi>That after the Scripture was written, the Church of the</hi> Jews <hi>was Rule and Judge unto the</hi> Jews; and cites <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8. <hi>Thou shalt come unto the Priests, Levites and unto the Judge, and enquire, and they shall shew thee the Sentence of Judgment, and according to that which they shall tell thee thou shalt do</hi>: And likewise he quotes <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2, 3. <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees sit in</hi> Moses<hi>'s Chair, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do, &amp;c.</hi> And from thence he infers, <hi>would God direct them unto, and punish with Death for not obeying an Authority which might deceive them, and was this Authority committed to them that were capable of mistaking?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It seems <hi>R. E.</hi> would narrow and pinch up the Church of God among the <hi>Jews</hi> in a straight Compass, when he would confine it only to the Priests and Levites, and to the Judges in those Dayes, whenas all the Tribes were called the Church as well as <hi>Levi</hi>; again it is said, Jacob <hi>is my Portion, and Israel is the Lot of my Inheritance,</hi> comprising the whole Tribes and Families of the <hi>Jews</hi>; but it seems these must be no Part of the Church with <hi>R. E.</hi> he pinches narrower now then he will do when he tells us of the Vastness of the Universal Church; but let that pass as by the Way, and to come to the Matter in Hand; the Priests and Levites were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the express Commandments of God, as to be Ministers unto him, and to minister unto the People, according unto the Covenant that he made in those Dayes; and the Priests and the Levites were endowed with the Spirit from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suitable to the Ministry &amp; Charge committed to them, and they were Figures of Christ, the Everlasting High Priest; and the Law and Judgment which was given by the Lord to <hi>Moses,</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Priests, and their Lips were to preserve Knowledge, and good
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:40634:337"/>
Reason, because they were committed unto them; and the Tables of Stone and the Commandments were not given to the Families and the rest of the Tribes, and as <hi>R. E.</hi> hath answered himself, <hi>neither could sufficient Copies have been written in any reasonable time to every particular Tribe, Family or Person</hi>; and therefore R. E. concludes full too hastily, but that his Spirit indeed is by assed all along in his Discourse to aim toward the Mark he would be at, to set up Men above the Spirit, Scripture and Reason; but I enquire of R. E. whether that the Priests and Levites and Judge did tell them any other thing, or direct them in any other Way, or gave Judgment after any other manner then as was written in the Tables of Stone, or the Book of the Law, which was written, wherein the Mind of God was contain'd, both in Point of Worship, and also in Point of Government; and why might not R. E. as well and reasonably have concluded, that that which was given from the Mouth of the Lord concerning all <hi>Israel,</hi> was the Direction, Rule and Guide, and Judge, as well as the Priests and Levites; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the People or the Church having the Recourse to their Ministers appointed of God, was, because they had the Statutes and Ordinances of God committed unto them, which was put in the Ark of the Covenant, and in the Tabernacle: And by the Way, I would ask R. E. or any of his <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> a Question, seeing he saith, <hi>That this Promise is granted and intailed unto the Church</hi> (without all Limitation or Condition) <hi>as to be the only infallible Rule, and that they cannot err</hi>; whether that these Priests and Levites ever did err, yea or nay? and when was the Entail cut off from them? seeing the Scripture saith, <hi>They had violated his Law, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Covenant</hi>; and again, <hi>The Prophets prophesied for Hire, and the Priests bore Rule by their Means, and the Judges judged for Rewards</hi>; and as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> said concerning <hi>Israel, They are all gone out of the Way, and there is not one that doth Good, no not one,</hi> and whether were they the Rule, and true Guides, and Judges in this revolted State, yea or nay? although I do not question but they retained still their Places by Way of Office, and would claim the same Power which they had before from God, as they stood in the Commands of God, as R.E. and his Catholicks do, and will lay claim to the Office and Power the Apostles had, though they do err from the Spirit the Apostles were in; and whether their Power of being Directors, Guiders and true Judges and infallible Rule stood not upon this Condition, as they did continue in the Covenant of God, and kept the Precepts of God in Purity without Violation, which when they did not (as sometimes they did not) whether were they subject to err, or whether did they err, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> or nay? <hi>viz.</hi> the Priests and Levites, Judges and Heads of the People, which R. E. reckons for the Church; and though Christ did exhort his Disciples to hear the Scribes and Pharisees, who sat in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Chair, and to observe and do those things which they from the Law before-given read, taught and instructed the People in, because as I said before, the Law and the Statutes were committed to the Priests and Levites, and they to read it, and minister unto the People by the Appointment of God; and these Statutes and Ordinances were the Rule that the then Church ought to have observed, yet Christ exhorted the Disciples <hi>to beware of their Leaven and of their Hypocrisie,</hi> and said, <hi>they said and did not,</hi> notwithstanding all the
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:40634:337"/>
Authority which R. E. saith they had; and further saith, <hi>Would God direct them unto, and punish with Death for not obeying an Authority which might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them? or would Christ command the doing of whatsoever should be done by an Authority that was capable of mistaking?</hi> all which maks nothing for R.E. but rather would run him upon a harder Rock, if this should be true or granted; for then he is bound both to believe and justifie the Scribes and Pharisees in whatsoever they did or said, of which methinks R. E. should be ashamed; 'tis true, they that sate in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Chair could not err, nor be capable of mistaking, as they continued to keep unviolate the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Statutes and Rule, which were given unto them by the Command of God; but when they disobeyed, and <hi>set up the Traditions of Men, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled them with the Ordinances of God, and neglected the weighty Matters of the Law, as Justice and true Judgment</hi>; both they that taught, and they that were taught, came justly under Reproof: And seeing R. E. reckons that the Authority of the <hi>Jews, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> could not be deceived, or capable of mistaking, only because they bear the name of such an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Office; I query of R. E. again, whether the Scribes and Pharisees were not mistaken, yea or nay? and whether they were not deceived, yea or nay? and wherefore Christ should exhort his Disciples to take heed of them, and to beware of them, and to take heed of their Doctrine? and why did Christ pronounce so many Woes against them, notwithstanding their sitting in <hi>Moses</hi>'s chair? But in what hath been said, I hope will be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to convince any, that what R. E. hath laid down for a seeming Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation makes altogether against himself, the Premises before well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: And as for all thy collections out of the Promise of God to his <hi>Church, Isa.</hi> 54. &amp; 56. and of its Endowments and Glory and Excellency, <hi>and of his putting his Spirit in them, and of his Word in their Mouthes, and that it should not depart from the Seed, or the Seed's Seed forever</hi>; this is granted, and the Promise is not to Men, as Men, but to the Seed, which is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but one; but <hi>Israel</hi> was this true <hi>Church</hi> then in the time of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, though it hath Relation to future Ages also; and if R. E. looks that this Promise should be to <hi>Israel</hi> after the Flesh, the <hi>Church then visible and in Being,</hi> he mistakes himself, and he egregiously errs, and contradicts the Scripture in sundry Places, which saith, <hi>Your House is left unto you desolate, their Sacrifices ceased, the Glory of God departed from them, their Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied a Divination of their own Brain, and their Visions were as Visions of the Night</hi>; and the Lord spake not to the most of them, yet they said falsly, <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> in their revolted Estate; for they were erred from the Spirit, and gone from the Seed, and joyned to another Seed, and their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flesh was departed from them, though as Men they had the same Flesh still, go learn what that means; and yet notwithstanding all this, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God was not violated, neither unfulfilled on God's Part; for the Promise was not then, neither now is to Natural Generations, or that which is born after the Flesh, or to men as men and Creatures, but as they are the Seed, and as they are Men of God, and as they are born again and new Creatures; and if thou wilt have an intailing, here it is intailed, which cannot be cut off; for the Covenant stands not to Men in such a Place, that carries the Name of Office or Authority, but as they are led by the Spirit, the infallible Judge, Rule or Guide, as they walk by this and in this, they
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:40634:338"/>
cannot err; and they erring from this, they are subject to be deceived, and to be mistaken in all things and every thing, of which there are evident Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Scriptures of Truth in divers Ages, of them that professed themselves Members of the Church of God, and so visible as R. E. speaks of, yea, and the greater Part too, that have erred, and their Pathes have been reckoned by the Lord as crooked and perverse, and their Habitations full of Cruelty; and this is given for an Instance, the visible Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> did err and go aside, notwithstanding all the Promises of God to them; and as they looked that it still belonged to them, because they were in visible Profession, though they had turned their Backs upon the Lord, and their Hearts too, and violated his Covenant; yet still (as I said) the Promise of God and the Covenant of God is not made of none Effect, nor broken on God's Part, but stands with the Seed forever, who are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in Heart, and who worship God in Spirit and Truth, and in Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Heart, and hath no Confidence in the Flesh, nor fleshly Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor external Performances, but only trusts unto the Gift of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness manifest in them, by which Justification comes upon all that believe, and the Fulness of the Blessing of the Gospel of Christ, and the Fulness of the Promise of God; but these things I know, though they be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Faithful and True, are a sealed Book, and hid from all Eyes living in the Flesh, who have not been baptized into the Death and Suffering of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That Christ by his own Mouth and the mouths of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, did Promise that there should be a Church which the Gates of Hell should not prevail against, and this Church was established upon the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Foundation, and the Rock of Ages, and was endued with Power from on High, and with a great measure of the Spirit of God according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Christ's Promise,</hi> which more plentifully was poured forth after Christs departure, and after his Ascension, and great Gifts were given unto them, the <hi>Word of Knowledge, the Word of Wisdom, the Interpretation of Tongues, and the gift of Tongues, the Gift of Prophesie, the gift of discerning Spirits, healing the Sick, working of Miracles,</hi> &amp;c. and all these foresaid gifts were given <hi>for the Work of the Ministry, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the Body of Christ, till we all come into the Unity of the Faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, and unto a perfect Man, and to the measure and Stature of the fulness of Christ, Ephes.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. And all these were instrumental (though the Spirit of God which was with them and in them, the only means) to bear witness unto those things that they had learned and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to publish the word of Faith abroad unto the World: and for these aforesaid ends above-mentioned, which though R. E. and his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks will needs lay claim to the Succession by way of Office, yet by their Doctrine deny in part the very end wherefore such gifts were given, to wit, the Doctrine of Purgatory, for if they did perfect the Saints, or were brought up to the knowledge of the Son of God, and to perfect Men in Christ Jesus, and to be without Sin, what need had there been of raising up this damnable Doctrine out of the Pit, to purge from Sin after they be dead, seeing they were to be perfect Men while they were alive, and the Ministry was given for this End? but yours it seems cannot have these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on this side of the Grave, and therefore they perfect them in the grave

and so be ministers in another World: And this Church thus gathered and endued before-mentioned, with the infallible Spirit of God, if any that did sometime believe and were joyned unto it, did walk disorderly, as not becoming the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, they were to be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and Exhorted, and if they persisted in their disorder, it was to be told to the Church, or the whole Body, and if such a one would not hear the Church, he was to be reckoned as a Publican, or a Heathen, and to be denyed as to have any Fellowship with him, till manifest Repentance was shewn; but we never read that this Church <hi>did shed any man's Blood, or Burn any, or give consent to Destroy any, i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Argues further and saith, <hi>but if Christ by his Spirit doth not preserve this Church from all possibility of teaching Error instead of Truth, I may receive such Errors as may damn me</hi>; unto which I say, Christ by his Spirit doth preserve this Church from all possibility of teaching er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, if they continue in the Guidance thereof, and Err not from the Spirit of Christ, as some Churches did, which were as truly Christian, and might lay claim unto Christ's promise of preservation out of error, as ever <hi>Rome</hi> could do, and yet six of the Seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> were reproved by the Spirit of Christ, some of them for holding gross Error, and some for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it; but where was the fault? did not Christ perform his promise to his Church, or to these and other particular Churches, as <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi>? (yes) but there was an erring from the Spirit; but all that R.

E. hath left out the Conditions on the Disciples part, and that which was <hi>their duty, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I command you, and then lo I am with you, &amp;c.</hi> But R. E. likes not obedience it seems unto Christ's commands, and yet he will needs be a sharer in the Promise, and of the Power that was given, and bind God unto that, and he and his Church to be loose, to do and to teach what they will; but as to all the Scriptures he hath brought and minced them, and cut them in piece-meal; and all the inferences he makes, this we acknowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out multiplicity of words, that whatsoever was promised to the Church of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Disciples of Christ; as the Church of Christ, and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ, the same Promise of Christ, doth belong to the Church of Christ and Disciples of Christ in every Age, and stands upon the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; <hi>viz.

And so I conclude with that which <hi>Austin</hi> said unto <hi>Faustus</hi> the <hi>Manichee, Ye Work no Miracles, and yet if ye wrought any, at your Hands we would take heed of them.</hi> And Jer. 23. saith, <hi>The false Prophets have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my People by their Lyes and by their Lightness, and by their Dreams and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi> And so hath this false fained pretended Catholick Church done, deceived the Nations, and bewitched them with such Lying fabulous Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and false and ridiculous Miracles, and Sorceries and Inchantments, as is above-mentioned; and many more of the like Nature might be men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioned, but that I would not be tedious to the Reader, which if they were all sum'd up, would hardly make up a Heavenly Argument and Proof, as <hi>R.

E.</hi> and his Catholick Church, first, to be reckoned as an <hi>Unbeliever,</hi> second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be a <hi>Hater of God,</hi> and thirdly, in not believing these Miracles, or whatsoever else shall be declared unto thee by the said Church, or else thou

comest under no less Penalty then <hi>Eternal Damnation,</hi> as <hi>R. E.</hi> saith in the 80th page of his Epistle: but it is a small thing to be judged by man, and especially such a man who hath gadded abroad, and changed his way so oft, so that he hath forgotten the true Path of Righteousness to walk in, or else never knew it, and hath turned and wheeled about; and now at last doth as the poor <hi>Indian</hi> doth with his Deer-skin, hangs it upon one Shoulder, and so upon the other shoulder to shelter him from the Wind and Tempest that comes of that side: But the day is dawned, and mens Spirits are disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered beyond their Words, and all the turnings and wheelings of things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side down, is but as the Potter's Clay; for God measures every man, not by his Words, but by his Heart and Spirit, and Works, and will judge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in Righteousness according to their deeds.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>R.

<pb n="664" facs="tcp:40634:349"/>
God declared and published plentifully in it, and the everlasting Gospel of Christ in the Demonstration of the Spirit and with Power, insomuch that the Sound went through and through, and many believed, and the rest were hardened, having lost the Day of their Visitation; but alas! it was but a few, considering the Labour and Travail, and considering so many Thousands who counted the things of God a slight Matter; and for them that were worthy, and did believe, they were hated, and despised, and evilly entreated with the most, and shut up in Holes, and miserable Bonds and Prisons, and lingring Torments, which oftentimes were the Cause of their Death, whose Lives God is requiring at the Hands of that Place; and the Messengers of God were mocked, abused and evilly entreated, and shut up in Bonds till Death, and Wickedness did abound, and Peoples Hearts grew hard in Ease, Riches, Pride and vain Glory, till the Wrath of God broke forth, and cut down Thousands in his Displeasure; and this was seen and foreseen full three whole Years and upwards by some of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants of God, who laid down their Lives in Bonds in that City, and are gathered unto the Lord, and also some who remain in the Body unto this Day; and it was prophesied of, and the City was warned thereof, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and People, but the most made a Mock of it, till the just Judgment of God seized upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Lord took away these faithful Men of God, <hi>Edward Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, Richard Hubberthorn</hi> and <hi>George Fox</hi> junior, <hi>who had been much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant there,</hi> who were faithful Watchmen, and prevailed often with the Lord, till they were shut up in Bonds for all their sore Travail and Labour amongst the Inhabitants thereof; and that Place being unworthy of them any more, he delivered them, and took them away to himself from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to come, that they had seen and prophesied of, that they might see none of that Misery that is now come.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Lord did fore-know and fore-see, and also had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Evil against that City, and that which is now come to pass, and that this Generation, notwithstanding all the Entreaties, Woings, Warnings and Exhortations which they had and slighted, and they would proceed on to more Mischief and Persecution, in presumption against God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and are yet determined, and have said in their Hearts, <hi>Though the Bricks be fallen down, we will build with hewn Stone,</hi> to fortifie themselves, that their End might not fail, which the Lord God will blast and confound; and though Friends have born their Iniquity, they shall at last bear it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and know the Reward thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have none to help; so the Lord hath taken away many in his Love and Mercy from the Evil to come, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> For the hardening the Hearts of this Generation, who have devised Mischief from the Womb, and have gone astray as soon as they were born, after so many Warnings and evident Tokens of his Hand against them, and of his Displeasure, which have been set at nought, and yet are resolved to go on to root out the Heritage of God; I say, that their Hearts might be hardened, and their Eyes closed, that they may not discern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the End of the Righteous and the Wicked, nor see a Difference in their States, but as one dyes, so dyes the other as to the outward Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; though you beloved know a Difference both in Life and Death; and I do believe many who have laid down the Body, and put off this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y Tabernacle, have given great Testimony of God's Love unto them, of his Favour, Peace and Acceptation in the latter End; in this which I have said I am satisfied, and therefore could not but signifie the same unto you, that we might not sorrow concerning them that dye in the Faith, and sleep in Christ, as them who are without Hope; for these rest from their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and their Faith, Works and Life shall live, and we have and enjoy their Spirit and Life; so it is only personal Absence of this earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle that we want, so in that be comforted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Last of all,</hi> The Wayes of the Lord are unsearchable, but as he reveals them to them that fear him; and whatever may be manifest to any other, this I am certainly perswaded of, that God will have Honour and Glory through all these things, as it shall be in the End for the Prosperity of the Gospel of Truth; and I am perswaded of this, though the Lord should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many to be destroyed outwardly of all they enjoy, yet they are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to trust in him forever.</p>
                  <p>And though the Day be dark and gloomy, and the Devil be let loose to try the Faith of them that dwell upon the Earth, and the Wrath of the Wicked be great, yet the Bond is set that they cannot pass; and though we that yet remain alive to this Day were all dissolved and rowled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Dust, which is the End of all Flesh, yet that Life and Power which we have believed in, and that everlasting Truth which we have te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified of and suffered for shall never be extinguished or rooted out, but shall take up other Persons and Bodies from Generation to Generation, while Sun and Moon endureth; in this be all assured and comforted in the Lord, and chearful in your Sufferings, and comfort and strengthen one another; in the royal Seed of God all live and dwell (which cannot bow to the Seed

of the Bond-woman) which hath the Promise of Life, and Immortality, and everlasting Blessedness; and all look unto the Lord over all and above all the Rage and Wrath of the Enemy, and the Afflictions of this present Life, and feel that which is without End.</p>
                  <p>The God of Power be with you, &amp; comfort your in the midst of all your Tryals, and preserve you that your Faith fail not, is the earnest Desire of him whose Heart is knit unto the Lord and all his suffering People in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Covenant of Life and Peace; pray all unto the Lord without ceasing, that you may be able, though through the Valley of the Shadow of Death; the Peace of God fill all your Hearts, that you may rejoyce in the Lord, and trust in him forever.</p>

                  <p>TRuth never had that Advantage nor Countenance from the Men of this World (though Wise in their Generation) since Sin entered into it, to have the Approbation of the World, neither of the <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> thereof; for it alwayes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Truth, <hi>because it bore Witness against the World, and the Deeds and Works thereof,</hi> which ere evil; <hi>for Wisdom is only justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of her Children,</hi> and Truth is justified of her Children, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed doth it need any other Patron to shelter it self under, but the God of all Truth, from whence it proceeds; neither shall I seek a Shelter, neither run to any Mountain or Hill for Safety or Protection, nor to the mighty of the Earth, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of latter Dayes have done, to patronize their Labours, and to make them the more acceptable, and to be the sooner and more readily received: But seeing the Apostle saith, <hi>Not many Wise, not many Rich, not many Noble are chosen, but he hath chosen the Weak, and Poor, and despised of the World, who are Rich in Faith and good Works, who are Heirs of the Promise and of the the World to come</hi>; I chuse only to be approved to the Witness of Christ's Light in every Man's Conscience, and to the Measure of his holy Spirit which he hath placed in every Man, to that only I desire to be either approved, or else by it reproved; for wholly unto the Judgment of that in every Conscience I appeal, and do commend this ensuing Discourse, in the Sight of God, and the Answer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>A. Smalwood</hi>'s Book, who hath sought to make void Christ's Command, for to obey the Command of Men, as is manifest in his <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> to the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of <hi>Cumberland</hi>; for it seems by his Epistle they put him on Work, to preach and print this Sermon, whether upon this Subject or not, I shall not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but however, he saith, <hi>He hath obeyed their Commands,</hi> though he hath laboured, as much as in him lyes, to make the
<pb facs="tcp:40634:352"/>
Command of Christ void and the Apostles Doctrine, by his Arguments which he hath raised, to prove <hi>Christ's Doctrine</hi> one thing, and his <hi>Intention</hi> another; and so would blind the Minds of People, only to establish the Doctrines of Men, and the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Men in the Apostacy, and hath put divers Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the plain Words of the Scripture, and Interpretation, to prove his false Assertion that he laid down at the first, <hi>that Christ did not forbid all Swearing;</hi> I say, I could willingly have been si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, rather then to be found over and over again contending with every new Opposer of those old Truths, that have been believed and received long before the <hi>Apostacy</hi> entered in, which hath been answered (by that People I own in Judgment and Conversation) long ago; to let pass those Disadvantages we have adventured upon, our <hi>low, persecuted, imprisoned,</hi> and in a Manner <hi>condemned Condition,</hi> so that we may expect our Words, how true soever, yet they are not like to gain much Credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such an eminent Man as <hi>Doctour Smalwood. Again,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how we expose our selves to the Lash and Severity of a sharp Law, which some Men in their blind Zeal are far more rigid and severe in their Prosecution of it, then I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Supream Enactors</hi> of it were in their <hi>Intentions</hi> when they did enact it; all which notwithstanding are no Discouragement unto me, forasmuch as the internal and eternal Truth of our God, which we have known received and believed, is very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in our Eyes, yea, far more then either Life, or Liberty and Estate (which some have forfeited and lost upon Truth's <hi>Account</hi>) or any external Treasure or outward Enjoyment whatsoever, so that considering how the Truth lyes at Stake, we cannot be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, lest thereby we should appear to some Mens <hi>Apprehensions,</hi> as to be satisfied with what the Doctour hath said, and own his <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> that he hath laid down for positive Truth, I could do no less then to show our Dislike of his Doctrine, and to manifest the Weakness of his <hi>Arguments</hi> about this Particular of <hi>Swearing at all,</hi> under the Gospel, though he hath strained ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to prove his <hi>Assertion, That Oaths may lawfully be taken by</hi> Christians <hi>in some Cases,</hi> notwithstanding Christ's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THere being a Book lately published by <hi>A. Smalwood. D. D.</hi> as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Doctor of Divinity; first preached in a Sermon at <hi>Carlile,</hi> I suppose before the Judges at the Assizes then holden the 17<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>August,</hi> 1664. since which I perceive many Additions, by Reasons and Paraphrases are added thereunto, and Printed at <hi>York</hi>: In which Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course he hath Vindicated the lawfulness of Swearing under the Gospel, and hath gone about to prove it by many Reasons, and Authors; how that Christ upon that subject, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> did not intend an absolute Universal prohibition of all manner of Swearing under the Gospel; which Book of his I have perused with an upright Heart, and an imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Eye, seriously, to the End I might own that which is good in it, not as one being glued to an Opinion or Judgment; but what as carries demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Truth with it upon my Conscience and in my Heart; it being a Principle well known and believed amongst us, to have our Consciences void of offence towards God, and towards Man: and seeing my self and many more are great Sufferers at this day upon this very account, which I look upon, being truly and Conscientiously grounded upon the Doctrine of Christ, and consonant to the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> and seeing so large things have been written by other Hands in asserting the Truth of what we have believed, which yet stands as a Witness unto the Doctrine of Christ; notwithstanding all opposition and gain-saying, that it hath had by many Hands; I could have been wholly silent, and have referred all that hath been said to the Judgment of the Lord, and to that of God in every Mans Conscience; but that I perceive <hi>A. Smalwood</hi> hath rendred that People which I own in Judgment and Practice, to be in Error, and hath greatly gain sayed &amp; Villified all such as ever did or do deny <hi>Swearing</hi> upon never so Conscientious account; <hi>As erroneous, and as only sprung from the Pelagian Heresie and</hi> Manicheus, <hi>and I know not who,</hi> and have rendred all with Reproach and disdain, as <hi>Phanaticks</hi> who discent from him, with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful, and reproachful Names, to represent us as Odious as may be to the Magistrate, and at such a time as this, when tender and Conscientious
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:40634:354"/>
People, who fear the Lord in their Hearts, (and desire to live and be at Peace, and seek it with all Men) are sufferers, and great Sufferers too, upon this very account, whereby many are stirred up to more Persecution &amp; Wrath against us: and besides, this Discourse it seems is cryed up, as the most exquisite that ever was, or can be; and as unanswerable, and that we who deny to Swear, would abolish all judicable proceedings, and make them nothing; this Discourse is printed, as <hi>A. S.</hi> in his 12. page saith, <hi>To induce us to forsake so irrational an Opinion, and to Convince us of our Error; and</hi> it seems he himself, besides many other, exspects it must effect some great matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> I say all these things being considered, were a strong inducement to me, to write something in reply thereunto, through in very deed I love not Contention, neither strife about Words, but seeing it is the Doctrine of Christ, and that which hath been, and is stedfastly believed by divers faithful Professors and Sufferers, both formerly and now, however by <hi>A. Smalwood</hi> accounted and reproached by that disdainful Name of <hi>Phanaticks</hi>; a Word lately invented in the Pit of Darkness, where many of those and the like reproaches come from; I was engaged in my Heart, to bear my Testimony against this said Book, and for the Truth of Christ's Doctrine; not out of obstinacy and wilfulness, but in duty as by Conscience to God &amp; his Truth; which is dearer to me then my outward Liberty or all I have to loose for it, which I and many more at this day choose rather to suffer, then to be found violating the commands of Christ, or deny that which I have stedfastly believed; being perswaded thereunto by the Spirit of the Lord, and evidence of the Scripture of Truth.</p>
                  <p>The subject <hi>A. Smalwood</hi> hath taken to treat upon, and in the End to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, and pervert; are no less then Christ's own Doctrine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not at all</hi>: who would have believed or thought that one who accounts himself a Doctor, a Divine, and a Minister of Christ, should choose Christ's own Words to plead against Christ, and them that do abide in his Doctrine? or that ever any should go about to prove Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawful from these words in Gospel-times, or that Swearing is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden? but what would this Man encounter with, or what would not he oppose, if he hath but the Power of this World on his side? it is a small thing to gain-say what we say, and pervert our Words, and make them seem Erroneous, and to make our intentions one thing, and our words another, when he is so bold as to make Christ's Doctrine, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> and his intentions contrary to his words; what do we judge of a Man that speaks one thing, and intends another? it's fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to think what conclusions some will make to carry on their intended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; but methinks <hi>A. S.</hi> might have been more considerate then to have taken Christ's own Doctrine and Words, to oppose Christ's intention, or to be so bold as to assert the intention of <hi>Christ</hi> was otherwise then his words import; but rather have chosen some other Subject; but what matter makes many of subjects, for with a Consequence or two, and a little Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, they will seem to turn things any way, and go about to prove <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is Light, and Light is darkness,</hi> and what as in them lyes make it so to appear if they take a matter in Hand; and therefore the Apostle Exhorted <hi>to beware of Philosophy and vain deceit,</hi> for by this Men have been cunning

and crafty, <hi>and lie in wait to deceive the Innocent and Harmless, and to lead them out of the way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fourth page he saith, <hi>He will clear his intention, and that there are two sorts of Men that do Violence to this Text; the one winds it up to too high a note, as though Christ had forbidden all Swearing whatsoever.</hi> And in the tenth page he saith, <hi>This error is masked under a fair Colour of a more then ordinary Piety, but tends to overthrow all</hi> Judicatures, <hi>and takes away the decision of all emergent Suites and Controversies; and were it granted, saith</hi> A. Smalwood, <hi>we should be necessitated if not to disown the Magistrates Authority, yet to disobey their loyal command, as having a counter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Who doth the greater violence to this Scripture, whether <hi>A. S.</hi> who in his Doctrine he hath raised from these Words to be the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Discourse, who makes Christ's plain and express words one thing and his intentions another, I leave to all unbyassed Spirits to judge off; or they that say, <hi>Christ intended what he spoke, and spake what he intended</hi>: I say let all see and consider where the violence lies, and in whom, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he doth not wind it up by that note, or contrary to it, to use his own Words, otherwise then Christ intends it, as after will be made more evient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to appear, &amp; we say it's not error but Truth to believe Christ's Words, whoare Truth, more then <hi>A. S.</hi> his conjectural supposition, neither do we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, to be error masked, but Truth revealed, and Christ spoke and declared it, that we might believe it, and obey it: And we believe that <hi>A.

Swear not at all?</hi> doth it overthrow all Justice and Judicatories? Is it not the Seat of Judgment established in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Truth? and they that sit in Judgment ought they not to give Sentence and Judgment in Righteousness and Truth, and as the causes are represented unto them, and brought before them? and may not every Truth be confirmed out of the Mouth of two or three <note n="‖" rend="inter">
                        <hi>Without an Oath as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law in divers causes where no Oath is mentioned but Witnesses,</hi> Deut. 19.15.</note> Witnesses, and all emergent suits &amp; Controversies ended according to the best evidence after diligent Inquisition and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given accordingly, and that without the needless and cumbersome formality of an oath <note n="‖" rend="inter">Deut. 19.6. <hi>In case of Life and Death, no Oath was used we read of.</hi>
                     </note> which is sometime this, and sometime that, and changeable, whenas every true confession and Testimony is equivalent thereunto, in the presence of the God of all Truth? and who ever denyed this? And there is no necessity so to Judge that he that fears to Swear, and take an Oath, yet refuseth not to give Testimony about any matter, whether it doth concern the Lord or his Neighbour, that therefore he denyes the Magistrates Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or yet disobeys their legal commands? so that though all Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be denyed, yet that which answers the cause in hand is not deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, true Testimony; and therefore the Magistrates Authority and their
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:40634:355"/>
lawful commands may well stand and be obeyed, and right done unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man, and Christ's command stand also, these are but the Secret smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and suggestions of <hi>A. Smalwood</hi> to render them Odious to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and all People, who dissent from him in Judgment: And indeed such like Discourses and Instigations from such like Mouths and Pens as his is, who is accounted Learned and Eminent, hath not a little added afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto our Bonds, and they have made wide the Wound, and have made the Breach seem greater then it is, and the matter more grievous then there hath been any Cause for, I desire they may consider of it, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
                  <p>And in page 13. from this Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. <hi>But I say unto you, swear not at all,</hi> he layes down this Proposition or Doctrine, viz. <hi>Our Saviour did not intend by these Words,</hi> Swear not at all, <hi>an absolute, universal and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Prohibition of all manner of Swearing</hi>; and goes on to prove it by divers Reasons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> he gives is, <hi>That the Father and the Son are one in Nature, Power, Wisdom, Immutability and Eternity, and one in Will and Wisdom, therefore they cannot give forth contrary Commands; but God the Father hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Swearing in these Words,</hi> Thou shalt fear the Lord, and swear by his Name, and serve him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>And therefore it is not possible that God the Son should forbid it.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the Father and the Son be one in Nature, Power, and Wisdom, and Immutability, and Will, as in themselves, and alter not, but keep Covenant from Age to Age, and from Generation to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, there is no Contrariety in them, yet <hi>there are Diversities of Gifts, but the same Spirit, and there are Differences of Administrations, but the same Lord:</hi> It is granted, that after Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin, and Diffidence and Unbelief, Variance and Strife, and many Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, for which the Law was added, and because of which the Law was added, and the Command given forth unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> to swear by the Name of God, as <hi>Jerome</hi> saith upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3, 37. <hi>It was permitted the</hi> Jews <hi>under the Law, is being tender and Infants (and to keep them from Idolatry, which the rest of the Nations did run into) they might swear by the Name of God, not that it was rightful so to do, but that it was better to swear by the Lord then by false Gods or Devils; but the great Evangelical Sincerity and Truth admits not of an Oath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the ending of Strife and Variance, being in the Unbelief, which was the Occasion of the adding of the Law, and the Cause of the Command given forth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. with divers more Words, specified by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets: And though Christ came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it, and to destroy that which the Law was against (and which it took hold upon) and to finish Sin and Transgression, and bring in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Righteousness, and to restore to the Beginning; and we say, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we have believed and received of the Lord, and have a Cloud of Witnesses, both them that are gone before, and of them that yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main alive: As Christ said of Divorcement, <hi>It was not so from the Beginning,</hi> so we say, Oathes were not from the Beginning, but were added after Hardness of Heart, and Sin, and Unbelief entered into the World; but Christ who was made under the Law, and fulfilled the Law, put an End
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:40634:355"/>
to the Transgression, Sin, Unbelief, Variance and Strife, in whom all the Promises of God are fulfilled, he is the Righteousness of God; and who are true Christians indeed are come out of Unbelief, Variance and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and do see and know Christ to be the End of the Law for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness unto them that believe, who exhorted to do the Truth, confess the Truth and speak the Truth, who said, <hi>Swear not at all by Heaven,</hi> and which after more shall be said, God willing, to the Text it self: And so <hi>A. Smalwood</hi> his Reason is made void, and his Impossibility made possible, that God gave forth a Command, and permitted the <hi>Jews</hi> to swear in that Covenant and Ministration, and yet Christ in the New Covenant counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, as in the Text, being the Minister of a better Covenant, which stood upon better Promises, who leads to the Beginning, and is the Restorer of all Mankind that do believe; and yet the Father and the Son are one in Will, Wisdom &amp; Power: And though <hi>A. S.</hi> and others cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, or else have no Mind in that Latitude, as generally prohibitive of all Swearing, because he sayes, <hi>God did require it no less then he did his own Worship and Service in the moral Law</hi>; these nice Distinctions of Moral, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial and Ceremonial have confounded Peoples Understandings, though it is still acknowledged they did vow and did swear in the first Covenant under the Law; but whether he or any other making Swearing moral, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial or ceremonial is not much matter, seeing that Christ the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the Sum and Substance of all, and the End of the Law for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to them that do believe, and in him is Life and Righteousness en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; <hi>for the Law was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but the Grace and the Truth cometh by Jesus Christ,</hi> who in the Sum of all Types and Shadows; and therefore the Apostle said, <hi>We are circumcised in him, and baptized in him</hi>; and we do look upon an Oath under the Law to have some Type and Figure in it, notwithstanding <hi>A.S.</hi> sayes, <hi>It was none,</hi> and that <hi>Christ is improperly called the Oath of God,</hi> no more improper then he is a Vine, a Door, a Way, a Shepherd; <note n="*" rend="inter">
                        <hi>For he is called God's Covenant,</hi> Isaiah 53.5. <hi>and God's Covenant is his Oath which he sware,</hi> Luke 1.72, 73.</note> for all the Promises are fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in him, and are yea and amen: And as for the Morality of it, so far as it is moral and perpetual to all under the Gospel, is in Confession of Truth, and bearing Witness thereunto, as before the Lord, or in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and speaking the Truth when there is Necessity, as when any man's Person or Estate, or any Part thereof is in Danger; and this we have ever owned, and do own, and have and are ready to testifie the Truth before the Lord, or in his Presence, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any Matter which concerns the Glory of God, or the Good of our Neighbour, without being pinched or bound up to a certain Form of Words imposed upon us, but according as Necessity requires, so amply and largely as our Words may give Knowledge, and Understanding, and Light in any Matter which is to be desired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this hath been denyed, and hath not been received by this unbelieving Generation, who seek rather to establish the Traditions and Customs of men, rather then the evangelical Doctrine of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>And though Dr. <hi>Smalwood</hi> will needs have it, <hi>viz. Swearing,</hi> neither to be ceremonial or judicial; but for any Proof he brings, for ought I see,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Law said many things by Way of Precept and Commission (at least Permission) from God, which would be Irregularities grosly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable in <hi>Mens Manners, in moral Matters, Conversations, civil Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions and Communications,</hi> should they be used among them who profess the Gospel; the Law said, <hi>An Eye for an Eye, Tooth for Tooth, Hand for Hand, Foot for Foot</hi>; the Gospel saith, <hi>Avenge not your selves, resist not Evil, suffer Wrong, put up, forgive, forbear</hi>; the Law said, <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and hate thy Enemy</hi>; but <hi>A.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> Though I do not argue that Christ abolished the ceremonial and
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:40634:356"/>
judicial Laws once commanded, not abrogated them, yet Bishop <hi>Gauden</hi> doth, who attained, if not to a Degree of Knowledge and Learning, yet to a Degree of Promotion above <hi>A. Smallwood</hi> in his Book which he wrote for the Information of the <hi>Quakers</hi> about Swearing, he saith in his own Words, <hi>Christ came to fulfil the moral Law, however he came in a Way of fulfilling to abrogate the ceremonial, yea, and the politick Laws too, belonging to the</hi> Jews <hi>Policy in Church and State</hi>; and herein is the Bishop and the Doctor at odds, the Bishop said, <hi>He abrogated the ceremonial Law and judicial too, belonging to the</hi> Jews <hi>Policy and State</hi>; but Doctor <hi>Smallwood</hi> sayes, <hi>He denyes his Assertion; for</hi> (sayes he) <hi>we were never under the judicial Law, and what was never imposed need not be abolished</hi>; so then what remains forme to say but this, if Swearing was any Part of the judicial Law, or did belong to their political Estate, as it is the Judgment of many, but it is evident that Swearing was used by the Witness before Judges in <hi>Israel</hi> in those Dayes, to try out their Matters, according to Commandment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of God, as is evident from <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. in the whole Chapter, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Places; then by this Argument <hi>A. S.</hi> hath made, he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown himself, for he saith, <hi>We are no</hi> Jews, <hi>nor in</hi> Canaan, <hi>and so never imposed, and what was never imposed needs no abolishing</hi>; and it is, as I have said, manifest, that Oaths had Relation to judicial Proceedings, and to the Service of God too in that Covenant, which was shadowy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted much in outward Signs and Figures, but the Substance is Christ: So then instead of proving Swearing under the Gospel lawful, he hath by his Argument proved it never injoyned unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> neither indeed was it either ever commanded or commended unto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who believed, or they reproved for not observing it, that we ever read of, by Christ or his Apostles or Ministers in the first and purest times of Christianity; <hi>for to</hi> Jacob <hi>he gave his Law, and to</hi> Israel <hi>his Statutes</hi>; to every Nation he did not so, no not to <hi>Moab, Ammon,</hi> nor the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> neither the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and though he seems to plead hard for Swearing under the Gospel, yet he talls short in his Proof, except he took his own Reasons and Arguments, which divers of them are but imaginary; and in the Foundation of his Discourse he hath taken such great Compass, as there is not an universal, unlimited Prohibition of all Manner of Swearing; but what this Manner of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, it is very uncertain; sometimes he makes it this, and sometimes that; sometimes he saith, <hi>It is no Oath, though in the Form thereof there be not,</hi> I swear, <hi>or God be not named, or</hi> by God <hi>doth not alwayes signifie an Oath,</hi> and other where he seems to affirm it to be an Oath; but when an imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Eye hath sounded and tryed the Bottom, what this Swearing is, that brings so much Glory to God, and so much Good to our Neighbour, that he so vehemently contends for, that ought to be observed as well as God's Fear &amp; Service; it's but their own Traditions &amp; Inventions, for that under the Law will not serve (<hi>As the Lord lives</hi>) or that he calls Swearing under the Gospel will not serve (<hi>The Lord is Witness</hi>) or <hi>I speak the Truth in Christ,</hi> or <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="680" facs="tcp:40634:357"/>
and not without some Attestation of God, or of his Wisdom, Power and Presence, yet it would never yet be received, but reckoned as Insufficient, though both the Rulers of this Age and <hi>A. S.</hi> have said it, <hi>It might be that in private it might, but in Judicature never as received,</hi> though I do believe the most do believe we dare not lye in ordinary Communication, much less in Judicature, yet we have been set aside as Objects of Wrath, as deluded, erronious, factious, seditious, Contemners of Law, Obstructors of legal Procedings, except we would lay our Hand upon a Bible, and kiss it, and say, <hi>I swear,</hi> and <hi>by the Contents of the Book,</hi> and <hi>so help me God,</hi> or else fined imprisoned for Term of Life, our Lands and Goods confiscated, and we sentenced to be banished, our Wives and Children ruinated, Husband and Wife parted, Children and Parents separated, and such Monsters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have we to deal withal in this Age, and how many brought into this sad Condition in <hi>England,</hi> as little <hi>A. S.</hi> knows as cares: But for ought I know that he and such as he, in such publick Discourses as this of his have blown the Sparks, and have kindled a Flame in the Rulers, and incensed them, and stirred them up to Severity and Harshness against them who fear the Lord, and do maintain Peace with all men, as much as in them lyeth, and keep their Consciences void of Offence towards God, which makes us to chuse rather all this Hardship, then to offend the Lord, who serve and fear his Name, and reverence it more then they who seem to honor it, and pretend God's Honour through their Swearing. But to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for this <hi>A. S.</hi> saith, <hi>The Magistrates must act by the Law, and that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns such a Form of Swearing, and they cannot allow it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto that I answer, it had been a more necessary Discourse for <hi>A. S.</hi> to have exhorted the Magistrates, if the Law had been answered in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, not to be so severe in the Form, and also to have told them where any Law was made contrary to the Law of God, either in Matter or Form; the Consciences of Believers could not yeild Obedience thereunto, when it was repugnant unto the Law of God, and not according to the Form thereof, and in such Cases to be wary; and he and the rest of the Clergy to have advised with the Rulers and Law-makers, and to have informed them from whom they receive such great In-comes and Revenues (for the Preservation and Peace of all Men) tnat they need not stand so much upon the Form, seeing that so many conscientious People questioned it, so that there needed not such tying up to Form, under such great and heavy Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, as Banishment, Confiscation and perpetual Imprisonment, but have informed them so that the Truth might have been found out, and no judicial Proceedings hindered, which I am sure may be without any Swearing, true Testimony never being denyed, when required by any Magistrate, and let but a Penalty be upon him that gives false Evidence, or speaks an Untruth about any Proceedings in Judicature, or otherwise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to bear Evidence in any Controversie, if found, let them suffer as them that swear falsly, and as perjured, and the Case is one; and here all Scruples and Contentions about Swearing would end, and there would not be the least Obstruction in legal Proceedings, or in Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice; and let me tell Doctor <hi>Smallwood</hi> and the rest of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that if they would move such a thing in Parliament, peradventure it would be readily received from them, and in so doing they would do as
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:40634:357"/>
acceptable a Piece of Service, and as well-pleasing to God, and would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as much to the Peace and Tranquillity of the Nation, as any thing that ever they will do in their Age, or hath been effected many Ages; and so all these Heart-burnings, Contentions, and evil Surmisings, and evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting one another would cease and end, and which if not effected, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be looked for but sad Suffering, and great Oppression and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, which will provoke the Lord to Anger, and ever did against all them that were the Cause of it in Ages past: But I come to his second Argument.</p>
                  <p>Second Argument, <hi>Some without any Colour, Reason or Possibility of Proof, will needs have Swearing a ceremonial Rite, but God ranks it with his Fear and Service, therefore it must needs be moral; and therefore what at all Times, as well under the Gospel as under the Law, as well among the</hi> Gentiles <hi>as the</hi> Jews, <hi>tends to the Glory of God, that is not a ceremonial Ordinance, nor forbidden by Christ; but such is Swearing, and therefore it cannot be thought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> It hath been said and often asserted, that all the ten Words and ten Commandments were moral and perpetual, as well under the Gospel as under the Law; then I wonder what <hi>A. S.</hi> and divers others intend to do with the fourth Commandment if it be moral and perpetual, and to be observed in the same Manner and with the same Service, as then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and the same day and time, then he and most of them who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend most for the Morality of these ten Commandments are great Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors; and if he grant there was something ceremonial in it, and typical or figurative, which then was the seventh Day, which was given for a Sign of the World's Rest from its Labour, and of keeping after it an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Sabbath to the Lord, by Man's Cessation from his own Works, as God did from his, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. and the last of <hi>Hebrews, ver.</hi> 4. which <hi>Jewish</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the seventh Day as a Sabbath now, though never so solemnly, as then commanded, will have no Acceptation at all, no more then he, and he as much (that is, none at all) that never so solemnly swears by the Name of God, in such ceremonious Way as the <hi>Jews</hi> did of old, (or goes beyond the bare Asseveration or Testimony of Truth, with some Attestation of God's Power and Veracity, which hath never been denyed) which to do, we do not only think, but know it to be a superfluous Ceremony to <hi>Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,</hi> not to say, <hi>Brat of</hi> Jewish <hi>Extraction,</hi> as <hi>A. S.</hi> doth) now circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and cut off from Christians by Christ? And what though God did, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. rank it with his Fear and Service? was there any Service or Worship in that Covenant that had not some Sign and Shadow in it, and was ceremonial, and was to end in the Substance? was there not Prayer and Praising? and were not these Service and Worship? and had these not the Ceremony of Incense and Sacrifice, which then attended these Services? but the Substance was <hi>lifting up of the Heart unto the Lord, and making a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody in the Heart</hi>; and <hi>Circumcision is now that of the Heart, Rom.</hi> 2. which was outward before; the killing of a Lamb at the Passeover was an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in that Covenant; the Substance thereof is Christ, the Passeover; the other now under the Gospel would be no more then <hi>cutting off a Dog's Neck</hi>; these were all <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God to be observed, and in their day
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:40634:358"/>
and time; &amp; they that did according to the Command of God tended to the Glory of God in that first Covenant; but in the second under the Gospel, whosoever should observe them in the Figure, Ceremony and Shadow, should much dishonour God and his Christ, the Substance, and Christ would profit him nothing; see that Ceremony of Swearing, the Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that only abides under the Gospel, is testifying the known Truth from the Heart, with some Attestation of God to witness, who is Witness of all we do or say, and that no more then Confession or Denial by <hi>Yea or Nay,</hi> which is no Oath, is that standing Substance and the moral (if <hi>A. S.</hi> will have it called so) that remains under the Gospel, which answers that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious Way of Swearing under the Law, which is most evidence by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s rendering of that Term <hi>Swearing,</hi> as it was spoken by Way of Prophesie concerning its Continuance, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.23. <hi>To me every Tongue shall swear,</hi> under that Term <hi>Confessing</hi> only under the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Every Knee shall bow, every Tongue shall confess to God; Confession</hi> under the Gospel is made equivalent with an <hi>Oath</hi> under the Law; but this rendering of it <hi>A. S.</hi> doth not like, but would pervert <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, to have it <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> (but put to his own Addition) <hi>by Oath,</hi> so that his Argument is void; Swearing was binding in that ceremonious Way which it was commanded under the Law, but not under the Gospel, nor among the Christians, who are come to the Substance, and to confess and speak the Truth in Christ, to the Glory of God, acknowledging his Power and Omnisciency, and his Justice, in discerning whether Truth be spoken, and in punishing them that speak falsly &amp; his Wisdom in discerning the Secrets of all Hearts; and <hi>A. S.</hi> might as well have said, <hi>That Offerings and Oblations, &amp; Sacrifice tend much to the Glory of God under the Gospel, as under the Law, as Swearing</hi>; but saith he, <hi>Swearing is a Part of God's peculiar Service, that is incommunicable to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>; the like I say of the former, <hi>Offering, and Sacrifice, and Incense were incommunicable to any Creature, but was due unto God alone</hi>; yet it doth not follow as well under the Gospel as under the Law, for that were to set up the <hi>Figure,</hi> and <hi>deny the Substance</hi>; so this <hi>second Argument is insufficient,</hi> and the third is somewhat related to it, which I now come unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>third Argument</hi> is, <hi>That if Christ's Purpose be utterly to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish all Swearing, as an illegitimate Brat of</hi> Jewish <hi>Extraction, not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the</hi> Christian <hi>Church, then it must be either as it is repugnant to our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, or else to our Neighbour; for into that summary he hath contracted the whole Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> We must still distinguish that which was once a duty to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed under the Law, because commanded, is not required as a duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, and the strength of most of <hi>A. S.</hi> his Arguments, and the rest who contend for Swearing under the Gospel, are grounded upon the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, though this of Oaths he will needs have to be moral; it may be he would contend as much for the Morality of Tythes and Oblations, if it had been the subject of his Discourse, as for Oaths, and them to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> under the Gospel, for many such we have met with, and he might bring the same Arguments for Tythes and Oblations, they are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto God, but bring Glory to his Name; because hereby his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters under the Gospel are maintained, and are enabled thereby to Preach
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:40634:358"/>
the Gospel for the Conversion of Souls, which addes much to the Glory of God, and therefore cannot or are not to be prohibited, but these only belonged to the Levitical Priesthood, and continued only to the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, <hi>viz. to the bringing in of a better Hope and a better Covenant, which stood upon better Promises; for the Priesthood being changed, there is also of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity a change of the Law, Hebr.</hi> 6.12. by which Tythes was a duty, and they robbed God that detained them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. But this being ended and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Christ, the everlasting high Priest, who by one Offering perfected forever them that are Sanctified, he bid not his Disciples require Tythes as a due, or duty belonging to God, under the Gospel, <hi>But freely you have received, freely give, and what House soever ye enter into that is worthy there abide, and eat such things as are set before you, for the Workman is worthy of his Meat,</hi> and this was far more Evangelical, &amp; conduced more to the Honour of God, then Tythes; and the Apostles lived more by Faith upon God, who provided for them, who were employed in his Service, so that I argue, what was once a duty under the Law, that was to be performed unto God, is not alwayes a duty among Christians, for though Oaths were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the <hi>Jews</hi> in that time of Infancy, and as being weak, and it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, as <hi>Jerome</hi> saith, upon the 5<hi>th Mat. vers.</hi> 37. <hi>to Swear by the Name of God to keep them from Idolatry, seeing all other Nations were given to Idolatry, and Swear by false God's, as Chemosh, Ashtereth,</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> he knew their aptness to be led aside with the Customs of other Nations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were to acknowledge him alone, who was the living God, and no other, and to testifie Truth by his Name, as a thing certain and sure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore one of their Oathes was, <hi>as the Lord lives,</hi> and this among the rest was one of the Precepts of the Law, which was added because of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, to Swear by his Name, which needed not have been added, if Sin, and Transgression, and unbelief had not entered in, (mark this) and this Law of Oathes pertained to that part which was in the Transgression, and Variance, and Strife, and that led to Worship Idols, and this continued while that Nature was standing, but Christ was revealed and given to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Sin and Transgression, and unbelief, and to do away that part that lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after Idols, and that led into variance, and he leads out of the occasion of Evil, and from that which was the cause of the Addition of the Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlasting Righteousness again, which was in the beginning before Sin entred, and they that come to believe in him are not under the Law, but under Grace, moreover the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>The Law hath Power over a Man so long as he liveth, even as a Wife is bound by the Law of her Husband so long as he liveth, (and no longer)</hi> so as long as Man liveth in Sin, <hi>Un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, the Law was added as a cure and a remedy to decide Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, and ill distempers, that were entred into the Hearts of Men in the unbelief, and that is one reason which Doctor <hi>Gauden</hi> gives, why solemn Swearing should and ought to be in <hi>judical proceedings</hi> among Christians, to take away Jealousies, Distrusts, Dissimulations, frauds, unsatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

and insecurities; and Quotes <hi>Grotius, That Swearing is necessary, not absolutely and morally, or preceptively, but by way of Consequence and remedy,</hi> as to the state of the <hi>Jews</hi> we shall not, nor have not denyed it; but as to the State of Christians who are truly such, we say that the cause is taken away, and the effect follows, all Jealousies, distrusts, Dissimulations and strifes, and Insecurities, and so the remedies, to wit, Oathes cease, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of them, and that was one main thing why Oathes were permitted to end Strife, <hi>and Strife is a Work of the Flesh, and variance and discord,</hi> and it is inconsistent with true love to our Neighbour to hold that which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers the Strife, and that part, for love <hi>fulfills the Law, works no ill to the Neighbour, ends Strife,</hi> and so puts Swearing, the means to end strife, and the remedy out of place and date. But <hi>A.

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ knew better what he intended then <hi>A.

more ample expressions of Christ to make the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his mind of his dislike of these Oaths by Creatures that they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used, &amp; though these and much more were included in the general Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>; yet they are not to be excluded as superfluous, neither do they obscure the former, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> but give more Light to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to any but them that sees with A.

S. to obscure and darken Christ's words, if he did intend all Oaths, yet they that see with another Eye then he doth, is that they are only more large expressions, thereby to make the <hi>Pharisees</hi> understand, who were in the unbelief, and dull of hearing, that did not only forbid what the Law had forbid before, but even those Oaths that they frequently used, under those terms and forms which the Law had spoken of in those Words, as <hi>Heaven, Earth, Jerusalem, Head</hi> and <hi>Foot,</hi> and therefore he enumerates them as an amplification of his former prohibition, and so they are to be joyned, and we shall not stop as <hi>A.

S. would have it limited, only to Swearing by Creatures, which indeed was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biden under the Law; but Christ who taught a more Evangelical and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act obedience then the Law, he said, <hi>It hath been said of old time, thou shalt not forswear thy self: But I say unto you,</hi> (who saith more then the Law hath said) <hi>Swear not at all, but let your yea be yea, and nay, nay, for whatsoever is more cometh of Evil.</hi> And of this mind was Bp. <hi>Usher,</hi> late of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> who pleaded the Cause of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> or <hi>Leonists,</hi> whose Names are famous amongst the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and were the most Ancient and true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> if any <hi>Reformation</hi> be looked at beyond <hi>Luther</hi>; they professed it no way lawful for a Christian to Swear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the said Bishop <hi>Usher de Succes.

                  <p>But it may be that A.

S. say or Argue; and yet when the substance of the good things was to come to them that had believed, and received him who was sum of all; the Apostle said, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>If you be Circumcised Christ profits you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>; after he was offered up: And <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11. <hi>You observe new-Moons, and Holy days and Sabbaths</hi>: And these things that were once as really good as ever Swearing was, considering the End wherefore they were enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and these things were never Evil in themselves, yet the Apostle reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned them beggarly Rudiments, and told them, <hi>they had begun in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and now sought to be made perfect through the Flesh</hi>; and so stood in doubt of them that his labour had been in vain, and thereof if A. S. or any other will needs uphold Swearing, because commanded to the <hi>Jews,</hi> (before the Seed Christ was revealed) I say he is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.34.) <hi>a debter to the whole Law</hi>; and is as much bound to keep it in all other points as this, or else he is a Transgressour, and is one of those that would be laying Yoaks upon the Disciples Necks, unto whom they were never intended, for if the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and Rights and outward observations, which properly did belong to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church and State, to observe till the fulness of time, when the partition Wall should be broken down, and the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> should be one, and one Shepherd and one Fold for them both, (and no longer) and they were never given to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to observe; and therefore, for ought I can perceive many would have the gentile-Christians, who never were under the Law, neither the Ordinances of the first Covenant, neither ever given to them, yet <hi>they would compell the Christians to live as do the Jews,</hi> and <hi>to observe their Ordinances; and therefore are greatly to be blamed, Gal.</hi> 2.13, 14. Therefore we do not look upon any Swearing to be now a duty under the Gospel among true Christians, truly such, as some Swearing was once under the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but affirm all Swearing to be now a Sin, because forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the positive Law of Christ under the Gospel, who by his Death ended the right of that, and many more legal Rites and Rudiments, which whoso doth observe now as Christians doth it not without Sin, and Guilt, and Superstition; and therefore <hi>S. Fisher</hi> that faithful Servant of God, (who suffered in Bonds till Death for his Testimony even in this particular) saith well, <hi>That that sort of Swearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was not Sin simpliciter in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under the Law, is now a sin upon the account of Christ's Universal prohibition of all Swearing</hi>; who was of Authority to put to an End as he did by his Death unto the Law: And therefore that sort of Service and Worship which stood in outward Observations, which was duty because commanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and no Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their own Nature, neither were Evil in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor in any respect conducing thereto, as they were observed, but had some single good in them once, and yet who observes them now, as Service of God maketh Christ of so little effect to himself, <hi>as that he profits him nothing at all</hi>; I hope A.

therefore S. F. his Argument is not vain but of force: And yet let <hi>A.

The Magistrates exacting Oaths he seems to prove out of the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> and the Priest's Swearing lawfully out of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles and Christ's Sermons, but this his covering is too short, and is but trifling in the weighty things of God, not distinguishing betwixt the first Covenant and the second, and the Ordinances thereof; for the first he hath no Adversary, <hi>viz.</hi> that they did Swear though never exacted under Penalties, the second we conclude to be no Oath, <hi>viz. Amen, Amen, or verily, verily,</hi> which is no more then <hi>truly, truly, I say unto you</hi>; and if this be an Oath, why hath it not, and why is it not accepted as such? for we have said more then this, and can do in Truth, which we look upon to be far from amounting to an Oath, and yet it would never be received as such, which Argues plainly that what <hi>S.

Sworn and will not Repent:</hi> It is not denyed though the Lord Swore once, yea more then once by himself; this was in condescension to the State of Man in weakness and unbelief; and as to the State of the <hi>Jews, Gal.</hi> 3.19. before the Seed was revealed, which was the Substance of all Figures, and Gods Example of Swearing is no example for us now to imitate, and was in no wise a confirming of that old legal Ceremony of Oaths, as a practice <hi>legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to his Saints forever,</hi> as A. S. would make us believe it was, for his Oath, <hi>viz.</hi> (God's) ended in Christ, <hi>in whom all the Promises confirmed by Oath, were yea, and in him Amen,</hi> was also to end all Strife between him and Men, and to put an end to all Strife and Oaths also that are among Men to end Strife; <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith upon that 110. <hi>Psal. Let him then swear who cannot Repent of his Oaths</hi>; a little aftter the same <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Do not imitate him in swearing whom you cannot imitate in performing</hi>; and indeed the principal solution he gives is not to Swear at all: And <hi>Theophilus</hi> upon the place in Controversie whom A. S. says, <hi>was not cautelous enough,</hi> and it seems among the rest of the Fathers that A. S. sets as judge of, he saith, <hi>Learn hence that under the Law it was not Evil for one to swear, but since the coming of Christ it is Evil, as is Circumcision, and in sum, what ever is Judaical, for it becomes a Child to suck but not a man:</hi> So that it appears he amongst the rest of the Fathers did not only declare against Oaths in general or private Communication, but also distinguishes betwixt the first Covenant and the second, and the Ordinances thereof; and though the holy Ghost bear witness that both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, yea, and good Men, and the Creator himself in that first Covenant did Swear, so that A. S. concludes <hi>That is not morally Evil of its own Nature</hi>; In the first we shall not much quarrel nor dispute as under the Law, but that which was obliging then, as by command, it is not always obliging, but Christ the end of the Law for Righteousness said, <hi>Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, for whatsoever is more</hi> under the Gospel (then amounts to this) <hi>comes of Evil</hi>; therefore there is no necessity to put any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sence of Christ's Words then this Universal prohibition of all. Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as under the Gospel, (seeing that speaking the Truth, confessing the Truth, declaring the Truth) and nothing but the Truth in any matter wherein any Christian is concerned either in respect of God, or a man's Neighbour, this Answers the very Substance of the Law, and the very end &amp; purpose thereof, as ever an Oath did among the <hi>Jews</hi> in the first Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; forasmuch as speaking the Truth acknowledgeth God's <hi>Omnisciency</hi> and presence, and Power, and Wisdom; secondly, it doth any Office to any Neighbour, as in bearing witness to any Truth, and again to find out any Transgressour, or Transgression; and this is done, may be done, and ought to be done by all true Christians; and therefore no necessity of that formal Ceremonious way of Swearing as under the Law, neither is there any necessity for seeking any other sence of Christ's Words and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Words, <hi>Swear not at all by Heaven or Earth, or any other,</hi> seeing all the main ends and good ends, &amp; good purposes are Answered in the full, which the Law in the full Latitude and morality thereof did require, or for which it was given.</p>
                  <p>His sixth Argument is, <hi>That either these Words,</hi> Swear not at all, <hi>must be interpreted as not to forbid any Oath though taken upon just accasion, or else</hi>

                  <p>The Apostle knew what occasion he had to speak these Words, and the occasion was this, that the <hi>Jews</hi> sought to be justified by the <hi>Righteousness of the Law and by the Works thereof,</hi> and would needs look upon themselves as the Children of God, because they were of the stock of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Flesh, but the Apostle knew and also gave them to understand that the Children of the Promise were counted for the Seed; and again, <hi>for they are not all</hi> Israel <hi>which are of</hi> Israel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. And thus he spake Truth unto them, as it was revealed by Christ, whom the Father had revealed in him, and why might he not say, <hi>I speak the Truth in Christ,</hi> seeing that Christ was in him, and he in him? <hi>I Lye not,</hi> my Conscience also bears me Witness in the Holy Ghost, he might also as well say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Paul</hi> Swore by his Conscience, seeing that he took it for a witness; away, away, with such perverting and straining of the Scripture beyond and beside the mind of the Holy Ghost, for God is witness <hi>and I speak the Truth in Christ,</hi> they are no more then arden and Ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I shall conclude the Answer to this reason, and neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ignorance nor wickedness to the great Apostle, nor conclude, that Christ's words as he saith, <hi>doubtless the Apostle did,</hi> must be understood in a limited Sense, and limited only to Creatures, and not to all Swearing; and why so? but because the Apostle said, <hi>God is witness</hi>; and I speak the Truth in Christ, which is no contradiction of Christ's prohibition, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His seventh Argument is this, <hi>If some Swearing be enjoyned in the third Commandment, then all Swearing is not forbidden by Christ in these words</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Swear not at all, <hi>because he came not to destroy the Law, but some Swearing is there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, or else the Law written by the Finger of God in Tables of Stone cannot be vindicated from imperfection; and therefore in this Negative precept the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative must needs be included, thou shalt Reverence the Name of the Lord and Swear by it, whensoever it is not vain but necessary, which is required by a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magistrate for the Glory of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for maintaining of Peace, punishing Offenders, and ending of Controversies, and all these are necessary Ends but not attainable, at least not so well by any expedient, yet put in Practice as by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Oaths, so it cannot reasonably be believed, that Christ would forbid them being of such important u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> The substance of this is answered before, but however A. S. how he can make this third Commandment, Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain, to prove the continuation of Swearing under the Gospel among Christians we do not see, If Bishop <hi>Gaudens</hi> Words be true (as they are) who sayes, <hi>A true Christian's Oath is needless, his word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as firm as it,</hi> page 41. <hi>and an evil Man's Oath is worthy of no more credit then a Lyar, pag.</hi> 17. Since upon that account whosoever Swears by the Name of God Swears in vain and to no purpose, whether he be a true Man, or one deceitful, his word amounting to as much as his Oath: And why A. S. mentions the third Commandment to prove Swearing lawful under the Gospel except for the morality of it, which he looks upon Christ came not to destroy, and doth he look that every Letter &amp; Syllable of all the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments is so moral in all respects unchangeable &amp; uncapable of any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation by Christ's coming? he much forgets himself; for all these things contained in the first Table are not so moral or perpetual without some ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniality and subjection to alteration by Christ's coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he imagins if he had but remembred the fourth Commandment the next unto it, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou keep the holy Sabbath day, which then was the very 7th day of the Week which God had Sanctified, was but a Type and Sign, and Shadow, and Figure, and a Ceremony of the 7th. day of the World's rest from its Labour, and of the everlasting Sabbath as I said before, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. and I might as well Argue if the 7th. day of the Week was commanded in the fourth Commandment, then the seventh Day is not prohibited, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Commandment, example, or practice of Christ, the Apostles or Primitive Christians; and I might add this as a reason, because Christ came not to destroy the Law but to fulfill it; and further I might add the 7th. day was enjoyned in the 4th. Commandment, (and they used to call
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:40634:367"/>
it as moral as the third) and therefore it ought to be so under the Gospel, or else the Law written in Tables of Stone cannot be vindicated from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, and what would all my arguing prove, even as much as A. S. his arguing, the continuation and necessity of Oaths from the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and that is nothing at all; and the Law of God needs not A. S. nor any Vindication, <hi>it is Perfect, and endures forever, Psal.</hi> 19.7. and the Ceremonies, and Types, and Shadows that were joyned with, and unto the Substance of the Law, do neither add nor detract from its perfection, but it is the same in it self forever; and though we cannot own Swearing in that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ceremonious way as the <hi>Jews</hi> did use it till the Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d came, unto whom the Law and the Prophets bore witness; yet we do not make void the third Commandment, we take not his Name in vain, but Reverence it, and speak well of it, and Sanctifie it in our Hearts; and as the Apostle said, <hi>Do we make void the Law through the Preaching of Faith? God forbid.</hi> So do we make void the Law, or the Perfection of it, by speaking the Truth, and bearing witness to the Truth; though as I said, we cannot own those Typical Ceremonious ways of Swearing as it was in the first Covenant; nay, it is established, and the third Commandment is established, for he that speaks the Truth and bears witness in and from the Truth, honours God's Name, and Reverences it, forasmuch as he is called the God of Truth, and as we have said, being lawfully called before a Magistrate to bear Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in any thing wherein the Glory of God, or our Neighbour is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the decision of Controversie, seeing that true Testimony is a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um that concerns as much to that purpose now as Swearing did under the Law, therefore we have still been and are ready to answer all these neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary ends, and as well; and this is as good and expedient to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice among Christians as interposition of Oaths, enjoyned by God in the first Covenant, and far more Evangelical, and therefore shall conclude with that of <hi>Jerome, The Gospel Truth admits not of an Oath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His eighth Argument is, <hi>That Christ did never any things without some Ground of reason, but no reason can be shewed, why all manner of Swearing should be forbidden in a due manner, and upon a just and necessary occasion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may well believe that such Swearing was neither here or any where else forbidden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> We shall not much dissent or disagree about terms with A. S. that Christ did never any thing without some Ground or Reason, but yet we must deny his Conclusion, that no Reason can be given why all manner of Swearing should be forbidden; first of all, there was a time since Man had a being in this Creation when he was in the Image of God, and stood in the Covenant of God, when there was no Oath, neither any necessity thereof, Man being endued with Power from God, which was placed in him, so that he was in a capacity to fulfill, obey and serve, and believe his Maker without an Oath; for unbelief or Sin had not entred, and this was before the Fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. Secondly, Christ the unspeakable gift of God, who is the Mediator of the everlasting Covenant, yea, the Covenant is self, who is given for a Leader to the People, and who is made a Propitiation for Sin and Transgression, to end both Sin, Transgression, and Unbelief, which was the cause of the Addition of the Law, who leads to the beginning
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:40634:367"/>
again, all that truly do believe, and are worthy to be called true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or by the Name of Christ to have Union with God again, in that Life, Power, Truth, Righteousness and Wisdom, in which the Image of God truly consists which was before Sin and Transgression, <hi>and before the Law which was added because of it, which was commanded four hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years after the Promise was made, Gal.</hi> 3.17. Thirdly, After Sin was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and Death by Sin, an unbelieving part got up in all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> so that they could not believe God nor his Promises, and yet such was his love unto Mankind, considering the State into which they were plunged for confirmation of his Word unto Man, he Swore by himself, this was the Lord's condescension unto their low and unbelieving Estate all that time, and no way exemplary for Christians (truly such) who are come into the Faith, and to the Truth in it self, who do believe that all the Promises are fulfilled in Christ, yea, and Amen, <hi>who is the Author of Faith and of eternal Salvation to them that believe, Heb.</hi> 9.12. who prohibited that by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23. which sometimes was permitted, yea, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea, and added because of Transgression, and for which the Law and the command for Oaths was only added (which he did not destroy) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he leads from under the Power of that which the Law came against (which is just and good, and Holy) and the Seed fulfills it, and hath Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with it, and with him who is the Judge and Law-giver, and Saviour of all that do believe in him from Sin and Transgression. Fourthly, At that time when the Law was given forth at Mount <hi>Sina, Exod.</hi> 19.20. general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the Nations were given to Idolatry, and to serve and Worship strange Gods, as <hi>Baal, Ashtaroth, Chemosh, Rimphan,</hi> and many others, as the Gods of <hi>Samaria,</hi> which were said to be according to the number of their Cities, and their Idols were called the Sin of <hi>Samaria; Amos</hi> saith, <hi>They Swear by the Sin of</hi> Samaria, <hi>that did say, thy God O</hi> Dan <hi>lives; and the manner of</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba <hi>lives, even they shall fall and never rise again, Amos</hi> 7.14. Which was no other then the <hi>Calves</hi> which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> set up at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> which they feared, Worshipped and Swore by; therefore God having chosen a peculiar People to himself to Worship and serve him, and honour him, who should not walk after the manner of the rest of the Nations who knew not God; he commanded them to serve him, and Worship him, and Swear by his Name, as <hi>Jerome</hi> saith well, to keep them from Idolatry, and that they should not Swear by the Gods of the Heathen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the rest of the Nations did round about; yet still this must be considered that this State of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, wherein God gave them Ordinances suitable to their State, but it doth not follow, neither can it be reasonably conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that these Ordinances were to be perpetually binding unto all future Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially when Christ the Seed un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o whom all the Promises are, in whom the Law is fulfilled, and in whom the former Ministrations end, that his Disciples and true Christians should always be bound to these things once commanded, especially seeing Christ their Master, in whom the Father is well pleased hath prohibited this about Swearing, and also did Prophesie of the time to come after his Resurrection and his Ascension, that those Visible things which were as a Ministration for a time, should end as to the outward exercise and Typical and Figurative appearance of them, and that all these things should be revealed within by the Spirit and felt in
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:40634:368"/>
the Power of God in all that did believe, when the Holy Ghost should be poured forth, and the Promise of the Father be made manifest. Fifthly, Now considering that the Name of God is believed in, and he is confessed unto, and his Christ, and that there is not that Idolatry (especially out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) as there was in the Nations before and after the Flood, especially in that which is called <hi>Christendom,</hi> though we dare not conclude that all are <hi>Israel</hi> that are of <hi>Israel,</hi> or that all are Christians that have the Name, yet generally I say, the Name of God and his Christ is acknowledged and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, and not Idols and false God's; therefore there is no necessity of Swearing by the Name of God, as there was at the time of the giving forth of the Law, but especially among them that the Father will reckon as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his subjects and Disciples of Christ, who are partakers of his divine Nature, here is not that necessity among them, for they through the Law being dead to it, it hath no more Power over them; and therefore no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that they should be kept as under Tutors and Governours, seeing that the Age and Ages is come, which the Apostle spoke of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7. <hi>wherein Christ is revealed the hope of Glory, and whom he makes free are free indeed, Joh.</hi> 8.32, 36.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and lastly, The command of Oaths was given for the ending of Strife and Controversies among Men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. which hath relation to the Law, and to the State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Political proceedings, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle brings but that in as an instance or an example, and it is but <hi>A. S.</hi> his Groundless supposition that it seems it was used in the Apostles time, the Apostle speaking of an Oath only as among Men, and not of Saints, who as concerning Strife the occasion of Swearing, and consequently concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Swearing should not walk as Men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. but A. S. should consider this as every one ought, that when men that have been once in Strife and Contention, and Variance, come once into Christ, and to be in him New Creatures, (Christians) to walk no more as Carnal, not as Men, but as men of God, and as spiritual, and as true Saints and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they come both out of Strife and Swearing, which was added to end Strife; and whatever A. S. may conclude, we say these and divers more are great and weighty Reasons wherefore Christ did prohibit all Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and puts it out of use and date, and no necessity of it as among true Christians, seeing that every true saying or Testimony is equivalent with an Oath.</p>
                  <p>His ninth Argument is, <hi>That either these Words Swear not at all must not be extended to a total prohibition of Swearing, or else Christ thereby gave a new moral command; but Christ gave no new moral command, for that had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God's express will, thou shalt not add unto the word which I command; and besides he ordained no new Law in the matter of the</hi> 6<hi>th. and</hi> 7<hi>th. Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and shall we think that he who vindicated the other Commandments from the leud depravations of Men, hath abrogated this only, as though it had not been framed by the same Wisdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and acted by the same God? and further, Christ's op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is only against the Pharisaical Mis-interpretations of the Law, and if only so, then Christ did not forbid such Oaths as were lawfully before enjoyned.</hi>

Christ commanded that which the Law had not spoken of and not only a further thing, but another thing, <hi>But I say unto you that ye resist not ill, but whoever shall smite thee on the right Cheek turn to him the other also,</hi> ver. 40, 41. <hi>And if a Man sue thee at Law, and take away thy Coat, let him have thy Cloak also</hi>; where said the Law this, <hi>And whosoever shall compel thee to go a Mile, go with him twain</hi>; where did ever the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> command this? and though the Law said, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine Enemy</hi>; which he saith, <hi>was but a Pharisaical innovation,</hi> which if it be, I query of A. S. where in the Law it is written, <hi>Love thine Enemy?</hi> and as was said before, whether did not <hi>Israel</hi> fight with their Enemies, and kill them, and destroy them, and whether they had not a command so to do, yea or nay? as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.24. <hi>chap.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.23, 24.25. <hi>Josh.</hi> 10.19, 23. And whether this be not another thing that Christ saith, <hi>ver.</hi> 44. <hi>But I say unto you, love your Enemies, bless them that Curse you, do good to them that hate you, &amp;c.</hi> But it is manifest that in the second Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel that a more Evangelical and exact obedience then was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in the Letter of the Law, which so far as it was Typical, was only a Temporary dispensation; for as I said before the Letter of the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> permitted to be avenged on Enemies, <hi>Egyptians, Amalekites, &amp;c.</hi> And I hope that <hi>A. S.</hi> will not conclude that they killed them in love to them, and they might be avenged and take an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, whose Gospel in other points which the Law had not said forbids and condemns rash, anger, Lust after Women, Polygamie, divorce, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for Fornication, and yet it was indulged and connived at as under the Law, yet the Lord saith, by the Prophet <hi>Malachy, Mal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>He hateth putting away</hi>; while the Letter condemned no more but actual murder, and Adultery, indulging and conniving Polygamie and divorce: And though under the Law, Stripe for Stripe, Wound for Wound was permitted; but under the Gospel resist not Evil, avenge not, forbear, forgive, for the whole Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was given by the dispensation of Angels in the Hand of that Mediator for a time; and so some Swearing and such Swearing as even by God, was used in order to end Strife, where it was yet standing, yet Christ the Mediator of a better Covenant, in whose Hand the Law is now unto all Christians, he forbad not only that which the Law allowed, and indulged, connived at and commanded in divers things, as is manifest in this fifth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he prohibits all Swearing; so that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Christ doth not only reprove the false glos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And though <hi>A.

S. will call this, whether a new moral command, or promulgation of a new Law I know not, but it is evident enough that some things were prohibited by Christ, which the Law commanded, or at least allowed, and therefore we conclude from the 23. and 24. Verses of the 5th. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> that Christ did prohibit all vain Swearing and unlawful Swearing, which was disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed before under the Law, but even all Swearing which was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or at least permitted under the Law, for the reasons and ends given before, and this will stand as Truth, notwithstanding A.

S. goes on, <hi>It was enough that Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed not to Swear, and the sum of all or the most that he can make when he hath twined about with many Circumstances to prove that he did Swear or consented to Caiaph is adjuring,</hi> and answered his adjuring, this is all, <hi>I am,</hi> and <hi>thou hast said</hi>; and therefore what either may or can be said A. S. hath concluded Christ did Swear; &amp; yet Sect. 27. he tell us, that the essence of Swearing is in <hi>calling God to Witness,</hi> and how or where did Christ call God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? then this overturns his own Argument, seeing we do not read that Christ saied any more in his answer, then as is aforesaid, <hi>I am,</hi> and <hi>thou hast said</hi>; and he sayes, <hi>To alledge that Christ Swear not, because he laid not his Hand upon a Book or kissed, or lifted up his Hand is but to trifle,</hi> yet he says, <hi>that Ceremony is Ancient,</hi> as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tells him, that it's above 1250. years since; if it be but to trifle, why are so many Conscientious People in bonds this day in England, under a Premunire for these trifles? a very shame to Christianity; for where any or all of these have been denyed, though they have answered the Truth, and the whole Truth, and as much as A. S. calls an Oath, yet this hath been counted insufficient, and we know <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi> the Emperour, ordain'd the Ceremony, <hi>that Men should Swearly the Gospel or Book, and lay their hands thereon and kiss,</hi> or the like; <hi>and though it be so many Years since it was ordained,</hi> as A. S. sayes, this adds nothing to the warrantableness thereof, but Custome is proof enough to such a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Age as this, when Formalities, Ceremonies, Gestures and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures are more regarded then the power of God and Godliness; and we say such a Ceremony about Swearing is not without the Appearance of evil; for the Bible is a Creature, made up of many Creatures, and laying the Hand, and kissing, and ordering it in such manner is I know looked upon by many to be Swearing by it, and so the most takes it, and this were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:40634:370"/>
and therefore better to be wholely avoided then so many suffer because thy cannot do it, besides as I said, the evil appearance of it; for it is not any Gospel Institution, but an innovation since the Apostacy entred in; and if God had ever judged any necessity thereof, or that it had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred an Oath more solemn, the Law would have said something of it, and it was never a practice among the Primitive Christians, and therefore a vain Humane tradition crept in since, which ought to be avoided; and and though A.S. says, to reply that Christ Swore not, (though <hi>Caiaphas</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him is vain) for an examinate is to answer both in matter and Form, according to what is proposed; I say it's A. S. his vain supposition and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption without Ground so to judge that Christ Swore, I say sometime he held his Peace, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of him before, that he should be as a Lamb dumb before the Shearer, as sometime he was, both to the chief Priests and Elders, to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and to <hi>Herod,</hi> which were all in some Authority, and sometime he answered them in the Wisdom of God, and sometime he spoke and bore witness to that, and Prophesied unto them, which was not at all either as to the matter or form of the high Priests adjuring, for the very next Words. <hi>(but thou hast said) nevertheless I say unto you, hereafter shall you see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven) Mat.</hi> 26.64. and therefore these show A. S. his Argument to be frivolous and vain; and <hi>Mark</hi> saith, <hi>the chief Priests accused him of many things, Mark</hi> 15.3. but he answered nothing either to their accusations, or took notice of the high Priests adjuring to answer him in matter and form, as A. S. would have it, neither did he look upon himself so oblig'd, but answered sometime, and spoke the Truth alwayes when he spoke, and that which alwayes displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and dissatisfied the <hi>Jews</hi> when he answered, and for ought can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by his arguing that every Examinate is to answer directly to every matter and form to any that pretends Power to administer an Oath, or to adjure, he goes about to establish the Popes Inquisition, and create matter, as sometime they did here in <hi>England,</hi> in the height of the Popes domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forged matter out of their own wicked Hearts to ensnare the Lambs of Christ, and then to require them to Swear that they might destroy them and accuse them out of their own Mouths, even as the high Priest sought to destroy Christ and to ensnare him, which methinks A. S. hath said too much in Vindication of his adjuring, and will needs have Christ to be of his mind, and at last concludes that Christ Swore, but its but upon his own presumption and supposition, and is more then ever he is able to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from what is written. And A. S. tells us over and over again, <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was a part of God's Worship, wherein God's wisdom, Power, and justice is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,</hi> and then incommunicable to any Creature or false God, as is answered before, so was Circumcision then, and the Oblations, and Burnt Sacrifice, and Offerings, and new Moons to be performed only to the Lord, and were peculiarly to be performed unto God, and not communicable to any Creature; and we say and prove, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13.10.20. that these were a part of the service and Worship of God, and which as we shall grant that an Oath under the Law was commanded as well as these Services, or in his own terms an Oath was equally commanded with his Service as is proved above; In this he hath no Adversary; but what doth this prove in respect
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:40634:371"/>
of his Argument which makes it more (then equally commanded) for he will yield that these services were but temporary, but Swearing is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and so he hath given it a priority above the rest, his Argument all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long hath been chiefly drawn from the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, that it was joyned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with Fear and Service under the Law, and so hath striven without an Adversary, but now it must needs be above the service of God then, and yet from the same command he would only prove it, for he hath no better strength nor Ground; and we may as well alledge as he doth, and say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to this sort of Service that was commanded by the Lord as well as Swearing, for God hath joyned them together in the Text above said, and obligeth equality at all times, as well under the Gospel as under the Law; yet then A. S. would call this absurd if it be so as it is indeed, then we may as well conclude the other absurd, because one is standing as well as the other, and binding as well as the other by the vertue of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, although he tells us that an Oath in its Substance hath not any Type at all, so we say; for the substance is Christ, the Oath of God, in whom all the Promises and Oaths are fulfilled, and this is its substance; but as under the Law it was a Type of the Substance, and not the substance it self, and that Circumcision, the Passover, and the legal Offerings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law had as much goodness in them as Oaths had, what-ever A. S. sayes: and served to as good ends and purposes in that Ministration as they were ordained, and conduced as much to the Glory of God, and were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to, but not against the morality of the Gospel; for the shadows were not against the substance, nor the Ceremonials against the Morals, though the Apostle says, <hi>the Law is not of Faith,</hi> yet not against it, for as ministerial as the Ordinances of the Law were to the Gospel then, yet the Gospel may be and now is without it.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude this Argument, <hi>A. S. Were it so indeed that Oaths were Ceremonial, then it follows that Christ in this Text did not forbid them; for he did not forbid the Ceremonial Law, but observed it all his Life, eating the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over with his Disciples the Night before his Death, unless some would Interpret his Words,</hi> (I command you that you do not Swear) yet I am content for a Year or two you may Swear by Heaven or Earth as you have been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed, but after my Crucifixion and Resurrection Swear no more, <hi>and there let these that disallow Swearing as a part of the Ceremonial Law, Argue no more the unlawfulness of Swearing from these Words</hi> (Swear not at all.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Though Christ did observe the Ordinances of the Law, as being that Ministration appointed by God until the time of Reformation and the bringing in of a better Hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. It became him to fulfill all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, so was he Circumcised, and eat the Passover, and was Baptized, washed the Disciples Feet, which were not enjoyned by the Law, (though not against it) and that Ministration not fully ended, though he see it must end, and spoke of a further thing, and of the time then, and also it should be ministred more afterward after his Resurrection, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>The time cometh and now is, neither at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>nor this Mountain, but they that Worship the Father shall worship him in Spirit and Truth</hi>; so that he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of the end of all those things, and of the cessation of them, which were sometime commanded, respecting both the place and the Worship,
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:40634:371"/>
and to them that did believe the Disciples, unto whom it'was given to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, (then was the time) to them it was come, even (then) before Christ suffered; and therefore A. S. his Consequence is not true (that Christ did not forbid all Swearing from this Text) and though he had both Prophesied of a clearer Ministration, and laid down in Doctrine a more Evangelical precept then the Law, yea, and more strict obedience, yet notwithstanding many did still hold up these things, which the Law commanded, though they believed well of Christ, yea, after his Suffering and Resurrection, and that a long time, though that the Apostles told them the Substance was come, and that there was no more Offering for Sin, nor Oblations, neither legal Observations to be minded any more, yet still many observed them, and doubtless as to that formal Swearing that was among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that vain Swearing too many did continue in it afterward notwithstanding Christ's command, but then not submitting, made not his command void in it self, and there is no necessity to make such an absurd Interpretation as that he permitted them to Swear for a Year or two, by Heaven and Earth, and then at his passion to Swear no more, for after he gave forth the command there was no Permission, and yet afterward, as I said, the Apostles declared against the Shadows, and preached up the Substance, and as A. S. confesseth the types ceased of themselves, but let him know there was a time of Dying to them, and they ceased not all at once to them that had observed the Law, neither were the Mysteries revealed all at once, but as they grew in Faith and Knowledge, for the Righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith, and though the legal Observations were observed in Christ's time, so were they after, by many, but by right ended in the substance, and when he was come, though many did not see it till afterward: But I come to his 11th.

<pb n="708" facs="tcp:40634:372"/>
the Gospel is the Law revealed</hi>; and what was Prophesied and typified in the first is fulfilled in the latter; but what shall be thought of them, that hold up the Types and Figures of the first, as though they were not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or as though the Promise was not come, and he made manifest in whom all Shadows end? and though God be unchangeable in himself, and incapable of falshood or alteration, and I know none who denyes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of his word, or the immutability of the most high: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I cannot set up the changeable Priesthood, and Covenant, and the Ordinances belonging thereunto, against the unchangeable and everlasting Priesthood and Covenant, and as hath been said before, as though that all the precepts therein were so unalterable, as that of necessity they must needs continue, as obligatory to Generations, I might truss up together many Scriptures, and thwack them one on the Back of another, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Jews</hi> and the first Covenant most properly (till the Seed Christ was revealed, and offered up) and I might bring in Scripture to prove, that many things were commanded by the immutable God, and by him who is uncapable of alteration, and multiply many words, as A. S. doth to little purpose, and say what was written in the old Testament was by the Inspiration of God, and that his precepts are no more alterable then the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> and therefore they must needs still be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by all Christians to the World's end, or else conclude they that do not are atheistical, and deny God's veracity, and make the Law of God void; and what would all this in arguing prove, nothing at all; the <hi>Jews</hi> will confess as much, and plead as hard as <hi>A. S.</hi> can, who yet have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him of whom the Prophets prophesied, neither have received him who is the Substance of what <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets bore witness, and in whom the Law is fulfilled, and the Promises made good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with, and in whom all the Shadows end, and the vail done away, and all the Worship &amp; precepts belonging thereunto, who hath manifested and revealed the Father in all that believe, who is the new and living way, whose Worship is not now in the Letter, nor in the Shadows, nor Types, nor in any outward Observations, but in Spirit &amp; truth is he worshipped, for he seeketh such to Worship him; for the great Promise of reward was to, as ever was to Swearing; yet when they resisted him whom the Father had sent, all their observances though never so strict did not avail; but their Circumcision became Uncircumcision, and their Worship and service be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Prophaneness, when they despised the substance by whom Grace and Truth came to all the Children of promise: and we grant with <hi>A. S.</hi> that he came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it, and to end both Sin and Transgression, and the Law which was added because of it, and to bring in everlasting Righteousness, and it to rule in the Hearts of all that believe; and against such there is no Law; and though Christ enjoyned the Disciples, <hi>Mat</hi> 23. to observe what the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> bad them, who sate in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Chair and read the Law, and performed those services in part commanded; that was the time before he was offered up, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of that Covenant was not fully ended; yet I hope A. S. with us will grant that they were not to heed them or to obey them in their vain traditions and false glosses, and Interpretations and Evil manners, which he cryed wo against, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13, 14. neither after his Resurrection did
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:40634:372"/>
he enjoyn them to hear the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> neither to observe the Legal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the first Priesthood, but they declared against them and their practice, which continued in the Observation of those things, which did not make perfect as pertaining to the Conscience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9. and for all these Texts he alledges out of the Old Testament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.16. unto these it hath been answered that this proves nothing that Christians under the second Covenant should Swear as they did in the first; for these Precepts were only to keep them from Idolatry: for <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.16. <hi>If you will diligently learn the wayes of my People to Swear by my Name (the Lord liveth) as they taught my People to Swear by</hi> (Baal) <hi>then shall they be Builded in the midst of the People:</hi> And the 6th. of <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.14. is to the same Effect, <hi>You shall fear the Lord and serve him, and Swear by my Name</hi>: And Verse the 14. <hi>Ye shall not go after other Gods.</hi> All these only prove that the Nations went after other Gods, and Sware by them, and served them, and <hi>Israel</hi> too prone to follow their manners did so also, and therefore he gave them these Precepts to serve him, and fear him, and acknowledge him, to keep them from Idolatry, as hath been said, in the state of their Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and weakness, and that before the Seed was revealed; and that which A. S. calls a Prophecy by <hi>Isa.</hi> 19.18. of Christians Swearing under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, it's no such thing, but a Prophesie of <hi>Egypt,</hi> his joyning to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and owning their Worship, and their God, and acknowledge him; <hi>and do Sacrifice and Oblation, yea and vow a vow unto the Lord and perform it, ver.</hi> 21. Which clearly hath relation to the Law and the Worship of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not to the Gospel; so that A. S. might have as well said it was a promise how Christians under the Gospel should offer Sacrifice and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as under the Law, as well as Swear. But the Doctor hath traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed many Paths which are crooked, winding, and turning, to gather something together, and hath fetched it far, to prove Swearing under the Gospel, but all his proof falls short of his matter by much: And that of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 5.23. is a Prophecy of <hi>Israel's</hi> return out of the Captivity of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> in the days of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom the Lord called his Anointed, and shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.28.45. who made a Decree for all <hi>Israel</hi> to go out of <hi>Assyria</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and build their City, and their Temple, and Worship their God according as he had commanded; as may be seen at large in the Book of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and this was fulfilled (then) when they builded the City and the Temple in those days, (long before Christ was manifest in the Flesh) and then did <hi>Israel</hi> return, and every Knee did bow, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tongue did Swear by the Lord, which before the Captivity had not bowed, nor served, nor acknowledged his Name, but Idols which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord, and therefore gave he them into the hand of the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for seventy Years till they were humbled, and then brought them back according to <hi>Jeremiah, Isaiah, Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zachariah's</hi> Prophesies, for this was fulfilled; then is spoken by <hi>Isaiah</hi> in this Prophesie, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24, 25. (without contradiction to Christ's command) and his command entrencheth not upon this prophesie, neither doth this make the Gospel thwart the Law, beyond all terms of Reconciliation, as A. S. vainly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests in his margent, for this Prophesie was fulfilled long before Christ gave forth this command, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> Moreover, if this prophesie have any relation to the state of the Christian Church (as <hi>A. S.</hi> supposes,
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:40634:373"/>
upon what Ground I know not, saving his own affirmation) then we shall consider and see how it is fulfilled under the Gospel, and what the Gospel allows of in this particular; the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> a Minister of the Gospel, not of the Letter, as he saith himself, which some interpret to be the Law, citeth this Prophesie of <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.23. compare it with <hi>Rom.</hi> the 14 <hi>ver.</hi> 11. for it is written (where? in <hi>Isaiah</hi> before cited) <hi>As I live, saith the Lord, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knee shall bow unto me, and every Tongue shall confess to God</hi>; and in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> the 2.10, 11. <hi>That at the Name of Jesus, whom the Father hath sent, whom all is to obey,</hi> unto whom all Power is given in Heaven and Earth; the Apostle citing again the very words of the Prophet says unto him <hi>(viz. Jesus, every Knee shall bow</hi>; and ver. the 11. <hi>and that every Tongue shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to the Glory of God the Father</hi>; so that it cannot be reasonably thought or judged, that if God had required Swearing by his Name among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Apostle thus should alter the words, as to put confessing instead of Swearing, seeing he sayes, he used always plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Speech, for this had not been plainness, and we have better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe the Apostle, unto whom the Gospel was committed, whom the Son was revealed in, who declared the whole Counsel of God, and yet never either commanded or exhorted any to Swear, or reproved them for not Swearing by the Name of God (as the <hi>Jews</hi> did) in all his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that are extant, I say we have better Ground to believe him and his rendering of the words of the Prophet to be according to the mind of Christ, where he puts in confession to the Christians (which before was Swearing to the <hi>Jews</hi>) as being acquainted with the command of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Swear not at all</hi>:) and what-ever <hi>A.

S. yet it is not to us, that some Men were commanded in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament for observing some things, yea, many things, which are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the New, and yet God is not dishonoured, neither the Scripture bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; if we see the end of every command, and the time for which it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Service for which it served, as this about Oaths, hath been sufficiently declared before, to keep the <hi>Jews</hi> from Idolatry, to end Strife among them where it was; (but among true Christians, indeed) Strife is ended, and Peace is come, and they seek it with all Men; and that is done away (for which the Law was added) to wit, <hi>Sin and Transgression, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and Unbelief, and Strife,</hi> and no necessity of them among them; and all the morality that doth remain is confession, or saying, or Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in true words in any matter is that which is equivalent with an Oath, and is that which is the most conform to Christ and the Apostles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, under the Gospel: but I come to his last Argument.</p>
                  <p>Twelfth and last Argument, <hi>The consent of the Christian World, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of</hi> Emperours, Kings, Princes, Councils, Bishops, <hi>and People of all sorts, confirm this Truth that Christ notwithstanding these Words,</hi> (Swear not at all) <hi>had never forbidden Swearing as altogether unlawful; 'Tis true, some of the Fathers in their Homilies, and to the People inveighed much against Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:40634:373"/>
as though it had been altogether unlawful, but it was only against Customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Oaths</hi>; Chrysostome <hi>in his Homily to the People of</hi> Antioch <hi>preached so much against Swearing that the People were offended; he told them, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave that Sermon till they would leave that prophane Custome of Swearing; but the Fathers were less cautelous, but with great Vehemency enveigh'd against common Swearing in ordinary Discourse; but not at all intending to take away necessary Oaths; but</hi> Origen <hi>in his first Book against</hi> Celsus, <hi>God is witness of my Conscience; and</hi> Athanasius <hi>yet vehemently declaimed against prophane Swearing, yet in his Apology to the</hi> Emperour Constantius, <hi>he Sware again and again, the</hi> Lord is witness, <hi>and his</hi> Christ is witness: <hi>All whith clearly shews they did not disallow the voluntary taking an Oath, much less in</hi> Judical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; <hi>and the Reformed Churches, and the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and the whole Catholick Church in all times and places approved this Doctrine, that all Swearing is not unlawful; so that it follows that the Church in all Ages was so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as not to understand Christ's meaning, or so wicked as to Teach and Practise quite contrary, or else Christ never meant to forbid all kind of Swearing, (to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the former) were to profess all that went before either Dunces or Devils.</hi>

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Whatever A. S. concludes &amp; thinks, he hath not such a consent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians, as he makes a great flourish of; it's manifest by what hath been said, Christ prohibited it amongst his Disciples, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>; and likewise <hi>James</hi> the Apostle agrees in the same Doctrine, and the rest of the Apostles, also all the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> were esteemed so strict, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, and cautious of their asserting, or promising, that there was no need of an Oath among them, they kept up the sactity, credit of their Poses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, yea, among Unbelievers, that it was security enough in all cases to say, <hi>Christianus sum,</hi> I am a Christian, as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> asserts; and if they were urged any further to any Oath, for matter or manner, they repeated this as the only satisfaction they could give, there needed no more then the Veracity of their bare record; and thus much Bishop <hi>Gauden</hi> confesseth, and also in the 36. page of his Book he says, <hi>The Ground or Foundation for Swearing now is the Wickedness and unbelief of Men</hi>; but Christians (truly such) are brought out of Evil and Wickedness, Unbelief and Distrust, and there is no necessity among them either publick or private to Swear at all: <hi>Polibus</hi> observes, in the better and simpler Ages of the World, <hi>Oaths were seldom used in Judicatures, but after Unbelief and Lying increased, Oaths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,</hi> as a only remedy to cure and restrain those Evils: (but let it not be said that those are Christians that name Christ's Name and depart not from Iniquity) and since the perilous times came on that the Apostle spoke, that Men would not abide sound Doctrine but be lovers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that should have a Form of godliness and deny the Power thereof; such went out of the Truth, and went into the World, and the world went after them, and the false Church began to rise to dignity, and have the Name of Christian, though she consented not to the <hi>wholsome Doctrine of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Swear not at all,</hi> but perverted this, as she hath done many other Doctrines, and beguiled thc <hi>Kings of the Earth, and held out her Golden Cup of Fornication,</hi> and made Emperours, Kings, and Princes drunk with her Fornication, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.18. Councils, Bishops and People Err in their Judgments, &amp; by Tradition one Age after another have holden that lawful which Christ did not prohibit; but what doth all
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:40634:374"/>
this prove, for it's manifest that most of the Ancient Fathers of the Church as <hi>Origen, Chrysostome, Theophilact, Hillary, Athanasius, Jerome, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, Laurentius,</hi> and others in their Sermons and Homilies to the People, vehemontly and frequently enveighed against all Swearing without any Limitation, without any reserve amongst Christians Swearing as to private Conversation, yet they did not disallow the voluntary taking an Oath, much less in <hi>Judicature</hi> he says; but those are but therms of his own shuffling in, and what he speaks only of his own Head, by mingling his own words with theirs, for his own ends, for there is no such distinction made by them, as he makes, as lawful Swearing and prophane Swearing, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Swearing, and Swearing in <hi>Judicature</hi>; and it's to be desired that A. S. had but produced their Testimonies, and have cited only their own Words without adding to them, that they would have made much against him, for it's plain their Judgment and Witness was against all Swearing what-ever. But A. S. tells us, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his Homily to the People of <hi>Antioch</hi> preached so much against that prophane custome of Swearing, that the People were offended, and he told them that he would never leave that Sermon till they did leave Swearing; It were to be desired that more in this Age who pretend to be Christian Ministers would follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, for the like I believe hath not been in any Age; Oh! what custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, vain, rash, prophane, ungodly Oaths (in their Acceptation) take God's holy Name upon every trivial Occasion in vain in their Mouthes, and daily inventing new Oaths and Execrations, even daring God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them and damn them; yea, it grieves my Heart to think, and the Spirit of the Lord in me to consider what sounded in my Ears not long since, which I mention with Detestation and Abhorrency, that some when they had sworn even all the customary Oaths, and all the new invented Oaths, did proffer ten Shillings to any that could invent ten new Oaths, even glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in Sin, and making a Mock at it; and indeed it is fearful to hear, how without any Reverence unto God, or Dread of his Majesty, Oaths, these late Years, are broke out like a Land-flood over all the Banks; and no where so much to be found, nor no where so common as among them that reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves conformable Men (Loyal) and Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is one crying Sin, that draws down the Judgment of God upon this Land; and what Credit can we give to such Men in Judicature? shall we not say as St. <hi>Austin</hi> sayes, <hi>It disposes Men to false Swearing and gross Perjury, nor can indeed much Credit be given any more then to a Lyar to any Man that swears never so solemnly, and in Judicature, who is a common Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>; but instead of beating down that for which the Land mourns, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 10. many are even Propagators of it, and Pladers for it, and glory in it, and it's become almost the only Mark of a conformable Man: Oh what a sad Time are we fallen into, and what a sad State, that they that depart from this great Iniquity are become a Prey; I say, it had been more time for <hi>A. S.</hi> to have used his utmost Endeavours this Way, rather then to have opposed Christ's Doctrine, and added Affliction to the Bonds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Sufferers, who dare neither swear nor lye.</p>
                  <p>But not to disgress, A. S. he would make the Fathers, as he doth with Christ and the Apostles, he would make all dance after his Pipe, and make them all of his Mind, and construe and interpret all their Words unto his

End, though never intended, and therefore he sayes, they were not cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous enough, and so doth with them as he doth with Christ, he makes their Words one Thing and their Intentions another; <hi>though</hi> (saith he) Origen <hi>in his</hi> 25th Tract upon Mat. <hi>sayes, that Christ did forbid all Swearing; yet he himself swears in his Book against</hi> Celsus, <hi>for he said,</hi> God is Witness of my Conscience; <hi>and</hi> Athanasius <hi>though he declaimed against Swearing, yet in his Apology to</hi> Constantius <hi>he swears again and again</hi>; and why? he wrote as the Apostle did, <hi>the Lord is Witness,</hi> and <hi>Christ to Witness,</hi> and these must needs be Oaths, and voluntary Oaths; it's not probable that they should use voluntary Oaths, when they declaimed against all Oaths; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Origen</hi> saith, <hi>It behoves not a Man who lives according to the Gospel to swear at all</hi>; and <hi>Jerome, the Gospel Truth admits not of an Oath</hi>; likewise <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> who was Bishop of Constantinople (in Commendations of whom much is said in the Ecclesiastical Histories, <hi>Acts and Monument vol.</hi> 21. <hi>fol.</hi> 72.) blames them greatly who bring forth a Book to swear upon, charging the Clerks, that in no wise they constrain any Body to swear, whether they think a Man swear true or false, saying, <hi>it's a Sin to swear well</hi>; so that not only Swearing upon a Book was reprehended, but even all Swearing, such as A.

marginal Notes, that the Ministers who are inferiour in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvania</hi> swear Canonical Obedience to their Bishops, or the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> or the Confessions of <hi>Helvetia, Basil,</hi> or others whom he calls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? what of all this? what doth this prove from the Scripture of Truth; or as to the Convincement of them who hold it unlawful to swear under the Gospel, because Christ hath prohibited it by his Doctrine? what is all that A.S. hath said in his Arguments to Dissenters Satisfaction? who know Hundreds of Things wherein as much as they fall out and fight even to Blood with each other about their fancied Formalities, they all agree in against the Light and Power of Godliness, and against the very Appearance of the Image of him in his Holiness, who is the substantial Truth it self, we say, what is all this to some, that dissent from A. S. his Judgment, and others he calls reformed, whose Faith stands higher then the Wisdom and Thoughts of Men, who cannot consent so as to lead their Faith and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son captive after them, to try this or any other Truth, seeing it is the Gift of God, and the Inspiration of the Almighty gives Understanding; and though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and you agree in this, though you damn one another in other Matters, what is this to us? It shews only they erred from the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, &amp; you in this and many other Things are not separated from them; and thy Conclusion which thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordest with is false, that though God in the old Testament commanded it, yet it doth not follow that Christ in the new did not forbid it (neither that Christ and his Apostles practised it) who were under another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and for ought can be perceived by A. S. by that he calls voluntary Swearing, which he hath no Ground for, though in other Places he seems to condemn vain Swearing and customary Oaths, yet in this he looks not like himself, but seems to tolerate a kind of Oaths we find no mention made of in the new Testament, and yet we shall not conclude, as A. S. sayes, that all were so ignorant as not to understand Christ's Mind, nor so wicked as to teach the quite contrary to his Mind; for it is manifest many have been of the Mind of Christ in former Ages and latter, though we shall never strive to bring in all the World, or the <hi>Heathen,</hi> or Nations that became as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after the Publication of the Gospel, nor that Rabble which he calls the Christian World, which hath wondred after the Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.4. and yet there hath been still some Testimony born through Ages unto the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ; and Christ's Doctrine stands in Force; and in that Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that he intended it, notwithstanding A.S. his Reasons and Arguments and many more, as to forbid all Oaths in the second Covenant to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (truly such) in these Words, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> Many Instances might be brought of particular Bishops, as <hi>Otha</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bamberg</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Basilius</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> who refused to swear; and though A. S. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not trace it beyond <hi>Pelagius</hi> or <hi>Manicheus,</hi> yet we know that both Christ and the Apostles confirm it; and also the <hi>Esseans</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> did refuse to swear at all, even in Judicature; for <hi>Josephus</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> saith of them, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they say is as firm as an Oath, and so swear among them was counted a Thing superfluous; likewise</hi> St <hi>Basil</hi> commends <hi>Chinas</hi> a famous <hi>Greek,</hi> that he suffered a Fine of three Talents, rather then he would save it by Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the Loss of his Honour; and shall <hi>Christians</hi> (truly such) with whom Truth abideth, and in whom it dwelleth, come short of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:40634:375"/>
that was among some of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the best and most virtuous of them called <hi>Heathen</hi>; shall not this kind of <hi>Christianity</hi> which is professed in this Day, who are in Unbelief, Frauds, Infirmities, Contentions be condemned by these? shall not this Circumcision become Uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? and shall not they that fear to swear, and deny all Oaths be set above this, whose Yea is Yea and Nay Nay in all their Communication, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto Christ's Doctrine? shall not this inherit the Promise? and is not this more Gospel-like, to say, speak, testifie &amp; do the Truth, rather then to go back to <hi>Judaism,</hi> or into Contention, Strife, Emulation and Distrusts that the Swearers are in (falsly reputed Christians) and yet abide not in his Doctrine? But having done with A.S. his negative Part, I come to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Part, which is no other then hath been answered over and over again, yet he thinks he hath said more in clearing of it then others have said, that Christ only forbad Swearing by Creatures, and that indeed is the Sum of his affirmative Discourse, and the Pharisees Interpretation; and he brings the Judgment of divers Expositors upon this Text; <hi>First,</hi> promisary Oaths are here chiefly forbidden; <hi>2dly,</hi> Others think that Christ here forbad such Oaths as then were used in common Discourse; <hi>3dly,</hi> others say that prophane, false, rash and vain Oaths are generally here prohibited; <hi>4thly,</hi> Many understand that by these Words of Christ all Swearing by Creatures is forbidden, but not that by God himself, and last of all A.S. gives his Thoughts, which are as follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Christ did not forbid what the Law had commanded, but only the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical corrupt Glosses thereon, and the irreligious Practices of the mis-informed</hi> Jews (and cites Origen and <hi>Chrysostome</hi> who say upon this Place, <hi>they were accustomed to swear by Heaven and by Creatures</hi>) and A. S. further sayes, <hi>The Pharisees taught them to affirm whatever they had promised, swearing by God; they under a specious Pretention, that they would not take God's Name in vain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a slight Occasion, fell to swear by Creatures, which</hi> Grotius <hi>shows out of</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Judeus, <hi>which the</hi> Pharisees <hi>did not disallow, the easier thereby to delude such credulous People as believed those Oaths which themselves neither thought obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, nor meant to keep; and it's certain the Scribes and Pharisees taught the People, that to swear by several Creatures, as by the Temple and Altar was not binding, Christ reproves them as blind Guides upon that Account,</hi> Mat. 23.16. <hi>and further they taught, it was Perjury indeed to break an Oath if a Man had sworn by God, but not if he had only sworn by Creatures; in Exposition of which Christ forbids all Swearing by Creatures, and teacheth c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ntrary to the</hi> Jews <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, that such Oaths ought not to be taken, yet being taken are binding in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Creatures Relation to the Creator, and Christ reckons them among sinful Oaths, and teacheth them to use only bare Affirmations or Denyals in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:</hi> And this is the very Sum of his Judgment; and the Words of Christ are only to be limitted to this Sense and no further, that is, <hi>not to swear at all by Creatures in their mutual Converse or Communications</hi>; and this he hath repeated over and over in his Book, and this is the furthest lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that he will allow unto Christ's Prohibition, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>; and this Interpretation before-mentioned he looks upon to be the genuine meaning thereof, and is the Judgment of Doctor <hi>Gauden</hi> also, who hath contended as hard for some Swearing as A. S. hath; and I perceive that A. S. hath read the Answer to Bishop <hi>Gauden,</hi> published by that precious
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:40634:376"/>
Servant of the Lord <hi>Samuel Fisher,</hi> who finished his Life in Bonds for the Gospel-Truth against all Swearing, whose Answer stands firm, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative Arguments of Force, and are yet unanswered, though A. S. hath a little here and there carped at, and hath bitten at the Heel, but hath not made void at all his Answer, which will live as a living Testimony in Generations to come, as consonant unto Christ's Doctrine, wherein he prohibits all Oaths under the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> Though there be some Truth in the different Authors that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and also in A.S. his Words, that swearing by Creatures, as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Earth, <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and vain Oaths, is forbidden, and customary Oaths, and the corrupt Glosses of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and the false Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet all this comes short of Christ's mind, and of the true genuine sense of the words &amp; the scope of Christ's Sermon as is manifest in the Chapter, and in his Testament, and all he hath said will not help him to carry on that Work he hath undertaken, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Justification of any, or the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of any Swearing, or the defence of that limited sense, he would put upon the Universal terms in the 2. Texts, wherein Christ and the Apostle forbids all Swearing: And though A. S. often tells us, Christ did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid what the Law had commanded, neither gave any new positive Law before his Death; he sure hath forgot himself much; what will become of the two great Ordinances still upheld, as <hi>Baptism,</hi> and breaking of <hi>Bread</hi>? and whether was this a new Institution of Christ, or was it an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in the Law? and if it was an Institution of Christ (as the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth hold) and not of the Law, nor of <hi>Moses,</hi> (as indeed it was not) then A. S. his Argument is fallen to the Ground, that he gave no new Commandment, neither instituted any new Ordinance? and then what is become of these two great Mysteries as they have been called? but he hath ravelled out and spun out his Threed so long, that he often runs off his Legs; and though A. S. does often urge, that he came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it; and therefore hath said falsly, that Christ Sware be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the High Priest after he had given forth this Commandment, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> which if it had been true it had been no more president for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians then eating the Passeover; and though he sometimes urge that such Oaths as were commanded under the Law are not forbidden by that Text <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.38. because it was spoken sometime before his Death, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the first Covenant was not ended till his death; and therefore he concludes, <hi>That all Oaths would not be forbidden by Christ in this Text,</hi> for saith he, <hi>Christ did not forbid what the Law commanded</hi>; but though this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition was given out before his Death, yet with reference <hi>to the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after his Death</hi>: It is evident by the Texts before it and behind it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of divorce and of deportment towards injurious Ones and Enemies so in this of Oaths Christ prohibites and condemns not only those gross Abuses of those things that they had a Dispensation for under the Law, and that by Divine indulgency, which abuses crept in by the Pharisaical false Glosses, too much loosing the meaning of God's Law by <hi>Moses</hi> by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved examples or popular Customes; but Christ <hi>condemned and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted those very things,</hi> which in regard of the hardness of their Hearts, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust and wicked Cruelties, <hi>God himself in that very Letter of the Law indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them</hi> in, and gave them both a <hi>dispensation,</hi> and a precept for, <hi>in the
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:40634:376"/>
Law</hi>; for the Law said of <hi>old time,</hi> before the false gloss of <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> came in some things; so <hi>as it was not said from the beginning,</hi> when Man was in Innocency, and was merciful as his Heavenly Father was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and the Law said, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.12. <hi>whosoever shall put away his wise let him give her a Bill of divorcement, &amp; then she may go &amp; be another man's Wife; but I say whose putteth away his Wife, causeth her to commit Abultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth Adultery, Mat.</hi> 5.32. So that not only the corrupt Glosses and irregular Practices of the mis-informed <hi>Jews</hi> are forbidden; but even that which the <hi>Law not only permitted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and dispensed with, but commanded, is for bidden</hi>; (and another thing injoyned) and in cause of injury as he hath done, so shall it be done unto him: ye have heard it hath been said, <hi>an Eye for an eye, and a Tooth for a tooth, this was the Law,</hi> Exod. 21.44. Levit. 24.20. Deut. 19.20. and this was commanded: But Christ saith, <hi>I say unto you that ye resist not Evil, whosoever shall smite thee on the one Cheek turn the other also, and if a Man sue thee at Law and take away thy Coat, let him have thy Cloak also, and whosoever shall compell thee to go a mile go with him twain, Mat.</hi> 5.39, 40, 41. So here is not only a further thing, but even <hi>another thing commanded</hi> by Christ. Further, the Law said, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.14. <hi>thou shalt not commit Adultery</hi>; but Christ the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God saith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.28. <hi>whosoever looketh upon a Woman and lusteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her, hath committed Adultery with her in his Heart,</hi> again, <hi>ye have heard that it hath been said that thou love thy Neighbour and hate thy Enemy,</hi> though A. S. sayes, <hi>That is not found in the Law, but a corrupt Gloss of the Pharisees</hi>; I say that is found which amounts to as much, as hath been shewed: for the <hi>Jews</hi> that were of the Law, might and did spoyle their Enemies, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Amalekites, and had a command so to do, and kill them, and Root them out,</hi> and yet to help his Enemies Oxe or Asse under a burthen, if he were belonging to a <hi>Jew</hi> that personally hated him, and not an <hi>Amalekite</hi> one of that cursed race; but this is a ridle to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; <hi>But I say unto you love your Enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despightfully use you and Persecute you, Mat.</hi> 5.44. and the Apostle exhorted, give no offence to <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> so that his Doctrine went <hi>beyond the Law, put up, pass by, forgive, forbear</hi>; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, you have heard it hath been said of old time (where?) <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33. <hi>Thou shalt not forswear thy self, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine Oathes, but I say unto you,</hi> Swear not at all, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Heaven for it is God's Throne, nor by the Earth for it is his Foot stoole, neither by</hi> Jerusalem <hi>for it is the City of the great King, neither shalt thou Sweare by thy Head, because thou cannot make one hair white or black, but let your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by Yea, yea, and Nay, nay, for whatsoever is more then these cometh of Evil</hi>: It's most evident that Christ prohibits <hi>somewhat more here</hi> then was forbidden under the Law, yea, what ever Oaths were lawful under the Law, therefore it must be <hi>all Swearing</hi> at all, or else <hi>none at all,</hi> either all such Swearing as was used lawfully, and allowed as a Type for a time, in the Law, Oaths made <hi>lawfully and acceptably to God,</hi> or else <hi>nothing more at all then what was forbidden in the Law: for all false Swearing and forswear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all Swearing by Creatures, or breaking of solemn Oaths,</hi> made as unto God, were forbidden in and by the Law; therefore Swearing it self is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden or nothing: but saith A. S. <hi>The grand objection falls of it self,</hi> which
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:40634:377"/>
is either all kind of Swearing is forbidden, or else Christ forbids nothing which was not forbidden before, <hi>which is utterly improbable, saith he</hi>; and he grants that God had formerly prohibited all false and vain Oaths, <hi>and all Swearing by Creatures,</hi> saith he, which I grant to be true, then how is the grand Objection fallen, for is not <hi>Heaven, Earth,</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>the Head, Creatures</hi>; and this is the most that A. S. and divers others affirm, that it is only <hi>Oaths by Creatures,</hi> such as before mentioned that Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibits: and vain Oaths, and Swearing by Creatures, A. S. sayes, <hi>Christ reckons among sinful Oaths</hi>; then if so, as they are indeed, had not the Law forbidden this before, in general terms, wherein <hi>all Creatures are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi>? therefore the reason stands still in force, and the Objection, that either Christ <hi>forbad all Swearing,</hi> or else he forbids <hi>nothing but what the Law had forbidden before</hi>: It's manifest it stands still in force, for Christ forbad even those Oathes the Law required, and all vain Swearing, and Swearing by Creatures, and all Swearing whatsoever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Ye have heard it hath been said by them of old time,</hi> not of late by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> only putting their false Glosses on the Law, as A. S. intimates <hi>Pareus</hi> and others, in his Annotations, and hence conjectures, that by them of old time is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant, the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> and not <hi>Moses</hi> and the Law, and of old time must be meant (a good while ago) or not very long, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators understand it, less then (twenty Years) and thus he twists and twines to make the true sense of <hi>Christ's words void:</hi> it's evident of them of old time, is <hi>Moses</hi> time, the place before cited, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.2. is the place Christ alludes to, you have heard it said thou shalt not forswear thy self; so saith the Law in forty places, but perform unto the Lord thine Oaths, <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not all</hi>; no not by <hi>any Oath at all,</hi> note the opposition in the particle [but] which is between the <hi>old, lawful legal, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and no Swearing at all, not between no Swearing, and such prophane Swearing as was unlawful <hi>under the Law</hi>: the whole sum is this, the Law said, <hi>break no Oaths,</hi> but I say, <hi>take none</hi>; for if Christ intended no more in these phrases (<hi>Swear not at all</hi>) not by any Oath, then thus, <hi>Swear not vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, prophanely, ordinary, or by Creatures</hi> in your <hi>Communication, forswear not your selves,</hi> what forbids he more then the Law forbad? for Heaven, and Earth, <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> A. S. says, <hi>Christ reckons among sinful Oaths</hi>; and these are Creatures, and Swearing by Creatures was forbidden by the Law, <hi>I grant</hi> quoth A. S. <hi>Then this reason stands still good, he either forbad all Oaths, or he forbad no more then the Law forbad</hi>; and though it be granted that the <hi>Jews</hi> Swore by the Creatures, as the <hi>Temple, Altar, Jerusalem,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ prohibits them, and reproves them for these things, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise all Swearing whatsover; what doth A. S. gain by this? for it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in divers passages of his Sermon in the 5<hi>th. Chap.</hi> of <hi>Mat.</hi> that he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es a Righteousness which exceeds that of the Law, as I have shewed before, which he came to fulfill and not to destroy, by taking away the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Swearing,</hi> and establishing the substance in its stead, which is <hi>speaking the Truth,</hi> as in the sight of God in uprightness of Heart; yea, we say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again, what saith he more to his Disciples else, then the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> to theirs? they said, <hi>Swear not falsly, prophanely, but by God only, Swear not falsly</hi>: For Bishop <hi>Gauden</hi> cites for his Author <hi>Drusius,</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> all thing sin <hi>Judicials</hi> were confirmed by the Religion of an Oath, wherein
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:40634:377"/>
the <hi>name of God was interposed,</hi> therefore Christ says more unto his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in express terms, Swear no Oath at all, otherwise how would their Righteousness exceed that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> which except it did, they could in no case enter into the Kingdom of God; the <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Righteousness of the Law</hi> therefore in this point of <hi>Swearing</hi> was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing: the <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> in the same is not Swearing at all, so though the Gospel be not against the Law, yet the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel exceeds the Law in every point; the Law said, <hi>kill not,</hi> the Gospel <hi>be not angry</hi>; the Law, <hi>commit not Adultery,</hi> the Gospel, <hi>look not on a Woman,</hi> lust not; so in all the prohibitions of Christ; the Commandments of Christ went beyond the Law, also in this of Swearing, yet it did not if now there be any Swearing at all among Christians and Disciples of Christ, yet we shall also with A. S. agree that Christ not only forbad all Swearing (even that commanded by the Law, sometime lawful) but he also forbids and reproves, and condemns Swearing by Creatures, and vain Swearing in all Communication, and their perverting of the Law, and too much loosing it by Traditions, and making it void by their false Glosses, and counts them blind Guides, which said, <hi>To swear by the Temple, by the Altar, by Heaven, was nothing,</hi> he pronounced a Wo against them, and concluded, they were bound to keep those Oaths, though they ought not to have Sworn them, for as much as he that swears by the lesser swears also by the greater; as he that Swears by Heaven swears by the Throne of God, and him that sits thereon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. We confess with A. S. this was but a <hi>sinful prophane Creature Swearing, an irregular form of Swearing</hi>; by the Name of God the <hi>Jews</hi> indulged themselves in, but what doth <hi>A. S.</hi> gain by this? it's evident enough that solemn Oaths <hi>by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> as those familiar Oaths by Creatures, in which they tacitely Sware by God are forbidden by Christ, <hi>but I say unto you, Swear not at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But A. S. tells us as <hi>Grotius</hi> tells him out of <hi>Philo Judeus, That the</hi> Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees <hi>taught them to perform what-ever they had promised Swearing by God,</hi> they <hi>under a specious pretence that they would not take God's Name in vain upon slight occasions fell to Swear by Creatures, which the</hi> Pharisees <hi>did no disallow to cheat People withal, which they themselves neither thought obligatory, nor meant to keep.</hi> The name <hi>Elohim</hi> and <hi>Jehovah</hi> they might possibly scruple at, but that name <hi>Adonai</hi> they oft, as superstitiously, repeat in their much babling as they superstitiously decline mentioning of the other, but that in serious cases of concerns of Justice and Equity, and in Judicature in matter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, or ending of Controversies, that they should wave and forbear swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Name of God, when their Scriptures was so express for it, and they should chuse that way of Swearing, that is no reason at all to believe it, seeing <hi>Drusius</hi> sayes, <hi>among the</hi> Jews <hi>all things in Judicature were confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Oath, wherein the Name of God was interposed,</hi> as above mentioned. 2dly. That they should wave Swearing by the Name of God in matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, which they all believed were binding, and should Swear by Creatures in order to the giving satisfaction to one another, and security of each other, and by such Oaths as they judged not to be obligatory, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant to keep them, seeing A. S. says, <hi>It was in pretence of Reverence to God, they Swear not by God but by Creatures, to cheat and never meant to keep,</hi>
                     <pb n="720" facs="tcp:40634:378"/>
they knowing this that he that so Swears by Creatures <hi>meant not to keep but to cheat and not perform</hi>; such Oaths were not very probably used in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature among them, neither in serious cases, for such Oaths instead of giving satisfaction and putting an end unto Jealousies and Distrusts would have sure created them more then before; forasmuch as he that so Swears believes himself not to be bound thereby, then if he had not Sworn at all, and he unto whom he Swears also knows the same, that such Oaths (as A. S. tells on that they did Swear) is not binding, neither can any more credit be given to them then to a Lyar, because in this sort of Swearing there was no security; it is not probable I say, that they should chuse this in Judicature or any serious case of Controversie: And if it be that Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Christ only prohibits by Heaven, Earth, and Creatures, which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> indulged them in, wherein (as to the point of Swearing) <hi>does he prescribe a Righteousness and Perfection above or beyond Moses</hi> his Servant whom he was to exceed; for God by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Law it self had Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally forbidden all other Oaths, either in <hi>general terms,</hi> or sometime <hi>more particularly</hi>; but still all <hi>false oaths, vain oaths,</hi> and Oaths by Creatures are included, save only solemn Swearing by his own Name that there was no more Swearing left for Christ to forbid his Disciples, but Swearing by God himself, which the Law allowed of.</p>
                  <p>Besides moreover, the Opposition then which lies intimated in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle [But] being not between false Swearing and prophane Swearing, and Swearing by Creatures, as A. S. would have it, but between Forswearing then and No Swearing now, shews Christ's Intent to be to prohibit all Swearing; for it is indeed as if he had thus said, God under the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you to swear by his Name, and when you had sworn in Truth by him, to perform the Oaths you made by him, whether to him or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but I say, now God allows you not to swear at all, not by Heaven, Earth, or any other, no not those Oaths which ye did and might make of old unto the Lord your God in things lawful, but no Oath by a Creature did God account as an Oath made to him, provided ye performed it when ye had done, any more then he counted their solemn Fastings to be to him, <hi>Zachariah</hi> 7.5.</p>
                  <p>Again, Christ's own Expressions in the affirmative Part shew his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the negative to be a Prohibition of all Swearing as well as any; <hi>but let your Communication be Yea, Yea, Nay, Nay</hi>; so the Negative of his Words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> must be understood in such an universal exclusive Latitude as admits of no Oaths whatsoever among his Disciples; and as hath been said, that Particle [But] which stands between these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, of <hi>Moses,</hi> saying, <hi>Forswear not, but perform to God thine Oaths,</hi> and of Christ, saying <hi>[But] I say unto you, Swear not at all,</hi> doth manifest that Christ forbids all Swearing as much as any, even such Swearing as was not indulged to them by the <hi>Pharisees</hi> only, but by <hi>Moses</hi> and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who by his Servant dispensed with them in, and instituted even their Swearing by God's own Name, who never indulged or dispensed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that Creature-swearing, as A.S. speaks of, but threatned Woes to it under the Law; and by the Law again, if it be said, <hi>Christ only prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all such voluntary Oaths, which they sware to perform to the Lord by any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:40634:378"/>
as Heaven, Earth, in their Communication and mutual Converse</hi> (as A.S. sayes) <hi>but not solemn Oaths by God in Courts, or before Magistrates, and not between Man and Man, and Matter of Deliberation,</hi> as some others say, and have interpreted the Words, <hi>Let not your whole Conversation be interwoven with Oaths.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> Christ doth indeed forbid all such voluntary Oaths as were used by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and all Swearing by any Thing besides God or below God, also all Swearing in common Communication and ordinary Conversation, where Yea and Nay should serve, yea, and that which is called solemn, and by some sacred and lawful, even by God even all Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by God commonly, frequently or generally, which is now in Courts, and imposed by Justices and Magistrates, then which nothing almost is more ordinary, frequent and common; if our Communication and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation should be without Swearing, and our mutual Converse one with another among men should be without Oaths of any kind whatsoever; is not this exclusive of Swearing in Courts, and before Magistrates as well as other men, whether in Courts and Consistories as well as other Places, where men have their Conversation and mutual Converse with each other as ordinarily and commonly as else-where, which being considered I have with other often mused why some men have been so inconsiderate as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Christ's Words and Prohibition, as exclusive of mens Swearing in their ordinary Converse in Courts, where Oaths are as ordinary, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and common as in any Places whatsoever, especially that some men plead so much for Oaths in Courts, and before Magistrates only (as though they were sacred and solemn there, and no where else, and holy and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful only there) and yet can bring no better Proof under the Gospel for them nor of their Right to impose them upon Christians more then others? a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many false Instances they bring of <hi>Paul</hi> Swearing frequently to the Churches in his Letters; and such pitiful Proof as A.S. offers of Christ being charged by the high Priest (as he sayes) to Swear; though he Swore, for I deny that (<hi>I adjure thee</hi>) proves not that Christ Swore, it being not his, but another's Charge upon him; and it's silly to think, that Christ who said, <hi>Swear not at all, no not by Heaven, for it's God's Throne, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Swears by,</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>Swears by God that sits thereon,</hi> that he should Swear by the living God, he was the Christ, at the Command or Charge of the High Priest, who was his Inferiour (though he had been a better Priest then he was) as being but the Type of himself; but indeed there was no such matter as A.S. and others have affirmed; for when the High Priest barely asked him only whether he were the Christ or not? he answered, <hi>I am</hi>; besides the Law was not in the Shadow of it fully ended, although Christ had instituted divers Things among his Disciples, which were not in the Law, and yet not against it; but all these Instances which A. S. with many Opposers, hath brought of the Apostles and Christ's Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are but Shrouds and Shelters they make for themselves, because they have a Mind to obey the Commands of men rather then Christ's Doctrine, for avoiding of Persecution and Suffering, and therefore would make all Things they take in Hand look like their own Image; but having discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

of this before, I come to A. S. his last Part of his Discourse, and his Interpretation upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>In his 41 Section he sayes, <hi>If any still urge the Universality of the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (Swear not at all) and that of</hi> Jam. 5.12. <hi>(Above all Things my Brethren Swear not, neither by Heaven, nor by Earth, neither any other Oath)</hi> To the first he sayes, <hi>It's plain that they that thus argue break off our Saviour's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the middle, and suffer him not to come to his Period; for he saith not,</hi> Swear not at all, <hi>there fixing a Point, but</hi> Swear not at all, neither by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor by Earth, &amp;c. <hi>and for that of</hi> James <hi>must of Necessity by understood with Restriction,</hi> quotes <hi>Austin</hi> upon the Text, <hi>it cannot be that Swearing is worse then Forswearing, Theft, Adultery, Murder, these are hainous Crimes,</hi> nulla autem culpa est verum jurare; <hi>but if no Sin to Swear the Truth, why then</hi> Above all Things Swear not, <hi>not that Swearing is so great an Offence as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but lest we contract a Habit thereof, then probably by rash Oaths we shall offend God by false Swearing, which is no more then in an especial Manner, forbear for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing, and</hi> any other Oath <hi>must be restrained in a limited Sense, for there is not meant any Oaths whatever, but such as the Apostle speaks of, neither by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by Earth, nor any other Oath, that is, any Oath taken by other Creatures, for so must they be understood, unless we interpret his Words to make them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict God's, and se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> We who are of a contrary Judgment to A.S. do still urge the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversality of the Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33, 34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we shall not break off Christ's Sentence in the middle, <hi>Swear not at all, &amp;c.</hi> but shall render it as it is, neither was it ever intended otherwise, but for Brevity sake, because the Enumeration of Heaven and Earth, &amp;c. are only inclusive in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition; and we shall speak on, and what Christ hath joyned we shall not separate, but read the Words as they are, <hi>Ye have heard it hath been said of old Time, thou shalt not forswear they self, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine Oaths; but I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, for it is God's Throne, neither by the Earth, it's his Footstool, neither by</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>for it's the City of the great King, neither shalt thou Swear by thy Head, because thou cannot make one Hair white or black; but let your Communication be yea, yea, nay, nay, whatsoever is more then these cometh of Evil.</hi> James 5.12. <hi>But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Things my Brethren Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by Earth, neither by any other Oath, but let your Yea be Yea, and your Nay, Nay, lest you fall into Condemnation</hi>: In which two Texts we say (in the Affirmative) all Manner of Swearing is forbidden, for the Truth of which many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have been and may be given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Because all Manner of Swearing is here expresly instanced in these two disjunctive Clauses, which are expresly conclusive, and consequently (because spoken by Way of Prohibition) exclusive, exceptive of all Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that can be thought on, <hi>Swear not, Swear not at all,</hi> sayes the Text, yea, that none may imagine, as A. S. would make men do, that this general Rule admits of any Exception; but all know the Prohibition is so strict as to allow of no Permission in the Point to swear by any Thing but God, he adds, <hi>neither by Heaven, neither by Earth, neither by</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>neither
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:40634:379"/>
by thy Head</hi>; and these are only more ample Expressions of that Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are not exclusive or disjunctive from the Prohibition, but conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of the Prohibition of all Swearing whatever.</p>
                  <p>But lest any should think he forbids only and no more then extravagant Oaths of such as swear by Creatures, as Earth, <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Head, and such like, whenas whosoever swore lawfully under the Law was to swear by none but God himself; but that there be no Root at all for any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for Swearing against the flat Prohibition of it, <hi>James</hi> 5. he concludes and shuts up all in these universal Terms, and excludes all Oaths, and all possible Pretence of Plea at all for any Swearing, adding <hi>neither by any other Oath</hi>; what Words more plain Words can be uttered, or can be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly exclusive both of all Kinds or Sorts of Swearing, and of all sorts of particular Oaths of every Kind; and by Heaven, and by Earth, and by <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> are so far from signifying that those Oaths by Creatures are only the Oaths that Christ prohibits, that they are but only Enumerations and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications of the former Part of the Prohibition, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> which we grant were spoken to reprove the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> Practice about their vain Swearing.</p>
                  <p>And why must those Words of <hi>James</hi> 5. needs be understood with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction? <hi>Above all Things Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by Earth, &amp;c.</hi> why, St. <hi>Austin</hi> scruples at the first Words, <hi>Quare ante omnia jurare est quam furari, &amp;c. quam adulterare, &amp;c. quam hominem occidere,</hi> it cannot be that <hi>Swearing</hi> is worse then forswearing, then Adultery, Theft, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; we do not say it is, but if it be not, or that be not the Reason why he sayes, <hi>Above all Things Swear not,</hi> because <hi>Swearing</hi> is a Sin above all Sins, can no other Reason but that be rendered? yes, yet we shall agree with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> and A. S. too, if their Judgment be one, thus far, that it was not Sin to Swear the Truth, when called unto it, under the Law; <hi>why then Above all Things Swear not? not that Swearing is so great an Offence as Murder or Adultery, but lest we contract a Habit thereof, and then possibly by rash Oaths, we should offend God, which is no more</hi> (saith he) <hi>then in especial Manner, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Forswearing; and</hi> any other Oath (saith A.

                  <p>Again, It is by <hi>Solomon,</hi> who spoke by the eternal Wisdom of God, and in it to fear an Oath is made the Character of a righteous Man that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth acceptably to God (to Swear (at all) is more the Character of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unclean Sinner, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.1, 2. for howbeit Men shall once return, and discern the happiness of him that serves God, from his woe who serves him not, yet he is <hi>one event to the Righteous and the Wicked, to the good and clean, and to the unclean, to him that Sacrificeth, and him that Sacrificeth not, as is the good so is the Sinner, as he that Sweareth so he that fears an Oath,</hi> and so as above all things Swear not, is to be taken not only of those Oaths which were ever unlawful by Heaven and Earth, but even of those that sometime, were lawful under the Law, in the Type which now when the Substance the Oath of God is come, and the Covenant of Light given to all Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="726" facs="tcp:40634:381"/>
yea, in the verses immediately before, <hi>this Universal prohibition, Swear not at all, Mat.</hi> 5.30, 31. Christ sayes, <hi>'twas said of old, if any put away his Wife, let him give her a Bill of divorce; but I say, whosoever shall put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Wife, causeth her to commit Adultery:</hi> But this admits of an exception and that exception is thus exprest, <hi>viz. saving for the cause of Fornication</hi>; but though all this be granted, even these and many more Universal terms admit of exceptions and restriction, yet we cannot grant that these two Texts admit of any such exceptions or restrictions as A. S. would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them. My reason is this, because in this <hi>general term and Universal prohibition, Swear not at all,</hi> it cannot in Equity be taken and limitted in that sense which A. S. puts upon it, nor with that restriction, for that sense would make it short of the subject matter where all Swearing is forbidden as well as any, because Swear not at all by Heaven, Earth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Because there is not only no Expression made any where after of any such Exception or Restriction, but a fuller Amplification of it by such Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as are enumerated, and are more particularly exclusive of all kinds of Oaths, and of all Oaths of any kind, not only of those that they used to wicked Purposes, but even those they solemnly used sometime to good Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses before the Seed Christ was revealed; and the Apostle, <hi>James</hi> 5.12. <hi>neither by Heaven, neither by Earth, neither by any other Oath,</hi> which is a Re-inforcement and redoubling of the said universal Prohibition; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if Christ had intended any Exception here, he might as easily have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, and would as assuredly as he did immediately above in the Cause of Divorce, by (<hi>except in the Cause of Fornication</hi>) and have so said, <hi>Swear not at all, except it be solemn and sacred Oaths, and by the Lord, to good Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in Courts, where ye are call'd to swear before a Magistrate</hi>; so <hi>James</hi> if he had intended, as A.S. will needs inforce, yet without any Ground, a Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Restriction, <hi>Above all Things my Brethren Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by Earth, neither by any other Oath, except ye swear solemnly by God to good Purposes in Courts or before Magistrates</hi>; but as I said, instead of excepting any Exception, he adds that which more strengthens and clears beyond all Exception the Universality of his Prohibition; and if all vain Oaths by God were forbidden before, and all Swearing by Creatures, so that there was no need either for Christ or <hi>James</hi> to speak of them again, as A.S. sayes, then this is still matter for the Argument on our Part, that some Oaths were prohibited by Christ and <hi>James</hi> which were not prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, and of which there was Necessity for them to speak, as there was indeed, not only about those Oaths and other Things which the Law before had prohibited, but even of those Things that it had allowed and indulged, because of the Hardness of their Hearts; so we say, there was a Necessity of Christ and <hi>James,</hi> not only to mention those Things again which the Law had spoken of before, and disallowed, which we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced before, and is manifest in that <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and loosened by their false Glosses and Traditions, but even those Things which were permitted, indulged and commanded under the Law, and suffered to be, because of the Hardness of their Hearts, and Strifes, Unbeliefs, Insecurities; and therefore Christ teacheth and informeth his Disciples as it was in the Beginning before those Things entered, and in
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:40634:381"/>
this Cause about Oaths among the rest prohibits all Swearing without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, not only that which was once forbidden, but even that which was once permitted, and commanded, and indulged; and therefore <hi>it hath been said of old Time, thou shalt not forswear thy self</hi> (under the Law) where? in <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.21. <hi>but I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, nor Earth, nor</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>nor thy Head,</hi> which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly an exclusive Prohibition of all Oaths, without Exception or Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Limitation, and still will stand good (notwithstanding all A.

                  <p>And then A. S. concludes, <hi>Here the grand Objection falls of it self, which is,</hi> Either all kinds of Swearing is forbidden, or else Christ notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Words <hi>(But I say unto you)</hi> forbad nothing which was forbidden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>which is utterly improbable, and the Reason is</hi> (saith he) <hi>because God formerly had forbidden all false and vain Oaths, and all Swearing by Creatures, all which I grant to be true</hi> (saith he) <hi>but the</hi> Pharisees <hi>had taught the People o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise by their wicked Glosses, that made the Commandment of small Effect by their Tradition, and the Practice of that Nation was widely distant from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, both which were necessarily to be reformed, which our Saviour did in these Words,</hi> But I say unto you, Swear not at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> Who ever denyed but that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were blind Guides, and that they laboured to make void the Law, <hi>and made the Commandments of God of small Effect by their Traditions,</hi> or that the Practice of that Nation was not widely distant from the Commandment, and that they sware by false Gods sometime, and vainly by the true God, and took his Name in vain, and sware also by Heaven, and Earth, and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> like as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do now; all this we grant, that they were out of the Way both in Oaths and other Things, also that Christ reproved in the fifth of <hi>Matthew</hi> and else-where, which Christ reformed and reproved their Doctrine and Manners; I say again, how is the grand Objection fallen by this, <hi>That ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all kind of Swearing is forbidden here by Christ, or else Christ forbad nothing which was not forbidden before, which is utterly improbable,</hi> saith A. S. but it is more probable then any thing that A. S. hath yet offered; for if on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Heaven, Earth, <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Head, Temple and Altar be that which Christ forbad, that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> taught the People they might swear by, these were forbidden before, inclusive in false Swearing or Swearing by Creatures, though not expressed or enumerated nominally, yet included among the sinful and vain Oaths under the Law, and so were forbidden before; and saith A. S. <hi>I grant that all vain Oaths and Perjury, and all Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Creatures were formerly forbidden</hi>; and if so, as indeed they were, what more did he forbid then was forbidden, if the Words must only be understood of those sinful and vain Oaths by Creatures above-mentioned, that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> indulged the People in, and taught as A. S. would limit his Prohibition and Exception, I shall leave to the Conscience of every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned

man to judge, and say that in these Words, <hi>It hat been said of old Time thou shalt not forswear, but pay thy Vows unto the Lord, but I say</hi> (who am come to restore Man again into that Estate he fell from by Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and to redeem him that believes out of Strife and Contention, and Idolatry, to have fellowship with the Father) <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> neither by Heaven nor Earth, nor any other Oath, that as hath been said before here is a prohibition of all vain Oaths and false Oaths, and Perjury, and all Oaths by Creatures, and all the vain Traditions of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> about Oaths, and somewhat more, even a prohibition of those Oaths to his Disciples, which the Law allowed after Sin had entred, for which cause the Law was added, and Oaths added, but Christ ends it, (not by destroying it) but by fulfilling it, and hath set up that which is more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical, Truth it self, in which there is no shadow of change, and it is binding upon the Souls of all true Christians, and that by which they are bound one to another, and every Word, Promise, or Testimony that goes out of their Hearts and Mouths, they by it are bound to keep, least they fall into Condemnation, <hi>but their Yea is yea, and Nay is nay</hi>; and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is more then this cometh of Evil; and therefore they do not, cannot, nor dare not go beyond this or that which doth but amount to as much, and there needs no more among true Christians.</p>
                  <p>Now as to them, who are in the Contention and Strife and Unbelief and Oaths, works of the Flesh, as Variance, Discord, whom the Law hath Power over and is against, as long as they live in such estate, it's granted that the Law was added because of these Transgressions, and is against such; and how far Swearing can be binding among evil, contentious, unconsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Men, that make no Conscience of any thing, who cannot believe one another, nor give credit to one another without Swearing, Experience hath manifested whether they judge one another to be believed better by Swearing then without Swearing, that's little to us, neither shall we meddle in contentious matters, nor have to do with striving Men, as little as possible, but rather suffer wrong, then wrong our Consciences by Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which we are perswaded by Christ we ought not to right our selves, as hitherto we have done and have Peace, blessed be God in our Hearts, however, we could rejoyce and be glad to see all Men be at Peace, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and it's our desire to live in that love, and we shall seek it with Men and to be at Peace as much as in us lyes, even in that love that works no Evil, nor <hi>thinks no Evil, but believeth all things, and beareth all things,</hi> and so carries beyond Strife and Oaths; but if they will not be without Oaths in <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Judicatures,</hi> we are clear in the matter, if they exact upon us, and do as they have done, to the undoing, and Ruining of many in this World, we must be content, knowing it is better to suffer wrong, then to do it, and shall acquiesce and rest in the will of God, till he plead our cause, and open the Hearts of Men to see through the Clouds of Error and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is over their Consciences.</p>
                  <p>Yet however this I must needs say, this frequent, common, prophane Swearing, that hath exalted its Horn, more of late Years, is one of the crying Sins of <hi>England,</hi> that God's Anger is against, and will draw down his Judgment, and kindle the Indignation which hangs over this Nation,
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:40634:382"/>
not only because of those that command Men to Swear, contrary to Christs command, (and that for to establish Cruelty and injustice) but also that Swore falsly and vainly, and that against their Knowledge, for their own profit, and the disadvantage of others: to accomplish their wicked, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and Revengeful designs, against the Innocent, who dare not <hi>Swear at all,</hi> and thereby are made a prey to the Teeth of Wolves, and to the Wills of corrupt Men, who take occasion (as it were) <hi>To plow long Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes upon the Backs of the poor and needy, for which things sake the Wrath of God will be poured out upon the head of the Wicked, and the Nation shall be on Heaps, and the wise Men shall be turned backwards, and their Table shall be a Snare, and the Curse shall be upon the Rebellious, and they shall fall and be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and rise no more</hi>; and this may justly befall this Nation, because of Oaths, and because of Oppression.</p>
                  <p>And oh much pittied Nation! it may be said of thee truly as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hosea</hi> 4.2, 3. (<hi>Because of Swearing, and Lying, and Killing, and Stealing, and Whoring, they break out, and Blood toucheth Blood, therefore shall the Land Mourn, and every one that dwells therein shall be cut off</hi>) Oh! what sad times do we behold, nothing but extreames of Evil are presented to our Eyes and Ears, some do little but Swear, <hi>ordinarily, commonly and vainly,</hi> in all kind of Communication and Conversation, not only in their <hi>usual outer Courses in Courts,</hi> with <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> but in their hourly discourses also with other Men, in <hi>Cities, Townes, Princes</hi> and <hi>great Mens Courts,</hi> and <hi>Places, Universities, Colledges,</hi> almost all <hi>Houses,</hi> at least all <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Ale-houses,</hi> and in the open <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Assemblies,</hi> almost every where, are full of dreadful Oaths, and Mens discourses interwoven with execrable and direful Oaths, even as it were daring God to <hi>confound them</hi> and <hi>damn them,</hi> and such like, and though there be divers Laws against swearing vainly and forswearing, yet these are not looked at, but how should we exspect that they should look at the Execution of the Laws of Men which are good, who heed not the Law of God; and are so buzzed now a dayes, with over-executing those intangling Laws that are extant for Oaths, and forswearing, to intrap and insnare poor Innocent Men, who dare not <hi>Swear at all,</hi> but keep the Commands of Christ; so that there is no leisure lost to look after those most wholsome and profitable Laws of both God and the King, which are against vain Oaths, and forswearing, which the Land abounds with, the like hath not been in any Age, which is a sad presage of the Judgment of God to be at hand.</p>
                  <p>And last of all, A. S. says, <hi>He hath done, and he fears it's more and time to have done with the Exposition of those words, and so comes to Application, and so he speaks to all in general; who at that time or any other may be legally called to take their Oaths, which you have heard Vindicated to be lawful, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the seeming opposition of these words,</hi> Swear not at all; <hi>but those must be understood of necessary Oaths, and your Righteousness is to exceed the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Pharisees, <hi>but they condemned Perjury in the verse immediately before my Text; and your Warrant for swearing is in</hi> Jer. 4.2. <hi>which thence appears not only lawful but in some cases necessary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> It's more then time indeed to have done, to pervert Christ's plain Doctrine with his imaginary Exposition, and what he counts (legally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

seeing Christ prohibited it, is not of much force, neither will A. S.'s Vindication stand against the real opposition of Christ's words, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>; but his seeming Vindication (in the day of the Lord, when the secrets of all Hearts shall be manifest by Jesus Christ, when the Book of Conscience shall be opened) will be found to be in real opposition unto Christ, and his reward will be according to his works, who hath by his work strengthn'd the hand of Evil-doers and Persecutors, to the adding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to affliction upon the Righteous; and if the words must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of necessary Oaths, then there is none necessary among Christ's true Disciples, who commanded, <hi>Let your Yea be yea, or your Nay, nay, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is more comes of Evil</hi>; and whether the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Perjury or not, we are sure the Law did, which Christ's words hath reference to, <hi>It hath been said of old time thou shalt not forswear thy self</hi>; and if the Righteousness of Christ's Disciples be to exceed the Righteousness of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and they condemned Perjury, and all false Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by God, and the <hi>Law condemned all false Oaths and vain Oaths,</hi> and Oaths by Creatures, as A. S. hath granted; then the Righteousness of the Disciples is to be another, then the Righteousness of the Law, which condemned all Perjury and vain Oaths; then what is it, but not to <hi>Swear at all any Oath,</hi> but speak the Truth, and <hi>confess it to the Glory of God</hi> in <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay?</hi> and this is that which exceeds the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and is only lawful and necessary under the Gospel; and as for <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2. this is pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proof and warrant for Christians to Swear under the Gospel, for that was only spoken to <hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Juda,</hi> who were under the first Covenant, and yet were revolted from the Ordinances thereof, and were back-sliders, as is to be seen, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. and hath not Reverence to the second Covenant: But I shall come towards an end as well as A. S. and conclude and refer all (<hi>what both he and I have said</hi>) to the judgment of the Lord, and the measure of God's holy Spirit in all Mens Consciences, to be received or denyed by that as he and his Witness bears evidence, so shall the matter stand eternally.</p>
                  <p>Yet I cannot but mind the Reader, though A. S. hath had, as appears, certain Books of the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> in which are weighty things, about this particular of Swearing, which he hath not answered at all, as to their Arguments, only carped here and there at a word, which is not of great moment; but though he may plead some reason, that it was not possible to answer all things in so short a Discourse, as a Sermon, wherein he was limited as to time, yet since he had, I perceive, by his Annotations, time enough to have answered them, having their Books extant by him, but hath not, in the most weighty Considerations; therefore I refer the Reader to them, for his further satisfaction, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Answer of Bishop <hi>Gauden,</hi> by that faithful Servant of God, <hi>Sam, Fisher,</hi> where this point is largely discussed, likewise his <hi>Antidote</hi> against Swearing, in Answer to <hi>Heary Den,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah Ives,</hi> likewise a Book published by <hi>Isaac Penington,</hi> titled, <hi>The great Question concerning the lawfulness or unlawfulness of Swearing under the Gospel stated, and considered of</hi>; wherein are weighty things declared in short; 1st. what an Oath is; 2dly. the Ground and occasion of an Oath; 3dly. the causes wherein an Oath was to be used; 4thly. the end of an Oath; 5thly. the suitableness of its NATURE to the end aimed at by it; 6thly. the Persons to whom the use of an Oath was proper and lawful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="731" facs="tcp:40634:383"/>Wherein also is clearly shown the state of man-kind from the Creation, comprised in four Heads or particulars: First, <hi>(The State of Innocency) when there was no Oath)</hi> Secondly, <hi>An estate of Captivity,</hi> wherein an Oath was proper and lawful: Thirdly, <hi>The estate of shadowy Redemption,</hi> wherein it was lawful also: Fourthly, <hi>An estate of true and perfect Redemption,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it's neither needful nor lawful, seeing it's prohibited by Christ, all which A. S. hath passed over, and hath not answered.</p>
                  <p>Likewise a Book published by <hi>John Crook,</hi> Titled, <hi>The Case of Swearing</hi> (at all) <hi>discussed with</hi>; and several Objections answered: These things A. S. hath not answered, I only instance them for the Readers further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, if unsatisfied in what hath been said already; all which great and weighty things, are worthy of the Serious consideration of all.</p>
                  <p>Likewise a Book, Titled, (<hi>Swearing denyed in the new Covenant</hi>) by <hi>Morgan Watkins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When all that hath been said, is duly considered and weighed in the Righteous Ballance of God's holy Spirit, they will not think it strange that some deny to Swear at all, but rather wonder that such a Vail of Darkness should be so long over the minds and Hearts of them that believe not, notwithstanding so clear evidence from Christ and his Apostles, or the Example of the Primitive Christians or holy Martyrs, who spoke the Truth, but denyed to Swear at all; but that Custome and Tradition is often more minded then the very Truth it self.</p>
                  <p>Oh! that the Rulers of this Nation would once consider &amp; weigh what they are doing, and how many and great the suffering of a Conscientious People that fear the Lord in theirs Hearts are, who dare not disobey the commands of Christ, lest they fall into Condemnation, and come under the rebuke of the Lord in their Hearts, who hath Power alone to kill and to make alive, but rather chuse to suffer the loss of all, and undergo the manifold Sufferings that some malicious Spirits cause to be inflicted upon them; when indeed there is no cause at all; while prophane Persons Swear, and forswear, and take God's holy Name in vain, and make little Conscience of any thing, but sometime for, and sometime against, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever seems countenanced and discountenanced by the Magistrates; so that neither the <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Kingdom</hi> is in any more security, notwithstanding all such Swearing, how solemn soever they seem in Swearing, neither any more credit be given in Judicature, then there is to be given to him that is a common Swearer in his private occasions, or common Communication; and Oh! how doth the Land abound in this, insomuch that he that is not a Curser or Swearer is looked upon as a <hi>Phanatick,</hi> or some <hi>disobedient Person,</hi> or <hi>unconformable Man,</hi> which ought especially to be eyed for a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Person: Oh! that the Heads and Rulers of the People would but consider how near the Judgment of God is, and how ready to break forth upon the Nation; and not without cause, even great Evils are begun, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> already threatned, and <hi>God's Arrows flying abroad</hi> to wound and to destroy them that continue in hardness of Heart, &amp; rebellion against God, and will not suffer him to rule and reign in the Consciences and Kingdoms of Men, but vain Men would set up their <hi>Thresh-hold</hi> with his, and not only so, but against his; and great is the wickedness and the Sins

of this Nation upon many accounts, which the Lord will bring a Scourge upon, especially that grievous Sin of Persecution, that <hi>Cain</hi>-like way, which the Generations have chosen to add as they ignorantly suppose unto their Church, and so build up their <hi>Zion</hi> with Cruelty, and their Church by Iniquity: Oh! this is loathsome in the sight of God; had <hi>Zimri</hi> peace who slew his <hi>Master</hi>? had <hi>Israel</hi> Peace when she slew the <hi>Prophets?</hi> had the <hi>Jews</hi> Peace when they had Crucified <hi>Christ?</hi> had the <hi>Romans</hi> Peace when they Persecuted the first <hi>Christians?</hi> had <hi>Cain</hi> Peace when he had slain his Brother?
