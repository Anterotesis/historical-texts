            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Psalme, where<note place="margin">Psal. 82.</note> he speaketh of Princes: <hi>I haue said, ye are Gods, and ye are all children of the most high. But yee shall die like men, and fall like one of the Princes.</hi> And in another place: <hi>There be some that put</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 49.</note> 
               <hi>their trust in their goods, and boast themselues in the multitude of their riches. But no man maie deliuer his brother, nor make agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with God for him: for it cost more to redeem his soule, so that hee must let that alone for euer: Yea though he liue long and see not the graue.

               <note place="margin">Psal. 89.</note> 
               <hi>that liueth, and shal not see death, and shall deliuer his owne soule from the hand of Hell?</hi> And againe in the next Psalme following: <hi>Thou turnest man</hi>

               <hi>to destruction. Again, thou saist, come again ye children of men.</hi> We sée then, that it is Gods decrée and ordinance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable, that all men that come into the worlde, come but conditionally, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sam. 14.</note> shall please the Lord to call them away againe. And for all that (as the Prophet saith) we séeke to come to composition with Death, or to haue some daies of truce and respite to delaie his comming: yet we sée daily our date is out, and the daie of our assignation is soone expired, when we must appeare before the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iudge at a certaine houre, and at
<pb facs="tcp:19841:4"/>
the same instant wee must heare from his own mouth the sentence definitiue,<note place="margin">Psal. 62.</note> either of life or Death, for euer irreuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. What shall we then doo? we must first and chiefly haue a care, not as <hi>Aza</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 16.</note> had, to séeke out skilfull Phisitions, to take the potions and drugs that they shall minister, to saue vs from sicknes, which otherwise would be incident vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: nor as <hi>Mithridates</hi> had, to kéepe in store many preseruatiues and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, for feare of empoysoning by our familiar friends: we must not prouide a braue and goodly Horse, a swoord of the<note place="margin">Psal. 38.</note> best and trustiest making, an armour of proofe, to put our trust therin, as though these coulde saue vs from the hazarde of the battaile. For all this cannot infringe the ordinance of God, nor once saue vs from his anger, nor any iote turne away from vs the effects and execution of his diuine will. But the chiefest care and consideration that we must haue, if we either meane to preuent the mischiefs, which may be fall vs hereafter, or reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die those which are happened vnto vs alreadie, is humbly to desire, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19841:4"/>
to séeke for the grace and fauour of God, which is the most soueraign and readiest remedy that men may finde for the spéedie redresse of all calamities and aduersities, where with they shalbe afflicted. Now for that I am earnestly entreated by some of my brethren and friends to select and set downe in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting certaine places of holy scripture, for the comfort of such as be sicke, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them against the horrours and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions wherewith they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly saised, as well of their sinnes and offences, as of Death, of the Diuell, and of the displeasure &amp; iudgement of God, which are more horrible a great deale,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1. Cor. 13. 1. Cor. 12. Ephes. 4.</note> then al the other. Finding my self bound hereunto by Christian charitie, by the band whereof all the members of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bodie are firmely linked together: and knowing besides that it is a péece of the charge, that God hath laide on the neckes not onely of the Ministers of the Gospell: but also of the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which are ioyned with them for ayders and fellow-helpers: I would in no wise make refusall, to satisfie my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19841:5"/>
in this their request: although I know well inough, that many of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourers, on whom God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed greater talents, might be better spared, and were fitter to be employed in this busines, then my selfe: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, seeing that the members in what ranke or degrée so euer they bee, ought not to refuse any labour or seruice for the bodie, if it lie in their power to doo, I will attempt by the helpe of God, to doo that I am able, by his grace, to content and satisfie them in their desire. Omitting then many other kinds of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, by the which it pleaseth God to chastise and kéepe vnder his children, let vs speake here onely of Sicknes and Death, and set downe summarily consolations fit for the purpose, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and kéepe men in vre, to abide pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently their sicknes and diseases: the which are not casuall things, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of méere chaunce, now happening to one, now to an other, by rash and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduised rencountre: but we must thinke that they are al sent vpon vs by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:19841:5"/>And although the endes and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sicknes be diuers, yet the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is alwaies one, &amp; is the same, who is the giuer of all health and welfare. For from the mouth and ordinance of God (as saith Ieremy) procéedeth good<note place="margin">Lament. 3. 38. Amos. 3.</note> and euill, which is contrary to good. And there is none euill (as <hi>Amos</hi> saith) be it within the Citie or in the field, but it commeth from God. So then as peace and warre, pouertie and riches, libertie and imprisonment are from God: so in like maner are health, &amp; sicknes. <hi>Dauid</hi> in all his anguishes confesseth this: For in the sixt Psalme hee saith: <hi>O Lorde</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 6.</note> 
               <hi>rebuke mee not in thine anger, neither chastise me in thy sore displeasure.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that the anguish and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wherewith hee felt himselfe so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously afflicted, was the very pricking and working of Gods displeasure, whom he knew he had sore offended. Hée saith as much in another Psalme: <hi>Thine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 38.</note> 
               <hi>haue light vpon mee, and thine hand lieth vpon mee.</hi> And in the two and thirtie Psalme, <hi>Thy hand is heauy vpon me daie and night.</hi> And againe in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19841:6"/>
the 39. Psalme, <hi>I was dumbe and spake nothing, I kept sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce euen from good, and my sorrow was more stirred. My hart was hot within mee, and while I was musing the fire kindled, &amp;c.</hi> Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias<note place="margin">Isay. 38.</note> &amp; Iob likewise doo attribute their sicknes to none other but to God. And Iob saide, that in the very stinch that<note place="margin">Iob. 1. &amp; 19</note> came from his flesh halfe-rotten, and in the multitude of lothsome wormes that issued from his bodie, he still beheld but one hand of his Sauiour to touch him, to the ende hee might heale him againe with the other. The very Heathenish Infidels haue somtimes acknowledged that their Sicknes and diseases procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from none other cause but from God, who then punished them because of their offences. As Pharao and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily<note place="margin">Gen. 12. Exod. 9.</note> in the daies of Abraham, the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in the time of Moyses, &amp; the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the time of Samuell, when they kept the Arke of Couenant cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and prisoner in their owne country, after they had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it in the war, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they vanquished the children of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell. We must then conclude, that disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19841:6"/>
and generally all afflictions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities doo come from God, who dooth nothing but with great iustice and by<note place="margin">Psal. 33.</note> his heauenly wisedome. For all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are so well directed, that nothing may be found in them, but is done with waight, number and measure, and for great reason, although the cause thereof be sometimes vnknowne to vs. As then the Goodnes, the Power, the Wisdome, the Iustice, the Equitie, Constancy, and veritie, which appeare in all the works of God, are the motiues and causes why we allow of them and praise them: So confessing all these vertues in our sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and other aduersities, which are the handyworke of God and of none other, ought we not to take them in good part, and to arme our selues with this faith and holy cogitation against the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and murmuring of our hart, which doth pricke and prouoke vs to stomake, and be angry with God, yea and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to blaspheme his holy name hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly, when he will not doo as we would haue him, and fulfill the wicked and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate desires of our sinful flesh, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19841:7"/>
if he should do, he should become like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> vs, who are but flatterers and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of our owne vices and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Contrariwise to become holy, good and vertuous, we must labour to be like vnto him, and to submit all our desires and will vnto his wil. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we are indéed but hipocrites, and although that in our praiers wée craue and desire that <hi>his will bee done,</hi> our<note place="margin">Mat, 6.</note> hart dooth secretly make our mouth bée found a liar, and doth by and by tell vs in our eare: ha, hipocrite that thou art, if thou mightest choose, thou hadst rather haue thy own wil to be done, then Gods will. When a man speaketh to vs of Gods prouidence, and asketh vs, if euery thing that God dooth, be good, and well done, we can tell him by and by, it is: and so we say to our neighbors &amp; friends, when we sée them in any anguish or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to giue them the best comfort and counsel that we can, and for the best and spéediest remedie, we tell them then, it procéedeth from the prouidence &amp; will of God.

Euen so then, as a woman which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth her selfe entirely beloued of her owne husbande, neede not feare that he wil at any time misvse her: so ought we to assure our selues, that God who doth loue vs aboue measure, cannot do or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to be done to vs any thing that shall not be for our benefit. For if then when<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> wee were enimies (as saith <hi>S.

Is there anye thing to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more absurde, then to thinke that GOD, who is the soueraigne good, can be the Author of anye euill? Or<note place="margin">Iam. 3.</note> can wee haue from one Fountaine or spring, both salte water and sweete water?</p>
            <p>The heretikes, as <hi>Marcion</hi> and the <hi>Manichees,</hi> to shewe that they had such
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19841:12"/>
blasphemie in horror and detestation, would establish two principles: the one of life and light: the other of death and darknesse, perswading themselues by<note place="margin">Psa 68.</note> no meanes, that from God, who is the fountaine of life &amp; of all felicitie, might proceede any miserie or affilction: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were not deceiued, but in this onely, that from a good <hi>Maxime</hi> they drewe a naughtie conclusion: For in trueth, the good in so high degree as God is, that is to saye, soueraigne and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, cannot produce any euill, no more than fire can any thing that is colde: light, darknen: or life, death. And the reason is, because God, after that he had created the world and all that therein is contained, &amp; considered throughly all the workemanship of his hands, beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that they were all perfect good. And this is not simply to be vnderstood of all things that God created and made, but it extendeth also to all things that God doth, without any exception.</p>
            <p>For séeing that God is alwayes like<note place="margin">Psa. 102. Iam. 1.</note> to himselfe, and that in him, as <hi>Saint Iames</hi> sayth, there is no changing at all,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19841:12"/>
no not the least shadowe of alteration: and as his bountie is eternall, so at all times can it produce nothing but good workes, and doe those things that are good. And this is the reason which he gaue, aunswering by his Prophet to the people, who complained of the grieuous<note place="margin">O seas. 13.</note> calamities that did ouerpresse them: that he was by no meanes the causer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: as for him, he onely had procured their benefit and safegard, but that they were cause of their owne ruine, and of all the desolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that happened to them in their countrey. For as the fire kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth<note place="margin">Similitude.</note> but fire, and other things sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do produce things of their own qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and nature alike, so doeth God to, from whom can proceede none euill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is perfectly good. But then wil some man saye: why, sicknes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, famin, pouertie, dearth, &amp; warres, are not these euils &amp; plagues that God doth sende vpon vs, and is not he then the author and causer of them? God sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them in deede, as well vpon the good as the bad: on the one, to punish their sinnes, which is a verie good déede,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19841:13"/>
and a deede of Iustice: on the other to trye their patience, or to bring them to repentance. Thus if we would be good seruants and fitly applye these sicknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that God doeth send amongst vs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them to their right ende, wee should reape thereby much profit &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodly instructions. First then there is nothing so needefull, as to knowe our owne sinnes, the corruption and vice that is in vs, to the ende wee may hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selues before God, and dispose our selues to beseech and seeke his grace and fauour, the onely meane whereby they may be remitted couered and hid before him, that so wee may auoide and escape his iudgement, and the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which otherwise shall be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for vs, if our sinnes be not pardoned. But wee are so naturally blinded in our owne iudgement, by reason of the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue selfeloue that we haue in our selues, which doth blindfolde our eyes that wee cannot perceiue nor discouer the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, hipocrisie, false dealing, pride, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, defyance of one another, iniustice, impietie, idolatrie, inhumanitie, and all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19841:13"/>
this lumpe of wickednes which lurketh in our heart from our birth, &amp; hatcheth euery day more and more, as occasions shall serue to commit euil. For although we séeke to keepe close for a while the malice which we haue conceiued in our hearts as women do, which say they are not with chyld, till their bellie begin to swell, and til the daye of their deliuerie drawe neere, and then they must needes confesse that which before they stoutly denyed: So doe wee neuer confesie our sinnes vntil wee be by manifest proofes conuinced, and yet then wee stand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and diminish still some thing from the enormitie of our faultes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof we haue a notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in our first Parents, who when they stood before the face of God (from whom<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> nothing maye be concealed or hidden) their owne consciences accusing them, yet they sought by all craftie means they could, to counterfait and laye one from another the fault that they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; coulde not be induced, neyther by the feare and reuerence of God, who being present spake vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither by

the accusation and witnes of their own consciences which vrged them sore on euery side, but to confesse clearely and without any doubling, their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their ingratitude and ambition, by the which they were cast headlong from the happie &amp; blessed estate wherein they were a little before. Whereby we may see how harde a matter it is for men to acknowledge and confesse their sinnes sincerely and without hipocrisie.

By these few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples wee may easily perceiue, that men, although they beouer whelmed and filled with an infinite number of sinnes, yet they cannot acknowledge them, or haue feeling of them, if God do not giue them the grace to set them before their eyes. And this is the reason that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of holy Scripture <hi>Repentance</hi> (which partly consisteth in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and displeasure that man concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of his sinne) is called <hi>the gift of</hi>

            <p>But it is a meruaylous thing that our sinnes shoulde be diseases so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, so daungerous, and so mortall, and yet that they shoulde bee so little perceiued and regarded of those that are infected therewith: For wee see how Idolaters, hypocrits, ambitious, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaritious &amp; voluptuous perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are mery

And others thinke themselues neuer more happie than when they haue the full fruition and peaceable possession of the honours, riches and pleasures of this world which they desire so much: &amp; the cause of all this is, that they feele not their sicknes, the which is by so much more dangerous. For as among the diseases of the body none are more pernicious than those which bring least dolour and paine, as are the Palsies, Letargies, apoplexies, and other colde Cathars and tetters: for they are for the most part vncurable. This made an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient father say, that he desired not to be sicke at all: but if it chaunced that he

For that we hauing so oft offended him, since we haue bene lightened and regenerate by the knowledge of his truth, &amp; had so much fauour at his hands, besides, as to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into his family, and to bee adopted his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

God, to the which he doth attribute what good thing soeuer he did either thinke, or speake or doe in all his life. It is then the onely grace of God which is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and meane of life euerlasting, that wee hope for: as it is also of the righteousnes and holines of life, by the which we attayn vnto it.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19841:48"/>
This phrase of spéeche is very vsuall in the old Testament, to signifie the death of the<note place="margin">Iohn. 11.</note> Fathers. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> vseth it likewise wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

Séeing that seperating the soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, setteth the soul out of prison, and sendeth it to enioy liberty in heauen, there to be made much of in the bosome of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus christ, and to inioy with him and with all the happy soules, the eternall comforts promised and reserued for the elect people of God? The body on the other side liethe in the earth, as in a bed, there to sléep and

take his rest at his ease, being neuer wake or troubled in his sléepe, neither by feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dreames nor cares, nor feares, nor cries, noyses, or any thing els that maye disquiet the same, sléeping there til the day of the resurrection, when it shalbe waked<note place="margin">2.

               </note> by the sound of Gods Trumpet, and knit againe to the Soule, hauing left behind in the earth his mortality, dishonour, and weakenesse, hauing put on his robes of glory, power, immortality and corruption. Whereby we may sée, that it is without curse, that men feare so much this corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death: the which doth but seperate for a time the soule from the body, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great profite of the one and of the other. For the body is by this meanes out of all daunger, not onely of sinne, and of the miseries that waite thereuppon, but also of all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, remaining and resting in the earth, in certaine hope of the resurrection, and of the life euerlasting. And although it séeme to be altogether depriued of life lyinge in the earth, because that the soule being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from it, leaueth it without any mo uing or féeling, and it putrifieth and goeth into earth, yet being alwaies accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19841:50"/>
with the spirit and infinit power of God which quickeneth all thinges, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together void of life as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> saith: <hi>If the spirite of him which raised Iesus Christ vp from the dead, dwell within you. He also which hath raised him vp, shal also quicken your mortal bodies, because of his spirit which dwelleth in you.</hi> This is the reason, why in another place, drawing out vnto vs the portrature of the resurrection of our bodies to come, he brings in an example of the séede, which is cast into the earth, the which hath life in it, although being in the Garner, it semeeh to haue none, and holding it in our hands wee cannot iudge, but that it is a thinge dead and without life. Yet when it is cast into the earth, where a man would think the life, if it had any, would be smothered and taken away, it showes it selfe and growes, as it were, from the rottennesse from whence wee sée the eare commeth, which nourisheth and grows afterwards, shewing plainely by euident tokens the life that was hidde in it before it was cast in the earth. So God in the holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture<note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> caleth himself the God of Abraham,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19841:50"/>
long time after Abrahams death, and saith that he is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing. Then it followeth, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the soule of Abraham, which he redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the death of his Sonne, is yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, since it hath béen seperated from the Body: but that the bodye which is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the same redemption, which is knit and incorporate to Iesus Christ to be one of his members, and hath bene consecrated and sanctified vnto God, that he may dwel<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> therin as in his holy Temple, is not clean without life, although it be putrified in the bowels of the earth. For so much as it is alwaies accompanied with the grace of God, and iointly with the soule comprised in the euerlasting couenant, that hee hath made with his people, which couenant is a fountaine and vaine of life, not onely to the souls, but also the bodies of al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And if as <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> saith, they bee<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.</note> most happy and blessed which die in the Lord, and that no blessednes can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life: we must needes conclude the one of these two things: either that no blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes can come to the body, or els if it may come, that the body is not depriued and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19841:51"/>
void of all life lying in the earth. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be putrified and haue no signe of life in it at all, yet retayneth it in it selfe, as it were a séede and stack which shal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the day of the resurrection, when the spirite of God pouring out his infinite vertue on our bodies, shal raise them vppe againe, and shall make them shine with the glory and brightnes that hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised his elect. And euen as in an egge, there is a chicken, and a certain life which is euidently perceiued, when the hen hath heated and hatched it by her heate: so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and life euerlasting, whereof both our soules and bodies are called to bée partakers, from the time that we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Gospell of Christ (which is a worde of life and a séede incorruptible) shal shut vp till the last day by the power of our God, which shall then make vs newe<note place="margin">2.

Whereof we are also assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> by the baptisme that is giuen vs in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. For the water which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19841:51"/>
hath bene poured vpon our bodies, whiche the Scripture calleth the lauer of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is not onely to assure vs, that our soules are washt and purged cleane by the bloud of Iesus Christ, for the remission of our sinnes, but also our bodies, And that being both together couered and clad with the righteousnes and innocency of the son of God, and besides sanctified by his holye Spirite, they are by and by put in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life euerlasting, and altogether made frée and deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the slauery of death, which hath no power, as we said, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where sinne raigneth, which is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause of death. The holy Supper of our Lord in the which taking by faith breade and wine, which are giuen vnto vs by the handes of the minister, we are receiued to the partaking of the flesh and bloud of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and so vnited and incorporate<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> with him, that for euer (as <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> saith) he dweleth in vs and we in him, doth it not assure vs also that being inseperably ioyned with the life, and with him that is cause of life, wee can neither die either in soule or body, by reason of this vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is common both to soule and body? The
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19841:52"/>
death of the body ought not to séeme so hor rible, and hideous, as it doth vnto others, who are frighted as little children with a maske or false vizard. For if the mother should come to her childe with a monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vgly face to be séene, he would be afraid and runne away from her, crying: but so soone as shee should haue plucked off her false vizard, he would runne vnto her and kisse and embrace her. So muste wee doe, to bee deliuered from feare and frighting of death, wherewith we are naturally faised, wee must plucke off her maske and vizard, and must beholde it with that forme and face that Christ oure Sauiour did, when he ouercam death. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as by his Crosse he hath discharged vs of the curse vnder the which we were, and hath turned the curse into a blessing: So by his death hath he not onelie mortified, but also quickened our death, so that now it is become an hauen of health, and a dore to enter into the kingdome of heauen, and to take possession of that blessed life, which God hath promised to his elect children. That which doth cause vs to feare, is that wee doe behold it, in the mirrour of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19841:52"/>
lawe, where it doth shew it selfe vnto vs vnder a most terrible shape to beholde, and like a Sergeant armed with the anger of God, and with all the threats and curses set downe in the law against those that do transgresse the same, who commeth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his office and to cite vs to appeare presently before the iudgement seate, and to heare the sentence of the last and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Iudge, by whom we are sent vnto euerlasting fire, without any hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or euer to haue any other company, but with Diuels to torments vs. Which imagination if it come in our mind when we are ready to die, it cannot bée, but wée shall take such a conceite and apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that shalbe inough to ouerthrowe vs cleane, and cast vs downe into the pit and gulfe of desperation, if it should continue long with vs. But to get it away, wee must do as they who haue their eies daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by looking too long of one couller, that is twinkling and glimmering. To gette their sight again, they must cast their eies vppon some other couller that is more liuely for the recreation. So when we féele our selues brought into so dangerous a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19841:53"/>
case, by reason of the feare and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that the lawe causeth vs to haue of death, we must behold her face in the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> of the Gospell, where Iesus Christe setts it downe to be more swéete, well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored, and most amiable, where as Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in his lawe had made it most vgly and horrible to beholde: It hath nowe neuer a sting to prick vs, neither any cords, chains or bands to kéep vs vnder her iurisdiction: For Iesus Christ being risen from the dead hath broken them, as <hi>Sampson</hi> by a marueilous strength did breake (as man would breake a threade) the great cordes and cables wherewith the Philistines thought they had bound him so sure, and so manicled him, that they thoughte hee would neuer haue escaped their handes. Yet they were deceiued, for when they came vpon him with great fury and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, then they perceiued hee broke them all a sunder as easely, as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should break a litle string halfe burned a two. So death thought when she had made Iesus Christ to die, shee had ouercome all, and subdued all things vnder her power, and that shee had sette her Empire in so sure estate, so
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19841:53"/>
that it could neuer decay: yet shée founde her self vanquished and throne vnder féet, that shee shall neuer bee able to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19841:74"/>
their father kéepeth for them, and that Iesus Christ hath purchased for them. For his kingdome, (which is the riches that he hath promised vs) is not of this world, but heauenly. So the glory, power, estate, riches, honour, pleasure, counsell, peace and all the felicitie of this kingdome is altogether diuine and spirituall. Iesus Christ, who is the king, what temporall goods hath he possessed or purchased being in this world, where he was not maister of so much as the little birdes or the foxes are, that is to say, of a nest, a caue, or a hole to hide his head in? And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, who were the Princes of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, what reuenewes I pray you, or great possessions had they in this worlde? Saint Peter saide, speaking to the people<note place="margin">Acts. 3.</note> which lay at the gate of the Temple beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging an almes, gold &amp; siluer haue I none, but such as I haue, I giue thee: in the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> rise vp and walke. And S. Paule saith, we are as<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> poore men, and yet we make many rich, as hauing nothing, and yet possessing all things. We sée then hereby that the goods that God will enrich his children withall,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19841:74"/>
are not earthlie and corruptible goods which are subiect to théeues, to rust and mothes: but spirituall goods, certaine and permanent, which cost nothing, neither to get them nor to kéepe them. For God of his frée bountie doth bestow them vpon vs, and kéepe them for vs, and there is none that can take them from vs, but he himselfe, that which he doth neuer but by constraint, either through our ingratitude towardes him, or else by abusing them in applying them to some other end, then he appointed when he bestowed them vpon vs. The goods that we ought to make account of and purchase, and to take héede that we loose them not, are the heauenly riches, as the grace of God, our adoption, faith, the word of the Gospell, hope, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, patience, humilitie, the peace and tranquillitie of our consciences: and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ, which is the fountaine, from whence doe spring and flowe to vs all the graces, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and blessings of God. For so much as by it, and by the partaking there of we are reconciled and reunited vnto him, kept in his fauour and grace, whereby we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19841:75"/>
a hope certaine and infallible of life euerlasting, which is the very heape and fulnesse of all good, and of all the true feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie that wee can desire. It is thether then that wée must alwayes aspire, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must all the thoughtes of our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and all the desires of our heartes reach: this is our soueraigne good, and the marke of our blessednesse, and not this transitorie trash that maketh the possessours thereof nothing at all the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but is occasion that they become of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the worse, if they take not good héede as the Apostle sayth, making them<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19841:76"/>
that they are reuolted and gone out of the Church, haue none other answere to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse themselues and to collour their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie withall, but that they will not loose their goods, hauing rather to perish vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in kéeping them a little while, then bee saued for euer in forgoing them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they shew that they are farre from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the counsell of Iesus Christ, and from being anie of his disciples, whom he counselled that if their hand or foote offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them they should by and by cut them<note place="margin">Mat. 19</note> off and cast the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them, for it is better to goe into the kingdome of heauen halt and maymed, then hauing two hands and two legs to be sent into euerlasting fire: and likewise the eie is a part of the bodie which we account dearest, if it make vs offende, we must pluck it out, and cast it away: for it is better to be blind, and to enter into life with one eye, then hauing two to be cast into hell fire. What should we then doe with these temporall goods, when we perceiue that by them wee are withdrawne and holden backe from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Iesus Christ couragiously? Is it not more expedient and safer for vs to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19841:76"/>
breake through these snares, which hold vs so fast, and to escape awaie, then to tarrie, and being taken, to fall in to the handes of Fouler? <hi>Crates</hi> the Thebaile perceiuing that the goods he did possesse did withdraw his minde from the studie of Philosophie, and that the care that he had to looke after them, woulde not suffer him to haue anie leasure or libertie at all in spirit, tooke them and cast them into the sea: saying merily, he had rather they should be drowned, then that they should drownd him. And if a poore Pagan had done this for a desire hee had to attaine the knowledge of morall vertues and Philosophie, that he might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and gouerne the state of his life well: what should we doe that are Christians, instructed by the word and spirite of God, who haue the promises, and certaine and assured hope of life euerlasting, and of the kingdome of heauen, whereof we doe not doubt to haue the full sruition at the last. Let vs leaue then the goods of this worlde to worldlings, and to those that haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope, nor other Paradise but in this world. If we haue any goods let vs possesse them as though we had none at all, and let
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19841:77"/>
vs take but as much as will serue our turne, that is to saie: for our foode and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. That which Iesus Christe taught his disciples in the forme of praier that hée gaue vnto his disciples, where he teacheth them to demaunde nothing but their dayly bread. Condemning thereby all delicacies, excesses, licorousnes, wantonnes, sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, riot, and all other vaine superffui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this world: for the worlde as it is corrupted and excessiue in all things, doth not thinke it selfe riche but in superfluous things only: but the children of God must be contented with thinges néedfull for the bodie, &amp; must thinke themselues rich when they haue but crustes of Barly bread, or a few little fishes roasted, as our sauiour Iesus Christ and his disciples had: or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cake baked in the cynders, as <hi>Elias</hi> had: or Locusts as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish himselfe withall, and to cloath himselfe with a rugge coate made of Cammelles haire. In anie case they must possesse ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and must not suffer themselues to bée possessed by them. They must rule ouer them, and not be in subiection to them. To conclude, whether God giue them anie, or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19841:77"/>
whether he take them awaie, they must be as ready to leaue them, and to blesse and praise the name of God as well for the one as for the other, as that good man <hi>Iob</hi> did. The thirde concupiscence that is in the world, and is the most dangerous of all, is the concupiscence of the flesh, which <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> setteth downe at length in the booke of the Preacher, to shew y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it is most vsual, and the verie spring from whence all other vanities doe flowe. For there are few men in the world or none at all, who séeke not the pleasure and contentment of the flesh.

But man shall not continue in honour, hee is lyke the beastes that die.</hi> Some take great pleasure in hauing goodly gardens, orchards, closes, and fine smooth allies bordered rounde about with roses and swéete flowers, to haue shadowe and freshe aire in the Summer. Some in clothing themselues gorgeously, &amp; others
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19841:78"/>
doe spende almost all the daie in combing and curling their haire, in beholding theyr faces in glasses, in setting theyr ruffes, in perfuming themselues: many delyght to haue their houses furnished with riche and sumptuous houshold-stuffe, to adorne their halles and parlers with goodly hanginges of Tapistrie, with faire painted Tables, with costly séelings of beds, with exquisite couertures, with chaines of golde, and the richest imbrodery that they may find, with bedsteads of Iuorie, and abundance of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and golde plate. Others woulde haue their tables couered with the rarest &amp; most dainety dishes that might bee gotten for money, and the finest robes that might be come by, to dresse &amp; season their meate. Some delight to passe their time in good companie, to laugh and be merrie, to dance, to leape, and to do the things which are not decent to bee written or named. And what is all this but the markes, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, and trophees of the excesse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and vanitie of Christians. And we may saie of these, as it was said of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den image that <hi>Phryne</hi> a famous strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in <hi>Athens,</hi> caused to bee erected in the

But at this present daie amongst vs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, there is no house in the Cities, no village in the Countrie, where we may not beholde the armouries of the worlde, and of this vncleane spirite who is Prince thereof set vp, euen vpon the blessed Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both daie, which God hath reserued to him selfe, that in the same all the world shoulde thinke vpon nothing else, but sanctifieng and blessing his holy name.

They doe not onely make vs dul blockish and effeminate, but also make vs like to bruite beastes, and bring vs often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to our destruction. Let vs then take héede not to bee seduced by theyr flatterie and faire face.

As the silly bird &amp; fish are caught with the hooke, enticed vnto it, and deceiued by a baite which couereth the same. Let vs then take héede vnto them behinde and not before, as Aristotle most wisely doth admonishe vs: for as pleasures before séeme as fayre as Syrens, but if you looke behinde them, they drawe after them a long taile of an vgly serpent, the verie sight wherof would make a man afeard.

When we are debarred from these pleasures, and haue the vse of them no more, by reason of death, diseases. penurie, olde age, or by anie other meanes, we should reioyce as much as if we were escaped out of the handes of some cruell and outragious tyrant.

How great a ioy shall it bee then to vs when wée shall drinke our fill of the riuer of these plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? When we shall sée plainly the face
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19841:82"/>
of our God and sauiour Iesus Christ, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we shall sit at his table with the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob? When we shall heare the melodious mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke of Angelles singing continually, <hi>To the holy, holy, holy, great God of hosts be all praise, glorie and honour for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And lastly, when in stead of the Sun and Moone he shall make a perpetual light shine ouer them comforting them for euer. This pleasure shall bee (as Iesus Christe sayd) no momentarie thing, but a pleasure and ioy that lasteth for euer, and not as the pleasures of this worlde which fade awaie in time, and loose quickly their sauour, bée they neuer so great and daintie at their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. This we sée in many men daily by experience, who couet and desire many things eagerly &amp; verie vehemently, which when they haue once obtayned, and haue
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19841:82"/>
had their pleasure a little while, then this great heate beginneth a little and little to quench and diminish, and in the end is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether extinguished. And so it falls out of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes with vs, when we haue had our pleasure oftentimes of that which we haue with so great affection desired, we disdayne it afterward, and repent with great disple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with our selues, whereof we haue in the Scripture a notable example in Amno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sonne of Dauid, &amp; his sister Thamar.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13.</note> But the true pleasures that the blessed soules inioy in the kingdome of heauen are of another nature. For in satisfieng vs, they leaue vs alwayes in appetite, and in filling vs, they leaue vs alwayes hungrie: they quench our thirst, and yet we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thirstie: so that in contenting and satisfying all our appetites, they leaue vs still desirous to abide in the same estate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, so that we are neuer a wearie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. These are then the true plesures which we ought alwaies to desire and seke after, and not the pleasures of the worlde which are al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> but scuruie things. For as those which are full of the itch, whilest they are scratched haue some pleasure, and fele some
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19841:83"/>
ease, which lasteth but a little, whilest they are in scratching, and by and by vppon it there followeth a pain which vexeth them grieuously: so the voluptuous men haue neuer no pleasure but it is mixed with a thousand griefes and sorrowes. And theyr pleasure is much like that which they féele who are tickled, which hath a certayne vexation and feare which maketh them forget it and hate it by and by. There is yet one griefe more which may much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the sicke person, whereof he may bée eased: that is, hee feareth to be separated by death from the companie of his wife and children. The consolation that must bee giuen him, and the remedie that must be vsed for this, is to alledge vnto him the promises that God maketh to widowes, that he taketh them into his owne protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; promiseth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue especiall care ouer them, to defend &amp; vphold them against those that would oppresse them, &amp; to take a fearefull vengeance vpon those y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> should offer anie outragious iniuries towardes them. Likewise we must alledge vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> although that their wiues bee forsaken of their mortal husband, whom they haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoused
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19841:83"/>
in this world: yet they haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther husband in another world who is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, who is Iesus Christ, that shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer abandon them no more then al the rest of the faithful that remit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to him, &amp; relie wholy vpon him, who being so good a Tutor as he is, they being lefte vnto his protection can want nothing. Then must we shew him, that going out of this world, it is as if he and his wife should vndertake a voiage together, wherein the one should go before, and the other follow soone after. And lastly, as in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> beginning of their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he was not sorrowfull to leaue Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, to ioyne himselfe to his wife: so now hee should not be more sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull to leaue his wife to goe to God, who should be more deare vnto vs, then either fathers, mothers, wiues, children, or anie other thing. And as for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, hée must thinke vppon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that God made vnto him and them, that hée hath sealed and confirmed the same in the Baptisme of the one and the other: that is to saie, that hée wyll bee their God and the God of their posteritie. And that must assure him, that the graces
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19841:84"/>
and fauours that God hath bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, shall be continued vnto his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as he doeth promise expresly in Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, that he will shew mercie and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vnto thousand generations, to them that loue and feare him, and shall be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to keepe his commandements. What then can be wanting vnto those children, who being imitators of the faith and pietie of their parents, are assured by the promise of God to be alwaies enuironed and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his grace and bountie, which grace is the fountaine from which all prosperitie and blessings doe flowe vnto vs? Moses<note place="margin">Deut. 9.</note> sayth, that man doth not liue by bread one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by euerie worde that procéedeth out of Gods mouth. Which is not to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode of foode onely, but of all rhinges necessarie to mans life.

But let vs be readie to receiue him when he commeth, &amp; go with him into his rest. But forasmuch as the loue of this life, the swéetnes and pleasures of this worlde doe cast vs in a sléepe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, and distract our mindes from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of these things, to awake our selues, wee cannot doe better, then to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the houses of those that are visited by the hand of God, and the hospitalls and houses of God, not onely to sée and beholde on euerie side the examples and images of the corruption and mortalitie of our poore nature, to this end, that we may hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble our

selues, and containe our selues within the bounds of modestie: but also to put our charitie in vre in comforting and making strong the poore languishing and afflicted members of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>First, then we must shew them that all our diseases come from God, who sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, somtimes to correct vs &amp; bring vs backe from our wickednes, sometime to proue and make triall of our vertue. Giuing vs by this means matter and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make demonstration of the faith and trust that we haue in him, to craue his mercies by our earnest prayers and sorrowfull sighings, to acknowledge and confesse our faultes and offences by our griefe and displeasure. And to bring the sicke person so farre, to cause him to make an humble &amp; true confession of his sinnes, wee must first set before his eyes what is the spring and principall cause of all diseases, as well corporall as spirituall, and how that to heale them vp, hée must take awaie the causes that enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der them: that is to saie, our sinnes, from the which we cannot otherwise be deliuered, but by the remission and pardon that God doeth
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19841:86"/>
giue vs through his grace, so that as S.<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Iohn sayth, wee doe confesse them vnto him, and be assured, that Iesus Christ is our aduocate and propitiation to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by meanes of his iustice, by the which hée doth hide and deface them, so that they shall not be laide to our charge at the day of iudgement.</p>
            <p>And for that the loue which by nature we beare vnto our selues, doeth so blinde vs, that we cannot sée, or think our selues to be so vicious and corrupt as we are, we must pul awaie this vaile from before the sicke mans eyes, setting before him the lawe of God, wherein as in a glasse hée may view and behold all the course of his life, to make him know, that by the same, not onely all our actions, but also all our nature is condemned to be abhominable, naught and vicious.</p>
            <p>For proofe and confirmation hereof, we must alleadge vnto him in generall, that we are conceiued in sin, that we are all borne the children of wrath, that wée are but flesh and vanitie, that we are sold vnder sinne, that in vs there dwelleth no good thing, that our righteousnes is lyke
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19841:87"/>
olde rags, and filthie clothes. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we are altogether nothing but dust and rottennesse. Then must wee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto him all the commandements of God, and shew him particularly, that when he would examine himselfe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he should finde none of them, but hée hath oftentinms transgressed, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with those of the first table, to call to his minde.</p>
            <p>1 That he hath not done his best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour, to inquire after God, and to séeke to know him.</p>
            <p>That he hath not loued him with all his hart, with al his strength, and with all his soule.</p>
            <p>That hee hath not alwaies put his trust in him.</p>
            <p>That he hath oftentimes doubted of his promises, and mistrusted his aide and succour.</p>
            <p>That he hath trusted to the strength of the flesh, and such meanes that men might prouide, rather then to the succour and aide of God.</p>
            <p>That hee hath not looked for all his

prosperitie and increase, from the onely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and blessing of God.</p>
            <p>That he hath not alwaies called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him in all his actions, with full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and hope to be heard and helped of him.</p>
            <p>That he hath not alwaies dreaded and reuerenced him, as appertaineth to his high and soueraigne maiestie.</p>
            <p>That he hath not thanked him, and blessed his holy name, for all things at all times, and as well for his aduersities as prosperities.</p>
            <p>2 Then next, that thinking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon GOD, hée hath imagined him to bée vnder some humane and bodilie shape.</p>
            <p>That hée hath not conceiued him to bée a spirite incomprehensible, infinite, inuisible, immortall, impassible, immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, soueraigne in power, in bountie, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, iustice and veritie, as an example and myrrour of all vertue and perfection, the spring of all lyfe and light, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and fulnes of all goodnes, the heape of all happines and blessednes, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end of all things, who is all in al,

            <p>That he hath béene more curious of ceremonies and exterior shewes of piety, then of pitie it selfe, and rather to séeme a good Christian, then to be one in déede.</p>
            <p>And lastly, that he hath not alwaies thought in his minde, that the true &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruice of God doth consist in the only obedience of his will,</p>

            <p>That vpon small and light occasions he hath absented himselfe from the place of Conuocations and publike assemblies, ther to make publike confession and protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his faith, to shewe his deuotion and the feare of God that is in him, to edifie the congregation by his good ensample, and to make knowne to euerie man without any shame, feare, dissimulation and hypocrisie, the religion that hee will followe and kéepe, resoluing to liue and die in the same.</p>
            <p>That hée hath not laboured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and catechise his wife, his children, his seruantes, and all his familie, as a good Christian ought to doe, calling them morning and euening to Prayers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to reade and meditate the worde of God, to sing Psalmes, hymnes

            <p>That he hath not paide his worke men euerie daie theyr wages, but hath made them staie till the morow.</p>
            <p>9 That he hath not loued the truth in word and déed, doing nothing foolishly and vnaduisedly, but shewing a grauitie and sinceritie in all his affaires, customes and countenances, which should be worthie a man of truth and sinceritie.</p>

            <p>That he hath not béene so constant to confesse &amp; defend the truth against the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers and enimies of the same, nor so valiant to fight against those that by lyes and errors séeke to impugne the same, as he ought to be.</p>

            <p>10 Lastly, to shut vp his confession, we must shew him that all his nature, as also that of all other men that liue here on the earth, is most vile, vicious &amp; corrupt, and that of himselfe he can bring forth but bad fruit, as a bad trée doth: that is to say, all wicked thoughts, all inordinate affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens, all filthie and dishonest talke, and all things contrarie to the will of God: lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vndone all that is conformable to his will, and expresly commanded by him.</p>
            <p>Then when we haue shewed vnto him in this manner his faultes, to make him haue a better féeling of them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in himselfe a greater displeasure and

sorow for them, we must aggrauate them vnto him by the circumstances of place, time, and person, where hee hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them.</p>

            <p>Then must we discourse vnto him the reasons contained in this treatise, to take awaie the feare that he may haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of death, the deuill, the iudgement of God, and lastly the sorrowe that hée may haue to forgoe and leaue this worlde, and the things that are therein, in lieu of the hope and desire that he ought to haue of those heauenly &amp; incorruptible blessings.
