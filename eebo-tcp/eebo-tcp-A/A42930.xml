            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

others as well as my ſelf are happily deceived; in which caſe it will ſuffice to ſay with <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> That <hi>It is very hard for a man to be wiſe, that hath not been deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Method, it is as Regular as the Arguments would afford; though not ſo exact as might have been, if the ſame Metal had been caſt into another Mould; yet not ſo rude and out of ſhape, as to ſuſpect from the diſproportion of the Body that the Soul is ill lodged, or like ſome long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breath'd confuſed Diſcourſes, of late much in faſhion, whereof it may be truly ſaid as was once of the <hi>Romans</hi> two Ambaſſadours ſent to one of their Provinces, whereof one wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Head, the other lame in his feet, <hi>Mittit Populus Romanus Legatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quae nec Caput nec Pedes habet;</hi> and which for their prolixity and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicality may juſtly expect the ſame anſwer that thoſe of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> gave the <hi>Samnites, That they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the Beginning, underſtood not the Middle, and diſliked the Concluſion.</hi>

To leave the Laws <hi>ſub incognito,</hi> or Juriſdictions <hi>ſub incerto,</hi> are both of National ill conſequence, ſubjecting the people either to Tranſgreſſion through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or to unneceſſary expences by multiplicity of Law-Suits. <hi>Lux, Lex, &amp; Veritas,</hi> are almoſt <hi>Synonimous;</hi> if either of theſe ſuffer, though but a partial Eclipſe, how great is the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof; If a Juriſdiction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Law is but as a dead Letter, be uncertain, how great is that uncertainty? but the liquid and
<pb facs="tcp:97872:4"/>
clear ſtating and aſcertaining of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to their proper and reſpective Boundaries, beyond which one may not paſs to the invading of another, is one of the primary Conſtitutions of <hi>Jus Gentium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhort <hi>View</hi> of the <hi>Admiral Juriſdiction</hi> was in its Origination de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only to prevent a <hi>Vacuum inter alia negotia,</hi> and not to hazard the Cenſure of a <hi>Superfluum inter aliorum otia.</hi> And although a great part of this Fabrick, be laid on a Foundation of <hi>Civil Law,</hi> yet in regard it is an indiſpenſable duty which every man owes his Native Countrey, to keep, as much as may be, <hi>ſub incognito,</hi> from Strangers and Forraigners abroad, what poſſibly may not be abſolutely perfect (for there is no perfection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun) <hi>quoad modum procedendi</hi> at home, <hi>Sumus enim Surdi omnes in Linguis quas non intelligimus;</hi> And in regard this Treatiſe muſt recite the very Letter of certain Clauſes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Acts of Parliament, Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of State, and Book-Caſes of Common Law; And in regard the ſatisfaction of Merchants and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

was the main motive and deſign of emitting this to the Opinions of men; For theſe reaſons it could neither properly nor profitably ſpeak the <hi>Ideum</hi> of that Law, which is no leſs adequate to the Admiralty, then currant over all the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>The juſt Rights and Cuſtomes of the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty of <hi>England,</hi> are here with ſubmiſſion aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and conſequently therein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Priviledges of Merchants and Mariners; and not only of thoſe who have a Birth-right to <hi>England</hi>'s Laws of the Admiralty, but alſo of all ſuch, who negotiating with us, have a Right thereto by the <hi>Jus Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> and National Treaties. The Merchant is <hi>Bonum Publicum,</hi> and ſuch is that Nations Intereſt whoſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants do flouriſh, that to gratifie them with all poſſible immunities and due encouragement is now become the common policy of all ſuch King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and States, as reap more trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from their <hi>Ports</hi> then <hi>Paſtures.</hi> It was moſt true what <hi>Seneca</hi> once ſaid <note place="margin">

In the Law there are certain Perſons and Things Exempt from being Lyable or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Reprizals; They whoſe Perſons are Exempt, have alſo their goods Free. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals granted againſt any Kingdome or State, are underſtood as againſt ſuch only who inhabit therein, and not againſt ſuch who though originally of that Countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the Reprizals are, yet inhabit elſewhere, poſſibly in the ſame Kingdome whence the Letters of <hi>Marque</hi> iſſued; for he is not in this point reputed of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, State, Province, or City wherein he doth not inhabite, albeit he were born therein; It is not the place of a mans <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi> but his <hi>Domicill,</hi> not of his Origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but of his Habitation, that ſubjects him to Reprizals; the Law doth not conſider ſo much where he was Borne, as where he Lives; not ſo much where he came into the world, as where he improves the world; provided he hath there <hi>Decenniated</hi> or inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Ten years, or leſs, in caſe he hath born Office there, or paid <hi>Scott</hi> and <hi>Lott,</hi> or removed his Family thither, or his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or the greater part thereof, or is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized a Denizon of that Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Reprizals may not be Exerciſed on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, or ſuch as travel for Religion ſake, nor on Students, Scholars or their Books, or other Neceſſaries; Nor on Ambaſſadors or their Retinue; nor on Women or Children. Likewiſe Goods found with a Merchant of another place then that againſt which Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zals
<pb facs="tcp:97872:21"/>
are granted, albeit the Factor of ſuch Goods were of that place, are not ſubject to ſuch Reprizals; nor ought the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Place (though ſtrong enough for Condemnation where proof of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent property failes) prevail againſt fuller Evidence. Eccleſiaſtical perſons are alſo by the Canon Law expreſly Exempt from Reprizals; So likewiſe ſuch perſons, as by Storm or Streſs of weather are driven into Port, have an Exemption from the Law of Reprizals according to the <hi>Jus Commune,</hi> what the Edict of any particular State in that caſe may doe, is not here determined; But a ſhip or Goods belonging to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of another Prince, againſt whom Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals are granted, coming into a Port, of that State, iſſuing ſuch Letters of Reprizal, not by ſtorm or ſtreſſe of Weather, but to avoid Confiſcation for ſome delict commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at home in their own Countrey, may be ſubject to Reprizals in Port.</p>
                  <p>This Right of Reprizals (which as ſome would have it, anſwers to the <hi>Saxon Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam)</hi> is not only admiſſable in caſes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, or protelation of Juſtice, as when Judgement may not be had within the time preſcribed by Law, but alſo when Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is given plainly againſt the Law, and no Remedy to be had againſt ſuch wrong Judgement, either in the ordinary courſe <hi>per viam Provocationis A Appellationis ad J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

thus when the matter in Controverſie is <hi>tam quod merita quam quod modum proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi,</hi> not Doubtful, for in Doubtful matters the Preſumption is ever for the Judge or Court; But a wrong Judgement in matters not Doubtful muſt be redreſs'd one way or other, ſpecially if ſuch be given to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Foraigners, over whom the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Judge, though in his own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, is not ſo exactly the ſame, as over his own Subjects; And although it be a Rule in Law, <hi>Res judicata pro veritate habetur,</hi> yet it is as true, that <hi>Judex male judicans pro injuria tenetur;</hi> nor doth a Judgement or a <hi>Definitive</hi> diminiſh the <hi>merits,</hi> though it may alter the <hi>Caſe;</hi> Therefore <hi>Paulus</hi> the Lawyer held, that a Debtor, that is a Debtor indeed, though Judicially abſolved, yet by nature remains a Debtor ſtill; and therefore when this happens to be a Foraigners Caſe, he may (if all other Legal Expedients fail) for redreſs have recourſe to the <hi>Jus Gentium,</hi> which holds conformity with the Law of Nature. Subjects indeed may not by force oppoſe the Execution even of an illegal Judgment, nor forcibly proſecute their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed rights, and that by reaſon of the Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of that Power and Authority which is over them, the Subjects obedience being in the Emphaſis of the Magiſtrates Authority: But yet Foraigners can fly to the <hi>Jus Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium</hi> to Right themſelves by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, which they could not effect by any Legal proſecution, ſo long as their Right is
<pb facs="tcp:97872:22"/>
reparable by Judgment according to Law, but infeazible by reaſon of the denegation or protelation of Juſtice, contrary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular proceedings of Law.

By the Law of Nations all the Subjects of the Dominion doing wrong, whether Natives or Strangers making their aboad there, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of Reprizals; whereby 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Strangers not permanent there, nor under any of the aforeſaid qualifications, are excepted; for Reprizals being in their nature <hi>quaſi onus Publicum,</hi> are introduced for the ſatisfaction of Publick Debts, to
<pb facs="tcp:97872:22"/>
which Strangers, that are meerly ſuch, are no way obliged; indeed to the Laws of the Land, where their preſent being is, they are ſubject, but yet are not Subjects.

not ſeaſoned with ſufficient reaſon, is held but as an unſavoury derivation, from the great improbability that any in impoſing of <hi>Names</hi> ſhould quit the thing it ſelf, wherein the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated is moſt inherent, and flie only to the more remote qualities thereof; As if you ſhould ſay that the <hi>Admiral in rebus Maritin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <note n="c" place="margin">Spelm. Gloſs. verb. Admiral.</note> So that if you offer this Derivation, though <hi>cum grano vel mica Salis,</hi> it will not paſs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore others are of opinion that it is derived from the <hi>French [Ameral]</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an high Officer or Magiſtrate in Sea-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; But this is as if you ſhould ſay, <hi>(to keep to the Metaphor of a Liquid Element)</hi> That Ice diſſolved is the Mother of Water, rather then Water frozen the Mother of Ice; No doubt but <hi>[Ameral]</hi> in <hi>French</hi> now ſignifies ſuch an high Officer or Magiſtrate; but where was that <hi>French</hi> word <hi>[Ameral]</hi> when the Office of <hi>Admiral,</hi> by other Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions almoſt <hi>homophonous</hi> to that, was in being, but not in <hi>France?</hi> That Office by other Names Appellative not much diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to this of <hi>Admiral</hi> was anciently known in the world, when no ſuch thing in <hi>France;</hi> for the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves anciently had not theſe <hi>Admirales</hi> (for ſo then called) till <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in whoſe time <hi>iſti Admirales Magiſtratus creati ſunt;</hi>

the <hi>Great, Anno</hi> 330. So that it may be truly ſaid that this high Officer or Magiſtrate in Sea-affairs is in the <hi>French</hi> now rendred by the word <hi>[Ameral;]</hi> But not that the word <hi>Admiral</hi> is thence derived.</p>
                  <p>Therefore others conceive it is derived from the <hi>Saxon Aen Mere eal,</hi> that is, <hi>over all the Sea.</hi> This paſſes for a currant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation and expoſition of the word <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> with us; poſſibly becauſe it ſounds both ſo <hi>prettily</hi> and <hi>pithily;</hi> for we are now as apt as our Neighbours t'other ſide the water to be <hi>alamoded</hi> as well with fine words as other vanities. Yet this being a derivation of our own <hi>Generation,</hi> it may not be much controverted, ſpecially for that others as well as thoſe of our own Nation, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the word <hi>Admiral</hi> to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the <hi>Saxons,</hi> with whom the word <hi>[Hadmiral]</hi> doth ſignifie <hi>Praefectum maris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others there are who will have it derived from neither of theſe, but from the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, [Admirantes]</hi> for that in the Infancy of that Empire there were <hi>Quatuor Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, hoc eſt, Militum Praefecti, qui ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra marique pugnarent.</hi>

To this might be added King <hi>John</hi>'s Ordinance made at <hi>Haſtings,</hi> touching the Soveraignty of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Seas in the point of ſtriking Sail or veiling Bonnets by the veſſels of <hi>Forraign</hi> Nations to the Kings Ships; which Ordinance was made long before the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and wherein mention is likewiſe made of the high Admiral of <hi>England;</hi> But this that hath been ſaid, may abundantly ſuffice both to prove and illuſtrate the Antiquity of the high Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of <hi>England,</hi> and his Juriſdiction in matters Maritime.</p>
                  <p>If it be granted, that <hi>Fruſtra ſunt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma foris, niſi est Conſilium domi,</hi> it cannot well be denied but that <hi>Frustra ſunt Arma domi niſi est Dominium Maris,</hi> to which as undeniably may be added, that <hi>Frustra eſt Dominium Maris, niſi est Jurisdictio domi.</hi>

If therefore the Ancient Rights of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Admiralty of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould at any time happen to be impeded by ought, not ſo properly qualified Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to conſerve the Rights of the <hi>Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the <hi>Brittiſh Seas,</hi> might not a Decay of Trade, that <hi>Cornucope</hi> of all National Proviſions, be juſtly ſuſpected? ſpecially if Neighbour-Nations ſhould thence pretend to ſpy any thing like a flaw in <hi>Englands Trident,</hi> as if her <hi>Dominium Maris</hi> were in part diſmantled; the <hi>Plenty</hi> as well as the <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of theſe Kingdomes, much (under God) conſiſting in the Power of the Royal Navy, thoſe <hi>Pyramids</hi> of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> or <hi>Floating Gariſons.</hi> The <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium &amp; Jurisdictio Maris</hi> are ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, you cannot prejudice the one, and not the other; And therefore to ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that Juriſdiction, thoſe Ancient Rights, whereby our own are conſerved and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, may not be convenient; So that to doubt whether the eſtabliſhed Juriſdiction of the high Admiralty of <hi>England</hi> may judge of Marine Properties, is implicitely and in effect to inferre, that the Navy Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is equipped only to enamel the Seas and take the Air, or that their Captures at Sea muſt evaporate; if Bargains and Sales made <hi>ſuper altum mare</hi> can transferre and alienate properties, then doubtleſs the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty can finally judge and determine thereof.

The Authour of the Book entituled, <hi>Rights of the Kingdome,</hi> hath ſeveral Paſſages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Office and Juriſdiction of the Admiralty, whereof one is <hi>(pag.</hi> 90.) That <hi>Edgar</hi> that Great Monarch, was as great a Conquerour by Sea, as <hi>Aethelstane</hi> by Land; That it might be eaſier to ſhew his four Seas, then to ſet their exact Bounds. But in <hi>(pag.</hi> 132.) he is pleas'd to ſay, that the Law Maritime is <hi>Dark</hi> enough, with all the Juriſdiction of the Court Admiral; (So is the Sun to him that <hi>will</hi> not ſee) where he farther ſeems to pleaſe himſelf with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That that Office may be harder then the Name, by calling it a ſtrange mixture of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Arabick.</hi> Yet for the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the ſaid Office, he doth the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty that right, as withal in the ſame place to aſſert, That the old Ms. <hi>del'Office del' Admiral</hi> hath divers Records of <hi>H.</hi> 1. <hi>Rich.</hi> 1. and King <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaking of Trials by twelve (as at Common Law) But that now the practice is much otherwiſe.

And then adds, That in <hi>Edward</hi> the third the Rolls are full of that Office. And ſo proceeds, That in <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. it was brought to a Weldy <hi>(that's the Epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite it pleaſes him to afford it)</hi> Model.

ever ſtraighter much, then ſome may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Alſo that they were again diſputed in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James.</hi> And then he is pleas'd moſt facetiouſly to add, That it lies more open to the <hi>Common Law,</hi> then to the <hi>Wind.</hi> Yet withal he doth not there conceal, but that beſides the Laws of <hi>Arthur</hi> the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and <hi>Edgar</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> we have ſome Records of Cuſtome by <hi>Sea</hi> as well as by Land; with Priviledge to ſome, below the King, before the <hi>Norman:</hi> whom they make the <hi>Founder,</hi> yet he was (in the ſaid Authours judgement) but <hi>Patron</hi> of the <hi>Ports,</hi> and <hi>Wardens</hi> of the Sea. And the ſame Authour, ſpeaking of the Sea-ſtatutes of <hi>Rich.</hi> 1. how that they were made, <hi>de Communi probarum virorum Conſilio,</hi> refers to the very expreſſion of the Charter it ſelf; in <hi>Hovenden, Wendover,</hi> or <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> who doth add, that <hi>per Conſilium Magnatum,</hi> there were made <hi>Juſticiarii ſuper totum Navigium Angliae,</hi> &amp;c. which with divers Records of <hi>Henry</hi> the third may be added to the <hi>Admiral:</hi> or <hi>Saxon Aen Mere eal, Over all the Sea.</hi> To which much might be added from the Rolls of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97872:45"/>
Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> if you have retroſpect to the Honour thereof in Precedent Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Antiquity can witneſs with what effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual ſucceſs (if not to the <hi>nonplus</hi> of Neighbour-Nations) the <hi>Dominium Maris Brittanici</hi> hath been from Age to Age Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially aſſerted; If you conſider the plenty and ſplendour of a flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the preſent Generation cannot yet forget to give ample teſtimony thereof in reference to the Trade and Commerce of this Nation; And if you will not be ſo irregular as to deny the Conſequence that naturally flowes from theſe Premiſes, you cannot but inferre this Poſitive Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, That the ſucceeding Generations are like to ſuffer as well an Eclipſe of their Honour, as an Abatement of intereſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the influence of that Juriſdiction; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch <note place="margin">Car.

But in a word, the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> may not unaptly be compared to that Tree in the Iſland of <hi>Fierro,</hi> being one of the <hi>Sept. inſulae</hi> of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> which as <note place="margin">Purch.</note> 
                     <hi>Historians</hi> tell us, doth with the droppings of his leaves yield water for the ſuſtenance of the whole Iſland; It is farther added, that the <hi>Moors</hi> having taken that Iſland from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> attempted to fell down that Tree, but each blow recoyled on the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.

but a temporal baniſhment. And as they differ in the Circumſtance of Time, ſo alſo in the Circumſtance of Place; For in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation</hi> the party is only circumſcribed, and it's part of his puniſhment that he ſhall not go out of the limits of ſuch a certain place. So <hi>Shimei</hi> the <hi>Benjamite</hi> that curſed <hi>David</hi> in his way to <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> was after <hi>Davids</hi> death confined by his ſon <hi>Solomon</hi> unto <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>

But now in <hi>Deportation</hi> the party is not ſo confined to or circumſcribed by any certain place, but is quite baniſhed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled out of all the precincts of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Again, in <hi>Deportation</hi> the party can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take his goods with him, in <hi>Relegation</hi> he may; but this difference holds not always.

                  <p>A <hi>Prohibition</hi> in the ſenſe moſt adequate to the purpoſe in hand, is a Writ forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to hold Plea in a Matter or Cauſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be without the Juriſdiction and Cognizance of that Court where the Suit depends; <hi>Sir</hi> Thomas Ridley <hi>calls it a Commandement ſent out of ſome of the Kings higher Courts of Record, where Prohibitions have been uſed to be granted in the Kings Name, ſealed with the Seal of that Court, and ſubſcribed with the Teſte of the chief Judge or Juſtice of the Court, from whence the Prohibition doth come, at the ſuggeſtion of the Plaintiff, pretending himſelf to be grieved by ſome Eccleſiaſtical or Marine</hi>

For though all Fictions, whether Legal or illegal, may be Surmizes, Suggeſtions, or Suppoſitions, yet all Surmizes or Suggeſtions are not illegal Fictions; And many of the Suggeſtions uſed in the Practick part of the Law for the end aforeſaid, are both true, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable, and poſſible, and conſequently probable, and ſo of good and neceſſary uſe in practice, according to the Law in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Prohibitions in that behalf provided.

                  <p>For the yet clearer apprehenſion of the premiſes, it may be no digreſſion to inſert a word by way of caution to the imperfect Notioniſt, that he would not hence infer as if the Law did <hi>feign impoſſibilities,</hi> becauſe it ſuppoſes the <hi>living</hi> to be <hi>dead,</hi> and the <hi>dead</hi> to be <hi>alive;</hi> the <hi>abſent</hi> to be <hi>preſent,</hi> and the <hi>preſent</hi> to be <hi>abſent;</hi> and the like.

of <hi>fact</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> of <hi>perſon</hi> and of <hi>place,</hi> without their right and due diverſifications; yet they are not <hi>impoſſibilities,</hi> being rightly according to the Law of Fictions diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reſpect of fact, time, perſon and place, together with ſuch tranſactions, tranſlocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tranſtemporations, and tranſperſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as according to Rules of Law are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to every Fiction that enures to any effect in Law; For that which may ſeem <hi>Deceptio intellectus,</hi> and by miſ-apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion poſſibly be taken for an <hi>impoſſibility</hi> in the precedent inſtances of a Legal Fiction, is in truth nothing but that defect or abſence of verity in the perſon, act, thing, manner, time or place feigned; Indeed, to look for <hi>Truth</hi> in a <hi>Fiction,</hi> is to expect an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi> with as much vanity as ſome men do for <hi>Revelations:</hi> if it were poſſible that there could be the leaſt <hi>verity</hi> in the thing <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> it would immediately ceaſe to be a <hi>Fiction.</hi> Legal <hi>Fictions</hi> may be aptly ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The juſt Policies of Law,</hi> to attain unto the end and effect of Law by remedies extraordinary, only where the ordinary means do fail.

And where it is ſaid to be a ſuppoſed Agreement, and that it had not been delivered to the then Judges, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have heard the ſame read over in His Majeſties Preſence; And to which Anſwer was then made, <hi>That for ſo much thereof as differeth from thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, (viz.</hi> to the other Objections then made) <hi>it is againſt the Laws and Statutes of this Realm: And therefore the Judges of the Kings Bench never aſſented thereunto, as is pretended, neither doth the phraſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of agree with the tearms of the Laws of the Realm.</hi> This was the Anſwer then given to that Objection grounded upon the ſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. Whether the ſame were no more then ſuppoſed, may be referred to the matter of Fact; wherein, if ſo, the <hi>evidentia rei</hi> will eaſily liquidate the ſcruple, and diſſipate
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97872:105"/>
dubieties. Though the ſaid Agreement be diſagreed, yet the Law like the Axis of the Body Politick, remains fixed notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the rotation of opinions; And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo much thereof, as differed from the Anſwers then made to the other Objections, were repugnant to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, or the phraſe diſcrepant from the tearms thereof, would be more viſible upon an Inſpection, were it free to inſert that as an Imprinted Agreement here, which is called but a ſuppoſed Agreement there; Therefore to inquire how far the ſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement made, or ſuppoſed to be made, in one age, may be obligatory in another, may poſſibly have an implication of more verity and reality, then the thing it ſelf with general conſent doth or may challenge; yet being in ſubſtance Conſonant to the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Reſolutions upon the Caſes of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Juriſdiction, and being an Objection long ſince under a former Impreſſion, with the Anſwer thereto as aforeſaid, it may be now a leſs Tranſgreſſion to omit the Thing it ſelf, <hi>ſaltem in terminis,</hi> then Digreſſion to have given this ſhort hint thereof, <hi>quaſi in nubibus.</hi>
