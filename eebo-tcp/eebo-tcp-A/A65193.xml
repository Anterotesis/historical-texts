         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> may fall by this Viſitation, yet is the Lord here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

this Peſtilence is the Harbinger of that Saviour, and High-One,

               <p>Hence God expoſtulateth with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Amos 4. 10, 11. <hi>I
have ſent amongst you the Peſtilence, after the manner of Egypt,
&amp;c. yet have ye not returned unto me. I have overthrown ſome
of you, as God overthrew Sodom, &amp;c. yet have ye not returned
unto me. Therefore will I do thus unto thee, O Iſrael; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I will do thus unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi>
And indeed this is not only conſiſtent with, but contained in
the New Covenant, ſo to correct; if need be, to take away
the heart of ſtone, and to make us partakers of his Holineſs.
And when I ſeriouſly conſider what he did to his dear <hi>Moſes,
Eli, Job, David, Aſaph, Hezekiah, Joſiah, Aſa</hi> and others, for
leſs provocation, I fear much what the Lord may do with me
and others of his Children, after ſo long Gentleneſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Forbearance, as neceſſary to vindicate his Name,
which we have polluted before the Heathen to their hurt:
Yea, O the Pride, Senſuality, Covetouſneſs, Meanneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency,
empty Formality and Fruitleſneſs in the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Worſhip of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, Apoſtacy, Perjury, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
Hypocriſie, and yet Impenitency under all, that might
intercede againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the day! What reaſon is there
upon all, to ſigh therefore, and ſmite upon the thigh before
their eyes, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 6, 12. and to be apart in the Spirit
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35459:5"/>
of Grace and Supplication, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. Yea, every one
(though upon the higheſt mountains of Faith and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to be like Doves in the Valleys, all of them mourning,
every one for his iniquity, preſcribed of God for eſcape from
the Peſtilence and other calamities, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 16. &amp; 9. 4.
O therefore that poor ſinners alſo with <hi>Iſrael</hi> may imbrace
the advice in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 10. to <hi>enter into the Rock, and</hi> there
<hi>hide in the duſt, for fear of the Lord, and the glory of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</hi>
And, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 22. to <hi>ceaſe more from man, whoſe breath
is in his noſtrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Yet, as
it becomes all humbly to do what they can in a day of ſuch
Calamity, I ſhall more particularly caſt in my Mite towards
the Cure of this Contagion, with my diſſent from, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt two things directed by the Colledge-Doctors.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The CURE.</head>
               <p>In ſpeaking to the Cure, I ſhall firſt ſhew what is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to effect it; 2dly, What is; and laſtly, giving thoſe that
have worthily gone before me, their real due in the preſcript
of outward Medicines, I ſhall caſt in my Mite of that ſort al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
in addition only to any thing I have ſeen, without detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from any, or ſeeking gain, or the honour which is from
men, I truſt, but that which is of God only.</p>
               <p>It is not then firſt to look to the Phyſicians, how able or
eminent ſoever, wherein good <hi>Aſa</hi> failed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 12.
and hath but too many followers. Neither would this ſort at
any time (and much leſs now) be, as other diſeaſes, much
abated by all the Doctors in the world, except to humbled
ſouls, as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to whom then poor <hi>Iſaiah</hi> went, and may
go again ſucceſsfully with his bunch of Figs, which gave a
reverence to the uſe of outward means, but in the ſecond
place. Though (till God weary them with his hand) it's
feared men will arrogate his Healings to their Art, when in
tender mercy to his People, or for further probation, it may
in a moment ceaſe, or be abated, as at this time in <hi>Holland;</hi>
not (I believe) as the effect of the Pouder, nor Perfume, ſo
much boaſted of in every <hi>News-book,</hi> I am perſwaded to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35459:6"/>
further provocation and infection, which hath doubled week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſince the publiſhed ſtories of the <hi>infallibleneſs</hi> thereof, which
conſiſts (I fear) but in the filling the purſe of ſome of the
Projectors. And as to the publick Order of the Colledge-Doctors,
though I could wail over the view of thoſe ſtrong-ſcented
Ingredients of Pride and Preſumption in the latter
part of their Epiſtle, as tending to the infection of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
beyond their skill to avoid or cure; and others that
have them in too high eſteem, to fulfil the Word of the Lord,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 17, 18. Yet I count my ſelf, for my Country and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-ſake,
obliged humbly to witneſs againſt two principal
parts of their Advice only: with reverence indeed to moſt of
their Preſcripts, which yet exceed neither their fore-fathers,
nor add much, if any thing, to the common knowledge, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and experience of an ordinary man, in this day of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the face of the covering that hath been over the face of
all Nations.</p>
               <p>But firſt, their Advice of obſerving Church-Orders for
Prayer, as in former times, I deſire may be carefully mingled
with the Counter-Poiſons of the Scripture-diſcoveries alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
laid down concerning Falſe-worſhip and neglect of true,
as principal cauſes of Contagion, ſo as the former times they
ſpeak of may be explained to be ſuch, as <hi>Phineas, Moſes,</hi> and
<hi>Samuel, Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job, David, Jehoſhaphat, Iſaiah,
Hezekiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah,</hi> &amp;c. or men of like ſpirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
in Solemn Interceſſion acceptably to turn away
Wrath from a provoking Generation; and no times wherein
the wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the Land,
which is on record to be to Viſitation and Ruine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 29,
30, 31. elſe their Direction is hereby diſſented from.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly; I humbly diſſent alſo from their Direction
for <hi>ſhutting-up</hi> unto ſuch oppreſſion and hazard of both ſick
and well, ſhut up, and others, as is unavoidable ruine to
many after the manner thereof, and ſo an high provocation
to him, who hath torn, and who onely can heal; who hath
ſmitten, and can bind up, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 1. and who viſiteth with
Peſtilence (as I have ſhewed) for violence, and (I fear) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
it for ſuch continuance thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:35459:6"/>
Now becauſe ſome careleſly dream of Scripture-colour in
the caſe, I ſhall ſhew you firſt how cruelly remote it is from
that caſe.</p>
               <p>2dly. <hi>How much it errs from that ſtanding Rule amongſt
men,</hi> Mat. 7. 12. Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that
men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them: for this is the Law
and the Prophets.</p>
               <p>3dly. What ill effects it naturally hath towards the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Plagues.</p>
               <p>4thly. Appeal to the experience of all, reflecting upon
former and preſent times, both in this and other Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Nations.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the Scripture-caſe is only in the Plague of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie,</hi>
when the party onely apparently viſited was to be
viewed by the High-Prieſt, or his ſons; and being found by
him, or them, to be ſo, was in ſpecial over-ſight to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the reſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſhut-up but for ſeven dayes,
to be viewed then again by the High-Prieſt, &amp;c. and if found
whole, to be cleanſed and reſtored preſently, or otherwiſe ſo
ſequeſtred for ſeven dayes more, until ſuch recovery, <hi>Levit.</hi>
13, at large, but not to be ſhut up after. And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> alſo
being cured of his ſore, on the third day was to appear in the
Houſe of the Lord, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 5, 8. Nor is the Scripture
colour for ſhutting-up one well-perſon, not the ſick after
ſuch recovery, upon ſuch weekly view of him, if the caſe in
hand held parallel: but well ſaith the Scripture, <hi>The world by
wiſdom know not God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 21. and this their way of being
wiſer than God, is as the tender mercies of the wicked, <hi>Prov.</hi>
12. 10.</p>
               <p>2dly. It ſo errs alſo from that Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. that I
dare ſay the Doctors, and thoſe who ſtand upon their Sword to
execute this <hi>violent Advice</hi> upon the Poor ſo generally, would
not be willing to be ſo done unto, or have their Wives and
Children ſo dealt with in their calamity: <hi>And he that rolleth
a ſtone</hi> ſo againſt the very nature of humanity, may fear <hi>it
will return</hi> again <hi>upon him,</hi> Prov. 26. 27. Let me ſuppoſe thex
caſe therefore to their conſciences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:35459:7"/>
Whether, if four or five, or more, of the skilfulleſt and
hardieſt of themſelves, who have given this Advice as Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
againſt ſo many thouſand poor Innocents, were to be
coobed-up in one of the poor houſes, whereout but one dyed,
and have with them an old woman, or ſome poor ignorant
creature (a ſtranger to them, as is uſual) for their Nurſe, and
a ſturdy fellow without with an Halberd (or ſome ſtricter
Watch, as they have adviſed for others) to have each of them
no more than the Pariſh allows; and the Searchers, Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have allowed to viſit others, to viſit them: if in
a month or forty dayes after the laſt man of them dies, at ſuch
a ſeaſon, ſo uſed, they do not think in their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
with all their skill, their carcaſſes would all or moſt of
them be carried away in the Night-Cart; which now (for
fear thereof) are, many of them, got into their Country-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
after their <hi>Epiſtolary Vapour</hi> and <hi>Cruel Direction</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid?
How then may poor. Women with child, Widows, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
friendleſs, Fatherleſs and Sucklings, expoſed (without
ſuch help, as many have been) and half dead before, it may
be by the ſudden death of their firſt viſited neareſt relation,
eſcape the ruine of ſuch further violence upon them?</p>
               <p>Again, I query; If one in the Pariſh-Meeting-place fall
ſuddenly ſick, or dye, after ſitting there in the crowd two or
three hours amongſt the multitude; were it not as equal the
doors ſhould be ſhut upon the Aſſembly, or they in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
houſes ſhut-up, as that ſome Families (who were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off from the ſingle ſick perſon that dyed therein) ſhould
be preſently ſo violently uſed and expoſed? O ſurely, if we
would not be ſo done unto, theſe wayes then are unequal,
and this violent courſe not like to abate our Plagues, but is
rather a ſign and earneſt of further Wrath: And God by
leaving the Nation to be in love with ſuch <hi>unnatural Advice</hi>)
is, it's to be feared, paving a way for his Anger, in that more
general ſhutting-up, as a juſt Judgment upon many accounts,
propheſied of ſuch a provoking City, <hi>Iſa. 24. 10, 11, 12. The
City of confuſion is broken down, every houſe is ſhut-up, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3dly. It's full of evil effects, to the encreaſe of Plagues,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35459:7"/>
and that not only as it provokes God as aforeſaid, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
diſtracts men, filling them with horror of heart, both
thoſe that are ſhut-up, and thoſe that live daily in the fear
thereof; Moſt that are ſhut-up being ſurprized, unprovided,
unſetled in heart and houſe, needing then moſt the uſe of a
<hi>ſure friend, made for the day of adverſity.</hi> Pro. 17. 17. <hi>An Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job 33. 23. one of a thouſand, &amp;c.</hi> and are
under ſoul-ſinkings, and none to ſuccour them; their <hi>hearts
dye within them,</hi> as <hi>Nabals,</hi> upon this bad news; not a friend
to come nigh them in their many, many, heart and houſe cares
and perplexities, compelled (though well) to lie by, or upon
the Death-bed (perhaps) of their dear relation, drag'd away
before their eyes, afrighted children howling by their ſide,
fitted by fainting affliction to receive the impreſſion of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
fearful thoughts of the long night they have to reckon
before releaſe, after the laſt of the Family, ſo diſmally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
ſhall ſink by degrees, one after another, in the den of
this diſmal likeneſs to Hell, contrived by the Advice of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi>-Colledge of Doctors: no drop of water (perhaps)
but what comes at the leiſure of a drunken or careleſs Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert-bearer
at the door: no ſeaſonable adminiſtration being
at a certainty then for their ſupport, and innumerable evils
of this ſort incident hereunto: whereof if the ear of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
were opened to the cry of the Poor herein, I could
(upon knowledge) inſtance and give plentiful proof of one
months miſery and ruine already hereby upon many, enough
to make the ears of every one that heareth, tingle; and lay
the blood of Innocents at the door of the Deviſers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
of this Barbariſm; who alſo hereby bring no ſmall
conſternation hourly upon the minds of thoſe who are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
thoughtful (to terror) whoſe turn may be next to fall out
of the overſight of their neareſt Friends, into the hands of
the Halberd, Searchers and Chyrurgion, all ſtrangers to them,
ſo as it may be plague enough to be haunted with, under ſuch
diſtraction and affliction. Hence (I ſay) are a thouſand
thoughts created, to ſuch, ſwoondings, faintings, fears, (fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for infection naturally) as have occaſioned ſome already
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35459:8"/>
to loſe their precious lives, and many have hardly eſcaped
the effect thereof; who otherwiſe would not ſo dread the
Viſitation, that yet ſink down and ſhiver now through fear
hereof, but upon the ſudden ſight of a Houſe ſhut-up, and
cluſters of little Children and tender ones in their windows,
who might more rationally continue well by ſeparation as
they are able, or might be adviſed by a more charitable care
of them, than by ſuch miſerable, noiſom, melancholy, cloſe
impriſonment, which expoſeth the <hi>Well</hi> (ſhut-up) daily to
deſtruction, and alſo doth really but prepare a more unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable
ſtench, and feſt to wreak out of the windows (whilſt
ſo ſhut up) and diſperſe it ſelf into the City by a more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
concourſe to them at the window (though leſs to their
relief) and by opening the doors (upon ſuch choaking-up)
for the Searchers and Bearers of the Dead (ſo daily more
prepared for them) and other allowed Viſitors, whoſe walks
are far more perilous than twenty times ſo many left open to
keep themſelves clean and at diſtance from the Sick and
Dead, as elſe they would, to prevent their own infection.</p>
               <p>Yea, after the Houſe is allowed to be open, and all that are
left alive are well after this uſage, both they and it are far
more dangerous hereby to others, than before, they were
crouded up ſo long to ſuch a naſty and infecting ſtation, being
the natural and artificial way alſo hermetically to effect the
moſt forcible and noiſom putrifactions, when the <hi>Embrio</hi> ſhal
be unſealed; common experience having proved it naturally
leſs perilous to go to twenty viſited, kept ſweet and clean,
than to two ſo noiſomly expoſed.</p>
               <p>To which I may add, that many for fear thereof do hide
their Sores, and (after a Sweat or two) their Sickneſs alſo,
and go daily about their buſineſs ſo long as they can ſtand,
mingled to much more danger every way: Nor dare any do
the office of a Nurſe or Friend to thoſe ſhut-up (however ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
for the preſent diſtreſs) till help can be procured
(whereby ſome have been neglected) becauſe it is ſo pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l,
that they muſt be incloſed then themſelves, how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
ſoever to their charge and buſineſs, by which there
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35459:8"/>
comes no ſmall inconveniency to the Sick, who are forced to
take any ignorant Nurſe (or worſe) in haſte, to their great
hazard.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, I appeal to the experience of this and other
parts; how apparantly did the hand of the Lord reſt (as the
antient Citizens familiarly do obſerve) in the former great
Plagues upon this City, when the people were wearied out
of this oppreſſion, under cauſe enough to mourn unto this
day, over the cruelty every mercinary had opportunity to
commit (as now) under colour hereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> alſo, about the year 1650, and 1651. (under a far
greater Contagion) was made aſhamed hereof, and forced to
deſiſt; and what ſhould now encourage it, under a weekly
doubling the deſtroyed, under (if not directly by) it, ſince the
Doctors gave this Advice?</p>
               <p>And ſome affirm the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> from whence the Plague
is ſo ſoon (it's ſaid) departed, never practiſed it, but ordered
the Inhabitants of houſes viſited, to walk and air themſelves,
with ſome mark of diſtinction, at times appointed: and yet
<hi>I will ſhew you a more excellent way</hi> for the quick and thorow
Cure thereof, now poſitively, if it be not for too long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
tranſgreſſion and impenitency irrecoverable, as in

               <p>Alſo for Julip, either the plain Poſſet before mentioned
(before the other ingredients be in it) or without the Wine,
take ſixty drops of Spirit of Sulphur; with it only you may
turn three pints of Milk to a clear Whey, ſtirring it gently;
ſweeten it with ſyrup of Citron, or Oranges, or Wood-Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,

of their practice to their uttermoſt capacity, to reach the head
of the Malignity within the bound of diſcretion (though out

the handſing theſe edge-tools on the other hand ignorantly.</p>
               <p>Jellyes of Harts-horn and Ivory made in White-wine

(with coolers) as Marigolds plenteouſly, Sweet Majorum,

               <p>In their Broath alſo of Sheepſhead (if they take my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice)
a ſpoonful of Vinegar ſometimes may do well, or four
drops of the spirit of Sulphur, about which the extravagant
boaſt of <hi>Mindererus</hi> in his 18th Book <hi>de Peſtilentia,</hi> may (with
my own long experience of it) excuſe a ſober commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Of which, and Spirit of Vitriol, he thus ſpeaketh;
<hi>There is no Putrifaction whoſe neck they break not, no Infection

               </p>
               <p>I have alſo long uſed, and commend this Tincture, having

Ivory, Wormwood and Roſemary, equal parts of each; put
them into a Glaſs, pour into them Spirit of Sulphur ſix oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Spirit of Vitriol two ounces; ſhake them often, and
let them ſtand for uſe cloſe waxed. Of this or the like (as
you can get them) in dangerous obſtructions, turn Poſſet-drinks
as aforeſaid, with eighty drops to two quarts of Milk.
Of late, ſince the Contagion, Ladded to my Glaſs as much

I am ſure it would help Suppuration, and ripen ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and cheriſh the Riſing. But they do well to refer much
to Chyrurgions herein: And the Antient had need to give
the younger Chyrurgions good Inſtructions in Caſes that
have not come in their time. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chyrurgions (at laſt,
in the failer of other Applications) uſed to lance a multitude
every morning with good ſucceſs; which I adviſed lately to
ſome that do well, when certainly ripened; but leſt they
ſhould be too quick or ſlow, requires their skill to judge, and
conſcientious care, as they are tender of Lives. But Mr.

and ſave them much labour; and I take leave to advantage
it with an offer of Salt of Tobacco, where it may be had, in

quickly; by which, or only mixt with Emollients and Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
I have ſuck'd out incredible quantities of the thinner
matter preſently, and the very root, or laſt core, ſoon after,
when it hath lain very deep in the fleſh: But ſometimes the
Patient hath not been able to ſleep for the anguiſh, in which
caſe the Poultice, with Mallows, Lilly-roots, Figs, Lintſeed,
with Hogs-greaſe, or Palm-Oyl; may be laid by night, and
the other again in the morning: or white Bread and Milk,

The Patient muſt be ſure to keep his Bed carefully till the

               <p>And if the Swelling be too ſluggiſh, or by any accident

conſultation, whether the applying a Cupping-Glaſs to it
