            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS we are <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> we are all incorporated into one Body, and though diſtinct and different Families, Fortunes, and Qualities, yet <hi>fellow Members</hi> and <hi>Coheirs</hi> of one and the ſame <hi>Birthright;</hi> not onely by <hi>nature,</hi> as we are the Sons of men, (nature obliging all in one Common and equal Bond of Freedom and Unity,) but by certain <hi>ſacred Laws and Cuſtomes</hi> of peculiar and inherent Right to this Nation; <hi>general, equal, and impartial to all,</hi> without reſpect of perſons, rank, quality, or degree, derived through all ſucceſſions of Ages, by the blood Juſtice and Prudence of our <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> to us their poſterity, as <hi>ours,</hi> and the <hi>Right</hi> of our <hi>Children after us,</hi> not <hi>diſinheritable:</hi> though this Age were wholly made up of Apoſtates and Traytors to Common Juſtice and Freedom, and ſhould make ſale of, and deliver up their Children as ſlaves and vaſſails, yet <hi>Engliſh Right abideth,</hi> to wit, <hi>our juſt Lawes and Liberties,</hi> and may juſtly be reinforced as opportunity may preſent; <hi>Sometimes they ſleep but never dye,</hi> their <hi>total Extinguiſhment</hi> is not to be imagined ſo long as any <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh-blood</hi> abideth: and whoever undertaketh, (though by Arms, or otherwiſe,) their recovery and redemption is juſtified in that very Action by the Laws of God, of Nations, Nature, Reaſon, and by the Laws of the Land; and within the Bowels of our Nation amongſt our ſelves no War can be juſtified, but upon <hi>that ſcore,</hi> the contrary is Sedition, Murder, Treaſon, Tyranny and what not, and the Inſtruments thereof no other in the Eye of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Freedom and Right, but as Bears, Wolves, and other Beaſts of prey.</p>
            <p>Now right worthy and noble Citizens, and all other our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Brethren, let us conſider and lay to heart the ſad and deplorable condition of our native Countrey: Oppreſſion, Injuſtice, and Tyranny raigneth; Diviſion, Diſcord, and Diſſimulation fomented and foſtered; Trade and induſtery diſcouraged, our Land rent into parties and factions, and the Common Band of Unity Cancell'd, our Fundamental Laws ſupplanted, High Courts of Juſtice introduced, the blood of War ſhed in times of Peace; Arbitrary and illegal impriſonments, Pattents, Monopolies Exciſe, and other payments brought upon us, and continued Contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Petition of Right; no form or face of Government of <hi>Engliſh Conſtitution</hi> amongſt us; the name and Authority of the People in Parliament uſurped and abuſed, and the ſtamp thereof put upon ſtrange and prodigious Actions, vexing and oppreſſing the people with dayly Changes and Alterations in Government, as the Intereſt of ſome few ambitious Grandees alter and change, or get advantages one of another, and all under the <hi>Name of a Common-wealth,</hi> when as the <hi>Nature</hi> is not practiſed or intended at all, it being utterly inconſiſtent with their very temper and intereſt; they are wrapt up and compounded of nothing but guilt blood and Tyranny; and Equal and Common Juſtice (the Eſſence of a Common-wealth) are utterly repugnant thereto; and whatſoever they can doe muſt be planted and maintained by Sword and violence againſt the very Heart and Sence of the Nation; and they know not where nor how to centre an Oligarchy or ſomething they would have to be Maſters of the People, and perpetuate their power and Tyranny, and therefore would amaze and confound us with their New Debates of a <hi>Coordinate Power,</hi> or <hi>Senate for Life,</hi> ſuch as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws and Liberties know not of, and of pernitious Conſequence to this Nation; ſo that from theſe men that thus handle the Sterne at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> there is no expectation of any juſt Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace, or Freedom from oppreſſion; eſpecially conſidering, the Apoſtacy, Hypocriſy, Deceipt, and Perjury of thoſe men, their manifold Sollemn Engagements, Oaths, Vows, Proteſtations, Appeals unto Heaven; Promiſes, Remonſtrances, Declarations all by them broken again and again, never keeping Faith, Truce, or Oath, being unbounded, unlimited, Certain to nothing, not to be held either by the Law of God, of Man, of Conſcience, or Reaſon; <hi>and from ſuch Perſons in Government good Lord deliver us,</hi> and all the good people of <hi>England;</hi> and that all this is true of them, your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences Noble Citizens, and all other the Free people of <hi>England</hi> can witneſs, there is no tongue, no pen is able to vindicate them in this point, it is known of all, owned by all, and can be denyed by none; how then can any honeſt or juſt man ſhed any blood in their Quarrel, or lend them Aſſiſtance? ſurely that blood will be required at their hands, and we doubt not but you will be careful what you do.</p>
            <p>And therefore from thoſe Conſiderations and juſt provocations we have taken up Arms in purſuance of, and Inquiſition after our Government, Laws, and Liberties, that every <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> may be protected and ſecured in his Religion, Liberty, and Property; and though it may be ſuggeſted, that we intend to introduce <hi>Proſecution for Conſcience</hi> into the Land again, we do hereby (in the preſence of Almighty God) proteſt and Declare <hi>againſt all Coercive Power in matters of Religion,</hi> and that to the utmoſt of our ſtrength (through Gods Aſſiſtance) we will endevour to the hazzard of our Blood and Fortunes the Freedome and Protection of all virtuous and religious People, by what Name ſoever differenced from us, Equal with our ſelves: And that no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign or other other Authority ſave onely the Civil be exerciſed in <hi>England:</hi> That the Practiſe of the Law be reformed; all Corrupt Statutes repealed; Annual Elections of all Officers and Magiſtrates, with the Conſtant Succeſſion of Parliaments reſtored; our Fundamental Laws cleared and aſſerted, and whatever is contrary there to to be aboliſhed: That no Tryals be admitted in <hi>England</hi> for Life, Limb, Liberty or Eſtate but by the good old way of <hi>Juries,</hi> and that they be reſtored<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to their Original power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and purity: That all Extrajudicial and Illegal proceedings by High-Courts of Juſtice, or otherwiſe, with all Illegal and Arbitrary Committees be ſtrictly provided againſt: That the Exciſe, and all other Payments and Taxes ſuch as our Anceſtors never knew of, together with all Monopolies and Pattents deſtructive to Trade and the Common Good of the Nation be alſo aboliſhed: And, that our Parliaments and Magiſtrates be ſecured from all Force and Violence; and utterly cleared from all boundleſs Prerogative, and unlimited Priviledge: That the Right of the Poor in the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> all Donations for Charitable Uſes, and all Lands formerly belonging to the People be reſtor'd again: And that Mercy and Juſtice be truely eſtabliſhed amongſt us. And for theſe ends, and what elſe may be of publick good to the Nation, we do deſire, and indeed challenge as of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Right, the ſpeedy Election of a <hi>New Free Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, Moſt noble Citizens, Brethren and fellow Free-men of <hi>England,</hi> we have dealt truely and plainly with you, and given you the real Grounds and Reaſons of our taking up Arms; looking upon you as the moſt concern'd in the Nation, and therefore hold our ſelves the more oblieged to give you this <hi>Early Advice</hi> of our Candid and Juſt intentions in this Undertaking, that you may not be deluded or frighted (though falſly) into any ſtrange opinion of us, either through your own miſtake, or by the pollicy of thoſe men who will leave no means unattempted to render us as Publick Enemies, Rebels and Traitors, Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, Tyrants and Perſecuters, or whatever is odious and monſtrous, to engage you in Blood.</p>
            <p>Beleeve us, Right worthy Citizens, and Free-born <hi>Engliſh</hi> Brethren, we have no Deſigne of <hi>Fire or Sword,</hi> or of Evil toward you or your City, or any part of the Nation, or any perſon in it: We know there are thouſands amongſt you that are ſatisfied in us; it may be indeed that many or moſt of the Gathered Sepeate Churches may be fearful and jealous of us, and ſo may be induced to Arms againſt us; but we do again and again proteſt before Almighty God, and the whole World, that we have no other purpoſe towards them, but that they with us, and we with them, may be bound up as Friends and Brethren in the Common Cauſe of our Countrey, that every <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> may have <hi>Engliſh</hi> Freedom and Right; and we do not deſire to wrong either Man, Woman, or Childe the worth of a Shooe-latchet: Therefore we hope you will firſt well adviſe before you proceed in a new War, leſt you bring not only your own, but others blood on your heads (for we are reſolved to proſecute this to the laſt drop of our blood.) The <hi>Caſe of England</hi> is laid before you, <hi>our Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> they are yours as well as ours, and for which we have all engaged in the firſt War, and not to be ſo ſtreightly vai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Therefore we beſeech you, we conjure you as <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, to ſtand by your <hi>Native</hi> Countrey, and your Countreys Cauſe: Our voyce is, and it is no other than the Conſent and Voyce of the People, <hi>A New Free Parliament, A New Free Parliament;</hi> it is the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mans <hi>main Birthright,</hi> which we are reſolved to put the People in poſſeſſion of, or to periſh with our Swords in our hands.
