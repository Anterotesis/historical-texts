            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have hitherto been very ſparing in delivering my opinion, concerning the point, now moſt in agitation, <hi>viz. Of the lawfulneſs, or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, of Subſcribing the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement:</hi> conſidering the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that muſt needs have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, if it ſhould be once noiſed abroad, that I had given forth any determination, in ſo tickle a point. I could not but foreſee on the one ſide, if I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151688:4"/>
ſhould condemn it as utterly unlawful, how I ſhould be looked upon, by thoſe that have all power in their hands, not as a refuſer only; but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwader alſo of what they have thought fit to require: And on the other ſide, if I ſhould allow it in any caſe Lawful, what ill uſe would certainly be made thereof by multitudes of people, apt to be ſo far ſcandalized thereby, as either to ſwallow it whole without chewing, (that is, reſting themſelves upon the general determination of the Lawfulneſs, to take it hand over head, without due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, either of the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, or of other requiſite cautions, and circumſtances)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151688:4"/>
or elſe to conceive themſelves by ſo engaging, to be for ever diſcharged from the bond of their former <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſince by your Letter, and by ſending your Servant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with on purpoſe, ſo many dayes journey, through unknown wayes, and at this ſeaſon of the year (eſpecially as the weather hath proved, ſince his coming forth) ſcarce paſſable, you have ſhewn your earneſt deſire to underſtand what my opinion is in this point; ſo great, both for difficulty and concernment; I could not think it fit, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that civility which is to be uſed, eſpecially towards Strangers, to ſend back your meſſenger, without the return
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151688:5"/>
of ſome kinde of anſwer: Wherein, albeit I ſhall not come up to the ſull, of what your Letter declareth to be your deſire, <hi>viz. In giving a particular Judgment, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the</hi> Eight <hi>ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, therein propoſed, and the additional</hi> Quaere <hi>in the Poſtſcript:</hi> yet you ſhall find ſomething, tending towards your ſatisfaction therein, by touching upon thoſe points (ſo farr as the ſtraits of time would ſuffer) wherein the difficulty of the whole buſineſs, ſeemeth chiefly to conſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that <hi>Allegiance</hi> is a duty that Every Subject, under what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151688:5"/>
form of Government ſoever, by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> oweth to his Countrey, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Soveraign Power thereof. For the very ſame Law (which we may call the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> at leaſt in a large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation) which inclineth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, to grow into one civil body of a Common-wealth, muſt neceſſarily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, imprint a ſenſe, and tacite acknowledgement of ſuch a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior member of the body, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Caput Communitatis,</hi> or Soveraign Power, by which that Common-wealth is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as is neceſſary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whole body. So that the bond of <hi>Allegiance,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:151688:6"/>
doth not ariſe originally from the <hi>Oath of Allegiance;</hi> as if thoſe that had not taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> had a greater liberty, to act contrary to the <hi>Allegiance,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>cified in the <hi>Oath,</hi> then thoſe that have taken it, have: or as if, in caſe the <hi>Oath</hi> ſhould be quite laid aſide, there ſhould be no <hi>Allegiance</hi> due. But it is ſo intrinſecal, proper, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial a duty, and (as it were) fundamental, to the relation of a Subject, <hi>quâ talis,</hi> as that the very name of a Subject, doth after a ſort, import it; In ſo much, that it hath thereupon gained, in common uſage of ſpeech, the ſtyle of <hi>Natural Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance:</hi> Whence all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences will follow.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:151688:6"/>
1. That the <hi>bond</hi> of <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> (whether ſworn or not ſworn) is in the nature of it <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>indiſpenſable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is ſo inſeparable, from the relation of a ſubje<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> that although the exerciſe of it, may be ſuſpended by reaſon of a prevailing force, whileſt the Subject is under ſuch force, <hi>(viz.</hi> where it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, how the endeavor of exerciſing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſerviceable to reſtore the Soveraign Power to the right owner, for the eſtabliſhment of that Publick Juſtice and Peace, wherein the happineſs of Common-wealths conſiſteth) yet no outward force can ſo abſolutely take it away, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151688:7"/>
it, but that ſtill it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vertually in the Subject, and obligeth to an endeavour (ſo ſoon as the force that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it is over) of actually exerciſing of it, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the party, to whom of right it is due, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the common good thereby, upon all fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That no Subject of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that either hath, by taking the Oathes of <hi>Supremacy</hi> or <hi>Allegiance,</hi> acknowledged; or that not having taken either Oath, yet otherwiſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or believeth, that the <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to whom his <hi>Natural Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> is due, is <hi>the King, his</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:151688:7"/>
               <hi>Heirs, and lawful Succeſſors,</hi> can without ſinning againſt his Conſcience, enter into any <hi>Covenant, Promiſe,</hi> or <hi>Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or do any other <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> whatſoever, whereby ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to transferr his <hi>Allegiance</hi> to any other party, to whom it is not of right due, or to put himſelf into an incapacity of performing the duties of his <hi>bounden Allegiance,</hi> to his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraign, when it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be uſeful, and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That therefore the taking of the late <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> by any Subject of <hi>England</hi> (notwithſtanding the Proteſtation in the Preface, that therein he <hi>had the Honour</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:151688:8"/>
               <hi>of the King before his eyes;</hi> and that expreſs clauſe in one of the <hi>Articles</hi> of it, wherein he ſwore, <hi>The Preſervation of the Kings Perſon and Honour)</hi> was an act as clear contrary to the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> and the <hi>Natural Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of every Subject of <hi>England;</hi> as the <hi>Aſsiſting of the King to the utmoſt of ones power</hi> (which is a branch of the Oaths) and the aſſiſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any perſon whatſoever, with his utmoſt power, thoſe that were actually in Armes againſt the King (which was the very end for which that Covenant was ſet on foot) are contrary the one unto the other.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And that alſo for the ſame reaſon, no Subject of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151688:8"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> that hath taken the Oaths, and underſtandeth them, or is perſwaded that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of this, Realm, doth of right belong to the King, his Heirs, and lawful Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, can without ſinning in like manner againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, take the <hi>Engagement</hi> now offered: if he ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words, wherein it is expreſſed as if they did contain in them, and require of the Promiſer, an acknowledgment that the Supream Power of this Realm, whereunto the Subjects ow their <hi>bounden Allegiance,</hi> is rightly reſted in thoſe perſons that now exerciſe it; or as if they did import, an utter abjuration, or renouncing of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151688:9"/>
that <hi>Allegiance,</hi> which was formerly held due to the King.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This being cleared, the next enquiry muſt be, Whether or no <hi>the words of the Engagement,</hi> will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably bear ſuch a conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to the underſtanding of a rational and conſcientious Man, may ſeem conſiſtent with his <hi>bounden duty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to his lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign? Whereof (I think) there need be no great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, if it be well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all expreſſions by words, are ſubject to ſuch ambiguities, that ſcarce any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151688:9"/>
thing can be ſaid or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any words, how cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telouſly ſoever choſen, which will not render the whole ſpeech capable of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions than one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That very many men, known to be well affected to the King and his party, and reputed otherwayes both learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſcientious (not to mention the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> moſt of whom, truly for my own part, when we ſpeak of learning and conſcience, I hold to be very little conſiderable) have ſubſcribed the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who in the judgment of Charity we are to preſume, would not ſo have done, if they had not been perſwaded
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151688:10"/>
the words might be underſtood in ſome ſuch qualified ſenſe, as might ſtand with the duty of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the King.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That (as you write) it is ſtrongly reported and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the King hath given way to the taking of the Engagement, rather than that his good Subjects, ſhould looſe their Eſtates for refuſing the ſame. Which as it is a clear evidence, that the King and they who are about him, to adviſe him, do not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the words of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, as if they did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily import an abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Allegiance</hi> due to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo 'tis (if true) a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great confideration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151688:10"/>
the ſatisfaction of ſo many, as out of that fear only, have ſcrupled the taking of it. For the doing of that, cannot be reaſonably thought to deſtroy the Subjects <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance;</hi> which the King, who expecteth <hi>Allegiance</hi> from all his Subjects, adviſedly and upon mature deliberation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth them to do.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But all this being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the words of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, are capable of ſuch conſtruction; yet is not the Conſcience thereby fufficiently ſecured, from juſtly ſcrupling at the taking thereof, unleſs it may yet further appear, that the Subject hath the liberty to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151688:11"/>
make uſe of ſuch a conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is in effect the <hi>Quaere</hi> contained in your Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether upon ſuppoſition, that the words of the Engagement, will bear more conſtructions then one, the ſubſcriber may take it in his own ſenſe, or is bound to take it in the impoſers ſenſe? or, Whether it be neceſſary, or expedient before he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, to ask thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his ſubſcription, in what ſenſe they require him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it? Upon the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which <hi>Quaere,</hi> ſince (as I conceive) the laſt reſolution of the Judgment, wherein the Conſcience is to acquieſce, doth principally depend; I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151688:11"/>
ſhall endeavor to give you my thoughts therein, (wherein I acknowledge to have received much light and ſatisfaction, from a diſcourſe written by a very Learned, Judicious and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friend, whereof I lately had the peruſal, but for ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not thought fit to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed) as diſtinctly, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the time I have to do it in, will ſuffer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, for a man that is required of another to give faith by ſome <hi>Oath, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> or other <hi>Engagement,</hi> to take it in a ſenſe of his own, manifeſtly different (even in his own apprehenſion) from the others meaning, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed by words, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151688:12"/>
to the common cuſtom of ſpeech, and the nature of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs which it concerneth, is ſo groſs a conceit; that had not the impudence of the Jeſuits, in maintaining the lawfulneſs of their Equivocations, and the ſad experience of theſe late times, (wherein thouſands have chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves in perjury, by thinking to avoid it) evidenced the contrary, it n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght well have been thought a thing incredible, that any man of common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſhould ſuffer his reaſon to be ſo infatuated by his affections, as to be deceived thereby. For if ſuch latitude of conſtruction, ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Promiſes, and other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of that nature, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151688:12"/>
for the preſervation of faith amongſt mankind, there would not remain any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means, whereby for men to have aſſurance of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother meanings. Wherefore I take that for a clear truth, That all Promiſes, and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances wherein <hi>Faith</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be given to another, ought to be underſtood, <hi>ad mentem imponentis,</hi> according to the mind and meaning of him, to whom the faith is to be given; ſo far forth as the meaning may reaſonably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by the nature of the matter about which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, and ſuch ſignification of the words, whereby it is expreſſed, as according to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151688:13"/>
ordinary uſe of ſpeech amongſt men, agreeth beſt thereunto. The reaſon whereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the faith ſo required to be given, is intended to the behoof, and for the intereſt of him that requireth it; namely, to the end he may have the better aſſurance from him that giveth the faith, that what is promiſed ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly performed: which aſſurance he cannot have, if after his meaning, ſufficiently declared by the words, it ſhould yet be at the liberty of the promiſer, to reſerve ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecret meaning in his own breaſt, differing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:151688:13"/>
2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> what if the intention of the Impoſer, be not ſo fully declared by the words, and the nature of the buſineſs; but that the ſame words may in fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, be ſtill capable of a double meaning, ſo as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in one ſenſe, they ſhall bind <hi>to More,</hi> and in another <hi>to Leſs?</hi> I conceive in ſuch cafe it is not neceſſary, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes expedient (but rather for the moſt part otherwiſe) for the Promiſer, before he give faith, to demand of the Impoſer, whether of the two is his meaning. But he may by the rule of Prudence, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151688:14"/>
that (for ought I ſee) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the violation of any Law of Conſcience, make his juſt advantage of that ambiguity, and take it in the ſame ſenſe which ſhall bind <hi>to the Leſs.</hi> And this I ground upon the very ſame reaſon as before; For ſith the Faith to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is intended to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof of him, to whom it is given, it concerneth him to take care that his meaning be expreſſed in ſuch words, as will ſufficiently manifeſt the ſame to the underſtanding of a reaſonable man. Which if he neglect to do, no Law of Equity or Prudence, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Promiſer, by an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151688:14"/>
overſcrupulous diligence, to make it out, whereby to lay a greater obligation upon himſelf, than he needed to doe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But then <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if it ſhall happen (as often it cometh to paſs, when we have to deal with cunning men, and may poſſible be the Caſe now, and undoubtedly was ſo in the buſineſs of <hi>the Proteſtation,</hi> when the time was) That he that requireth the faith to be given, do of purpoſe ſo contrive the words, that there may be left an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity and latitude of ſenſe therein; yea, and that it be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151688:15"/>
very probable, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner apparent, (upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or other ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, ariſing from cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances or otherwiſe) even to the apprehenſion of the promiſer himſelf, that he hath ſome farther reach in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that promiſe from him, ſome more remote and ſecret intention, then he is willing to diſcover. In that caſe, What is to be done? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the Promiſer in ſuch caſe, is no wayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in giving his Faith, to take notice of any ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but is at liberty to make uſe of that Latitude of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151688:15"/>
ſenſe, which the other, did rather chuſe to leave unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, then to reſtrain, and ſo to turn the others cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dealing to his own beſt advantage, by taking it in the more favourable conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and that which bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>to lefs.</hi> For it is <hi>the declared intention</hi> only, <hi>(viz.</hi> That which the words, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common uſe of ſpeech, do in relation to the nature of the ſubject, moſt naturally and properly repreſent, to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of reaſonable men, when they hear them) and not to the remote, ſecret, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved intent,</hi> which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151688:16"/>
is obliged unto. The reaſon whereof is manifeſt; Becauſe he that requireth Faith to be given from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by words of his own contriving, is ever preſumed ſo to have determined the ſenſe thereof, in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the words, as may ſufficiently declare, what he intendeth the Promiſer ſhould aſſure him to perform. If therefore he have not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the words, as to ſignifie <hi>the More;</hi> it is in all reaſon to be preſumed, that he intended to oblige him but to <hi>the Leſs.</hi> For being at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to make his own choice of words, whereby to expreſs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151688:16"/>
his own meaning; who can think otherwiſe, but that he would make the choice with reſpect to his own Intereſt? And therefore though he might have a ſecret deſire, which he is loath to diſcover, that the Promiſer ſhould be bound to <hi>the More,</hi> and would be marvellouſly well pleaſed, that he ſhould ſo underſtand the words, as if they intended to bind him to <hi>the More:</hi> Yet ſince it had been ſo eaſie a matter for him, by adding or altering a few words, to have declared that intent, if he had thought it conducible to his own ends, It will be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alſo, that it was out of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:151688:17"/>
reſpect of ſelf intereſt, that he forbare ſo to do, and choſe rather to leave his meaning, in ſuch general words, as will not exclude the ſenſe, which bindeth but to <hi>the Leſs;</hi> and conſequently that his declared intent obligeth to no more but <hi>to the Leſs only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. To bring the matter yet cloſer, and to put it up to the preſent Caſes, there are yet two things more to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſhew what the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conſtructions <hi>(the higheſt,</hi> I mean, and <hi>the loweſt)</hi> the words of the Engagement are fairly capable of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:151688:17"/>
And <hi>Secondly,</hi> to find as well as we can, Whether of the two is more probably the meaning intended by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, to be declared by the words.</p>
            <p>The words are theſe:</p>
            <q>
               <hi>I do promiſe to be true and faithful to the Common-wealth of</hi> England, <hi>as it is now eſtabliſhed without King or Lords.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Wherein there are ſundry am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the words <hi>true and faithful;</hi> by which may be intended, either the promiſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151688:18"/>
of that <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> (which was formerly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be due to the King, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> to be now performed to thoſe that are preſently poſſeſſed of the Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as their right and due. Or elſe that promiſe <hi>of ſuch a kind of fidelity,</hi> as Captives taken in the Warr promiſe to their Enemies, when they fall under their power; <hi>viz.</hi> to remain true Priſoners of warr, and ſo long as they are in their power, not to attempt any thing to their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the word <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> by which may
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151688:18"/>
either be meant, thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are the <hi>prevalent party</hi> in this Kingdom, and now are poſſeſſed of, and do exerciſe the Supreme Power therein, as if the right of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty were veſted in them: Or elſe, the <hi>whole intire body of the Engliſh Nation,</hi> as it is a Civil Society or State within it ſelf, diſtinguiſhed from all other Foraign Eſtates. Taken in the former ſenſe, the fidelity promiſed to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> relateth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the upholding of that party who are the preſent Governors <hi>de facto,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſubjection to them as <hi>de jure:</hi> But taken in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151688:19"/>
latter, it relateth to the ſafety of the Nation, and importeth no more, as to the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, but to live peaceably under them <hi>de facto,</hi> and to yield obedience to them in things abſolutely neceſſary, for the upholding Civil Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety within the Realm; ſuch as are the defence of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Foraigners, the furtherance of Publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the maintenance of Trade.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the words <hi>as it is now eſtabliſhed,</hi> &amp;c. which may be underſtood either by way of approbation, of what hath been done by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151688:19"/>
way of aboliſhing Kingly Government, and the Houſe of Peers, and placing all Authority and Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realm, in the Houſe of Commons. Or elſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> only, as a clauſe ſimply and barely reciting what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Government it is, that this Nation <hi>de facto,</hi> is now under; <hi>viz.</hi> a Government by the Commons only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either King or Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Which Ambiguities conſidered; <hi>The higheſt conſtruction</hi> that can be reaſonably made of the words, is to this effect. I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151688:20"/>
acknowledge the Soveraign Power of this Nation, whereunto I ow Aliegiance and Subjection, to be rightly ſtated in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, wherein neither King nor Lords (as ſuch) have, or henceforth ought to have, any ſhare; And I promiſe, that I will perform all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and ſubjection thereunto, and maintain the ſame with my fortunes and life, to the utmoſt of my power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>loweſt conſtruction</hi> that can be reaſonably made of the ſame words, is to this effect: <q>Whereas for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Supreme Power in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151688:20"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> under which Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er I now am, is actually poſſeſſed and exerciſed by the Houſe of Commons, without either King or Lords; I promiſe that ſo long as I live under their power and protection, I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive or attempt any act of hoſtility againſt them: but living quietly and peaceably under them, will endeavor my ſelf faithfully in my place and calling, to do what every good member of a Common-wealth ought to do, for the ſafety of my Countrey, and preſervation of Civill Society there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:151688:21"/>
V. Now cometh in to be conſidered in the laſt place, the great Queſtion, whether of the two conſtructions it is, <hi>(That</hi> which bindeth to the <hi>Moſt,</hi> or <hi>This</hi> which obligeth to the <hi>Leaſt,</hi> the words can well bear) that the formers of the Engagement, did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intend to declare by theſe words? They that think <hi>the former,</hi> want not probability of reaſon to ground their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions upon. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that thoſe who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently poſſeſſed of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, are not minded to part with it if they can hold it. And that the likelieſt way
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151688:21"/>
to hold it is, if they can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bring the whole people of <hi>England,</hi> or at the leaſt the far greateſt part thereof, to acknowledge that they are rightly poſſeſſed of it, and to promiſe Subjection and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to them as ſuch. And that therefore the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being purpoſely devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſet on foot, as the fitteſt engine to expedite that work, muſt in all reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to oblige ſo farr. Which being ſo contrary to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perſwaſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the duty and Oath of Allegiance, I cannot blame thoſe that ſo underſtand the words of the Engagement, if
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151688:22"/>
they abominate the very thought of taking it.</p>
            <p>But there wanteth not great probability of Reaſon, on the other ſide, to induce us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the latter and lower ſenſe, is rather to be deemed the immediate, and <hi>declared intent</hi> of the Impoſers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever cauſe of ſuſpition there may be, that the former mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, may be more agreeable to their <hi>ſecret, reſerved and ultimate intent;</hi> between which two, if there be any difference (as it is not impoſſible but there may be) the Engager is not concerned in it, or not yet: the Equivocation, if there be any in that, muſt be put upon the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:151688:22"/>
Impoſers, not on the Promiſers ſcore. For thus believing, there are amongſt others theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That many prudent and conſcientious men of the Royal Party, as well Divines and Lawyers, as others, have thus underſtood it: who we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume would not for any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſpect in the world, have taken it, if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any more to have been intended in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it hath often been affirmed, both publickly and privately, in ſeveral parts of the Kingdom (if we may believe either common fame, or the reports of ſundry credible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:151688:23"/>
perſons) by thoſe that have perſwaded or preſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſubſcribe; that the ſame is the very true intent and meaning of it, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That if the Impoſers had been minded to have declared an intent of binding <hi>to More,</hi> they might eaſily have framed the words ſo, as not to be capable of a conſtruction bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>to Leſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That (as is alſo credibly reported) whilſt the form of words was under debate, the opinion of thoſe that would have had it ſet higher, was not followed, as held unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; and the vote carryed,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:151688:23"/>
for the more moderate expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wherein it now ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Impoſers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending by the Engagement to ſecure themſelves, eſpecially againſt the deſigns and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of thoſe men, who they knew (well enough) held them for no other then Uſurpers, muſt be in reaſon ſuppoſed to require no more aſſurance of them by the Engagement, then ſuch as may and is uſually gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Uſurpers; which is, not an acknowledgment of their title, and a promiſe of Allegiance, but meerly a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of living quietly, ſo long as they are under their power,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:151688:24"/>
and enjoy their protection.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That it is a received Maxim of Political prudence, for all new Governors, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe that either introduce a new form of Government, or come in upon a queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble title) to abſtain from all harſh procedings, even againſt thoſe whom they know to be evil affected to their Power, and not ſo much as to exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them (though it be in the power of their hands to deſtroy them) eſpecially in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Government: but rather to ſweeten them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better opinion of their perſons, and to win upon them by Acts of Grace and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:151688:24"/>
Oblivion (for <hi>Remiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Senec.</hi> 1. <hi>De. Clem.</hi> 24.</note> 
               <hi>imperanti meliùs paretur.)</hi> So as they may have but any tolerable kind of aſſurance from them in the mean time, of living quietly and peaceably under them. We have no reaſon therefore to believe that the Impoſers of this Engagement, who have acted the parts of the greateſt Politicians, ſo perfectly and ſuccesfully hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, as to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo fully oſ the Supreme Power of ſo great and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing a Kingdom, in ſo few years, would be ſo impolitick as not to proceed by the ſame rules, that all wiſe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151688:25"/>
perſons have ever pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the managing, and for the eſtabliſhing of an acquired power.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Out of all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes together (waying my Poſitive concluſion, either Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative or Negative, touching the Lawfulneſs or Unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſubſcribing <hi>in univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li)</hi> I ſhall declare my opinion only in theſe few following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is not lawful for any man to take the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a reſolution to break it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That therefore whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thinketh the words of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:151688:25"/>
Engagement do contain a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of any thing which it is not lawful for him to perform, cannot take it with a good conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That whoſoever ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the words of the Engagement, as if they did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to any thing contrary to his Allegiance, or render him unable to act according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, upon any ſeaſonable emerging occaſion, cannot with a good conſcience take it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That if any man for any temporal benefit, or avoiding any temporal dammage, ſhall take the Engagement with a doubting conſcience (that is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151688:26"/>
before he be perſwaded in his Judgment, upon ſome probable ground of reaſon, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him ſo to do) he ſinneth therein.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That if any man after a ſerious deſire of informing himſelf as rightly as he can, what are the duties of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance on the one ſide, and what is moſt probably the meaning intended by the words of the Engagement on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; ſhall find himſelf well ſatisfied in this perſwaſion, that the performance in the mean time of what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Engagement ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is no way contrary (for any thing he can diſcern
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:151688:26"/>
for the preſent) to his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Allegiance, ſo long as he is under ſuch a force, as that he cannot exerciſe it; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that whenſoever that force is ſo removed from him, or he from under it, as that he hath power to act according to his Allegiance, the Obligation of the Engagement of it ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth and expireth: and out of theſe conſiderations, rather then ſuffer extreme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, in his perſon, eſtate, or neceſſary relations, ſhall ſubſcribe the Engagement; Since his own heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth him not, neither will I.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:151688:27"/>
Sir, I have now two requeſts to you, which I doubt not but you will think reaſonable. The one, that whatſoever uſe you ſhall pleaſe to make of theſe papers, or any thing therein contained, for your own or any friends ſatisfaction; yet you would not deliver any Copies abroad, leaſt they ſhould come to be printed, as ſome other papers of mine, written in this manner have been, without my knowledge.

            <p>A <hi>Gentleman of good Eſtate, hath Iſſue one only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who placing her affections upon a perſon much below her rank, intendeth Mariage with him: The Father hearing of it, in great diſpleaſure Voweth, and confirmeth it with an Oath, that if ſhe Marry him he will</hi>

               <hi>never give her a farthing of his Eſtate.

            </p>
            <p>
               <label>The Reſolution.</label> My opinion is, <hi>That the Vow was</hi> Raſh, <hi>and is not at all</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:151688:29"/>
1. The Queſtion here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed is concerning the <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> only; yet I deem it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to declare my opinion concerning the <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> alſo: and that for two reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe there ſeemeth in the propoſal of the Caſe, to be ſome weight laid upon the after iterations, which were more deliberate, as if they added to the Obligation. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe I think it needful that the Vower ſhould as well be convinced of the greatneſs of his ſin in making ſuch a Vow, for the time paſt, as ſatisfied concerning the preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture invalidity of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is eaſie to believe; that the Gentleman when he firſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:151688:30"/>
made the Vow, was poſſeſſed with a very great indignation againſt his Daughter, for her high and inexcuſable diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him in ſo very weighty a buſineſs. And truly it muſt be confeſſed, he had need to be a man of a very rare command over his own Spirit, and ſuch as are ſcarce to be found one of a thouſand, that could ſo contain himſelf within the bounds of reaſon upon ſo juſt a provocation from an only child (poſſibly ſome other ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring) as not to be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the violence of that paſſion, into ſome thoughts and reſolutions, not exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the dictates of right
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:151688:30"/>
reaſon. It can therefore be little doubted, but the Vow made whilſt the Reaſon was held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the force of ſo ſtrong a perturbation, was a raſh and irrational Vow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor will theſe after-acts in confirmation of the firſt Vow, though having more of deliberation in them, be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to redeem either it or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the imputation of Raſhneſs: underſtanding raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that latitude as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts do, when they treat <hi>de Voto temerario,</hi> under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof they comprehend all ſuch Vows as happen <hi>per de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum plenae &amp; diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſſae delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationi,</hi> as they expreſs it; For it is to be conſidered, that when
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:151688:31"/>
an injury, diſobedience, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affront is ſtrongly reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it many times taketh a very deep impreſſion in the ſoul, which though after the firſt <hi>impetus</hi> have a little ſpent it ſelf, it begin ſomewhat to abate, yet it doth ſo by ſuch ſlow and inſenſible degrees, that the ſame perturbation, which firſt diſcompoſed the mind, may have a ſtrong influence into all ſucceeding deliberations for a long time after. Even as after an acute Feaver, when the ſharpeſt paroxyſmes are over, and the malignity of the diſeaſe well ſpent, although the party begin to recover ſome degrees of ſtrength; yet there may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for a good while after
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151688:31"/>
ſuch a debility in the parties, as that they cannot exerciſe their proper functions, but with ſome weakneſs more or leſs, till the party be perfectly recovered. Sith therefore the after-iterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the firſt Vow in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, did proceed apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the rancor and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity remaining in the mind, as the dregs and reliques of the ſame perturbation, from which the firſt Vow alſo proceeded: they muſt upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (to wit, <hi>per defectum plenae deliberationis)</hi> undergo the ſame cenſure of Raſhneſs with the firſt Vow. The ſame I ſay for the kind; ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I grant there is for the degree: but <hi>Magis &amp; Minus</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:151688:32"/>
               <hi>non variant ſpeciem,</hi> we know. And the conſideration of that difference is only thus farr uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the preſent Caſe, that the more deliberate thoſe after-acts were, the more culpable they are, and the leſs capable either of Excuſe, or Extenuation; and conſequently doe oblige the party to ſo much the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſolemn, and laſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But concerning raſh Vowes (in as much as the knot of the Queſtion lyeth not there) it ſhall ſuffice to note theſe few points. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That every <hi>Raſh Vow</hi> is a ſin; and that upon its own ſcore, and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſely as it is <hi>raſh,</hi> although it ſhould not be any other way
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151688:32"/>
peccant. All acts of Religious worſhip (by the importance of the third Commandment) are to be performed with al due ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, attention, and adviſedneſs: how much more than a <hi>Vow?</hi> which is one of the higheſt acts of worſhip, as being a ſacred contract, whereunto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is a party. See <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 1, <hi>&amp;c. Secondly,</hi> That Raſh Vows are for the moſt part, (beſides the Raſhneſs peccant in their matter alſo; For they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made in paſſion, and all paſſions are evil Counſellors, and Anger as bad as the worſt. <hi>The wrath of Man</hi> ſeldom <hi>worketh the righteouſneſs of God. Thirdly,</hi> That a Raſh Vow, (though to be repented of for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151688:33"/>
the Raſhneſs) may yet in ſome caſes bind. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; A man finding himſelf ill uſed by a Shop-keeper, of whom he had formerly been accuſtomed to buy, voweth in a rage, that he will never buy of him again: This is a Raſh Vow; yet it bindeth, becauſe if the party had never made any ſuch Vow at all, it had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been unjuſt or unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, (nor ſo much as impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) in him for to have done the ſame thing, which by his Vow he hath now bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to do. So if a man impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of his ill luck at Cards, ſhould Vow in a heat never to play at Cards any more; he were in this caſe alſo bound to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151688:33"/>
keep his Vow: becauſe there neither is any ſin in keeping it, nor can be any great neceſſity why he ſhould break it. That therefore <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if at any time a <hi>Raſh Vow</hi> bind not; the invalidity thereof proceedeth not meerly (nor indeed at all) from the Raſhneſs (which yet is a very common error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men) but from the faultineſs of it otherwiſe, in reſpect of the matter, or thing Vowed to be done; when that which is ſo Vowed, is either ſo evil in it ſelf, or by reaſon of circumſtances, becometh ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that it cannot be performed without ſin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That therefore concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vow in the preſent caſe,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:151688:34"/>
I declared my Opinion that it is not at all obligatory; it is done upon this ground (which is a moſt certain truth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to by all) That <hi>Rei illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citae nulla obligatio.</hi> If a man ſhall Vow any thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Piety;</hi> as if having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken offence at ſome indiſcreet paſſage in a Sermon of his own Miniſter, he ſhould vow that he would never come to the Church, or hear him Preach again: Or that is contrary to <hi>Juſtice;</hi> as to take away the life of an innocent perſon, as thoſe 40 perſons that had vowed they <hi>would neither eat nor drink till they had ſlain Paul:</hi> Or never to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to one whom he knew
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:151688:34"/>
he had wronged: Or contrary to <hi>Charity;</hi> as to be revenged of, or never to be friends with, one that had done him wrong: Or that is contrary to <hi>Mercy;</hi> as if having loſt ſome money by lending to his friend, or having ſmarted by ſuretiſhip, he ſhould vow never to lend any man money, or become ſurety for any man again. Let ſuch a vow, I ſay, as any of theſe, or any of the like nature, be made either raſhly, or deliberately, and ſtrengthened with Oaths and Imprecations, in the moſt direful and ſolemn manner that can be deviſed to tye it on the faſter; yet it is altogether null and invalid as to the effect of Obligation. Whence thoſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151688:35"/>
common ſayings, <hi>In ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lè pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs is reſcinde fidem; Ne ſit juramentum vinculum iniquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> &amp;c. And we have a good preſident for it in <hi>David,</hi> after he had in a rage vowed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all that belonged to him; which vow upon better conſideration, he not only did not perform, but he bleſſed God alſo, for ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially preventing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, by the diſcreet demeanor, and intervention of <hi>Abigail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Now the reaſon why ſuch vowes are not binding, is very cogent and clear; Even becauſe the party at ſuch time as he is ſuppoſed to have made ſuch Vow, as aforeſaid, lay under
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:151688:35"/>
another (a former and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſtronger) obligation to the contrary. And it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all the reaſon in the world, that he who either by his own voluntary act, hath bound himſelf (where lawfully he might ſo do) or by the command of his lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior (that hath a right to his ſervice, and may exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from him) is already bound to do or not to do this or that; ſhould not have power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:151688:36"/>
7. And the reaſon of this reaſon alſo, is yet farther evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for that <hi>Quiſquis obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, alteri obligatur.</hi> When a man is obliged by-any act, it is alwayes ſuppoſed, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is made to ſome other party: to whom alſo it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſome right to accrue, by vertue of the ſaid act ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory; and that that other party is by the ſaid act ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently veſted in that ſaid right, Of which right he cannot be again deveſted and deprived by the meer act of him, who inſtated him therein, and is obliged to perform it to him (unleſs himſelf give conſent thereunto) without the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt injuſtice in the World.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:151688:37"/>
Now God having a perfect right to our obedience, by his own obliging Precept, both for the not doing hurt to any man, and for the doing good to every man, upon all fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities: and this right alſo confirmed, and ratified by our own obligatory act in a ſolemn manner, before many witneſſes at our Baptiſm, when we vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: it were unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to think that it ſhould be in our power, by any after-act of ours to diſoblige our ſelves from both, or either of thoſe obligations. For then we might by the ſame reaſon free our ſelves from the obligation of that latter Act alſo (ſuppoſe an
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:151688:37"/>
Oath, or Vow) by another ſubſequent Oath, or Vow; and from that again by another: and ſo play faſt and looſe, make Vows and break them <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Evident it is therefore, that every vow requiring any thing to be done, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to any office of <hi>Piety, Juſtice, Charity,</hi> or <hi>Mercy,</hi> which we owe either to God or man, is void, and bindeth not; becauſe it findeth us under the power of a former contrary obligation, and hath not it ſelf power ſufficient to free or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge us from the ſame.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The general rule thus cleared, it remaineth to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine concerning the particular Vow, now in queſtion, whether
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:151688:38"/>
it be void upon this account or no? It will be found hard I believe to free this <hi>Vow,</hi> from being repugnant to the rules of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but impoſſible I am ſure, to reconcile it with the perfect Evangelical Law of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Political Juſtice,</hi> requireth that every man ſhould obey the wholeſome Laws of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and ſubmit himſelf to be ordered thereby. Now put the caſe (which is poſſible enough) that the Daughters Husband ſhould for lack of ſupport from his Father-in-law, or otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> live and dye in great want, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Wife, and many ſmall Children behind him, deſtitut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:151688:38"/>
ſuſtenance. The Law would (as I ſuppoſe) in that caſe, upon complaint of the Pariſh, and for their eaſe, ſend the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and her Children to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and compel him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them out of his Eſtate. Which order he ought to obey, nor can refuſe ſo to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the high contempt of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority, and manifeſt violation of the Civil Juſtice, notwithſtanding his Vow to the contrary: The Law muſt be obeyed whatſoever becometh of the Vow; in that caſe therefore it is evident the Vow bindeth not.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhould not happen to be the caſe (which yet is more then any man can
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151688:39"/>
poſitively ſay before-hand:) the Parent is nevertheleſs in <hi>Moral Juſtice</hi> bound to provide due maintenance for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Grand-Children if he be able. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ought to lay up for the Children. True it is, he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it but upon the by, and by way of Illuſtration, in the handling of another argument, very diſtant from this buſineſs: but that doth not at all leſſen the importance of it, ſuch illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations being ever taken <hi>à no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori,</hi> and from ſuch common notions as are granted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto by all reaſonable men. The ſame Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving amongſt other ſins of the Gentiles, mentioned diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151688:39"/>
to Parents in one verſe, in the very next verſe, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo want of natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Parents. And the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in the Childe can no more diſcharge the Parent from the obligation of that duty he oweth to the Childe, of <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and <hi>maintenance,</hi> then the unnaturalneſs of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, can the Childe from the duty he oweth to the Parent, of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> For the ſeveral duties, that by Gods ordinance, are to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by perſons that ſtand in mutual relation either to other, are not <hi>pactional</hi> and <hi>condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;</hi> as are the Leagues and Agreements made between Princes (where the breach in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:151688:40"/>
one part, diſſolveth the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the other) but are <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> and <hi>independent;</hi> wherein each perſon is to look to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the performance of the duty that lyeth upon him, though the other party ſhould fail in the performance of his.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Something I foreſee, may be objected in this point, concerning the lawfulneſs of the Parents withdrawing main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from the Childe (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole, or at leaſt in part) in the caſe of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Which how far forth it may, or may not be done; as it would be too long to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſo it would be of little avail to the preſent buſineſs. For it is one thing to with-hold
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:151688:40"/>
maintenance from a diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Childe for the preſent, and to reſolve ſo to continue till he ſhall ſee cauſe to the contrary. And another thing to binde himſelf by Vow or Oath, never to allow him any for the future, whatſoever ſhould happen. Let be granted whatſoever can be ſuppoſed pleadable on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers behalf, in the preſent caſe: yet there will ſtill remain two particulars in this Vow, not eaſily to be cleared from being unjuſt. <hi>Firſt,</hi> let the Daughters diſobedience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all this uttermoſt of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, from the offended Father; yet how can it be juſt, that for the Mothers fault, the poor innocent (perhaps yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born)

Children, ſhould be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and irrecoverably exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, from all poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from their Grand-Father? <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is (if not unjuſt, yet what differeth very little there-from) the extremity of rigid Juſtice; that any offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der much leſs a Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) ſhould for any offence, not deſerving death, be by a kinde of fatal peremptory decree, put into an incapacity of receiving relief from ſuch perſons, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ought to have relieved the ſaid offender, without any reſervation either of the caſe of <hi>extreme neceſsity,</hi> or of the caſe of <hi>ſerious repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. However it be for the point of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> yet ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151688:41"/>
is the repugnancy of the <hi>matter</hi> of this <hi>Vow,</hi> with the precepts of <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> that if all I have hitherto ſaid were of no force, this repugnancy alone were enough (without other evid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) to prove the unlawfulneſs, and conſequently, the invalidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or inobligability thereof. It is (not an Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but) the expreſs perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory precept of Chriſt, that we ſhould be <hi>merciful,</hi> even as our heavenly Father is <hi>merciful.</hi> And inaſmuch as, not in that paſſage only, but for the moſt part whereſoever elſe the duty of <hi>mercy</hi> is preſſed upon us in the Goſpel from the example of God: God is repreſented
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151688:42"/>
to us by the name, and under the notion of a <hi>Father,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I may not lay much weight upon it, as a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative proof; yet I conceive I may commend it as rational To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, for all that are Fathers to conſider of, whether it do not import, that <hi>mercy</hi> is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a <hi>Father</hi> as much as (if not rather much more then) from any other man; and that the want of <hi>mercy</hi> in a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is more unkindy, more unſeemly, more unnatural then in another man: But this by the way. From that precept of Chriſt, we learn that as there is in God a two-fold <hi>mercy,</hi> (a giving <hi>mercy,</hi> in doing us good, though we deſerve it not, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:151688:42"/>
a forgiving <hi>mercy,</hi> in pardoning us when we have done amiſs:) ſo there ought to be in every good Chriſtian man, a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (after the example of God) to ſhew forth the fruits of <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> to others, in both kindes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all proper, and meet occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. So that if any perſon, of what quality or condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhall upon any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoever vow that he will never do any thing for ſuch or ſuch a man; or that he will never forgive ſuch or ſuch a man: every ſuch Vow, being <hi>contra bonos mores,</hi> and <hi>contra officium hominis Chriſtiani,</hi> is unlawful, and bindeth not.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The offices of <hi>mercy</hi> in the former of thoſe two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:151688:43"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> of doing good, and affording relief to thoſe that are in neceſſity, are themſelves of ſo great neceſſity (as the caſe may be) that common hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity would exact the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them from the hand, not of a ſtranger only, but even of an enemy. If a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or an enemies Beaſt lie weltering in a Ditch, a helping hand muſt be lent to draw it out. The Samaritans compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the wounded Traveller, in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. (There being a feud, and that grounded upon Religion, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of all others, is the moſt deadly feud between the two Nations) is commended to our example, to the great reproach
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:151688:43"/>
of the Prieſt, and Levite, for their want of <hi>Bowels</hi> to their poor Brother, of the ſame <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; For the nearer the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is between the Parties, the ſtronger is the obligation of ſhewing <hi>mercy</hi> either to other. And there is ſcarce any relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nearer, and more obliging, then that of Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour, who in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. ſharply reproved ſuch vows, (though made with an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to advance the Service of God, by inriching his treaſury) as hindred Children from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their Parents, will not certainly approve of ſuch vows (made without anyother inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151688:44"/>
then to gratifie rage, and impatience) as hinder Parents from relieving their Children.</p>
            <p n="13">13. If to avoid the force of this argument, it ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the Daughters diſobedience, in a buſineſs of ſo high concernment, might juſtly deſerve to be thus ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and that it were but equal that ſhe, who had ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard to her Father, when the time was, ſhould be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded by him afterwards: All this granted, cometh not yet up to the point of ſhewing <hi>Mercy</hi> according to the example of God. No Childes diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can be ſo great to an earthly Parent, as ours is to our heavenly Father: Yet doth he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:151688:44"/>
notwithſtanding all our ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings continually do us good, communicating to our neceſſities, and cauſing his Sun to ſhine, and his Rain to fall, and infinite benefits in all kinds to deſcend upon mankinde, not excluding the moſt thankleſs, and diſobedient, and rebellious, from having a ſhare therein.</p>
            <p n="14">14. And as for that other branch of <hi>Mercy</hi> in pardoning offences, God giveth a rich ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all men, of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that kinde, (and to Fathers particularly) by his great readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to pardon the greateſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, if they ſincerely ſeek to him for it. If the Father in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with ſuch ſeverity
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:151688:45"/>
againſt his riotous Son, as to have vowed never to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him again; he had been a very improper exemplar, whereby to ſhadow out the mercy of God to repentant ſinners. Concerning the great importance of this duty, which is ſo frequently inculcated by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and ſo peremptorily enjoyned, as not any other duty more. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 4, 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 21.—35. <hi>Eph,</hi> 4. 32. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>James</hi> 2. 13. See alſo <hi>Sirac.</hi> 28. 1, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> I ſhall not need to ſay much: only as to the preſent <hi>Caſe,</hi> it would be conſidered, how perverſe a courſe it is, and contradictory to it ſelf, for a man to think himſelf obliged,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151688:45"/>
by one inconſiderate act, never to forgive his Daughter; when as yet he cannot beg pardon of his own ſins, at the hands of God, (as he ought in his daily prayer to do) without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs condition of forgiving every body, and an implicit imprecation upon himſelf, if he do not.</p>
            <p n="15">15. But ſhall the Daughter that hath thus grieved the ſpirit of her Father, thus eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, and be in as good a condition, as if ſhe had never offended? And will not others be incouraged by her impunity, to deſpiſe their Parents after her example? There is much reaſon in this objection; and therefore what I have hitherto
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151688:46"/>
written, ought not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if thereby were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch a plenary indulgence for the Daughter, as ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore her <hi>in integrum,</hi> but only that ſhe ſhould be made capable of receiving ſuch relief from her Father, from time to time, as in relation to her neceſſities, and after carriage, from time to time, ſhould ſeem reaſonable; and that his Vow ought not to hinder him from affording her ſuch relief. But by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and in what proportion. the Father ſhould thus receive his Daughter, into his fatherly affection, and relieve her, muſt be left to diſcretion, and the exigence of circumſtances. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyl ſhould adviſe (in order to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151688:46"/>
the objection, <hi>viz.</hi> for examples ſake, and that the Daughter might be made, even to her dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, and kept, ſenſible of her great and ſinful diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to her Father) that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould cut off from his Daughter, and her Poſterity, ſome meet portion of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, (as perhaps a fifth part at the leaſt; or if a fourth, or a whole third part, I ſhould like it the better:) and by a ſolemn deliberate vow, dedicate the ſame to be yearly imployed in ſome pious and charitable uſes. Theſe times will afford him choice of objects, if God ſhall move his heart ſo to do; and by ſo doing, he may, <hi>Firſt,</hi> in ſome ſort redeem and make a kinde
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:151688:47"/>
of ſatisfaction for his former <hi>Raſhneſs,</hi> (not <hi>Popiſhly</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and in regard of the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God,</hi> but) in a <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe, and in regard of the <hi>world,</hi> and his own <hi>Conſcience. Secondly,</hi> it may be a good means to keep the Daughter in a continual freſh remembrance of her fault, that ſhe may not, after a ſhort and ſlight repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (as in ſuch caſes too often it happeneth) forget the ſame; whereof ſhe ought to have ſome remorſe all the dayes of her life. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by after a ſort, perform his firſt vow; I mean according to the general intention thereof, and the rational part, (which was to make his Daughter repent her
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:151688:47"/>
folly, and to ſmart for it:) the over-plus more then this, being but the fruit of rancor and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> he ſhall in ſo doing, doubly imitate God, our heavenly Father. <hi>Firſt,</hi> when a raſh, or ſinful act is made an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of a pious, or charitable work; it beareth ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of, or rather is indeed it ſelf a gracious effect of that goodneſs and wiſdom in God, whereby he bringeth light out of darkneſs, and good out of evil. <hi>Secondly,</hi> God himſelf when he graciouſly pardoneth a high preſumptuous ſin, as he did <hi>Davids</hi> great ſin, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> commonly layeth ſome laſting affliction upon the offender; as he did upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:151688:48"/>
who after the ſealing his pardon for that ſin by <hi>Nathan,</hi> ſcarce ever had a quiet day all his life long. The reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſeemeth to be double, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for admonition to others, that none preſume to provoke God in like manner, leſt they ſmart for it alſo in like manner: and partly for the good of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, that he may by the ſmart be brought to the deeper ſenſe of his error, and be eft-ſoons reminded of it, leſt he ſhould too ſoon forget it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus have I with very much ado, (in that weak condition I have been in, ever ſince the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion came to my hands, and wherein I yet continue) decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:151688:48"/>
               <hi>my opinion fully concerning the whole buſineſs as far as I underſtand it. More largely I confeſs then I intended, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was needful: and with greater ſeverity, then (it may be) the parties will well like of. But truly I deſired to do the part of a faithful Confeſſor, and the ſores on both parts ſeemed to be ſuch as were not to be touched, with too gentle a hand: In the Daughter, an act of high diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, tranſported by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of inordinate love; and in the Father an act of great Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tranſported by the paſsion of inordinate anger: both beyond the bounds of right Reaſon, and Religion; and both to be deeply repented of. Howſoever, I cannot</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:151688:49"/>
               <hi>be ſuſpected to have written any thing, either out of favour for, or prejudice againſt either party; not having the leaſt conjecture, who the perſons are that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the buſineſs: nor ſo much as in what part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they live. I ſhall pray that God would direct them both, to do that which may beſt ſerve to his glory, and bring the ſoundeſt comfort to their own ſouls.</hi> Amen.</p>
