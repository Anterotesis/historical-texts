            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT we may no longer be the diſ-ſatiſfaction of our friends, the ſubject of our enemies malice (to worke jealouſies and miſ-repreſentations upon) and the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (if not aſtoniſhment) of many in the Kingdome, in our late or preſent tranſactions and conduct of buſineſſe; we ſhall in all faithfulneſſe and clearneſſe profeſſe, and declare unto you, thoſe things which have of late protracted and hindred our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding, the preſent grievances which poſſeſſe our Army and are yet unremedied, with our deſires, as to the compleat ſettlement of the liberties, and peace of the Kingdom, which is that bleſſing of God, then which (of all worldly things) nothing is more dear unto us, or more pretious in our thoughts, we having hitherto thought all our preſent enjoyments (whether of life or liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or neareſt relations) a price but ſufficient to the purchaſe of ſo rich a bleſſing, that we and all the free-borne people of this Nation, may ſit down in quiet under our Vines, under the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adminiſtration of Juſtice and righteouſneſſe, and in the full p<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſeſſion of thoſe Fundamentall Rights and Liberties, without which we can have little hopes (as to humane conſiderations) to enjoy either any comforts of life, or ſo much as life it ſelfe, but at the pleaſures of ſome men, ruling meerly according to will and power.</p>
            <p>It cannot be unknowne what hath paſſed betwixt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Army, as to the ſervice of <hi>Ireland.</hi> By all which, together with the late proceedings againſt the Army, in relation to their petition and grievances; all men may judge what hath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37468:3"/>
hindred the Army from a ready engagement in that ſervice; and without further account or Apologie, as to that particular, then what paſſages and proceedings themſelves (already made publicke,) doe afford; we doe appeale to your ſelves, whether thoſe courſes, to which the Parliament hath (by the deſignes and practiſes of ſome) been drawne, have rationally tended to induce a cheerefull and unanimous undertaking of the Army to that ſervice, or rather to breake and pull the Army in pieces with diſcontent and diſhonour, and to put ſuch dil-obligations and provocations upon it, as might drive it into diſtemper, and indeed diſcourage both this Army and other Souldiers from any further engagement in the Parliaments ſervice. And we wiſh all men would (with us) upon the whole carriage, ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether (in the intentions of thoſe who have by falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, and miſ-repreſentations put the Parliament upon ſuch wayes) the timely and effectuall reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſeem really to have been intended, or rather (with the breaking, or disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Army) to draw together, or raiſe ſuch other forces, and of ſuch a temper as might ſerve to ſome deſperate and diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive deſignes in <hi>England.</hi> For which, (beſides the probable ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions from their carriage of the buſineſſe) we have before hand, in the tranſaction thereof, had more then hints of ſuch a deſigne, by cleare expreſſions to that purpoſe, from many of the Officers of the Army, that have been perſwaded, and appeared moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to engage as for <hi>Ireland,</hi> on the tearmes propoſed. And, that ſuch a deſigne hath all along been driven; ſeems now to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by the preſent diſpoſing of thoſe Forces that have been engaged for <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the endeavours of ſome, to gain a power from the Parliament of ordering thoſe Forces for ſome ſervice in <hi>England;</hi> and by the private liſtings of men for ſervice there, without any publick authority of Parliament. And (all this) by the ſame perſons, who have all along appeared moſt active, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the late proceedings againſt the Army.</p>
            <p>As to the juſt diſcontents and diſ-ſatisfactions of the Army, in relation to their grievances, and their non-compliance to the late orders for ſudden disbanding by peece-meale (before more full and equall ſatisfaction were given to the whole) we deſire you to look back to the Papers already publiſhed, of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37468:3"/>
themſelves, the Narrative of the Officers, and the late Papers from the generall Councell of Warre at <hi>Bury,</hi> and late generall Randezvouz neare <hi>Newmarket:</hi> and (we thinke) your late reſuming the conſideration of theſe things (as to a further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction) doth much juſtifie the deſires and proceedings of the Army, in the paſt particulars, hitherto.</p>
            <p>And though (had we (upon our firſt addreſſes) for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Rights and Dues) bound or free, a candid recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a juſt conſideration, and a reaſonable ſatisfaction, or at leaſt a free anſwer therein, wee ſhould have been eaſily perſwaded to have abated or forborne much of our Dues, and not to have enquired into, or conſidered (ſo farre as we have) either the poſſibilities there are for more preſent ſatisfaction of Arreares, or the credit of future ſecurities propoſed; yet ſince upon theſe former addreſſes, we have found ſuch hard dealing, as in the ſaid Papers is ſet forth, and thoſe additionall (though hitherto but partiall) ſatisfactions, comming ſo hardly as they have, we finde no obliging reaſons in the leaſt, to decline or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from what is our due; but rather ſtill to adhere unto our deſires of full and equall ſatisfaction, in all the things mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the aforeſaid Papers, not onely in behalf of our ſelves, and the Army, but alſo the whole Souldiery throughout the whole Kingdome, who have concurred, or ſhall concurre with us in the ſame deſires.</p>
            <p>And to all our former deſires, as Souldiers, we cannot but adde this (wherein we find our ſelves ſo nearly concerned in poynt of Juſtice and Reputation) that more care, and a ſtricter courſe may be taken for making good all Articles granted upon Surrenders, according to the true intent and meaning of them. As alſo for Remedy and Reparation in caſe of any breach; (and this) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe delayes which divers have found, as prejudiciall to them or more, then if they had been totally denyed the performance of them</p>
            <p>Nor will it now (wee hope) ſeeme ſtrange or unſeaſonable to rationall and honeſt men, who conſider the conſequence of our preſent caſe, to their own, and the Kingdoms, (aſwell as our) future concernments in poynt of right, freedome, peace and ſafety,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37468:4"/>
if (from a deepe ſence of the high conſequence of our preſent caſe, both to our ſelves (in future) and all other people) we ſhall, before disbanding, proceed, in our own and the Kingdoms behalf, to propound, and plead, for ſome proviſion, for our, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſatisfaction, and future ſecurity in relation to thoſe things, eſpecially conſidering, that we were not a meere mercinary Army, hired to ſerve any Arbitrary power of a State; but called forth and conjured, by the ſeverall Declarations of Parliament, to the defence of our owne and the peoples juſt rights, and liberties; And ſo we tooke up Armes, in judgement and conſcience to thoſe ends, and have ſo continued them, and are reſolved according to your firſt juſt deſires in your Declarations, and ſuch principles as we have received from your frequent informations, and our own common ſence concerning thoſe our fundamentall Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, to aſſert and vindicate, the juſt power, and Rights of this Kingdome in Parliament for thoſe common ends promiſed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all arbitrary power, violence and oppreſſion, and againſt all particular parties, or intereſts whatſoever. The ſaid Declarations ſtill directing us to the equitable ſence of all Laws and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as diſpencing with the very Letter of the ſame, and being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame to it, when the ſafety and preſervation of all is concerned, and aſſuring us, that all authority is fundamentally ſeated, in the office, and but miniſterially in the perſons neither doe or will theſe our proceedings (as we are fully and in conſcience perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) amount to anything, not warrantable before God and men, being thus far, much ſhort of the common proceedings in other Nations, to things of an higher nature then we have yet appeared to. And we cannot but be ſenſible of the great complaints, that have been made generally to us of the Kingdome, from the people where we march, of arbitrarineſſe and injuſtice, to their great and inſupportable oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>And truly ſuch Kingdomes, as have according both to the law of Nature and Nations, appeares to the vindication and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, of their juſt rights and liberties, have proceeded much higher; As our brethren of <hi>Scotland:</hi> who in the firſt beginning of theſe late differences, aſſociated in Covenant, from the very ſame grounds and principles (having no viſible form, either of Parliament or King to countenance them) and as they were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37468:4"/>
therein juſtified, and protected by their own, and this Kingdome alſo, ſo we juſtly ſhall expect to be.</p>
            <p>We need not mention the States of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> and others, all proceeding upon the ſame Principles of right and freedome; And accordingly the Parliament hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it no reſiſtance of Magiſtracie, to ſide with the juſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Law of Nature and Nations, being that Law upon which we have aſſiſted you. And that the Souldiery may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold the hands of that Generall, who will turne his Cannon againſt his Army on purpoſe to deſtroy them; the Sea-men the lands of that Pylot, who wilfully runnes the Ship upon a Rock, (as our brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> argued.) And ſuch were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of our Anceſtors of famous memory, to the purchaſing of ſuch Rights and Liberties as they have enjoyed through the price of their blood; and we (both by that and the later bloud of our deare friends and fellow-Souldiers, with the hazard of our own) doe now lay claim unto.</p>
            <p>Nor is that ſupreame end, (the glory of God) wanting in theſe caſes, to ſet a price upon all ſuch proceedings of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Juſtice, it being one witneſſe of God in the World to carry on a Teſtimony againſt the Injuſtice and unrighteouſneſſe of men, and againſt the miſ-carriages of Government, when cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or declining from their primitive or originall glory.</p>
            <p>Theſe things we mention, but to compare proceedings, and to shew that we are ſo much the more juſtifiable, and warranted in what we doe, by how much we come ſhort of that height and meaſure of proceedings, which the people in free Kingdomes and Nations have formerly practiced.</p>
            <p>Now having thus farre cleared our way in this buſineſſe, wee shall proceed to propound ſuch things as we doe humbly deſire for the ſetling and ſecuring of our own and the Kingdomes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right, freedome, peace, and ſafety, as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Houſes may be ſpeedily purged of ſuch mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as for their Delinquency, or for Corruptions, or abuſe to the State, or undue Elections, ought not to ſit there: whereof
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37468:5"/>
the late elections in <hi>Cornwall, Walles,</hi> and other parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome afford too many examples, to the great prejudice of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples freedome in the ſaid elections.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thoſe perſons, who have, in the unjuſt and high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt the Army, appeared to have the will, the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, credit, and power, to abuſe the Parliament, and the Army, and indanger the Kingdome in carrying on ſuch things againſt us (while an Army) may be ſome way ſpeedily diſabled from doing the like or worſe to us (when disbanded, and diſperſt, and in the condition of private men) or to other the free-borne people of <hi>England</hi> in the ſame condition with us, and that for that purpoſe, the ſame perſons may not continue in the ſame power (eſpecially as our and the Kingdomes Judges in the higheſt truſt) but may be made incapable thereof for future.</p>
            <p>And if it be queſtioned who theſe are, we thought not fit par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulartly to name them in this our repreſentation un to you, but ſhall very ſpeedily give in their names; and before long ſhall offer what we have to ſay againſt them, to your Commiſſioners, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we hope ſo to carry our ſelves, as that the world ſhall ſee, wee aime at nothing of private revenge, as animoſities, but that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice may have a free courſe and the Kingdome be caſed, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by diſinabling ſuch men (at leaſt) from places of Judicature who deſiring to advantage, and ſet up themſelves, and their party, in a generall confuſion have indeavoured to put the Kingdom into a new flame of warre, then which nothing is more abhorrent to us.</p>
            <p>But becauſe neither the granting of this alone, would be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſecure our owne, and the Kingdoms rights, liberties, and ſafetie either for the preſent age or poſterity, nor would our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of this ſingly be free from the ſcandall, and appearance of faction or deſigne onely to weaken one party, under the notion of unjuſt or oppreſſive) that wee may advance another (which may be imagined more our own) we therefore declare</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37468:5"/>
That indeed wee cannot but wiſh, that ſuch men, and ſuch onely, might be preferred to the great power and truſt of the Commonwealth, as are approved, at leaſt, for morall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; And of ſuch wee cannot but in our wiſhes preferre thoſe, that appear acted thereunto by a principle of Conſcience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in them. And accordingly we doe and ever ſhall bleſſe God for thoſe many ſuch Worthies, who through his Providence, have been choſen into this Parliament; And, to ſuch mens endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours (under God) we cannot but attribute that Vindication, (in part) of the peoples Rights and Liberties, and thoſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of a juſt Reformation, which the firſt proceedings of this Parliament appeared to have driven at, and tended to, though of late obſtructed, or rather diverted to other ends and intereſt by the prevailing of other perſons of other principles and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But yet we are ſo farre from deſigning, or complying to have an abſolute or arbitrary power fixed or ſetled for continuance, in any perſons whatſoever, as that, (if we might be ſure to obtain it) wee cannot wiſh to have it ſo in the perſons of any, whom we could moſt confide in, or who ſhould appear moſt of our own opinions or principles, or whom we might have moſt perſonall aſſurance of, or intereſt in, but we doe, and ſhall much rather wiſh, that the Authority of this Kingdome in Parliaments (right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtituted, that is, freely, equally and ſucceſſively choſen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its originall intention) may ever ſtand and have its courſe. And therefore we ſhall apply our deſires, chiefly to ſuch things, as (by having Parliaments ſetled in ſuch a right Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) may give moſt hopes of Juſtice and Righteouſneſſe, to flow downe, equally to all, in that its ancient Channell, without any Overtures, tending either to overthrow, that foundation of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Government in this Kingdom, or to ingroſſe that power for perpetuity into the hands of any particular perſons, or party whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And for that purpoſe, though (as we have found it doubted by many men minding ſincerely the publique good, but not weighing ſo fully all conſequences of things) it may and is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to prove, that, upon the ending of this Parliament, and the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37468:6"/>
Election of New, the Conſtitution of ſucceeding Parliaments; (as to the perſons Elected) may prove for the worſe many wayes; yet ſince neither in the preſent purging of this Parliament, nor in the Election of New, wee cannot promiſe to our ſelves, or the Kingdome, an aſſurance of Juſtice, or other poſitive good from the hands of men, but thoſe who for preſent appeare moſt righteous and moſt for common good (having an unlimited power fixed in them during life or pleaſure) in time, may become corrupt, or ſettle into parties, or factions; or, on the other ſide, in caſe of new Elections, thoſe that ſhould ſo ſucceed, may prove as bad or worſe then the former. Wee therefore humbly conceive, that, (of two inconveniencies the leſſe being to bee choſen) the main thing to be intended in this caſe (and beyond which humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence cannot reach, as to any aſſurance of poſitive good) ſeemes to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> to provide, that however unjuſt or corrupt the perſons of Parliament-men, in preſent or future, may prove; or whatever ill they may doe to particular parties (or to the whole, in particular things,) during their reſpective termes, or periods, yet they ſhall not have the temptation or advantage of an unlimited power fixt in them during their own pleaſures, where by to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate injuſtice and oppreſſion upon any, (without end or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,) or to advance and uphold any one particular party, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or intereſt whatſoever, to the oppreſſion or prejudice of the Community, and the enſlaving of the Kingdome unto all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but that the people may have an equall hope, or poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if they have made an ill choice at one time, to mend it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and the Members of the Houſe themſelves may be in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, to taſte of ſubjection as well as rule, and may ſo be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to conſider of other mens caſes, as what may come to be their owne. This we ſpeake of, in Relation to the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> as being entruſted, on the peoples behalfe, for their intereſt in that great and ſupreame power of the Common-wealth, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power, with the power of finall judgement,) which being in its own nature, ſo arbitrary, and in a manner unlimited (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in point of time) is moſt unfit and dangerous (as to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples intereſt) to be fixt in the perſons of the ſame men during life, or their own pleaſures. Neither, by the originall Conſtitution of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37468:6"/>
this State, was it, or ought it to continue ſo, nor doth it (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, and continues ſo) render that State any better then a meere Tyranny) or the people ſubjected to it, any better then Vaſſalls: But in all States, where there is any face of common free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and particularly in this State of <hi>England</hi> (as is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both by many poſitive Lawes, and ancient conſtant cuſtome) the people have a right to new and ſucceſſive Elections unto that great and ſupreame truſt, at certain periods of time, which is ſo eſſentiall and fundamentall to their freedome, as it is, cannot, or ought not, to be denied them, or withheld from them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> is of very little concernment to the intereſt of the Commons of <hi>England.</hi> Yet in this wee would not be miſ-underſtood, in the leaſt, to blame thoſe Worthies of both Houſes, whoſe zeale to vindicate the Liberties of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did procure that Act for continuance of this Parliament; whereby it was ſecured from being diſſolved at the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, (as former Parliaments had been) or reduced to ſuch a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as might enable them the better to aſſert and vindicate the Liberties of this Nation, (immediately before ſo highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, and then alſo ſo much endangered.) And theſe wee take to be the principall ends and grounds, for which, in that exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of time and affaires, it was procured, and to which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it hath happily been made uſe of; but we cannot thinke it was by thoſe Worthies intended, or ought to be made uſe of, to the perpetuating of that ſupreame truſt and power in the perſons of any during their owne pleaſures, or to the debarring of the people from their right of Elections (totally new) when thoſe dangers or exigencies were paſt, and the affaires and ſafety of the Common-wealth would admit of ſuch a change.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:37468:7"/>
Having thus cleared our Grounds and Intentions (as wee hope) from all ſcruples and miſ-underſtandings, in what followes we ſhall proceed further to propoſe what wee humbly deſire for the ſetling and ſecuring of our owne and the Kingdomes Rights and Liberties, through the bleſsing of God to Poſterity; and therefore upon all the Grounds premiſed, we further humbly deſire as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</p>
            <p n="3">3. That ſome determinate period of time may be ſet, for the continuance of this and future Parliaments, beyond which none ſhall continue, and upon which new Writs may of courſe iſſue out, and new Elections ſucceſſively take place according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Bill for Trienniall Parliaments;</p>
            <p>And herein we would not be miſunderſtood to deſire a preſent or ſudden diſſolution of this Parliament, but only (as is expreſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that ſome certain period may be ſet for the determining of it, ſo as it may not remaine (as now) continuable for ever, or during the pleaſure of the preſent Members; And we ſhould deſire that the period to be now ſet for ending this Parliament, may be ſuch as may give ſufficient time for proviſion of what is wanting and neceſſary to be paſſed in point of juſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for further ſecuring the Rights and Liberties, and ſetling the peace of the Kingdome. In order to which we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humbly offer.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That ſecure proviſions may be made for the continuance of future Parliaments, ſo as they may not be adjournable or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveable at the Kings pleaſure, or any other wayes then by their own conſent during their reſpective periods, but at thoſe periods each Parliaments to determine of courſe as before. This we deſire may be now provided for (if it may be) ſo as to put it out of all diſpute, for future, though we thinke of right, it ought not to have beene other wiſe before.</p>
            <p>And thus a firme foundation being laid in the authority and conſtitution of Parliaments for the hopes, at leaſt, of common
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37468:7"/>
and equall right and freedome to our ſelves and all the free-born people of this Land; we ſhall for our parts freely and cheerefully commit our ſtock or ſhare of intereſt in this Kingdome, into this common bottome of Parliaments, and though it may (for our particulars) goe ill with us in one Voyage, yet we ſhall thus hope (if right be with us) to fare better in another.</p>
            <p>Theſe things we deſire may be provided for by Bill or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament to which the Royall Aſſent may be deſired: when his Majeſtie in theſe things, and what elſe ſhall be propoſed by the Parliament, neceſſary for ſecuring the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people, and for the ſetling the <hi>Militia</hi> and peace of the Kingdome, ſhall have given his concurrence to put them paſt diſpute, We ſhall then deſire that the Rights of his Majeſtie and his poſterity may be conſidered of, and ſetled in all things, ſo far as may conſiſt with the Right and Freedome of the Subject, and with the ſecurity of the ſame for future.</p>
            <p n="5">5 We deſire, that the right and freedome of the people, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to the Parliament by way of humble Petition, their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances (in ſuch things as cannot otherwiſe be remedied then by Parliament) may be cleared and vindicated. That all ſuch grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the people may befreely received and admitted into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and put into an equitable and ſpeedy way, to be heard, examined, and redreſſed (if they appeare reall) and that in ſuch things for which men have remedy by law, they may be freely left to the benefit of Law, and the regulated courſe of Juſtice, without interruption or checke from the Parliament, except in caſe of things done upon the exigency of Warre, or for the ſervice and benefit of the Parliament and Kingdome in relation to the Warre, or otherwiſe, in due purſuance and execution of Ordinances or Orders of Parliament,</p>
            <p>More particularly (under this head) we cannot but deſire, that all ſuch as are impriſoned, for any pretended miſdemeanor, may be put into a ſpeedy way for a juſt hearing and triall, and ſuch as ſhall appeare to have been unjuſtly and unduly impriſoned, may (with their liberty) have ſome reaſonable reparation according to their ſufferings and the demerit of their oppreſſors;</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37468:8"/>
6 That the large powers, given to the Committees or Deputy Lieutenants during the late times of War and deſtraction, may be ſpeedily taken into conſideration, That ſuch of theſe powers as appeare not neceſſary to be continued, may be taken away, and ſuch of them as are neceſſary may be put into a regulated way, and left to as little Arbitrarineſſe, as the nature and neceſſity of the things wherein they are converſant will beare.</p>
            <p n="7">7 We could wiſh that the Kingdom might both be righted and publikely ſatisfied in point of Accounts, for the vaſt ſummes that have been levyed and paid, as alſo in divers other things wherein the Common wealth may be conceived to have beene wronged or abuſed; But we are loath to preſſe any thing, that may tend to lengthen out further diſputes or conteſtations, but rather ſuch as may tend to a ſpeedy and generall compoſure, and quieting of mens minds, in order to Peace, for which purpoſe we further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8 That (publique Juſtice being firſt ſatisfied by ſome few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to poſterity out of the worſt of excepted perſons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Delinquents, having paſt their Compoſitions) ſome courſe may be taken (by a generall Act of oblivion or otherwiſe) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſeeds of future Warre, or fewds, either to the preſent age, or poſterity, may the better be taken away, by eaſing that ſence of preſent, and ſatisfying thoſe feares, of future Ruine or Undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to perſons or families, which may drive men into any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate wayes for ſelfe preſervation or remedy, and by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the private remembrances and diſtinction of parties, as farre as may ſtand with ſafety to the rights and Liberties wee have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto fought for.</p>
            <p>There are (beſides theſe) many particular things which we could wiſh to be done, and ſome to be undone, all, in order ſtill to the ſame ends, of common right, freedome, peace, and ſafety. But theſe propoſalls aforegoing, being the principall things we bottome and inſiſt upon, wee ſhall (as we have ſaid before) for our parts acquieſce; for other particulars in the Wiſdome and Juſtice of Parliaments. And whereas it hath been ſuggeſted or ſuſpected, that in our late, or preſent procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37468:8"/>
our deſign is to over throw <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> or hinder the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, and to have the <hi>Independent</hi> government ſet up, we doe clearely diſclaime, and diſavow any ſuch deſigne; We one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire that according to the Declarations (promiſing a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for tender conſciences) there may ſome effectuall courſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken according to the intent thereof; And that ſuch, who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſcientious grounds, may differ from the eſtabliſhed formes, may not (for that) bee debarred from the common Rights, Liberties, or Benefits belonging equally to all, as men and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Common wealth, while they live ſoberly, honeſtly, and inoffenſively towards others, and peaceably and faithfully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the State.</p>
            <p>We have thus freely and clearely declared the depth and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of our hearts and deſires in order to the Rights, Liberties, and Peace of the Kingdome, wherein we appeale to all men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſeeke any thing of advantage to our ſelves, or any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular party whatever, to the prejudice of the whole, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things we wiſh and ſeek, doe not equally concerne and conduce to the good of others in common with our ſelves, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſincerity of our deſires and intentions; wherein, (as we have already found the concurrent ſence of the people in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Counties by their Petitions to the Generall, expreſſing their deepe repreſentment of theſe things, and preſſing us to ſtand for the Intereſt of the Kingdome therein; ſo we ſhall wiſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find the unanimous concurrence of all others, who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually concerned with us in theſe things, and wiſh well to the Publike.
