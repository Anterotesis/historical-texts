            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Peace, 'twere enough to say, nothing is more
expresly required than Christian <hi>Concord</hi>
by our Lord Iesus, or more commended
from its heavenly Original and happy Fruits;
nor scarce any thing more warned against as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
the Kingdom of Christ, advantageous
to Satan's Interest, destructive to Religion, yea
Civil Society, repugnant to the very <hi>Design</hi> and
<hi>Spirit</hi> of the Gospel, with the mutual useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Men, than uncharitable and dividing
Contentions be. The only reason that can be
suggested to acquit such Contenders from notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Guilt must be, that it's for the <hi>Faith of the
Gospel</hi> that they contend. But it's worth our
serious thoughts, that as even this cannot excuse
a rigid, censorious, envenom'd Spirit, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed
Methods in our Struggles for Truth;
so no other than a <hi>direct Opposition to the
Essentials of some Fundamental Article</hi> can
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:43119:3"/>
warrant Divisions, or refusals of Communion
on the account of meer difference in the Faith,
provided <hi>Assent</hi> to no real Error is imposed on
us as a <hi>Term of Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's too obvious to require Proof, that if a
<hi>direct</hi> Opposition to what is not fundamental,
or to whatever <hi>remotely</hi> belongs to all which
is so; nay further, if opposing by <hi>denied Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences</hi>
what is of the Essence of any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Article of Faith, be a warrant for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of Ministers and Churches from each
other, then the <hi>instituted Rules</hi> of Christian
Fellowship do not oblige us: the <hi>approved In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
of Communion in the New Testament
Churches ought to be condemned, and all the
Churches of Christ must daily be more and more
<hi>rended</hi> by Non-communion and dividing Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities,
until the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church lose all
shew of <hi>Unity,</hi> or be reduced to a single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
(and that but for an uncertain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
even when vast numbers of <hi>Christian
Societies</hi> proclaim the Advancement of our
Saviour's Conquest.</p>
            <p>Nor is their Folly less apparent, who for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
of this surmise that every Error which
they ought to rectify in themselves, and by just
methods to reform in others, is a <hi>bar</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
or yet, that Separation is one of those
<hi>just</hi> Methods in the case fore-mentioned, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
towards such over whom they pretend to no
<hi>Authority.</hi> O when will Men see that Christ's
Royal <hi>Prerogative</hi> is assumed, when ever <hi>other</hi>
Terms of, or Bars to Communion are invented
than what he hath expresly made such, and
that in a matter wherein his own Honour and
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:43119:3"/>
his People's Interest are concerned next to that
of Vnion with himself!</p>
            <p>But alas! in contempt of Rules so necessary
to the Churches Peace, many Ages are filled with
Instances of assuming a right to <hi>account him
for a Heathen</hi> who differs but in Trifles, and
cannot pronounce their very <hi>Phrases,</hi> tho scrupled
because abused to support an Error, and the
Truth designed by them is most expresly owned:
a thing so thwarting a Christian Temper, that
<hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Bazil</hi> profess they would break
with none who refused the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so they
would by any words declare their soundness in
the Doctrine of the Trinity; and yet that word
had been adjusted by not a few particular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
but the great <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the Heresy of <hi>Arius.</hi> I scruple not to
say, an <hi>Antichristian</hi> Spirit most effectually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisheth
the like Moderation; and such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
entrusted with the <hi>Secular</hi> Sword, would
use it as they do their <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> however
they condemn Severity while <hi>themselves</hi> are not
the Persecutors.</p>
            <p>That there have been of late years great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
among the <hi>Dissenters</hi> is too publickly
know; I had rather share in the Imputation of
an Accessory, than perpetuate them by the fullest
Vindication, hoping that a calm Season will
better fit all of us to reflect, and repent of our
Faultiness, especially the <hi>Unchristian</hi> manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Debates, and for which we have
great reason to pray God would not signally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<hi>hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But blessed be the Name of our God, that
e'er we be quite <hi>devoured</hi> by each other, a fit
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:43119:4"/>
occasion is ministred for our healing; and tho
self-preservation hath been my work ever since
my temperate Confutation of Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> (and
then too) none will wonder I take hold of this
Opportunity to evidence that further Contests
will be inexcusable: nor is it a hard Province
when the <hi>united Ministers</hi> and <hi>Congregational</hi>
Brethren have so far acquitted themselves:
The <hi>first</hi> by sundry former Accounts (and now
more enlarged from any word in which I cannot
suspect two will differ) of their Vindication
from Errors concerning the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of
Christ, and <hi>Justification,</hi> which are the only
Points objected. The last by their <hi>Declaration
against Antinomian Erros,</hi> for which I am
too thankful to remark its Stings; and had
it come out before my <hi>Postscript,</hi> I durst not
have represented their Iudgment by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of their Objections (however natural)
as in some few things is done. That the <hi>God
of Peace</hi> would give us Peace, is the unfeigned

            <p>AS the too visible Progress of <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianism</hi>
grieved us, and obliged our
Defence of the Truth, and a Gospel-Ministry:
so we must rejoice in the
<hi>Congregational Ministers Declaration against
Antinomian Errors,</hi> well knowing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
will more regard the Judgment of
these Brethren, because of their Agreement
with them in matters of Church-Discipline.</p>
            <p>We are sorry they were not a little sooner
prevailed with to give this Testimony; for
then we had not been forced in <hi>the Answer to
the Report,</hi> to hint some of the Reasons indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
us to think many of them espoused, and
the generality of them in this City too much
countenanced <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> with its open
Abettors. Nor dare we indulge a Temper
so devilish, as for Party-sake to repine at these
Brethren acquitting themselves from those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Errors: But on the contrary, we glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavour to procure Peace by this <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of theirs; for which desirable end, we
shall overlook all the Reflections contained
therein against us; and not refuse to acquit
our selves once more from all <hi>hurtful Errors
concerning Christ's Satisfaction, and our Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
(altho so fully and often done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43119:5"/>
that our Brethrens Insinuation to the
contrary doth not a little surprize us) and,
which is principally aimed at, we hope it will
appear, that in all that's <hi>material,</hi> both our
Brethren agree with us in our Testimony
against <hi>Antinomianism;</hi> and we agree with
them in a disapproval of the other Extreams.
To evidence which we shall repeat, 1. Our
Testimony against Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Errors, when
so many were indangered by his <hi>reprinted</hi>
Books. 2. Some part of our former Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
against <hi>Popish, Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi>
Errors, when our Brethren accused us thereof
for subscribing the foresaid Testimony against
<hi>Crispianism.</hi> 3. We shall give an account of
our Congregational Brethrens <hi>Declaration
against Antinomian Errors.</hi> 4. We shall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that this taken together and examined
with Candor, ought to be acknowledged a
sufficient Vindication of the Approvers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
from all <hi>hurtful Antinomian</hi> Errors. 5. We
shall add our further Testimony against Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
about Christ's Satisfaction and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
If Peace at least must not be allowed
us after this, we must bewail a judicial stroke,
and expect to be despised by such who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
our common hurt from these Debates,
but have not Judgment to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the injured Seekers of Peace, and the
injurious Fomenters of Trouble.</p>

               <head type="sub">The State of Truth and Errors (subscribed

by Mr. Williams, in a Book called,

first Edition; Anno 16. 1692.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 1. IT is <hi>certain</hi> from God's Decree
of Election, that the Elect shall
in time be justified, adopted, and saved in
<hi>the way</hi> God hath appointed; and the <hi>whole</hi>
meritorious Cause and Price of Justification,
Adoption, and Eternal Life, were perfect,
when Christ <hi>finished</hi> the Work of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Nevertheless, the Elect <hi>remain</hi> Children
of Wrath, and subject to Condemnation, <hi>till</hi>
they are effectually called by the Operation
of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> The Elect are at <hi>no time</hi> of their
Lives under the Wrath of God, nor are they
subject to Condemnation if they should die
<hi>before</hi> they believe; yea, when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Dominion of Sin, and in the Practice
of the grossest Villanies, they are <hi>as much</hi>
the Sons of God, and justified, as the very
Saints in Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 2. Tho <hi>our Sins</hi> were imputed to
Christ with respect to the <hi>Guilt</hi> thereof, so
that he, by the Father's Appointment, and
his own Consent, became obliged, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43119:6"/>
to bear the <hi>Punishments</hi> of our Iniquities;
and he did bear those Punishments to the <hi>full
Satisfaction of Iustice,</hi> and to our actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
when we believe; nevertheless, the
<hi>Filth</hi> of our Sins was not laid upon Christ;
nor can he be called the Transgressor, or was
he in God's account the Blasphemer, Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> God did not only impute the Guilt,
and lay the Punishment of the Sins of the
Elect upon Christ; but he laid all the very
Sins of the Elect upon Christ, and that, as
to their <hi>real Filthiness and Loathsomness;</hi> yea,
so, that Christ was <hi>really</hi> the Blasphemer,
Murderer, and Sinner, and so accounted by
the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 3. The Atonement made by Christ,
by the Appointment of God, is that <hi>for
which alone</hi> the Elect are pardoned, when it
is applied to them. But the Elect are not
immediately pardoned upon Christ's being
appointed to suffer for them, nor as soon as
the Atonement was made; nor is that Act of
laying Sins on Christ, God's forgiving Act,
by which we are <hi>personally discharged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> The very Act of God's laying Sins
on Christ upon the Cross, is the very <hi>actual
discharge</hi> of all the Elect from all their Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 4. An Elect Person ceaseth not to be
a Sinner upon the laying of our Sins upon
Christ; that is, he remains a Sinner, as to the
<hi>Guilt,</hi> till he believes, if Adult. He is a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as to the <hi>Filth</hi> of Sin, till he be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
He is a Sinner, as to the charge of the
sinful <hi>Fact</hi> he commits, and that even after
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43119:6"/>
Pardon and Sanctification: Nevertheless, he
is free from the <hi>Curse</hi> when he is pardoned,
and shall be purged from all the Filth of Sin
when he is perfect in Holiness. And tho
Christ did bear the Punishment of our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
yet it never was Christ's Iniquity, but
<hi>ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> The Elect upon the Death of Christ
ceased to be Sinners, and <hi>ever since</hi> their Sins
are none of <hi>their</hi> Sins, but they are the Sins
of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 5. The <hi>Obligation</hi> of suffering for
our Sins was upon Christ, from his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the Office of a Mediator, to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherein he finished his satisfactory A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement.
The <hi>Punishment</hi> of our Sins lay
upon Christ from the first moment, to the
last of his state of Humiliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> The time when our Sins were laid
<hi>actually</hi> on Christ, was when he was nailed to
the Cross, and God actually forsook him;
and they continued on him <hi>till</hi> his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 6. The God testified his threatned
<hi>Indignation</hi> against Sin, in the awful Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Christ's <hi>Soul</hi> and Body in his Agony,
and suspended those <hi>delightful</hi> Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Divine Nature to the Human
Nature of Christ, as to their wonted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
yet God was never <hi>separated</hi> from
Christ, much less during his Body's lying in
the Grave; neither was the Father ever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with Christ, and far less did he <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi>
him, because of the <hi>Filthiness</hi> of Sin upon
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:43119:7"/>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> Christ was on the account of the
<hi>Filthiness</hi> of Sins, while they lay upon him,
<hi>separated</hi> from God, <hi>odious</hi> to him, and even
the Object of God's <hi>Abhorrence,</hi> and this to
the time of his Resurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 7. The Mediatorial Righteousness
of Christ is so imputed to true Believers, as
that for the sake thereof they are pardoned
and accepted unto Life eternal; it being
reckoned to them, and <hi>pleadable</hi> by them for
these Uses, as if they had personally done
and suffered what Christ did as Mediator <hi>for</hi>
them, whereby they are delivered from the
Curse, and no other Atonement nor meriting
Price of saving Benefits can be demanded
from them. Nevertheless, this Mediatorial
Righteousness is not subjectively in them;
nor is there a Change of Person betwixt
them and Christ, neither are they as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as he; but there remain Spots and Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
in them, until Christ by his Spirit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that Holiness begun in all true Believers,
which he will effect before he bring them to
Heaven. <hi>See the</hi> 2d <hi>Truth, and note, it is
only Dr.</hi> Crisp'<hi>s Change of Person is denied,</hi> viz.
<hi>a perfect Change which makes us as righteous
as he,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but not Christ's dying in our stead,
which in this Book is oft asserted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> Every Believer, or elect Person, is
as righteous as Christ, and there is a <hi>perfect</hi>
Change of Person and Condition betwixt
Christ and the Elect; he was what we are,
<hi>viz.</hi> as sinful as we; and we are what he
was, <hi>viz.</hi> perfectly holy, and without Spot or
Blemish.</p>

Truth 8. <hi>I shall express it in the words of
the Assembly.</hi> The Grace of God is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
in the <hi>second Covenant,</hi> in that he freely
provideth, and offereth to Sinners a Mediator,
and Life and Salvation by him, requiring
Faith as the <hi>Condition</hi> to interest them in
him; promiseth and giveth his holy Spirit to
all his Elect to work in them that Faith,
with all other saving Graces; and to enable
them unto all Obedience, as the Evidence
of the Truth of their Faith and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to God, and as the way which he hath
appointed them to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Note, Reader, that these Divines do here
join together the Covenant of Redemption with
Christ, and the Gospel-Covenant whereby are
dispensed to us the Benefits impetrated by Christ;
which two distinguished would lead to clearer
thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> The <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> hath <hi>no
Condition</hi> to be performed on Man's part,
tho in the strentgh of Christ: Neither is
<hi>Faith</hi> it self the Condition of this Covenant;
but all the saving Benefits of this Covenant,
are actually ours <hi>before</hi> we are born: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are we <hi>required</hi> so much as to believe,
that we may come to have an Interest in the
Covenant-<hi>Benefits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truth 9. <hi>I shall express this in the words of
the Assembly, and Congregational Elders at the</hi>
Savoy <hi>(Confes. of Faith,</hi> ch. 14. 2. &amp; <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi>
ch. 14. a. 2. of <hi>saving Faith:)</hi> By this
Grace, a Christian believeth to be true what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is revealed in the Word, for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God speaking therein; and <hi>acteth</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:43119:8"/>
differently upon that which <hi>each</hi> particular
Passage thereof containeth; yielding Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Commands, trembling at the
Threatnings, and embracing the Promises of
God for this Life, and that which is to come.
But the principal Acts of saving Faith, are
<hi>accepting, receiving,</hi> and <hi>resting</hi> upon Christ
alone for Justification, <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and
Eternal Life, by <hi>virtue</hi> of the Covenant of
Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error. Saving Faith</hi> is nothing but our
<hi>Persuasion,</hi> or absolute concluding within
our selves, that our Sins are pardoned, and
that Christ is ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 10. Christ is freely <hi>offered</hi> to be a
Head and Saviour to the <hi>vilest</hi> Sinners, who
will knowingly assent to the Truth of the
Gospel, and from a Conviction of their Sin
and Misery out of Christ, are humbled, and
<hi>truly willing</hi> to renounce all their Idols and
Sins; denying their own <hi>carnal</hi> Self and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and accept of Christ as offered in the
Gospel; relying on him alone for Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Sanctification, and Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> Christ is offered to Blasphemers,
Murderers, and the worst of Sinners, that
they <hi>remaining</hi> ignorant, unconvinced, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled,
and resolved in their purpose to
continue such, they may be assured they have
a full Interest in Christ, and this by <hi>only
concluding</hi> in their own Minds upon this
Offer, that Christ is theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 11. Every Man is without Christ, or
not <hi>united</hi> to Christ, until he be effectually
called; but when by this Call the Spirit of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43119:8"/>
God enclineth and enableth him willingly to
accept of Christ as a Head and Saviour, a
Man becomes <hi>united</hi> to him, and Partaker of
those Influences and Privileges which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the Members of the Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> All the Elect are <hi>actually united</hi> to
Christ, before they have the Spirit of Christ,
or at all believe in him, even before they are
born; yea, and against their Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 12. Tho Faith be no way a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Cause of a Sinner's Justification, yet
God hath promised to justify all such as truly
believe, and requires Faith as an indispensible
Qualification in all whom he will justify for
Christ's Merits; declaring, that Unbelief
shall not only hinder Mens <hi>knowing</hi> that they
are justified, but that it is a bar to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's
<hi>being</hi> justified <hi>while</hi> he continues an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error.</hi> The <hi>whole</hi> use of Faith in Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is only to <hi>manifest</hi> that we were justified
before; and Faith is no way necessary to
bring a Sinner into a justified State, nor <hi>at
all useful</hi> to that end.</p>

                  <head>In a Digression there about Repentance

                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth.</hi> Altho neither Faith nor Repentance
be any part of the meriting Righteousness
for which we are justified, and the Habits of
both are wrought at the same time, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Regenerating Principle; and
there must be an assenting Act of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there be any exercise of true Repentance:
And Repentance as consisting in the fruits
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43119:9"/>
meet for it, <hi>viz.</hi> an external Reformation
and a fruitful Life, must follow Pardon, as
doth also an ingenuous Sorrow for Sin in the
sense of Pardon: Nevertheless, Repentance,
as it consists in some degree of Humblings
and Sorrow from Convictions of our lost
State, and the Evil of Sin, with a sincere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of Heart to turn from our Sin and Idols
to God, is absolutely necessary in order to
the forgiveness of Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Error.</hi> Our Sins are forgiven before any
Repentance; and Believers ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
or mourn, or sorrow for the Sins they
have committed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> 13. Tho neither Holiness, sincere
Obedience, or good Works, do make any
<hi>Atonement</hi> for Sin; or are in the least the
<hi>meritorious Righteousness</hi> whereby Salvation is
caused, or for which this, or any Blessing
becomes <hi>due to us as of Debt;</hi> yet as the
Spirit of Christ freely worketh all Holiness
in the Soul, and enableth us to sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and good Works; so the Lord Jesus
hath <hi>of Grace,</hi> and for his own Merits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to bring to Heaven such as are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of true Holiness, perform this sincere
Obedience, and do these good Works perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veringly,
and appoints these as the Way and
Means of a Believer's obtaining Salvation,
and several other Blessings; <hi>requiring</hi> these
as indispensible Duties and Qualifications of
all such whom he will so save and bless, and
<hi>excluding</hi> all that want or neglect them, or
live under the Power of what's contrary
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43119:9"/>
thereto, <hi>viz.</hi> Profaneness, Rebellion, and utter
Unfruitfulness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Error.</hi> Men have nothing to do <hi>in order</hi> to
Salvation, nor is Sanctification a jot the <hi>way</hi>
of any Person to Heaven; nor can the Graces
or Duties of Believers, no, nor <hi>Faith</hi> it self
do them the <hi>least</hi> Good, or prevent the least
Evil; nor are they of any use to their <hi>Peace</hi>
or Comfort; yea, tho Christ be <hi>explicitely</hi>
owned, and they be done in the strength of
the Spirit of God. And a Believer ought not
to think he is more <hi>pleasing</hi> to God by any
Grace he acteth, or Good he doth; nor may
Men <hi>expect any Good</hi> to a Nation by the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
earnest Prayer, or Reformation of
a People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> 14. Tho we ought to intend <hi>God's
Glory</hi> as our supream End in all our Duties,
and design therein the expressing our Love
and <hi>Gratitude</hi> to God for his Benefits, with
a great regard <hi>to publick</hi> Good: Yet we also
lawfully may, and ought to strive after Grace,
grow in it, and perform holy Duties and
Services, with an <hi>Eye to,</hi> and <hi>Concern for</hi> our
own spiritual and eternal Advantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Error.</hi> No Man ought to propose to himself
<hi>any Advantage</hi> by any Religious Duty he
performeth, nor ought he in the <hi>least</hi> to intend
the Profit of his own Soul by any Christian
Endeavours; it being vain and unlawful to
do any thing with an Eye to our <hi>spiritual</hi>
or <hi>eternal Good,</hi> tho in <hi>Subordination</hi> to God's
Glory in Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> 15. The <hi>ordinary</hi> way whereby a
Man attaineth a well-grounded Assurance, is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43119:10"/>
not by <hi>immediate</hi> objective Revelation, or
an inward Voice saying, <hi>Thy Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
thee:</hi> But when the Believer is <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining</hi>
his Heart and Life by the <hi>Word,</hi> the
holy Spirit <hi>enlightens</hi> the Mind there to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Faith, and Love, and such other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
which the Gospel declareth to be
infallible <hi>signs</hi> of Regeneration: And he adds
such <hi>Power</hi> to the Testimony of <hi>Conscience</hi>
for the Truth and In-being of these Graces,
as begets in the Soul a joyful sense of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
State; and some comfortable free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from those Fears which accompany a
doubting Christian; and according to the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
of these Graces, Assurance is <hi>ordinarily</hi>
strong or weak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Error.</hi> Assurance is not attained by the
<hi>Evidence</hi> of Scripture-Marks of <hi>Signs</hi> of
Grace, or by the Spirit's <hi>discovering</hi> to us
that he hath wrought in our Hearts any holy
Qualifications: But Assurance comes <hi>only</hi> by
an inward <hi>Voice</hi> of the Spirit saying, <hi>Thy
Sins are forgiven thee,</hi> and our believing
<hi>thereupon</hi> that our Sins are forgiven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> 16. The Sins of Believers have the
<hi>loathsomness</hi> of Sin adhering to them, which
God <hi>seeth,</hi> and accounteth the <hi>Committers</hi>
guilty thereby: and they ought to charge
<hi>themselves</hi> therewith, so as to stir up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Repentance, and renew their Actings
of Faith on Christ for Forgiveness. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
they ought not thereby to fear their
being out of a justified <hi>State,</hi> further than
their Falls give them <hi>just</hi> cause of suspecting
that Sin hath <hi>Dominion</hi> over them; and that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43119:10"/>
their <hi>first</hi> believing on Christ was not <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Error.</hi> God <hi>seeth no Sin</hi> in Believers, tho he
see the <hi>Fact;</hi> neither doth <hi>He</hi> charge them with
any Sin; nor ought they to charge <hi>themselves</hi>
with any Sin, nor be at all sad for them; nor
confess, repent, or do any thing as a <hi>Means</hi>
of their Pardon; no, nor in order to <hi>assuring</hi>
themselves of Pardon, even when they commit
Murder, Adultery, or the <hi>grossest</hi> Wickedness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> 17. It's true of <hi>Believers,</hi> that if
Sin should have <hi>Dominion</hi> over them, they
would thereby be subject to Condemnation:
And tho the Grace of God will <hi>prevent</hi> the
Dominion of Sin in every elect Believer, and
so keep them from <hi>eternal</hi> Death; yet true
Believers may by Sin bring great <hi>hurt</hi> upon
themselves in Soul and Body, which they
ought to <hi>fear;</hi> and they may expect a share
in <hi>National</hi> Judgments, according as they
have contributed to common Guilt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Error.</hi> The <hi>grossest</hi> Sins that Believers can
commit, cannot do them the <hi>least harm;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

themselves have had a hand therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> 18. Tho God is not so <hi>angry</hi> with
his People for their Sins, as to cast them out
of his <hi>Covenant</hi>-favour; yet by their Sins he
is so <hi>displeased,</hi> as for them to <hi>correct</hi> his
Children, tho he speaks <hi>Instructions</hi> by his
Rebukes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Error.</hi> None of the Afflictions of Believers

<hi>Sanction</hi> of the Law of Innocency; nor any
Atonement for our Defects; and we <hi>still</hi> need
Forgiveness and the Merits of Christ, for
<hi>Acceptance</hi> thereof; yet as far as it prevails
it's lovely in it self, and pleasing to God, and

                     <hi>Truth 20. Gospel-preaching</hi> is when the
Messengers of Christ do publish to fallen
Sinners the good News of Salvation by
Christ, to be <hi>obtained</hi> in the way which he

Salvation on his Terms, earnestly perswading

to comply with those Terms, as ever they

possess the Benefits he hath purchased; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
all to look to him for <hi>Strength,</hi> and
acknowledg him as the only Mediator, and
his Obedience and Sufferings as the <hi>sole</hi>
Atonement for Sin, and <hi>meriting</hi> Cause of all
Blessings; instructing them in all revealed

pressing after Perfection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Error. Gospel-Preaching</hi> is to teach Men

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43119:11"/>
and while they were ungodly, they had

                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth 21. Legal Preaching</hi> is to preach
the Law as a Covenant of Innocency, <hi>or

Preaching, to require and perswade to Faith,

1696. A Paper called, The second
Paper, 1696. A Proposal made by us,
1697.</head>
               <p>ALtho we hoped the Caution used in the
foresaid <hi>State of Truth and Error,</hi> would
prevent the Imputation of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> and
other hurtful Errors; yet finding our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
dissatisfied, we subscribed with them,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1692. (about seven Months after the
<hi>State of Truth</hi> was published) certain Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Propositions collected out of the <hi>Assembly</hi>'s
<hi>Confession,</hi> which we printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1693.
with this Title, <hi>An Agreement in Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi>
&amp;c. but that being too long to be here
inserted, we shall confine our selves to the
more material Parts of what further Account
we have given of our Judgment concerning
the Doctrines of <hi>Satisfaction and Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which may be seen at large in our
<hi>Answer to the Report,</hi> p. 3, 11, 27, 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1694. In a Paper sent to our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational
Brethren it's thus declared:</p>
               <p>We the <hi>united Ministers</hi> in and about
<hi>London,</hi> do renounce and testify against these
following Opinions.</p>
               <p>1. That there is no definite number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<hi>elected</hi> from all Eternity, whom God
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43119:12"/>
will by his appointed Means <hi>certainly</hi> save,
and bring to Eternal Life; leaving the rest
who fall under a just Condemnation for their
Original and Actual Sins, especially for their
Neglect and Contempt of the Means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>2. That Christ died <hi>equally</hi> for all Men,
not intending the final Salvation of some more
than others.</p>
               <p>3. That Men have in their own Power, by
the use of the natural Faculties of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Will, <hi>unassisted</hi> by the special Light
and Grace of the Holy Ghost, to perform all
that is necessary to Salvation; or that his
special efficacious Light and Grace is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to their Conversion, Perseverance,
and final Salvation.</p>
               <p>4. That any of them whom God hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
predestinated, and called effectually
according to the purpose of his Grace, shall
fall away either totally, or so as not to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
glorified.</p>
               <p>5. That Faith, Repentance, a holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
or any Act or Work whatever done
by us, or wrought by the Spirit of God in
us, are any part of that Righteousness, for
the sake of which, or on the account whereof,
God doth justify any Man, or entitle him to
Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>Then follows a Testimony against the other
Extreams, <hi>viz.</hi> Antinomian Errors.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Anno</hi> 1696. in a Paper (call'd <hi>The
second Paper)</hi> sent to our Brethren, we thus
give our sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:43119:13"/>
1. <hi>Concerning Iustification:</hi> That altho the
express Word of God doth assert the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Regeneration to our entring into the
Kingdom of God, and require Repentance
that our Sins may be blotted out, and Faith
in Christ, that we may be justified, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Heart and Life, without which we
cannot see God; yet that none of these, or
any Work done by Men, or wrought by
the Spirit of God in them, is, under any
Denomination whatsoever, any part of the
Righteousness, for the sake, or on the account
whereof God doth pardon, justify, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Sinners, or entitle them to Eternal Life,
that being only the Righteousness of Christ
without them imputed to them, and received
by Faith alone.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Of a Commutation of Persons</hi> between
Christ and us: As we are to consider our
Lord Jesus Christ in his Obedience and
Sufferings, as God and Man, invested with
the Office of Mediator; so it is apparent this
Commutation of Persons with us was not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
in respect of either Nature, by which
his individual Substance should become ours,
and ours his; nor moral, in respect of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
or Actions, whereby he should become
inherently sinful, and we immediately sinless;
nor was it any change whereby his Office
of Mediator should be transferred on us,
but it is to be understood in a legal or judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
sense, as we may call it, <hi>viz.</hi> He by
Agreement between the Father and him,
came into our room and stead, not to repent
and believe for us, which the Gospel requires
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43119:13"/>
of us as our Duty, tho he hath undertaken
the Elect shall in due time be enabled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but to answer for our Violation of the
Law of Works, he being <hi>made Sin for us,
that knew no Sin; that we might be made the
Righteousness of God in him:</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Of God's being pleased or displeased with
Christ as standing and suffering in our stead.</hi>
We judg that God was always pleased with
Christ both in his Person, and Execution of
all his Offices, which is exprest most parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in that of his Priestly, <hi>Iohn 10. 17, 18.
Therefore doth my Father love me, because I
lay down my Life;</hi> and no otherwise displeased
than as having a dispassionate Will to inflict
upon him the Punishment of our Sins, which
he had undertaken to bear, that God might,
without Injury to his Justice or Honour,
pardon and save penitent Believers for his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and Intercession founded thereon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> It was declared, that by the words
<hi>[under any Denomination]</hi> we exclude all
Righteousness from being meritorious, or
atoning, yea, or a procuring Cause of these
Benefits; none is at all so but the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ: But we intended not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
what the Gospel requireth in order to
our Interest in those Benefits given for the
sake of Christ's Righteousness.</p>
               <div type="proposal">
                  <head>We also in 1697, delivered our Iudgment
in this Proposal to our Brethren.</head>
                  <p>1. That Repentance towards God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in order to the Remission of Sins.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43119:14"/>
2. That Faith in Christ is commanded by the
Gospel, in order to the Justification of our
Persons before God, for the sake of the alone
Righteousness of Christ. 3. That the Word
of God requires Perseverance in true Faith
and Holiness, that we may be Partakers of
the Heavenly Glory. 4. That the Gospel
promiseth Pardon through the Blood of Christ
to the Penitent, Justification before God to
the Believer, and the Heavenly Glory to such
as persevere in Faith and Holiness; and also
declareth that God will not pardon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent,
justify the Unbeliever, nor glorify
the Apostate or Unholy. 5. That justifying
Faith is not only a Perswasion of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
but also a receiving and resting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ alone for Salvation. 6. That by
Change of Person, is meant, that whereas
we were condemned for our Sins, the Lord
Jesus was <hi>substituted</hi> in our room to bear the
Punishment of our Sins for the Satisfaction
of Divine Justice, that whoever believes on
him may be acquitted and saved; but it is
not intended that the Filth of Sin was upon
Christ, nor that he was a Criminal in God's
account. 7. That by Christ being our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is meant, that Jesus Christ our Mediator
obliged himself to expiate our Sins by his
Blood, and to purchase eternal Life for all
that believe, and Faith and every saving Grace
for the Elect; but it's not intended that we
were legally reputed to make Satisfaction, or
purchase eternal Life. 8. That by Christ's
answering for us the Obligations of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Law of Works, is intended, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43119:14"/>
the Law obliged us to die for our Sins,
Christ became obliged to die in our stead;
and whereas we were after we had sinned
still obliged to yield perfect Obedience,
Christ perfectly obeyed the Law, that upon the
account of his Active and Passive Obedience
Believers might be forgiven, and entituled to
eternal Life; but it is not intended that the
sense of the Law of Works should be, that
if we, or Christ obey'd, we should live, and
if Christ suffered we should not die, tho we
sinned; nor that Believers are justified, or
to be judged by the Law of Works, but by
the Gospel; altho the Righteousness for the
sake of which they are justified, be as perfect
as that Law of Works required, and far
more <hi>valuable.</hi>

December 1698.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 1. THat the eternal Decree gives
such an Existence to the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Elect, as makes their Estate
whilst in Unbelief, to be the same as when
they do believe, in all respects save only as
to the <hi>Manifestation;</hi> and that there is no

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:43119:15"/>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 2. That the Elect considered as in
their natural Estate, or as in the first <hi>Adam,</hi>
are not under the denunciation of <hi>Wrath</hi> by
the Law, as well as other Unbelievers and
impenitent Sinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 1. That there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the state of the Elect whilst in Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and when Believers, besides what is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestative
to their Consciences, <hi>p.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> 2. That before they believe they are

               <p>

therefore God cannot see Sin in his People
to be <hi>displeased</hi> with them for their Sins; nor
doth God express his Fatherly Displeasure
against them by any Afflictions laid upon
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> That pardoned, yea mortified Sins
are truly and properly Sins; and God <hi>seeth</hi>
the Sins of his own People, and is <hi>displeased</hi>
with them <hi>for</hi> their Sins.</p>
               <p>

confess or mourn over Sin, as committed by
them, or pray for pardon of Sin, in making
a daily acknowledgment of a need of it,
because it was pardoned before committed;
and pardoned Sin is no Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> That when Believers do sin, it is
their Duty to humble themselves, confess their

                  <hi>Truth.</hi> The Sins of Believers do hurt them,
and they should be afraid to commit them,
seeing they impair their Graces and Comforts,
harden their Hearts, wound their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
hurt and scandalize others, grieve
God's holy Spirit, expose to his Fatherly
Displeasure, and bring temporal Judgments
upon them, <hi>p.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 6. That they must do no good Work
or Duty for their own Benefit, or with an
Eye to their own Salvation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 7. Believers not having in themselves
an Ability to do good Works, are not bound
to perform any good Duty, unless excited
thereunto by a special motion of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> Tho Believers Ability to do good
Works is not at all in themselves, but wholly
from the Spirit of Christ, yet are they not
hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were
not bound to perform any Duty unless upon
a special motion of the Spirit, but they ought
to be diligent in stirring up the Grace of God
that is in them, <hi>p.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 8. That Sanctification evidenced by
the Spirit of God to their Consciences, is
not a Sign, Mark, or Evidence of their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
and that Marks and Signs for the
trial of a Believer's Faith are of no use: for
Faith lying in a full perswasion and assurance
that their Persons were actually justified
and pardoned in Christ, it is a Sin to question,
Whether they do savingly believe or no?</p>

<hi>perswasion</hi> and assurance that our Sins are
actually pardoned; but <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Signs</hi> for
the trial of our spiritual Estate are useful,
and to be sought after; and Sanctification
evidenced by the Spirit of God to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
is a certain sign and mark of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<hi>p.</hi> 28, 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 9. That Gospel Ministers are not to
preach the Law in its Commands and Curses
to convince Men of their need of Christ,
nor are Believers obliged to regard the Law
as delivered by <hi>Moses,</hi> nor as externally
propounded; nor are they bound when they
commit Sin to look to the Law for further
Discoveries and Convictions of the remaining
Corruptions that are in them, because by the
Gospel its Obligations are dissolved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> That the Law delivered by <hi>Moses</hi>
continues in its Commands and Curses un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissolved;
and it's still of use to <hi>convince</hi> of
Sin, that we may see a need of Christ, and
therefore is to be preached and externally
propounded, and we are to look unto it,
<hi>p.</hi> 36. And tho there is no Sin so small but
it deserves Damnation, yet there is no Sin so
great that it shall bring Damnation to them
that truly <hi>repent,</hi> which makes the constant
<hi>preaching</hi> of Repentance necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 10. That Ministers of the Gospel
ought not to propound the <hi>Offers</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto all those to whom God calls them
to preach, seriously inviting them to improve
the Means of Grace that they may be saved,
and assuring them in the way of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43119:16"/>
Duty, of the Salvation of all such
as believe in Christ, because they want Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to close with the Offer, and all shall not
be saved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> That tho Men want Ability to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
savingly, yet it's the Duty of Gospel-Ministers
to make the Offer, and testify unto
them that whoever believes and repents shall
be saved; and that it's the Peoples Duty to
make use of their natural Faculties with such
external Means and workings of the Spirit
as God affords them, that they may believe,
repent and be saved, <hi>p.</hi> 41, 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 11. That by God's laying our Sins
upon Christ, he became every way as sinful
as we, and we every way as righteous as he;
and that therefore Persons may expect to be
pardoned whilst they continue in a state of
Unbelief and Impenitence; and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Repentance and Holiness are not in the
nature of the thing, nor, by the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gospel, necessary to our being
possessed of eternal Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> Our Sins were not laid upon Christ
so as to make him every way as sinful as we,
and we are not every way as righteous as
Christ; and none may expect to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
in a state of Unbelief and Impenitence;
and continued Repentance and Holiness are
necessary to our possession of eternal Life,

               <head type="sub">It's made evident, that this Declaration
of our Brethren taken altogether, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
with due Charity and Candor,
ought to be acknowledged a sufficient Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the Approvers thereof from all
hurtful Antinomian Errors.</head>
               <p>TO this end, 1. We think that Christian
Charity and Candor oblige us to judg of
what they have declared by these following
Rules, and we expect the same for our selves
from them. 1. That the omission of any
Points unmentioned is not to be attributed to
a mistaken Judgment concerning them, and
far less when the things expressed are granted
to be Truths or Errors upon a reason that
alike infers what is omitted. 2. That the
Approvers do truly intend for substance what
is declared. 3. That in a Body of Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
some few may be more narrow in their
Conceptions, and therefore to avoid a Breach,
must be accommodated in the phrasing of some
Points beyond what the others, if at full
liberty, would either need or chuse. 4. If any
thing be a little darkly or suspiciously word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in one part, and more expresly and fully
in another, the latter must be the Index of
their Judgment; upon which account we cite
not only their <hi>State of Error and Truth,</hi> but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43119:17"/>
refer to the Pages containing their Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
and approved <hi>Authorities,</hi> some
of which will be mentioned afterwards.
5. That they ought not to be charged with
the Consequences of any occasional Passages
which they disown.</p>
               <p>2. These just Rules being admitted, we
shall enumerate the <hi>hurtful Antinomian Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi>
as Antinomianism is described in the
last Age (which in many things differs from
what was so called at first) and under each
refer you to the places (besides the above-mentioned
<hi>State of Error and Truth)</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Brethren have so laudably vindicated
themselves by their <hi>Declaration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The dangerous Parts of <hi>Antinomianism</hi> are
reducible to these general Heads. 1. As it
renders the <hi>Ministry</hi> unapt to its proper
Ends. 2. As it tends to <hi>Libertinism</hi> in
Practice. 3. As it hinders a well-grounded
<hi>Assurance,</hi> and encourageth <hi>Presumption.</hi>
4. As it reproacheth <hi>Christ</hi> our blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
Against each of which our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
bear their Testimony.</p>
               <p>1. The hurtful <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errors which
render the <hi>Ministry</hi> unapt to its proper Ends,
are, 1. Unduly limiting the <hi>Offers</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and decrying Arguments to excite Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to use their Endeavours under the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of Gospel Means and common Grace.
Against this see <hi>Error</hi> 10. and from <hi>p.</hi> 41
to 47. 2. Forbidding and branding as <hi>legal</hi>
the <hi>preaching</hi> of Duties and Threatnings, and
the applying of promised Benefits as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to Faith and other Duties, whereto those
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43119:18"/>
Benefits are promised. Against which see
<hi>Error</hi> 9. and <hi>p. 36, 39. Error</hi> 6. and <hi>p.</hi> 25,
26, 45. 3. Denying that the Elect whilst
<hi>unconverted,</hi> are under the Curse of the Law,
and affirming they are united to Christ, and
justified <hi>before God,</hi> and pardoned whilst im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
Infidels. Against which see <hi>Errors</hi>
1, 2, 11. and <hi>p.</hi> 12 to 18. and 47, 58.</p>
               <p>2. The hurtful <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errors tending
to <hi>Libertinism</hi> in Practice, besides the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
to a Sinner's Conviction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
under the fore-mentioned Head of
the <hi>Ministry,</hi> are such as these: 1. That <hi>God
seeth no Sin in his People,</hi> accounts them not
their Sins but Christ's, and is not <hi>displeased</hi>
with his People, nor afflicts them <hi>for</hi> their

them what we think to be Truths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 1. Punitive Justice against Sin is no
Property of God, but only an Effect of his
Will, and therefore there was no need of
any Satisfaction to be made by Christ for
Sin; nor is it less than ridiculous to say
God was at once just as well as merciful in
bringing about our Salvation by Christ:

                  <hi>Truth.</hi> God is essentially just, and so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for the Honour of his Law when enacted
and his Government, that Sin must not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished;
and therefore if Sinners be saved
from the Punishments threatned by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Law for Christ their Mediator's sake,
it was necessary that he made Satisfaction to
Punitive Justice by enduring the Penal Effects
of God's Wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 2. Jesus Christ is not the true eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> This Article is inserted, because the
<hi>Value</hi> of Christ's Obedience and Death, for
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> was deprived from the
Dignity of Christ's Person as God: And
therefore tho the <hi>Socinians</hi> faintly argue, that
if Christ were the eternal God, it would
not render his Death a Satisfaction; yet it's
evident their great Concern in denying
Christ's Satisfaction is to prevent the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable
Argument this would be for his
Deity. The like is also to be seen by their
Notion of the <hi>Lord's-Supper.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 3. Christ did not by his Blood acquire
or purchase the Gospel-Covenant, nor was his
Death an impulsive Cause of God's promising to
Men the Blessings of that Covenant; nor did it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43119:20"/>
move him to make such Promises: But Christ
was only the Mediator, that is, Sponsor of it,
who assured Men that God would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
it, and who in God's Name, and by
his Command, performed such things as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the confirming and executing of
the said Covenant. <hi>Socin. Tom. 2. 168, 199.

               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> Christ did not only confirm the
Gospel-Covenant to Men, and do such things
as belonged to the execution of the Gospel
Promises, but God as Governor made those
Promises in consideration of the Death of
Christ, as what vindicated the Glory of his
Government in offering and promising such
Blessings to condemned Sinners, altho as our
absolute Lord and Proprietor he freely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
within himself, that those Blessings
should be granted in what method he judged
fit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 4. Christ was for no other cause a
Mediator, nor so call'd, but that he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God a middle Person between
himself and Men, not that he should appease
God towards Men, but that he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
God already pacified to them, and
most evidently confirm the same by himself:
And as for Men who were Haters of and
Enemies to God, them he was to reconcile
to God <hi>(i. e.</hi> convert) and be our eternal
Lawgiver, and faithful Interpreter of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will to them, by whom they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

                  <hi>Truth.</hi> Jesus Christ was by Divine Adjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a middle Person between God and
Sinners, and as such laid his hand on both;
undertaking to appease God's Wrath, and
procure Salvation for us at his hand; and
also to make God and the way of Salvation
known to us for our Reconciliation and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God: and by him God still im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
his Blessings to us, and admits us free

               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 5. Christ is called a Surety as a

               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> Tho Christ was not a joint fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
Party with us in the Covenant of
Works, yet he was not only a Surety on
God's part to us, but he was a mediating
Surety on both parts; and as such he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the Covenant of Redemption to
make Atonement for us, and in the Gospel-Covenant,
that all true Believers shall perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
to the obtaining of eternal Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 6. Christ was not an High-Priest
while on Earth, nor was his Blood offered
by him to God, but it was himself was offered,
and that not on the Cross, but when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into Heaven; yet the Death of Christ
so far belongs to his Priesthood, that he was
prepared by his Death to become a High-Priest,
and to offer himself a perfect Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for Sin in Heaven, neither of which
could be according to the Decree of God, if
his Death had not intervened. <hi>Crell. vol. 2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> Christ was an High-Priest while he
was on Earth, and as such upon the Cross
offered up himself by his bloody Death a
perfect Sacrifice, whereby his Blood was a
propitiatory offering at the very time it was
shed; and tho in the virtue thereof the Saints
were saved before his Incarnation, and Christ
for ever intercedeth in the Heavens, yet the
presenting of himself or it there, makes no
addition to the Perfection of it as a Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 7. There is no use nor place in the
Priesthood of Christ for appeasing God's
Wrath, or offering any Sacrifice, no not in
Heaven, as a Condition of obtaining Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
properly as from God, or impetrating
the same; but Christ's Death is a means of
our enjoying that Remission from God, and
it was indirectly a Condition thereof as to
be given to us, <hi>i. e.</hi> it was a Condition impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
on Christ, without which, by the Divine
Decree, he was not to obtain Authority from
God to forgive us our Sins; and it may be
called a Sacrifice to God's Mercy, as of his
own free Grace reconciled, but not as offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Sinners. <hi>Socin. Tom. 2. 665, 666.
Crell. vol. 1. 612. Wolzog. in Ioh.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth.</hi> The first and principal use of Christ's
Priesthood, was to offer on the Cross a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to appease God's Wrath against Sinners,
and to impetrate Remission and eternal Life,
that so God the offended Governor might,
consistently with the Honour of his Law, and
of all his Divine Perfections, be at liberty, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43119:21"/>
inclined as well to give the said Blessings, as
that we might become actual Partakers of
them from Christ, as authorized to apply
them to us: And all the other Sacerdotal
Acts of Christ do refer to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Error</hi> 8. Redemption mentioned in the
New Testament, signifies no more nor other
than a freeing us from the Punishment of Sin
without any proper Price intervening. And
when it's said, Redemption is obtained by
the Blood of Christ, it's not meant that the
Blood of Christ could move God, or that
God was thereby obliged to grant us Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the Punishment of our Sins, but
that the shedding of his Blood ought to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene,
that we might be moved thereby to
accept that Deliverance when offered to us.
Neither did Christ buy us, but God by Christ
asserted his Right to us; and tho our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from Punishment is gotten as if by a
Price, yet this is not as if the Blood of Christ
were paid to any. <hi>Socin. Tom. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Truth.</hi> Redemption by the Blood of Christ,
is that we are bought by his Blood as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

disputes against this as the Error of <hi>Grotius</hi>
and the rest of the Orthodox, stating it in
these words, <q>God was before angry, but
being appeased by the Death of Christ he
determined to lay aside his Anger, and
upon our believing and repenting he doth

               <p>2. <hi>Grotius de Satisf. cap.</hi> 7. distinguisheth
the Actings of the Divine Will; 1. As <hi>before</hi>
Christ's Death is decreed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then God is
angry with the Sinner, yet so as not to be
averse to all methods of Reconciliation.
2. <hi>Vpon</hi> Christ's Death (as well when fixed

the way, but <hi>promiseth</hi> to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.

with a right Faith, and Christ according to
the Tenor of the Covenant presents the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43119:22"/>
to God; then God lays aside his Anger,
and receives the Person into Favour (or is

               <p>3. How little do well-meaning <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi>
consider, that not only in the third
Error, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in this <hi>last Error,</hi> they agree
with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and that in a Point whence
<hi>most</hi> of their false Notions about Christ's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
proceed. For, see you not? they
hold that after God's absolute Decree to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy

the change is only on <hi>our</hi> part: And no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation

                  <hi>Error</hi> 10. By Christ's dying for our Sins

Christ according to his Sponsion satisfied <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

God any thing which we owed for our Sins;
but when he is said to have died for our Sins

Sins, <hi>to take them away,</hi> i. e. he died to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim</hi>
us from our Sins, and to <hi>assure</hi> us, that

                  <hi>Truth.</hi> When it's said, <hi>Christ died for our

but they were imputed to him as what
he had for our Salvation engaged to make
Satisfaction for: And he did by his Death
make a real, full and proper Satisfaction to
God's Justice, vindicating the Honour of his
Justice and Government, and of the violated
Law as fully, as if the pardoned Sinner had

Christ our Mediator to express his hatred of
Sin, and deter us from it by his Death as
any instance of Divine Displeasure against
our Offences, and therefore our Sins were not

inflicted were not only fit, but truly design'd

which God thus testified his high Displeasure.</p>

meant, that Christ was substituted to die in
the room of us who were condemned to die,
that God might be pacified, nor that his Death
was instead of our Death, that we for the
Merit of it might be delivered; but the
meaning is, that Christ for our good did by

merciful as well as just (i. e. <hi>Mercy abated

Iustice demanded)</hi> Lib. 3. cap. 2. §. 8, 9.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth.</hi> Tho the great Mercy of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in his being willing to admit, accept
and provide Christ our Mediator to make
Satisfaction for our Sins, yet God our just
Governor would have it that the terms of
Satisfaction proposed to our Mediator should
be such as <hi>strict Iustice</hi> demanded for the
Honour of his violated Law, and securing the
Ends of his Government; which terms were
no lower than that he should suffer what
was <hi>fully</hi> equivalent to the Punishments they
whom he was to redeem deserved to endure.
And as our Lord Jesus did suffer in kind
much of what we deserved to suffer; so he
suffered (considering the Dignity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43119:24"/>
of his Person) what was in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
Value <hi>fully equivalent</hi> to such of our
deserved Punishments, as he was not capable
of suffering in <hi>kind.</hi> Nay the Price of our
Redemption paid by him, was not only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent
to what the Law of Works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us, but it was <hi>supralegal,</hi> that is,
it far exceeded what any Sinners were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
obliged to; nor see we how a full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for all our Sins could be otherwise
made.</p>
                  <p>

§.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth.</hi> Considering that our New-birth
and Faith are the Fruits of the holy Spirit,
whom by Sin we had expelled, his return to
regenerate and make us Believers must be for
the sake and with respect to the Merits of
Christ, as what vindicated the Honour of
God who restored him to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth.</hi> No Penance, Pilgrimage, Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
or good Works of our own, or other
Men, can make proper Satisfaction to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice for the least of our Sins as to any
part of their Fault or Guilt.</p>
                  <p>This last we add in opposition to what

                     <hi>Truth</hi> 1. Tho true Faith be a Gospel Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
yet it is not accepted for sinless
Obedience; nor doth the Gospel entitle us
to Salvation upon our believing, as the Law
did upon a perfect sinless Obedience: for the

Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth.</hi> 2. Tho a dead Faith cannot justify
us, and our believing Consent must be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
if we survive it; yet are we as truly and
firmly justified, and in Christ's Right entitled
to Glory when we first believe, as when those

                  <p>We shall provide against <hi>Limborg</hi>'s and
some other <hi>Arminians Notion</hi> of Justification
<hi>(tho it be none of the five Points which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute</hi>

                     <hi>Error</hi> 3. By Faith being imputed for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
is meant, that God graciously for
Christ's sake will account our Obedience which
we yield him by Faith as if it were perfect,
tho it be imperfect. As if a Creditor having
a Debtor who ows him 1000 <hi>Gilders,</hi> should
upon this Debtor's paying him 100, forgive
him the rest, and graciously impute to him
this <hi>part</hi> of Payment for the Payment of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth.</hi> Tho we are justified by Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
on, and Faith in him be accounted a
Gospel-Righteousness, as it is the performed
Condition upon which we are by the Gospel-Promise
adjudged to have the Righteousness
of Christ imputed to us as our pleadable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
against the Curse of the Law; by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43119:26"/>
which Righteousness of Christ alone our Right
to Pardon and eternal Life (wherein we are
personally invested by the Gospel) is merited
as well as the Blessings themselves. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
our Faith in Christ is no part of the
<hi>Debt</hi> we owed to God by the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
nor is it, or our sincere Obedience
proceeding from it, either in themselves, or
Divine Acceptance, a full Conformity to the
Gospel <hi>Precepts,</hi> much less doth God impute
to us this Faith, or that Obedience for the
payment of the whole Debt owing by the
Law or Gospel, tho he grant us thereupon
that Pardon, Favour and Acceptance Christ
hath procured, so as to deal with us as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Persons; and these he doth not sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
until Faith produceth the said Fruit of
Obedience, but grants them upon our first
true purpose to turn from Sin to God, and
our acceptation of and trust in Christ for
doing this, and for obtaining all Salvation
by him.</p>
                  <p>The common POPISH Notion of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
as stated by <hi>Andradius</hi> in his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
Explication of the Decree of the <hi>6th
Session of the Council of</hi> Trent, whereto <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
and the generality of the Papists
agree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Error</hi> 4. The <hi>first</hi> Justification is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
of an ungodly Man by the infused
habit of Love, the infusion of which is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
by Christ. The <hi>second</hi> Justification is
this habit of Love producing goods Works,
by the Merit whereof we are further justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and <hi>ex condigno</hi> deserve eternal Life;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43119:26"/>
but neither the <hi>first</hi> nor <hi>second</hi> Justification
consists in the <hi>forgiveness of Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note.</hi> By <hi>preparatory</hi> Work, the Council
intend with the School-men, that our Wills
moved by the Spirit do by their natural
Power prepare themselves to obtain the habit
of Grace, and <hi>ex congruo,</hi> merit the Infusion
of it, which Habit is that justifying Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
for the Merit whereof the Sinner is
at first absolved from Guilt, and accepted
to eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> 1. Neither this <hi>first</hi> nor <hi>second</hi> Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is the Justification described usually
in the Gospel, which is not the Conversion
of a Sinner, or the progressive Holiness of a
Convert, but a <hi>forensick</hi> Act, <hi>viz.</hi> God's
judicial absolving us from the Curse due for
Sin, and adjudging us entitled to Glory for
the Merits of Christ, according to the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> 2. It is not true, that preparatory
Works do any way deserve from God the
Habit of Grace at first infused, tho ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
the Divine Spirit doth by Knowledg and
humbling Convictions abate the Obstacles to
Grace in our Hearts, and put us upon seeking
help from Christ; all which are as truly
owing to his more common Operations, as
saving Grace is to his special.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> 3. Neither the first infused Habit of
Grace, nor its Acts, do merit further Grace
or Holiness; nor yet any degree of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
or Acceptance which by Divine Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ensue thereupon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Error.</hi> 5. Christ hath merited that the
Habit of Love should by its virtue extinguish
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43119:27"/>
Sin in us by good Works, and we by these
Works merit Reconciliation with God, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of Sin, and eternal Glory, as what
do appease his Anger, satisfy for our Guilt,
and are part of the Price of eternal Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note.</hi> The Popish Error concerning Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
leads them to this Error about Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
and when Justification is considered
in a <hi>Protestant</hi> sense, <hi>viz.</hi> as a <hi>forensick</hi> Act,
the true Controversy between the Papists and
us is about the Doctrine of the <hi>Merit of
good Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth.</hi> Neither Repentance, Faith, Love,
nor any good Work proceeding therefrom,
do in the least <hi>merit</hi> Reconciliation, Pardon,
or eternal Life; neither did Christ merit that
<hi>we</hi> might merit: But Reconciliation, Pardon,
and eternal Life were merited <hi>only</hi> by Christ's
atoning, satifying, and meriting Sufferings
and Obedience: And therefore the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ is accepted and reputed the
only <hi>meriting</hi> Righteousness in God's justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Act, altho this Act terminates on none
(Adult) besides the penitent Believer, and
on all such by the <hi>Ordination</hi> of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note</hi> 1. It's one thing for <hi>Christ</hi> to merit,
that <hi>we</hi> might by our Works merit Salvation,
it's another thing for Christ to merit that
Salvation <hi>it self,</hi> which he gives and applies
to Men on Gospel-terms; the first is <hi>Popish,</hi>
the last is <hi>Protestant</hi> Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>2. It's one thing what our Judg in his
justifying Act accounts to be the thing which
<hi>appeaseth</hi> his Anger (for Reconciliation)
makes <hi>Compensation</hi> to Justice (for Pardon)
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43119:27"/>
and to be the meriting <hi>Price</hi> (of eternal
Life) to which Reconciliation, Pardon, and
eternal Life he now adjudgeth the penitent
Believer to be entitled. Now the thing which
our Judg accounts to be that which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the Righteousenss of
Christ, and <hi>only</hi> that.</p>
                  <p>It's another matter <hi>whom</hi> our Judg in his
justifying Act accounts and adjudgeth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the <hi>Gospel-Offer,</hi> to be the <hi>Persons</hi>
who he therein promised should be actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
pardoned, and entitled to Glory in
the alone meriting virtue of what appeased his
Anger, made amends for Sin, and was the Price
of Glory. Now <hi>this Person</hi> is the penitent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
and he is accounted to be such from
his having Gospel-Faith in Christ, with true
Repentance, and as such is adjudged to be
under the Favour of the foresaid Gospel <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>
of Reconciliation, Pardon and Glory,
yet procured and merited not by his Faith,
but by Christ's alone Righteousness, as before
accounted for, and obtained in <hi>his</hi> Right, who
as well had these promised to him for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in the Covenant of <hi>Redemption,</hi> as
they are promised by God in Christ in the
Gospel to Believers themselves for a personal
Title to possess them, and to plead the Merits
of Christ for the enjoyment of them.</p>
                  <p>Having testified our <hi>Concord</hi> with our
Brethren, and and added this <hi>further</hi> account
of what we esteem <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> in the
Doctrines of Satisfaction and Justification,
we must express our Thankfulness to God,
that our Brethren in the foresaid <hi>Declaration</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:43119:28"/>
have testified against ignorant and scandalous
Persons intruding themselves into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.
And tho the Vindication of our selves
in this matter be needless, when our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Practice are so well known; and it's
so notorious, that of the great number of
unqualified Men who are of late turned
Preachers, those very few who <hi>broke out of
any of our Congregations</hi> in this City, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
no Approbation or Countenance from
us; and to avoid Restraint and Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they renounced the Name of <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
yea, preach'd against us; yet to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
what we can this present Testimony of
our Congregational Brethren, we'll publish
one of the Articles agreed to by all of us for
strengthening our <hi>Vnion</hi> after our said Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
Recess, which is as follows,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>6. That no Ministers of the Union shall
admit, or consent that any Person shall
preach in their Congregations, unless they
have been solemnly admitted to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry

of the United Brethren, or produce a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
that they have been under proper
and preparatory Studies to qualify them
for that sacred Function.</q>

               <p>3. As they <hi>limit</hi> Christ's Death in this

as you see in the fifth <hi>Chapter.</hi> So I
could easily shew how they dilute their own

Scripture-Expressions to that Insignificancy,
that no Man can hope by their method to
apprehend any kind of words with certainty

               <p>4. They sometimes state the Difference
between themselves and others, and there are
some things they still adhere to and secure,
however they perplex this Controversy with
their seeming Grants and equivocal Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>Socinus</hi> states this Question and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
it: Are our Sins blotted out by any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
or Satisfaction, or else by Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Most think they are blotted out, a
Satisfaction intervening: but we think they
are blotted out by simple Forgiveness, <hi>or a
Pardon absolutely free.</hi> Prael. cap. 15. p. 565.
He also states the Difference with <hi>Covet,</hi>
and puts this for the Position held by his
own Party. I judg and think this to be the
Orthodox Determination, That Jesus Christ
is therefore our Saviour, because he hath made
known to us the way of eternal Life; and
in his own Person, both by the Example of
his Life, and rising from the dead, hath given
assurance of it, and made it evident, as also
that he will give eternal Life to us who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him. But I affirm, that he neither sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
Divine Justice, by which we Sinners
did deserve to be damned; nor was there
any need that he should satisfy it. <hi>Socin.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43119:31"/>
Tom. 2. de Servat. cap. 1. 121. Crellius</hi> states
this Question; Did the Redemption wrought
by Christ include his Payment of a <hi>true
Price</hi> to God for our Sins, which he calls
Satisfaction? <hi>Resp. ad Grot. cap.</hi> 8. This he
denies; and he and others of them take great
advantage of <hi>Covet</hi>'s making use of <hi>Creditor,
Debtor, and Debt,</hi> to express their Judgment
in this Controversy. Other Instances might
be given.</p>
               <p>(2) The principal things they adhere to
are, 1. That Christ did not appease God's
Anger towards Sinners. 2. That what Christ
did and suffered had no meriting Virtue; and
so did not merit from God our Pardon, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
and eternal Life, or properly move
God to give or promise them. These are the
Heart of <hi>Socinianism</hi> as to the Satisfaction of
Christ; and they do exclude what Christ
performs <hi>in Heaven,</hi> as well as his Death on
Earth, from any proper influence Godward
as to these things, tho to effect what they
call Expiation, they ascribe more to Christ's
abiding on God's Right-hand taking care of
the Church, than to his Resurrection, and
more to his Resurrection than to his Death;
these two last being but the decreed interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
way of coming to the other, which they
call the Expiation it self. Hence they always
deny any proper redeeming Price, and say
God quitted his right to punish us without
any respect to Christ; and distinguish of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
on God's part (which they call his own
Act;) and on our part, which is, say they,
Christ's giving us eternal Life; wherein as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43119:31"/>
contain'd a full deliverance from the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sin. As to Expiation on <hi>God's part,</hi>
that's in no wise by Christ's inclining God
to forgive our Sins by his Sacrifice; yea <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi>
tells us God alone expiates Sin. And
when <hi>CRELLIVS</hi> blames <hi>Grotius</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Socinus</hi> to confine the Efficacy of Christ's
Sacrifice to Sins future for Prevention or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and excluding the Forgiveness of Sins
past, otherwise than as it begets Faith, and
so turns us from Sin. What greater expiating
Virtue doth he ascribe to it under the Notion
of an expiating Sacrifice? it's this, it takes
away the Guilt and Punishments of all Sins
tho past before Conversion, and however
great: But how and wherein? He answers,
it's partly by declaring and granting us a
right to that thing, and partly by actually
taking away Divine Punishments. <hi>But is
that Right or Pardon at all properly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by this Sacrifice?</hi> No, by no means;
that he had denied, and abides by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
here, and in the following Sections. The
sum is; a crucified Saviour his being exalted,
and in Heaven taking care of our Salvation,
assures us, that we shall be partakers of the
Pardon appointed and promised before by
the meer Mercy of God without respect to
Christ; and Christ as the authorized Sponsor
on God's part conveys it, and assisted with
the Divine Power fully removes the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or rather God himself doth it: Nay,
by their Scheme you cannot well see them
allow less expiating Virtue to <hi>Mens Prayers</hi>
than the legal Sacrifices, yea the yearly: for,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43119:32"/>
fay they, we expiate our own Sins by those
Prayers; and scarce more to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
than the Legal, except as to more sorts
of Sin, and its greater aptness to disswade us
from Sin by the Love of God, and strong
grounds of hopes of higher Rewards, being
more evidenced and assured by this Sacrifice
of Christ, than by those of the Law: For this
Sacrifice of Christ is no other than an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
Means, which being performed, that
Discharge follows by the Divine Decree,
which the self-inclined God, unmoved by
any thing Christ was to do or suffer, resolved
freely to bestow of his meer Mercy.</p>
               <p>To add no more, they carefully distinguish
between the Impetration of Pardon; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
with respect to the Divine Will, and the
means of the application of that Pardon to
the Sinner. From the former they exclude
Christ's Satisfaction and Merits, and confine
their Virtue truly altogether to the latter.
The thing it self is unprocured as from God,
the Sinner's obtaining it is subserved by
Christ by what he perfoms to make us meet
for it, and possessing us in the Effects of it
according to the way decreed, and that only
because <hi>decreed. Socin. Tom. 1. Praelect. cap.

Crell. Resp. ad Grot. cap.</hi> 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>5. It's very obvious that the Socinian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
lies not in those things wherein some
are induced to place them, because of certain
Phrases sometimes occurring in Debates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Doctrine of Christ's Satisfaction.
To Instance a few.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:43119:32"/>
(1.) It's not whether the Sufferings of a
<hi>Sponsor</hi> in the stead of the Sinner be in <hi>so
strict a sense</hi> a proper Punishment, as the
Sufferings of the <hi>Delinquem</hi> himself would
be? this is nothing with them; for their
Question is, Were Christ's Sufferings such an
Instance of God's rectoral <hi>Hatred</hi> against our
Sins, and <hi>Anger</hi> against Sinners, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Honour of his Justice and injured Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Law was provided for, and
vindicated, and Sinners to be deterred from
Sin by God's insisting upon such a penal
<hi>Compensation</hi> before he would be <hi>reconciled</hi> to
us. Punishment under this Notion they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
dispute against.</p>
               <p>(2.) Nor is it about the Phrase <hi>Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Persons</hi> between Christ and Sinners,
they grant it; admit a <hi>Surrogation</hi> of the
typical Sacrifice instead of the Sinner, and a
<hi>Substitution</hi> of Christ in our place. Their
Point depends not on any such mere words.
But was Christ appointed, and did he consent
to endure what the Sinner was to suffer, that
in <hi>virtue</hi> thereof the offended God might be
<hi>appeased,</hi> and the Sinner <hi>delivered?</hi> This is
the thing they oppose. <hi>Crell. Resp. ad Grot.
cap. 9. par.</hi> 14. explaining this very Phrase.</p>
               <p>(3.) Nor is with them the Question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christ's Sufferings were in part the <hi>Idem,</hi>
and in other respects a full <hi>Equivalent</hi> to the
Punishments the Sinner deserved: No, their
Arguments run against the <hi>Equivalency,</hi> and
on that account deny that his Sufferings
could be a <hi>full Price</hi> of Redemption, or a
<hi>Satisfaction;</hi> and well they may, when they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43119:33"/>
call him a <hi>mere</hi> Creature. <hi>Crell. Resp. ad Grot.
c. 4. par. 2. &amp;c. 6. par.</hi> 18. It's the <hi>Proportion</hi> in
the Value they most directly militate against.</p>
               <p>(4.) Nor, whether Christ was a <hi>Sinner</hi> in
judicial Esteem, or was he reputed the <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
Mediator making <hi>amends to Iustice</hi> for
our Sins, that we the Offendors might be
redeemed by his <hi>merits,</hi> who, to make Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
submitted to be dealt with as if he
had been a <hi>Sinner.</hi> The last is enough for
their Abhorrence; and tho <hi>Socinus</hi> took all
Advantages to expose the Orthodox, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
their Opinion as to the Imputation
of Sin to Christ, yet grants they hold that
Christ was truly innocent, and reputed so
by God even when he was punished as if an
Offender. <hi>De Servat. cap.</hi> 6. It's true, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they would force some such Consequence
on the words of the Orthodox, as if Christ
must be legally reputed a Sinner, but that is
to furnish themselves with an Argument to <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule</hi>
the true Doctrine of Satisfaction. And
note, they deny that 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. Christ was
made Sin,</hi> to be Christ was made a Sacrifice
for Sin; yea some render it, he was made a
Sinner, as <hi>Slicht.</hi> &amp;c. God dealt with him as
a Sinner. <hi>Socin in loc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(5.) It's far enough from the <hi>Socinian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy,
whether Christ was <hi>immediately</hi>
obliged by the Law of Works to die, <hi>i. e.</hi>
Did God thus sentence him, Thou Christ
hast sinned, and therefore thou shalt die?
Or, was he immediately obliged to die by
the Govenant of Redemption, and <hi>mediately</hi>
by the Law of Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Sentence is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43119:33"/>
to be thus apprehended? Whereas thou my
Son the Mediator, hast with my Consent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
thy willingness to expiate Sin, and
ransom Sinners, justly condemned by the
Curse of my Law to die: And whereas my
<hi>Vindictive Iustice,</hi> the Honour of my Law
and Government, required that I the <hi>Rector</hi>
should exact Satisfaction and Reparation for
the Crimes of these Sinners by <hi>thy</hi> Death, if
I agreed to <hi>thy</hi> redeeming and saving them,
and thou hast <hi>obliged</hi> thy self to die in their
stead to redeem them, <hi>therefore</hi> thou shalt
die this accursed, shameful Death.</p>
               <p>This, I say, is no part of the Dispute with
the <hi>Socinians,</hi> for the last account doth as
directly oppose their Notions as the former,
nay much more; for it asserts the Compact
before his Incarnation, and consequently the
<hi>Divinity,</hi> at least <hi>Preexistence</hi> of Christ.</p>
               <p>(6.) Nor yet is it of any moment with
them, whether Men say Sin would be in a
more proper sense the <hi>immediate</hi> meritorious
Cause of the <hi>Sinner's</hi> dying who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Sin, than of Christ's dying who
did not commit the Sin, tho he obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to make <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for it in the Sinner's
<hi>stead,</hi> that the provoked God might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to him. The Point with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, Did our Sins, notwithstanding God's
<hi>merciful</hi> Disposition, retain that <hi>Demerit</hi> in
his account, as rendered Satisfaction for it
by Death <hi>necessary</hi> to reconcile him to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and consequently did Christ suffer
Death to make that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> which was
become thus necessary by Sin, and yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43119:34"/>
for the Sinner to make.</p>
               <p>(7.) It's true, the <hi>Socinians</hi> usually say
our Sins were the <hi>occasion</hi> of Christ's Death
(yet oft they call them the antecedent Cause)
but occasion being more common and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> I wish others had
waved that word to prevent Abuse. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
the mere using of that word is far
from arguing any Man to <hi>Socinianize,</hi> so that
he apply it to a sense opposite to what <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
do. This will appear, if we consider
in what sense the <hi>Socinians</hi> use it; they say
our Sin was an occasion of Christ's Death, as
Sin was that which we were to be reclaimed
from, and our hope supported against. And
the Death of Christ was that way in which
God, who was not unreconciled before, did
appoint Christ to reclaim us from our Sins;
as his Death assureth us of the Truth of his
Doctrine and Promises, manifesteth God's
prior Reconciliation, and so his Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
an Argument to encline us to believe
and repent, and also a <hi>causa sine qua non;</hi>
both of a strong Motive to Holiness, <hi>viz.</hi> the
endless Glory designed in Heaven for us
(which was before shut up) and of that
Power, Authority and Care of Christ at
God's Right-hand to bring us into the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it.</p>
               <p>But when others shall call our Sins an <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi>
of Christ's Death, and explain it thus;
That it was an occasion of Christ's Death as
a <hi>penal</hi> Satisfaction to the <hi>Iustice</hi> of God,
and that he endured it to <hi>pacify</hi> God to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
that God's <hi>hatred</hi> of Sin, and his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43119:34"/>
Justice (yea <hi>punitive</hi> Justice) might be no
less demonstrated in Christ's Satisfaction,
than if the Sinners had been <hi>damned.</hi> And
his Obedience, and his Punishments wherein
<hi>Vindictive Iustice</hi> was thus glorified, did <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
the Pardon of our Sins, and eternal Life,
such an <hi>Explication</hi> doth as much oppose <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism,</hi>
as if they had used the word <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Cause</hi> instead of <hi>occasion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That no Person may pretend the Reverend
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Authority in favour of <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi>
because he sometimes calls our Sins an
<hi>occasion of Christ's Death,</hi> I do assure the
Reader that he explains the word <hi>occasion</hi> in
the last sense, and in the most direct opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Socinianism:</hi> nor can any pretend
but the reason he useth this word, as also <hi>pro
causa meritoria,</hi> or instead of a meritorious
Cause, is only to distinguish Christ the <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>
making Satisfaction to Justice for our Sins,
from the <hi>Sinner</hi> himself when suffering for
his <hi>own</hi> Sins. To evidence which, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
his own Assertions under this seventh
Head, and could easily cite his own words,
which agree exactly to what's <hi>Antisocinian</hi>
in the six foregoing Heads. See <hi>Method.

               <p>Need I add that he says, <q>God declared

It were endless to produce the Instances de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating
the Orthodoxness of this great
Man as to the Satisfaction of Christ against
<hi>Socinianism.</hi> And by the way, such as say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Christ's penal Satisfaction was <hi>not</hi> necessary
to the forgiveness of our Sins, do a thousand
times more favour Socinianism than Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Notions or Words can be wrested to.</p>
               <p>Perhaps others who follow <hi>Episcopius</hi> and
some other <hi>Arminians</hi> (when all must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
him of <hi>Socinianism)</hi> may surmise he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
their Notion of Christ's Death, as if
it were a Satisfaction only to the <hi>Will of God,</hi>
and not a full Satisfaction to the <hi>Iustice of
God.</hi> To this I answer, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Satisfaction into that which is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the <hi>Will</hi> of a Person, and that which is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43119:35"/>
the Payment of what was owing by an <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi>
otherwise not due. And he affirms,
that Christ's Satisfaction was not a mere ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
the <hi>Will</hi> of God (tho it supposeth his
Consent;) but it was a <hi>full</hi> Equivalent to what
Punishments we deserved, in that it better
answered the Ends of Divine Government,
than the Sinner's Punishment would have
done; it more fully demonstrated the <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive</hi>
Justice <hi>of God,</hi> than if the Sinner had
been damned, and it was a <hi>full Satisfaction</hi>
to governing Justice, and the End of the

               <p>I thought this account necessary not only
for the forementioned End, but also that our
Agreement in opposition to <hi>Socinianism</hi> might
not exclude Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and such as approve of
his Scheme, which would add strength to that
Heresy, and be injurious to many worthy
Persons; nor ought a few words so fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
be pressed to brand them with that
<hi>odious</hi> Title, who could more plausibly fix
the same Character on Persons from <hi>things</hi>
plainly asserted in the Socinian <hi>sense,</hi> and
<hi>subserving</hi> their <hi>Hypothesis:</hi> As Christ's Death
was not <hi>necessary</hi> to the remission of Sin,
the <hi>Promise</hi> of Forgiveness is no <hi>Effect</hi> of
Christ's Death. Repentance <hi>under</hi> the Gospel
is an <hi>Effect</hi> of justifying Faith in Christ. The
preaching of Reconciliation to Sinners, is only
to publish to them that God is <hi>already</hi> recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to them, and to call them to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<hi>to God.</hi> Many others might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced;
but I think it were unjust, even upon
such grounds, to call any of these <hi>Socinians.</hi>

<hi>dangerous</hi> Errors concerning the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Christ, and Justification of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
nor can I doubt but the impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

which either Side have more especially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

               <p>1. In both these Doctrines the visible

different Notion of Christ's <hi>Suretiship.</hi> For
by this the word <hi>Imputation,</hi> as used in both

and Instrument wherein he voluntarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
himself, as also the respect he had to
us therein.</p>
               <p>1. In the Covenant of <hi>Redemption</hi> they
consider Christ agreeing with his Father the
Terms of Satisfaction to Justice, and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of Life for Sinners, and obliging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to assume our Nature, and therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to obey the Law, die an accursed
Death, with whatever was <hi>equivalent</hi> to
what by the Covenant of Works <hi>our Sins</hi>
deserved. Here they think Christ did not
covenant <hi>strictly</hi> in our stead, or as our <hi>Proxy,</hi>
tho he covenanted <hi>to die</hi> in our stead, even
<hi>strictly so:</hi> He <hi>transacted</hi> as a free Interposer
tho for our Salvation; we were no federating
<hi>Party,</hi> tho we were the Persons <hi>whose Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was his promised Reward: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have more reason, since we are become
his Members, to say we intercede in Christ
<hi>now,</hi> than to say that we covenanted in Christ
<hi>then.</hi> Finally, they account his <hi>Act</hi> of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
so peculiar to himself, that his non-performance
of what he engaged (which was
impossible) had not made us <hi>more guilty,</hi>
tho it would have left us miserable for <hi>our</hi>
own Sins, there being no other way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
us.</p>
               <p>2. They find Christ called a <hi>Surety</hi> in the
<hi>Gospel-Covenant</hi> made with fallen Man, <hi>Heb. 7.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43119:37"/>
22.</hi> and no where else. This Covenant sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the former, yea supposeth Christ's
having <hi>executed</hi> his Engagements by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Redemption to make Satisfaction
to Justice <hi>(i. e.</hi> it was at first accepted as if
executed) for this Covenant with Man doth
not adjust the <hi>terms of Redemption,</hi> but the
<hi>way</hi> of conveying the <hi>Effects</hi> of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and is called the <hi>Testament</hi> of our
Lord Jesus, whereby he bequeaths the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
he acquired by his atoning Death. In
this Covenant Christ is such a <hi>Surety,</hi> as not
only assures us all will be performed which is
promised to us on God's part, but that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to bring in the Elect, and for the Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Believers unto eternal Life, by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting
that Power and Authority he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
But here also they apprehend Christ
a <hi>distinct</hi> federating Party: A Mediator treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and obliging himself to make the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
stand sure, and effect the Ends it was
designed for: but he binds not himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
repent, or persevere <hi>for us;</hi> but that
<hi>we</hi> shall repent, believe and persevere; nor
doth <hi>his</hi> Engagement that we should do so,
prevent <hi>our</hi> personal Engagement by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to do it our selves, tho in <hi>his Strength.</hi>
Now <hi>our Act</hi> of engaging is not <hi>his</hi> engaging
Act, but an Effect of it; nor is our repenting
his repenting Act, but the Effect of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<hi>Assistance;</hi> nor is that Assistance of his
<hi>reckoned</hi> to be legally our assisting our selves;
nor can we say that we covenanted <hi>in Christ</hi>
to bring in the Elect, or that Believers shall
persevere: By which, with other Reasons, we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43119:37"/>
are induced to think, that in covenanting he
transacts still as Mediator; but he <hi>obliging</hi>
himself to these great Performances, in order
to our doing what we are personally obliged
to do, and our receiving what we are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
to receive, if ever we be saved even in
a Gospel-way (tho it supposeth him already
crucified) he is properly called a <hi>Surety of the
New Covenant,</hi> yet still connoting him a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not suggest, that if in this new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
Christ's Suretyship will not infer our
being <hi>one</hi> foederating Party with Christ, and
hence that we covenanted <hi>in</hi> him; it will far
less follow we did so in the Covenant of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi>
which treated of things so improper
to be once <hi>propos'd</hi> to us as undertaking Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
much less as <hi>Principals,</hi> which to strictly
legal Sureties always are supposed. But of
this I have treated in <hi>Man made righteous,</hi> and
<hi>in Answer to the Report,</hi> and <hi>P. S. to Gospel-Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE OTHER SIDE think Christ,
with the Father's consent, came into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Works</hi> considered as a <hi>Bond,</hi> (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violated
say <hi>some,</hi> as violated say <hi>others)</hi> and
therein became <hi>one</hi> foederating Party with us,
(as <hi>Elect</hi> some say, as <hi>Believers</hi> say others)
even <hi>such</hi> a Surety as made the Covenant of
Works run thus: If thou Christ my Son, <hi>or</hi>
you the Elect (or Believers) do obey all the
Law, you shall live: But if they sin, thou <hi>or</hi>
they shall die, or they having sinned, thou
shalt die. And they conceiving Christ to be
as a strict pecuniary Surety in this one Bond
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43119:38"/>
with us, they esteem him one legal Person and
Representative in such a sense as that we did
covenant in him, and are legally esteemed to
do and suffer what he did, and not only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
of Salvation in his right, and for his
sake.</p>
               <p>This may be accounted by some a <hi>dangerous</hi>
Difference, and so it were <hi>on our part,</hi> if we
did not own that Christ's fulfilling of the Law
was an <hi>Article</hi> in the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that we are as fully <hi>assured</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if we accept of Christ, as if we had
covenanted in him; and that he hath engaged
the Elect should <hi>accept</hi> of him, tho they did
not covenant in him: and that Believers have
as <hi>inviolable</hi> an Interest in the Benefits of
Christ's Death, both in his right and by the
Gospel-promise, as if they were legally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
to suffer what he did suffer. But all
this we acknowledg. It would be as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
on our <hi>Brethrens</hi> part to say we cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
in Christ, and obeyed in him, if they
did not renounce all proud assuming Boasts,
as if they were <hi>as</hi> righteous as Christ, or
stood on terms with God needing <hi>no more
Acts of Mercy</hi> than that one of <hi>appointing</hi>
Christ to be Mediator; but after that they
are on terms of strict Justice, and above For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The like Danger would ensue
their Position, if they did not acknowledg
the <hi>necessity</hi> of Faith to Justification, and
this Faith to be always accompanied with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and persevering Holiness. But our
<hi>Brethren</hi> renounce the former, and own the
latter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:43119:38"/>
Matters standing thus, will afford no ground
to hereticate each other: We think a mediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Surety obliged in a <hi>distinct</hi> Bond to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the utmost which our Brethren affirm
Christ to have done, doth <hi>as well</hi> secure our
State, and support our Faith as if in the same
Bond, and better account for the sapiential
Methods of Divine Government towards Man
<hi>since</hi> the Fall, with God's judicial Procedures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Man as under <hi>Gospel-offers,</hi> and his <hi>sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending</hi>
Christ's merited Benefits till Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
as also his recorded Pleadings with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
The Brethren think not that Christ did
more for our Salvation than we allow, but that
we did more in Christ; and thence judge our
Faith more supported, and the Law of Works
more honoured in their way. But did each side
perceive all the aforesaid respective Ends alike
provided for, and evil Consequences equally
avoided, the Notion in debate could for its
own sake admit no Dispute on either side.
And is it not pity to hate each other for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the best Scheme, to avoid the same <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi>
which both would prevent, and secure
that same <hi>Good</hi> which both honestly aim at by
their respective <hi>Hypotheses?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Forbearance is the juster in this point,
because it turns upon a Solution of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
When <hi>Adam</hi> is called <hi>a Figure of Christ,
Rom.</hi> 5. 18. is there not some <hi>disparity</hi> in their
Representation of Men, as well as in those other
things there instanced? Our <hi>Brethren</hi> think
Christ so fully prefigured by <hi>Adam</hi> as a <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,</hi>
that we as truly obeyed and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Christ, <hi>as we sinned in</hi> Adam. We
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43119:39"/>
think the <hi>Figure,</hi> as to Representation, is to
be explained thus: <hi>As</hi> no man becomes a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or dieth, whose Depravedness and Death
were not procured and merited by <hi>Adam</hi>'s
first Sin; and tho the Pagan Sinners who died,
did not actually sin against a revealed positive
Law, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, yet he was the <hi>Root</hi> of
Death to them as well as to the Jews under
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Law: <hi>So no men</hi> are quickned, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
sanctified, or saved, but <hi>Christ is a Root</hi>
of Life, Grace, Justification, Holiness, and
Glory to them (in all these by his <hi>Merits,</hi> in
some also by his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet we conceive Christ may as well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Figure</hi> here intended, by our
being quickned, justified, and saved by
Christ's <hi>Obedience imputed</hi> to us, without our
being <hi>esteemed</hi> to have obeyed and suffered
<hi>in him,</hi> as Christ was condemned and died
for <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Sins imputed</hi> to him, tho he was
not <hi>esteemed</hi> to have sinned <hi>in Adam.</hi> As he
was condemned <hi>by our</hi> Disobedience, so we
are justified <hi>by his</hi> Obedience, <hi>viz.</hi> the first
by his own Compact with the Father, the last
by that and the Gospel too: He was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by any imputation that made him by
the Law a Sinner, unless he sinned in <hi>Adam;</hi>
neither are we justified by being legally judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Sufferers</hi> or <hi>Obeyers</hi> in him. It avails
not to say Christ was legally a Sinner, and
yet not reputed to <hi>sin in Adam,</hi> because Christ
was our <hi>Root;</hi> for tho he was our Root as to
Grace, Acceptance, Pardon and Glory, and
whatever else did <hi>proceed from him to us,</hi> as our
<hi>Saviour;</hi> nevertheless, if he was a <hi>Sinner,</hi> he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43119:39"/>
could not as to this be our Root, unless we
<hi>derive</hi> Sin from him; but surely that <hi>Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
must have its Root, not in him, but
in those that were Sinners before him, and
whose Sins were imputed to him: they must
denominate that one legal Person <hi>into</hi> which he
came, a <hi>sinful guilty Person;</hi> as he doth that
one <hi>obeying, satisfying Person,</hi> into which we
are admitted: (which Terms our Brethren
espousing, I argue from.)</p>
               <p>Finally, we are enclined to set the foresaid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Christ's Representation by this among
many other Reasons: for in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18.
where <hi>Adam</hi> is called a <hi>Figure,</hi> the Death of
those Heathens was <hi>merited</hi> by their <hi>own</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Transgressions as well as by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.
But the Elect, even when <hi>Believers</hi>
do not, <hi>merit</hi> Life by their own personal O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
and therefore we are not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
altogether in the same manner in
Christ as in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. From the former another point ariseth
referring expresly to the <hi>Satisfaction, viz.</hi> in
what sense our Sins were imputed to Christ.</p>
               <p>One saith our Sins were imputed to Christ
only as to Guilt or Obligation, to bear the
Punishment which we deserved for them;
which Punishments tho he obliged himself to
endure in our stead to reconcile God to us,
yet that did not render him a Sinner in God's
account, because that Title results from the
violation of the Precept abstractedly from a
respect to the threatning; and conceiving he
was not a Sinner in our stead, tho he suffer'd
in our stead the punishments due to our sins,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43119:40"/>
they think he was esteemed by God what in
truth he was, <hi>viz.</hi> the holy, innocent Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
punishable by his own consent for the
Sins he came to expiate, and were not expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
without his dying in our stead.</p>
               <p>But our Brethren think our Sins were so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to Christ, as to give him the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and judicial acceptation of a Sinner in
the esteem of God and the Law.</p>
               <p>Yet lest the difference should appear great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than it is, it's fit I inform you that our
Brethren deny that Christ had any Sin or
Defilement in him, or had any Sin of his own:
they were our Sins, only <hi>imputed</hi> to him, and
he was a legal Sinner by being one <hi>political
Person</hi> with those Sinners whom the Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
real Sinners, and condemned as
such.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, we own that (supposing
the Covenant of Redemption) he was as truly
<hi>obliged,</hi> and God the just <hi>Rector</hi> at as full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to punish him for our Sins, as if he had
been reputed a <hi>Sinner:</hi> Nay Divine Justice
<hi>required</hi> the inflicting those Punishments on
him, if the Sinner was to be redeemed from
them for his sake.</p>
               <p>Now, Reader, can this difference justify
mutual Censures or Alienation? What, is a
Sinner without Filth, yea or any Fault of
his own, above a Sponsor obliged to bear
the Punishments of other mens Sins in the
stead of the Offenders? And they who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
him to be this, what less say they
of him than the others mean, tho scrupulous of
that harsher Denomination? At least it would
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43119:40"/>
appear strange to revile each other for a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
explication of that Text, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21.
he was made Sin for us.</hi> One thinks he was
made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for Sin after the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Custom: for we find very oft the words
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to signify a <hi>Sin-Offering</hi>
as well as Sin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 1, 2. and <hi>cap.</hi> 4. 28,
29, 33. And this very Apostle follows the
same Usage, calling an Offering or <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
for Sin <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Rom. 8. Heb.</hi> 10. 5. The
other side will have it meant that Christ was
made a Sinner, but a Sinner that's holy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled,
and never offended: which Notion of
being made Sin is too diminutive to admit
harsh thoughts of such as entertain it.</p>
               <p>An unconcerned Observer will be apt to
say, These who call Christ a Sinner are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to <hi>renounce</hi> Socinianism; and they who
call him a Sacrifice for Sin, are as sollicitous
to <hi>confute</hi> Socinianism and <hi>Antinomianism</hi>
too, by withholding an advantage which both
these Errors receive by the use of that Word.
But where's the Christian Charity or Prudence
of the <hi>condemning Side,</hi> when both contend
for what seems the best Defence of the Doctrine
of Satisfaction? The other Phrases accounted
for in the <hi>6th</hi> Chapter, admit the same Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
as this, and upon the same Grounds.</p>
               <p>3. The third point wherein there appears
some difference, refers to the Doctrine of
<hi>Iustification.</hi> But before I insist on this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to offer a few hints.</p>
               <p>1. Any Difference in this matter seems to
proceed from want of an equal Consideration
of the Covenant of <hi>Redemption,</hi> which fixed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43119:41"/>
the terms of Satisfaction, and Impetration of
saving Benefits, which Christ <hi>alone</hi> was
thereby obliged to perform; and the <hi>Gospel-Covenant,</hi>
wherein the Method of giving us
a personal Interest in the Blessings impetrated
by Christ is ordained. By the former, all
that belongs to Satisfaction and Merit are
confined to Christ, and Pardon, Adoption,
and eternal Life put in the hand of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
as his Reward. By the latter, a way
becoming our fallen State and rational Nature,
is appointed to apply to us a Right to the
purchased Blessings; nor can the Scripture-Account
of God's Calls, Pleadings and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Proceedings be explained without it. I
think the not distinguishing these two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
or fixing the Mind upon either of them,
with too little regard to the other, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
much to our Debates.</p>
               <p>2. With Humility I propose to Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether such can <hi>dangerously err</hi> as to the
way of Salvation, and particularly in the
Doctrine of Justification, who do honestly
adhere to our foregoing account of Christ's
<hi>Satisfaction;</hi> and in subordination thereto,
assert a <hi>Gospel-Law</hi> or Covenant, wherein is
enacted a Rule by which the saving Effects of
that Satisfaction are given forth: it seems to me
highly improbable. For in the account given
of Satisfaction, we ascribe the whole Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of Pardon, Acceptance, and all saving
Benefits only to the Atonement and Merits of
Christ, expresly excluding all our own Graces
and good Works from the least place therein:
And by our Judgment of the Gospel-Law, we
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43119:41"/>
secure the Method and Rule of the personal
Application of these merited Benefits, and that
conformably to the scope of the Bible in its
most explained Parts, as well as in full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
with an apt Ministry, and a judicial
Sentence against impenitent Infidels, to whom
those Benefits are not applied, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Gospel-Offers.</p>
               <p>Whereas if we conceived never so fitly
and with greatest Soundness concerning the
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ, and denied a Gospel-Law
(or what's <hi>equivalent to it)</hi> we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
no small Danger inevitably to ensue;
and that in no less a matter than Mens Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
for if this Gospel prove a <hi>Rule of
Iudgment,</hi> and that Christ gives forth Pardon
and such merited Benefits thereby, will not our
<hi>Ministry</hi> be useless and ensnaring to Souls,
which doth not explain and press the Gospel-<hi>Conditions</hi>
in order to an Interest in those
Benefits? And must not those secure Sinners
be destroyed who submit not to those Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
however confident they be upon Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Apprehensions of what Christ hath
done to satisfy Justice, and merit eternal Life?
The <hi>Boundaries</hi> therefore I would propose to
my self are, that Christ be not <hi>rivalled</hi> in his
atoning or meriting Performances on the one
hand, nor <hi>rejected</hi> in his enacted Rules of
dispensing his purchased and offered Benefits
on the other: for he is truly dishonoured,
and Souls undone by both. But I would not
be mistaken, as if this were suggested to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on the Brethren who are seriously intent
upon the first; for it already appears, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43119:42"/>
will be more evident that they neglect not the
last, but affirm what to this purpose is <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi>
to a Gospel-Law.</p>
               <p>3. It is very evident that when <hi>Protestants</hi>
express great Zeal for Christ's <hi>alone Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
imputed to us in Justification, against the
<hi>Popish Doctrine,</hi> the generality of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among them do only exclude every thing
besides that Righteousness of Christ, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>meritorious</hi> of Acceptance, Pardon, Life,
and any other Blessing; and from being any
Satisfaction or <hi>Compensation</hi> for any Sin; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that this alone can atone the <hi>Anger</hi> of
God, <hi>for the sake</hi> of this alone will he absolve
us, and nothing below this is perfect enough
for us to stand in before the Bar of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
And therefore the <hi>Work</hi> of Faith it
self can be no justifying Righteousness in
that sense they took justifying Righteousness
(all which we heartily own;) and hence
they oft appropriate the justifying Aptitude
and Office of Faith mostly to a <hi>Reliance</hi> on
that sole meriting Righteousness of Christ,
and its <hi>receiving</hi> Forgiveness, Acceptance,
and a Right to Life, of meer Mercy, for the
sake of Christ's alone Merits: All which is
justly and truly spoken, as they accommodate
it to the defence of Christ's Righteousness,
as the only thing appointed or fit for the fore-described
Purposes, and in opposition to the
<hi>Popish</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dispute they had with the <hi>Popish Church</hi>
was about this meriting, atoning, satisfying
Righteousness; and you I find them often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that if the Papists would grant that this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43119:42"/>
Righteousness was that of <hi>Christ alone,</hi> the
great Controversy about Justification was at
an end: But at the same time most Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
and our <hi>Homilies</hi> do fully grant, that
Repentance was necessary, and required to
Forgiveness, and Faith to Justification, and
these Blessings promised to those Graces, tho
they were not led to dispute whether these
were to be called a Righteousness as qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Subject on whom</hi> God's justifying Act
terminated: But whether in that Act God
regarded any thing as a meriting, absolving,
satisfying Righteousness, any thing as a <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
to Justice, any thing as an <hi>impelling</hi>
Motive, or valuable Consideration, <hi>besides
the Righteousness of Christ.</hi> To this their
Debates were confined in their day, and this
they were intent to maintain, as all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ought to be: Whereas the reason of
debating the <hi>Name</hi> of that by which the
Subject of Justification was determined in
opposition to such whom God did not justify,
was not so much before them as before others,
of later years assaulted by such as went into
another <hi>Extreme</hi> from the Doctrine of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Merit.</p>
               <p>Nor was this matter otherwise stated by
our able Divines who contend against such
<hi>Arminians,</hi> as affirmed the <hi>Tò credere,</hi> to be
our justifying Righteousness; for by Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
such <hi>Arminians</hi> mean the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which is <hi>part of Payment,</hi> and stands in
the place of, and answers the <hi>same</hi> Ends in
our Justification, as perfect Obedience served
for to sinless Man; which we have before
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43119:43"/>
stated and renounced. Were there need, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
Testimonies offer by which this Head
is easily proved, tho I grant some Men
may be found to vent some <hi>Inconsistent</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.
Having premised these things, I
reassume the Difference about Justification
that seems to continue, which lies,</p>
               <p>1. In <hi>the manner</hi> of the Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness. Both agree it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
but <hi>how,</hi> is not so universally assented
to: <hi>One side</hi> thinks the sense of imputing
Christ's Righteousness to be, that God rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
us to have legally done and suffered
what Christ did, and this to the full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Justice and the Law of Works,
and therefore are reputed to have perfectly
obeyed the Precepts of this Law, and fully
endured its Curse; and for our <hi>legally</hi> doing
so, God judgeth and pronounceth us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in full Conformity to the Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
entituled to Pardon, Adoption, and
eternal Life. If you ask, Is this justifying
Sentence the Sentence of the <hi>Law of Works,
viz.</hi> its premiant Sanction applied to us by
God as the righteous Judg judging us by the
Law of Works? They answer, It is the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> but it is of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Grace
that God allowed Christ to be
<hi>one Person</hi> with us in the Covenant of Works,
whereby we are thus accounted to obey and
suffer in him. But others think that the
Righteousness of Christ is imputed in the
following manner, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. They consider that
the Father promised to Christ in Reward of
his Obedience and Suffering, that they who
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43119:43"/>
believed on him should be pardoned, adopted,
dealt with as righteous Persons who had not
sinned, and be eternally sav'd: Hence the
<hi>Lord Iesus</hi> has a right to Believers obtaining
these things. And as Faith <hi>describes</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in this Covenant who shall obtain them, so
when we become Believers, we are accounted
and adjudged to be such Believers, and such as
are to obtain those Blessings in Christ's Right.</p>
               <p>2. They consider God in Christ for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piential
Ends, making in the Gospel an <hi>Offer</hi>
of Pardon, Adoption, and eternal Life to
poor Sinners if they believe, and promising
these Blessings <hi>when</hi> they believe, and still as
Blessings <hi>bought</hi> by Christ's Obedience and
Sufferings, and <hi>promised</hi> to him for Believers;
tho withal used in his Gospel as <hi>Motives</hi> to
inforce his Command of Faith and Calls to
it. These things thus considered, we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that when God in Christ justifieth us,
he doth not only give us Pardon, Adoption,
and Life; but he <hi>adjudgeth</hi> and sentenceth us
to be the Persons that by the Covenant of
Redemption were to be pardoned, adopted
and saved in the <hi>right of Christ;</hi> and <hi>to whom</hi>
the Gospel by its Promise gives a <hi>personal</hi>
Right to that Pardon, Adoption and Life as
purchased by Christ: And he esteems and
adjudgeth that the Obedience and Sufferings
of Christ in their full virtue, is our <hi>pleadable
Security</hi> for the enjoyment of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we have a right to <hi>plead</hi> his Death and
Merits with God as what procured these for
us, as well as God's <hi>Fidelity,</hi> who promised
them to us in his Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:43119:44"/>
You see by this account that we rise not
so high as to say, we are accounted to do and
suffer what Christ did, and to be absolved
<hi>immediately</hi> by the Sentence of the Law of
Works; nor fall we so low as a mere Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of the <hi>Effects</hi> of Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but assert an <hi>Imputation</hi> of Christ's
Righteousness it self <hi>relatively</hi> to those Effects.
Christ's Right is applied, and his very Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
reckoned to us, as what <hi>pleads with
God</hi> for those Effects, and secures us against
all condemning Obstacles and Challenges.
The justifying <hi>Sentence</hi> is not the Sentence of
the Law; God saith not, <hi>You</hi> have perfectly
<hi>obeyed,</hi> therefore you shall <hi>live; you</hi> have
<hi>satisfied</hi> the Curse, therefore you shall not
die: Yet the Righteousness which procured
our Salvation, and is our adjudged pleadable
Security of enjoying this promised Salvation,
includes an <hi>Obedience</hi> as perfect as that to
which the Law promised Life if we had <hi>not
sinned,</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> equivalent to what the
Curse pronounced against us when we sinned.
But because we apprehend not where this
Law includes such a Sentence as this, <hi>viz.</hi>
because <hi>Christ</hi> obeyed, <hi>you</hi> shall live tho <hi>you</hi>
obeyed not; and because <hi>Christ</hi> who sinned
<hi>not,</hi> did suffer for your Sins, <hi>you</hi> shall be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
tho <hi>you have sinned;</hi> therefore we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conceive the <hi>justifying Sentence</hi> to be the
Sentence of the <hi>Gospel-Law,</hi> yet connoting
the <hi>Law of Mediation,</hi> and presupposing a
Satisfaction made to the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> which
we conceive to be to this purpose. Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Sinner, I judicially esteem and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43119:44"/>
thee to be one that I promised <hi>to
my Son</hi> in the Covenant of Redemption, to
pardon, adopt and glorify in Reward of <hi>his</hi>
perfect Obedience to my Law, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to my Justice, which I acknowledg
he hath performed: As also to be one of those
Persons to <hi>whom</hi> I made a Promise of Pardon,
Adoption and eternal Glory, when I <hi>offer'd</hi>
these Blessings to all Sinners who <hi>would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on him.</hi> Thou art therefore in the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Promise made to Christ, and the
Promise made thee, adjudged <hi>to receive</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,
Adoption and Glory, and to have
<hi>a right to plead</hi> the Righteousness of Christ
for thy safe and comfortable Enjoyment of
them in the prevailing Efficacy of his Merits,
who alone procured both these Blessings, and
that <hi>Faith</hi> upon which thy <hi>Estate</hi> is so much
altered. Charity obligeth me to think that
some well-meaning Persons who talk of <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Justification in Christ, intend no more
than this Promise made to Christ in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Redemption:</hi> and by not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
between this Promise, that <hi>all who
should believe</hi> on him should be justified; and
that other Article, all the <hi>Elect shall</hi> believe
on him (which is a distinct thing) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not that by the first no Man can be
justified <hi>till</hi> he be a <hi>Believer;</hi> and the last
Article only assures that the <hi>Elect will be</hi>
Believers, and by the Consequence of the
<hi>first</hi> that they shall all be justified, but yet
not <hi>before</hi> they are Believers. <hi>Isa. 53. 10, 11.
He shall see his Seed,</hi> and <hi>by his Knowledg</hi>
(or Faith in him) <hi>he shall justify many,</hi> are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43119:45"/>
not the same thing: The <hi>former</hi> ascertains
the Elect shall believe, the latter that they
shall be justified <hi>when</hi> they believe; nor could
it be otherwise even when Christ upon the
<hi>Cross</hi> paid that for the sake of which these
Promises were made to him; he must then
pursuant to the Compact die, that Believers
might be <hi>justified,</hi> and the Elect become <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi>
otherwise the Articles of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Redemption must be altered, and
not direct his engaged Performances and
Rewards; nor can I chuse but wonder to see
our Divines in their Dispute against the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
proving that Justification is a <hi>forensic</hi> or
judicial Act, and yet find many using terms
so <hi>improper</hi> to such an Act, and omitting, yea
condemning those which are <hi>proper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to digress no further; you see what
is this part of the difference about Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet remember our Brethren do not say
we our selves did <hi>personally</hi> obey or suffer, or
are reputed so to do, but are reputed to have
done it <hi>in Christ,</hi> who was one legal Person
with us in the account of the Law; nor do
they deny the Pardon of Sin, but own it,
whatever others think of the difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
such things; they do deny also that
we can be said to <hi>satisfy</hi> in Christ, tho we
died in him, or that we <hi>merited</hi> in him, tho
he merited. Further, there's no difference
about the <hi>Effects</hi> of the imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, nor yet about the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it self as including both his <hi>active</hi> and
passive Obedience, nor the <hi>time</hi> of its Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<hi>viz.</hi> when we believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:43119:45"/>
And shall we condemn each other notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this Agreement in almost every
thing besides the manner of Imputation, and
this is about what God accounts <hi>us</hi> to have
done in Christ, and not what <hi>Christ</hi> hath done
for us? Shall Men rend each other, because
one thinks there <hi>can</hi> be no Imputation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what he grants; the other suspects it is
not an Imputation unless it be in his words;
and yet both grant an Imputation effectually
available to <hi>all</hi> the same real Purposes, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Honour of Christ and Grace, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of God's Decree, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
and Salvation of Believers, as if they
had never been unrighteous, with ground
of believing hopes about it equally strong and
quieting?</p>
               <p>2. The other <hi>Point</hi> undecided is, what
<hi>Title</hi> or <hi>Name</hi> we should give to that Faith
which is required in the Person on whom
God's justifying Act doth terminate: our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
scruple our calling it a Qualification, a
Condition or a Righteousness. Others of
us think each of these properly ascribed to
it, a <hi>Qualification</hi> as it distinguisheth one
Man described by the Word, which declares
who shall be justified, from another who,
according to the Rule of the Word, and the
Incongruity of the thing, is not to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
unless the Divine Perfections and the
Methods of Grace should be reflected on;
for by the Gospel-Rule he that hath not
Faith is to abide under Wrath. And how
unbecoming and of ill Consequence would it
be to entitle a Man to Glory, and receive
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43119:46"/>
him to favour for Christ's sake while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth
Christ, and is resolved to tread under
foot his Blood, tho it's from God's Promise
and not any Merit of Congruity that the
Accepter of Christ should be justified? They
call it a <hi>Condition,</hi> not to signify any <hi>Merit</hi>
or <hi>Compensation,</hi> which they abhor, but to
connote God's <hi>Offers</hi> of these Blessings to
<hi>more</hi> than do accept of them, as also a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Authority</hi> injoyning a Compliance with
the Terms on which the Blessing is offered,
tho that be no more than a <hi>meet Acceptance.</hi>
And to shew the <hi>manner</hi> of God's conferring
them upon that Acceptation, they think it
may be called a <hi>Gospel-Righteousness,</hi> not as
meritorious of the Blessing, no, nor a <hi>full</hi>
Conformity to the Gospel-Precept, but as it
is the <hi>performed Condition</hi> of the offered Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
according to the Tenor of the Gospel-<hi>Promise,</hi>
which always supposes Christ's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
and his paying the impetrating
<hi>Price</hi> of all such offered Blessings.</p>
               <p>And they are more induced to account the
performed Condition a Gospel-Righteousness,
because the Gospel so very often speaks of a
<hi>subjective</hi> Righteousness <hi>in us,</hi> and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
<hi>imperfect</hi> Men <hi>righteous</hi> so expresly with
respect to that Righteousness: they also
think that this cannot be from Obedience to
the <hi>Law of Works</hi> unless it were <hi>perfect,</hi> which
it is not, nor yet from <hi>full</hi> Obedience to the
<hi>Precepts</hi> of the Gospel, which enjoyn no less
as a <hi>Duty</hi> than doth the Law it self; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can find no ground of that <hi>Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi>
besides a Conformity to what the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43119:46"/>
Gospel-Promise appointeth as a <hi>Condition</hi> of
the Good it entitles a Person to; yet still as a
means of giving us in a way of <hi>governing
Grace</hi> what was promised <hi>to Christ</hi> for us, as
a Reward of his full Satisfaction to <hi>Legal
Iustice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Brethren think these Terms too
high, and prefer calling Faith an <hi>Instrument,</hi>
as many Protestants do, who also call it a
<hi>Condition:</hi> Some chuse to call it a <hi>means,</hi> I
suppose to note a <hi>physical</hi> Influence in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to what's <hi>moral,</hi> and expressive of any
Law; both which by the way we apprehend
an ascribing much more to Faith than we dare,
because it makes Faith efficacious from its <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
Aptitude and Activity, without a Divine
<hi>Ordination</hi> of it to that end by any <hi>Promise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reason of any Debate concerning
these Expressions lies in this: Our Brethren
consider all the Gospel-Duties and Benefits
as a mere physical <hi>Order</hi> of Blessings decreed
by God to the Elect; and so one is given
before the other, according as the Gospel
describeth that Order: We grant the said
<hi>Order,</hi> and should insist on no more were not
the Benefits offered to <hi>more</hi> besides the Elect,
and still used as <hi>Motives</hi> to induce Men to
submit to those Duties, and this by <hi>Promises</hi>
of the Benefits <hi>if</hi> the Duty be performed,
and <hi>Threatnings</hi> of withholding the Benefits
with additional Misery to be inflicted if
they be not performed, with an account of
<hi>judicial</hi> Proceedings towards Men with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to their performance or non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the said <hi>official</hi> Terms. But
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43119:47"/>
things being thus, and so very apparently
the Indications of <hi>governing</hi> Methods, and
the Aptitude of our <hi>Ministry</hi> for Conversion
and Perseverance so much depending upon
the affecting of Mens <hi>hopes and fears;</hi> we
are forced to own that the Gospel is not <hi>only</hi>
a description of the foresaid Order, but that
it is a <hi>Law of Grace</hi> subordinate to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Redemption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet that none may suspect the difference
above what it is, I shall recite what our
Brethren grant in their</hi> Declaration. <hi>They
say,</hi> p. 13. We are true Owners of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the instant when we believe. <hi>P.</hi> 15. It
must be said that even in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> in God's
Court, and according to the Iudgment in that
open Court which God hath set up in his Word;
and according to the Proceedings of his Word
(which is the Rule he professeth to judg Men by,
and therein he keeps to the Rule of his Word;
as Christ saith, <hi>I judg no Man, but the Word
that I speak shall judg you,</hi> Ioh. 12. 47, 48.)
God doth judg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pronounce his Elect ungodly
and unjustified till they believe. <hi>All these are
the words of Dr.</hi> Goodwin, <hi>which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of, and note that he in</hi> vol. 2. of the
Creatures, lib. 2. cap. 7. p. 51, <hi>to 63. proves
at large, that Faith in Christ is of</hi> another
kind <hi>than the Faith required by the</hi> Law of
Works. <hi>They also say,</hi> p. 46. God in the
Covenant of Grace freely <hi>offereth</hi> unto Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Life and Salvation by Iesus Christ, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring</hi>
of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith in him that they may
be saved. <hi>Note the Assembly of Divines
in</hi> Westminsier, <hi>larger Catech.</hi> Q. 32. <hi>add</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:43119:47"/>
requiring Faith as the <hi>Condition</hi> to interest
them in Christ. <hi>And less. Cat.</hi> to escape the
Wrath and Curse of God due to us for Sin,
God requireth Faith in Iesus Christ, Repentance
unto Life, <hi>&amp;c. And in the</hi> Savoy <hi>Confession
as well as theirs,</hi> Cap. 18. S. 2. <hi>The</hi> true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's
Certainty of Salvation is not a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural
and probable Perswasion grounded upon a
fallible hope, but an infallible assurance of Faith
founded upon the Divine Truth of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Salvation, the inward Evidences of those
Graces <hi>unto which</hi> these Promises <hi>are made,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Of all which our Brethren have approved.
To add no more, they declare</hi> p. 47. <hi>it's an
Error,</hi> That continued Repentance and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are not in the nature of the thing, nor by
the Constitution of the Gospel, necessary to our
being possessed of eternal Life: <hi>And may it
not be supposed that</hi> nor <hi>is put for</hi> and? <hi>Also
that</hi> necessary by Constitution of the Gospel, <hi>as
distinguished from necessary in the</hi> nature of
the thing: <hi>Some of them may mean an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
or</hi> rectoral <hi>Constitution,</hi> i. e. <hi>this
Order is appointed by Christ as our</hi> Ruler,
<hi>wherein he hath</hi> enacted <hi>this Connexion, and</hi>
requireth <hi>our Compliance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things being put together, must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
our Brethren from the imputation of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Faith, Repentance, or Holiness, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
or useless to Salvation, tho they scruple to
call it a <hi>Gospel-Righteousness;</hi> and we hope it
may encline them to a forbearance towards us,
who think these Concessions contain for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
all that we intend by the Terms, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
and <hi>Gospel-Righteousness,</hi> which we
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43119:48"/>
make use of as <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> do more exactly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensively,
and to some purposes more
safely express what we conceive to be the
true import of these Passages when connected,
and which we approve of.</p>
               <p>Yet to put things in a fuller Light, I shall
represent the matter as it stands by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Passages, to all which they declare their
Assent <hi>p.</hi> 63. The Brethren affirm God in
his Covenant <hi>offering</hi> Life and Salvation to
<hi>Sinners,</hi> and <hi>requiring</hi> Faith in him that they
may be saved; and this Faith in a Mediator
commanded by the <hi>Gospel</hi> (and not by the
Law of Works, as Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> saith) with
<hi>Gospel-Promises</hi> of an Interest in Christ and
his Benefits, and these are <hi>made to this Faith,</hi>
(as a Condition, saith the Assembly of Divines)
and this in such a manner, that the Believer
may have an <hi>infallible</hi> assurance of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
upon an inward evidence of his having this
<hi>Faith,</hi> as that Grace <hi>to which the Promise was
made,</hi> wherein the said Benefits were included.
And also that this Gospel includes that <hi>Word,</hi>
which is the <hi>Rule of Iudgment,</hi> by which Rule
God judgeth that Man (tho <hi>Elect)</hi> who hath not
this Faith, to be a Christless, unpardoned Child
of Wrath; and him who <hi>hath</hi> this Faith, to be a
true <hi>Owner</hi> of Christ and Pardon: Also that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is of such necessity to all Sinners, that
it as well as Faith, is <hi>required</hi> that they may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape,
and <hi>none</hi> may expect to be pardoned in a
<hi>state</hi> of Unbelief and Impenitence; yea <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi>
Repentance and Holiness are <hi>necessary</hi>
to our possession of eternal Life. And all this
to be necessary, not only from the nature of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43119:48"/>
the thing, but also by the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the
Gospel.</p>
               <p>I apprehend this Account is so <hi>equivalent</hi> to
a Gospel-Law of Grace for all its great purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that I shall not be offended at what name
they please to give it; and did not a fear of
offending them prevent me, I would prove it
to be all the Law of Grace which we assert;
especially if they would allow that when they
say <hi>God requireth Faith,</hi> that Sinners under
Offers of Life may be saved, it's upon his
<hi>Throne</hi> (tho a Throne of Grace) that God in
Christ requireth it, and from thence directs
his Offers of Salvation to Sinners; and thence
<hi>sentenceth</hi> them who live under Gospel-Offers
by their asserted <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Iudgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, we have no reason to contend,
especially when both agree the Debate is
about the Instrument of <hi>Donation,</hi> and the
Qualification of the Subject to receive a
<hi>Gift,</hi> and not about any thing that <hi>meriteth</hi>
the Gift freely bestowed on God's part, and
thankfully and humbly received on our part.
A low degree of Charity would make allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
on both hands, when the Difference is so
minute. They seem jealous of the Honour of
<hi>Free-Grace</hi> (yet owning Christ's Merits:)
we are for Free-Grace in opposition to all
<hi>Merits</hi> besides Christ's, but not exclusively of
all <hi>governing</hi> Methods in applying the effects
of Free-Grace. They grant Faith in Christ
is required, that we may be saved; we more
expresly say, it's by a rectoral <hi>Authority:</hi> they
grant it so by the <hi>Law of Works;</hi> we say it's
by a <hi>Gospel</hi> positive Law, tho we grant when
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43119:49"/>
this <hi>positive</hi> Law requireth it, we are obliged
also by the <hi>general</hi> Law of Nature to yield
Obedience; yet not by the Law of Works,
as specified by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant, which Faith
in Christ was inconsistent with from the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Nature of that Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
are watchful against any inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of man <hi>mingling</hi> with Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:
We, besides avoiding of that, are
solicitous lest men come short of Salvation
by the Righteousness of Christ, through a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of what he <hi>requireth</hi> in all those who
shall be saved by it; and yet we declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all things besides Christ's Righteousness
to be any impetrating, satisfying, atoning,
meriting or compensating Righteousness; and
as Faith hath no share or place in this Office,
so <hi>Christ's Righteousness,</hi> tho the sole merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Cause, is not that which God by the
Gospel requires of Sinners that they may be
saved by the Righteousness of Christ. Faith
is that commanded Requisite, and no more
than that; its place is thereto confined: and
therefore here's no <hi>mingling</hi> of our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with Christ's, because their Use, Place,
and Offices be so very distinct.</p>
               <p>They seem most afraid of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianism;</hi>
and therefore keep to this sense
of being justified by Faith <hi>alone, viz.</hi> we are
justified <hi>only by Christ</hi> believed on, or the
<hi>Object</hi> of Faith only is imputed to us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
We are truly afraid of Popery
and Arminianism, but not <hi>only</hi> of these, but
of <hi>Antinomianism</hi> too; and therefore are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to maintain <hi>two</hi> great Truths included in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43119:49"/>
that one Sentence, <hi>We are justified by Faith,</hi>
viz.</p>
               <p>1. That the Believer is absolv'd from Guilt,
accepted into God's Favour, and entituled to
eternal Life in and for Christ's Righteousness,
and neither Faith, nor any Grace or Act of
ours make the least <hi>recompense</hi> to God, or is
the least <hi>Price</hi> or <hi>Merit</hi> of Pardon or Life,
or any <hi>motive</hi> inclining divine Justice to
<hi>promise</hi> or <hi>accept</hi> us into his favour, or to treat
us as <hi>righteous Persons:</hi> This from our heart
we own, and know that this is what sound
<hi>Protestants</hi> intended by it against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</p>
               <p>2. Yet as God promised to <hi>Christ</hi> in the
Covenant of Redemption, all Belivers should
be absolv'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so in the the Gospel-<hi>Offer</hi>
of his Grace to Sinners, he <hi>promised to Men,</hi>
that he would in and for the Righteousness
of Christ, absolve, accept, treat as righteous
Persons, and give eternal Life (already pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by Christ) to every <hi>true Believer;</hi>
commanding Sinners to <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>threatning</hi>
that if they believed not, they should <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi>
condemned, yea become subject to <hi>sorer</hi>
Punishments: And that he would <hi>judg</hi> them
by this Gospel-<hi>Rule of Iudgment.</hi> Whence
we are attentive to a <hi>second Truth, viz.</hi> That
God accepts and accounteth Faith a <hi>performed
Condition</hi> of this Gospel-Covenant, and upon
it acquits the Sinner from the <hi>Charge</hi> of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Infidelity, and adjudgeth the Believer,
<hi>qua</hi> such, in opposition to Infidels, to be, in
<hi>Christ's Right,</hi> and by his Gospel-<hi>Promise,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
to a <hi>present personal Interest</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43119:50"/>
Absolution, Acceptance, and Gift of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life; yet as <hi>procured</hi> by Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
<hi>alone,</hi> and applied for his sake.</p>
               <p>To add no more, our Brethren in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of Justification almost confine their
Regards to the Satisfaction of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Christ transacted with the provoked Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God: We, besides that, consider a
propitiated God in Christ applying the effects
of his Redemption to Men in a Method of
governing Grace, but without any real dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the Doctrine of Satisfaction; and
withal sincerely granting the Condition is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>
in the Strength of Christ <hi>freely</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed.
Yet upon the whole they provide
against carnal <hi>Security,</hi> and we against carnal
Boasting: They are far from designing to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
the Glory of Christ, as <hi>King, Lawgiver,</hi>
and <hi>Iudg;</hi> and we as far from intending the
diminution of his Glory as a <hi>Priest.</hi> How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and unhappy would perpetuated
Contests by where the Grounds pretended are
of so little weight?</p>
               <p>Thus I have insisted on what seems most
like a Difference in the Doctrine of <hi>Satisfaction</hi>
and <hi>Iustification.</hi> Some weak persons may
think there is a great Controversy, where I
see nothing worth our notice, they will say.
Some think we are justified by <hi>one</hi> Act of
Faith, viz. <hi>Reliance.</hi> Well, but they say ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
Faith is <hi>receiving Christ,</hi> &amp;c. as well
as a Reliance. <hi>Ay,</hi> but a Man <hi>sees</hi> only with
his <hi>Eye,</hi> tho more is of the Essence of a Man:
But I say no Man sees without that which is
of the <hi>Essence</hi> of his Eye. <hi>Another</hi> thinks
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43119:50"/>
justifying Faith <hi>as such</hi> receives Christ only as
a <hi>Priest; others</hi> say, it receives him also as a
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prophet:</hi> yet the <hi>last</hi> say the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
Sinner hath an <hi>especial</hi> respect to Christ's
<hi>Priesthood</hi> as most agreeable to his present
case; and the former will say its but an <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical</hi>
Faith that receives not Christ as
Prophet and King as well as Priest. Nay, its
not the true Christ, the <hi>anointed Messias,</hi> who
is received, unless it be as Prophet, King, and
Priest, even <hi>Christ Iesus the Lord.</hi> Ay, but
some say <hi>Repentance is an effect of Iustification;</hi>
but there be very few of our <hi>Congregational</hi>
Brethren of that mind, and I suppose they
mean <hi>Works</hi> meet for Repentance, and not a
change of the purpose of the heart.</p>
               <p>Nay, but several say, <hi>Faith alone is the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Iustification;</hi> others make Repentance
<hi>the Condition of Forgiveness.</hi> What then?
seeing the first grant there is no justifying
Faith <hi>without</hi> Repentance, and the last grant
the <hi>aptitude</hi> of Faith to receive and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
Christ (which I suppose they mean by
instrument) is far greater than Repentance.
But when both sides consider Faith as an <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi>
Condition as well as an Instrument,
they'l scarce dispute but that Repentance is a
Condition of Pardon as well as Faith, unless
they would agree to join them together by
calling Faith a <hi>penitent</hi> Faith, or Repentance
a <hi>believing</hi> Repentance; connoting at once a
Sinner's purpose to <hi>return to God</hi> by Christ the
Mediator, and his closing with Christ <hi>the
Mediator,</hi> that he may return to God by him:
tho I think the end is first agreed to, before
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43119:51"/>
the way or means to that end is resolved on or
made use of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But sure there is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those who think we are justified by Faith
<hi>only,</hi> and those who think we are justified by
<hi>Works</hi> as well as by Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Not so very great; when both
mean that we are justified neither by Faith nor
Works, as the word <hi>justified</hi> is commonly
taken: for both agree that we are absolved,
accepted as righteous, and entitled to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life only for Christ's Death and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
as the only meriting, satisfactory
and atoning Righteousness.</p>
               <p>2. They who say it's by Faith alone that
<hi>we apply</hi> this Righteousness, do also grant that
Faith is <hi>not alone</hi> in the person to whom God
applies the Righteousness of Christ; and when
they apply it to themselves, Repentance,
Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are <hi>Concomitants</hi> with Faith: And
they who think we are <hi>justified by Works,</hi> as
they think <hi>its God</hi>'s applying Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
to us, and not <hi>our</hi> applying it to our
selves, that is the great justifying Act; so they
grant God justifieth us <hi>as soon</hi> as we repent
and believe <hi>with the heart,</hi> and suspends not a
justified State, till <hi>Works meet for Repentance</hi>
or the <hi>Effects</hi> of Faith are produced; yea,
should a man dy then, he would be certainly
saved.</p>
               <p>3. They who say its by Faith <hi>alone,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that <hi>justifying Faith</hi> will certainly
<hi>produce</hi> good Works; and if <hi>good Works</hi> and
persevering Holiness do not follow, it was a
<hi>dead</hi> Faith; and because <hi>dead,</hi> it never was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43119:51"/>
a <hi>justifying</hi> Faith, however men flatter'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
Also that Mens <hi>Faith,</hi> tho not their
Persons, is justified by their <hi>Works:</hi> yea the
most Judicious own, that if Sin should reign
in Believers, and they apostatize, they would
be condemned, (tho the Promise of Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
make that impossible;) and therefore
persevering Holiness and good Works so far
<hi>continue</hi> their justification, as they prevent
what would bring them into Condemnation;
and Faith is the Condition of the Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Justification. See Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> of <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
p. 207, 208, 306.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, they who say we are
<hi>justified</hi> by <hi>Works,</hi> do account Works to
be no more but the <hi>executing</hi> the foederal
<hi>consenting</hi> Act of Faith; and so its Faith
exerting it self by various occasions: and
considering that the Believer's not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
his Enemies, but his persevering in
Faith and Holiness, are plain Conditions in
many <hi>Promises</hi> made thereto; and God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
to Believers, that he will have <hi>no
pleasure</hi> in any Man who drawerh back, and
<hi>he shall die</hi> if Sin reigneth in him; <hi>Heb. 10. 38.
Rom. 8. 13. Mat.</hi> 6. 14, 15. They conceive
that by Perseverance in Faith and true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
they are kept from being <hi>chargeable</hi> with
final and total Apostacy, and from Obnoxious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Evils denounced by the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Apostates</hi> as such, and are adjudged to
be under the Influence and Safeguard of the
Promises made to Believers as <hi>persevering:</hi>
nevertheless they abhor a thought that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
in Faith and Holiness, or any good
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43119:52"/>
Work, is any meriting Righteousness, or the
least Compensation for Sin, or entitling Price
of the least Benefit; nor exclude they the
need of multiplied and continued <hi>Pardon,</hi> or
make they any Blessing <hi>due of Debt;</hi> but they
rely <hi>wholly</hi> on Christ's Merits for these things,
as the only procuring Cause; tho they are
<hi>affected</hi> and <hi>governed</hi> by these places of God's
Word, which are directed to Believers as part
of his <hi>Rule of Iudgment;</hi> well knowing that
whatever Sentence the said Words pass in this
Life, God executes in part now, and more at
Death; but at the great Day it will be <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly</hi>
pronounced, and <hi>perfectly</hi> executed.</p>
               <p>These respective Concessions duly weighed,
secure those who say we are justified by Faith
<hi>alone</hi> from the danger of <hi>Licentiousness;</hi> and
those who say we are justified by <hi>Works</hi> also,
from detracting from the <hi>Honour of Christ's
Righteousness,</hi> as having the <hi>sole</hi> meriting, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning
Virtue and Efficacy in Justification;
and do not only <hi>grant</hi> Perseverance, but think
these conditional Promises and Comminations
are apt and <hi>designed</hi> means of it, in Subjects
capable of moral Government, and whose
<hi>Warfare</hi> is unaccomplished.</p>
               <p>However such different Sentiments may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to others, I lay so little stress upon them,
that I had not thought it worth my labour to
have printed a Sheet against any man who
confessed the necessity of saving Faith (as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the Gospel) to Justification, (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Love still accompanying that
Faith in the Object on whom God's justifying
Act doth terminate) and the Uneffectualness
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43119:52"/>
of <hi>Faith</hi> to save any who neglected to perform
good Works, and to persevere in Faith and
Holiness. Such as granted but these things
I had never wrote against for scrupling the
<hi>conditional</hi> respect of them to the Gospel-Law.
But Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Notions I apprehended dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
and they so greatly prevailing, my
Brethren thought my confuting them necessary
at that time: whereas I had no purpose when
I wrote against Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> to intermeddle with
these other points; but some Congregational
Brethren in their Attempts against my Book,
did from a very few occasional Expressions
therein, accuse us of <hi>Socinianism, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi>
and <hi>Popery:</hi> and that they might have
some pretence to fix that Charge, they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Controversy into these lesser Matters,
whereby I was necessitated either to insist on
them (however against my Will) or else abide
under the foresaid severe Imputation, to the
prejudice not only of my own Ministry, but
also of most of my Brethren.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I think it may be accommodated;
at least so far as to cut off just Pretences for
hereticating and dividing from each other:
To which end I will consider these several
Opinions, and then reduce the difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Among them who say Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
<hi>is imputed [in se]</hi> there be two Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
most noted, and whereto all others
are reducible: Of both these I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43119:53"/>
treated so much, that little more is
needful.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Some</hi> think the Elect are judicially, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> accounted to
have done and suffered in Christ all the Law
demanded, both as the Punishment of Sin,
and the Merit of eternal Life.</p>
               <p>Such must hold that Christ's Death and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
are the <hi>formal</hi> Righteousness of the
Elect, and the formal Cause of Justification,
and that from the first moment of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Subsistence; yea, and (except making
Christ to be their Representative) without any
<hi>Gift</hi> of that Righteousness, it being imputed
not of Grace but of <hi>Legal Iustice,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Obedience had been if he had finally obeyed,
and his Offence now is upon his sinning.</p>
               <p>There <hi>are others</hi> who are for this judicial
reckoning Sinners to obey and suffer in
Christ; but they hold they are not adjudged
to have done this, till they are <hi>Believers;</hi> and
then they are legally just before God, and
as such entitled to eternal Life. These speak
more <hi>safely,</hi> but less <hi>consistently;</hi> they limit the
time, from a Conviction that the whole scope
of the Gospel must be contradicted, if Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
do not <hi>remain</hi> condemned, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<hi>only</hi> are justified. But yet it seems
hard to apprehend, that God by the Law of
Works accounts the <hi>Person</hi> of a Believer to
have suffered in Christ, and therefore to be
absolved, whom yet he did not account to
suffer in Christ while he was an <hi>Vnbeliever,</hi>
and therefore condemned him, and this by
that very same Law which now acquits him.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43119:54"/>
I know, to make this consist, it's offered that
the <hi>Elect</hi> are not Christ's Seed <hi>till</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Believers. But this comes short, for it will
thence follow that Christ in his Death was
a strict Representative, who personated Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<hi>[qua] Believers,</hi> which will induce ill
Consequences: And yet further, it is not
true, that the Persons of Believers were <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally</hi>
in Christ when he died, as we were
in <hi>Adam</hi> when he sinned; and so no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can be brought from that Instance. I
grant that both the <hi>Merit</hi> and the powerful
<hi>Virtue</hi> whereby our Persons in time obtain
Faith, were in <hi>Christ</hi> before we were born;
but that makes not Christ the Root of our
<hi>Persons</hi> at that time, but of that regenerating
Virtue whereby we become Believers; and
therefore tho as to this change of our <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
we may be called <hi>Christ's Seed</hi> when
we believe, yet it's not such a Seed as it may
be said of, we suffered in him, as we sinned in
<hi>Adam</hi> who was the <hi>natural</hi> Root of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and thereupon such a Representative as
his Descendents sinned in. What may be
said of Christ's <hi>adopting</hi> Merit will have no
place here, for these Authors make Adoption
to be an <hi>Effect</hi> of Justification, and so the
Imputation is prior.</p>
               <p>2. There be others who are for imputed
Righteousness <hi>in se,</hi> but cannot approve of
the former manner of Imputation, among
whom there is some variety in wording their
Conceptions, but they come to one and the
same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that God adjudgeth the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
to be one whose Absolution, Adoption
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43119:54"/>
and Glory were <hi>promised to Christ</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of his Death and Obedience by the
Covenant of Redemption, (which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
also to the Believer <hi>himself</hi> in the
Gospel-Covenant) and for his actual Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and Enjoyment thereof, as also Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Treatment as <hi>a righteous Person,</hi>
against all Challenges, God judicially ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
what Christ hath done and suffered
to be his <hi>pleadable Security:</hi> This we take to
be Imputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the Opinion of those who
say Christ's Righteousness <hi>is not imputed [in se]</hi>
but only as to Effects; they in Expressions
oppose all the forementioned account, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the <hi>first</hi> Head is true, and that the
<hi>second</hi> is any Imputation of Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<hi>in se.</hi> Nevertheless they grant that
Christ's Righteousness is the meritorious
Cause of our Justification by Faith, and
seem to insist mostly upon its Efficacy to that
end, as Christ's Satisfaction was the ground
upon which God enacted the Gospel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
wherein our Faith, tho imperfect, is
accounted for Righteousness. Concerning
this Opinion I shall offer a few things.</p>
               <p>1. None ought to narrow it, as if the
Authors meant that Pardon and eternal Life
are not merited by the Righteousness of
Christ; for they affirm, that these and other
<hi>Gospel-Blessings</hi> are merited by Christ as well
as the Gospel-Covenant. Pray say not this;
it's not only the Covenant it self, but <hi>those very
Blessings</hi> which that Covenant conveys, that
are the merited Effects of Christ's Death and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43119:55"/>
Obedience; they were his deserved Rewards
which are dispensed to us upon believing.
This I insert, to obviate a Conceit too much
improved by some, so stupid, or worse, that
they will not own this Distinction, and still
cry out as if their Opinion confined the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of Christ's Righteousness to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of <hi>a Law</hi> whereby Men were to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
Pardon and Life by their own Faith:
Whereas they are so far from this, that they
affirm these Blessings were already accounted
purchased, and Authority in Christ to dispense
them before he could enact such a Law.</p>
               <p>2. They intend not to exclude Christ's
Righteousness from being imputed in any
sense; for they say it's imputed <hi>quoad effectus,</hi>
and therefore should not be charged to deny
all Imputation, or represented to say, we are
pardoned and saved for our own Works,
without <hi>any</hi> Imputation of Christ's Death and
Obedience at all.</p>
               <p>3. In all which they affirm concerning
Justification, they still suppose Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Satisfaction, and are sound therein:
None can accuse them to differ from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
as to Christ's expiating Sacrifice, or
impetration of eternal Life.</p>
               <p>4. I could wish a very worthy Person of
this Opinion would review his own account
of Justification, wherein he saith, it's <hi>that Act
whereby God imputes to every sound Believer
his Faith for Righteousness upon the account of
Christ's Satisfaction and Merits,</hi> and <hi>gives
Pardon and Life as the Benefits of it,</hi> i. e.
of Justification, which he further explicates,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43119:55"/>
                  <hi>—Through Christ's Sacrifice the Defects of this
Faith, which is our Righteousness, are pardoned,
and by his Merits that imperfect Duty is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
or imputed to us for Righteousness,
which it is not in it self.</hi> Had I thus stated
this Point, I should ask my self, Do not I
set Pardon too remote from Christ's Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
as the meritorious Cause? And how can
Pardon be the Effect of imputing Faith for
Righteousness, (which is Justification,) and
yet God cannot impute Faith for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unless he first pardon its Defects for the
sake of Christ's Sacrifice? But the cause of
my mentioning this Account follows.</p>
               <p>5. They do affirm what amounts to a real
Imputation of Christ's Righteousness <hi>in se,</hi>
at least what supposeth this Imputation, and
infers it to be necessary: For how by Christ's
Merits can a Righteousness in it self <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
be reckoned before a just God for our
perfect Righteousness, and yet those Merits,
for which it is so reckoned, not be imputed
at all for Righteousness to us who have that
Faith? Would Faith be <hi>no</hi> Righteousness,
except the Divine Mind did apply the Merits
of Christ to Faith to <hi>make it</hi> a Righteousness,
upon which I am accounted righteous by this
Faith, and yet the Divine Mind not apply
to me that Righteousness of Christ, without
which my Faith had left me still <hi>unrighteous?</hi>
whereas it seems undeniable, as far as Christ's
Righteousness is necessary to make my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
<hi>Faith</hi> my Righteousness in God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that same very Righteousness is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make my <hi>Person</hi> righteous in God's
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43119:56"/>
account. Moreover, they own that God <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to Christ</hi> in reward of his meriting
Sufferings and Obedience, that all Believers
should be absolved and glorified, and can
they be adjudged to this Absolution and
Glory without a <hi>judicial</hi> acknowledgment
that they are to be absolved and glorified in
that Right of Christ which resulted from
that Promise made to him? And can that be
without an Imputation of those Sufferings
and Obedience of Christ which are rewarded
in that <hi>Right</hi> of Christ, and thereby in those
<hi>Blessings</hi> wherein Believers have this judicially
acknowledged interest? They also abhor a
thought that our Faith can be presented to
God as any Righteousness in <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to
Justice, <hi>Atonement</hi> for our Sin, or the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
<hi>Price</hi> of our Salvation: withal they
grant there must be such a Righteousness,
and that this was Christ's Righteousness, and
that our Sins are satisfied for, we receive the
Atonement, are reconciled, and obtain the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
so purchased. Now is it possible that
things should stand thus, and Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
not be imputed to us? Can our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judg declare himself satisfied, atoned,
and reconciled to us Sinners for the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ, and not impute to us that
Righteousness <hi>in se,</hi> as what he accounts a
Plea for us in his account? Can we enjoy the
<hi>merited Effects</hi> of Christ's Death, and that
Death not be reckoned what secures to us those
Effects against the Challenges which the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
of it were designed to answer? Finally,
Do not these Divines oft rest on and plead
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43119:56"/>
with God the Merits of Christ more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
and directly than a denial of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
will admit? when they <hi>rest</hi> on Christ's
Righteousness, and <hi>plead</hi> it with God for
Pardon, (tho it's true we could not expect
Pardon for it, were not Pardon promised for
the sake thereof.) I think their Minds
oft act more directly and fully towards the
Righteousness of Christ, than to intend it
thus, <hi>viz.</hi> I trust in Christ's Merits for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
as that Pardon is the Effect of that
Justification wherein our Faith is accounted
through Christ's Satisfaction a Righteousness
according to the Gospel-Covenant, which
Covenant was procured by the Merits of
Christ's Death.</p>
               <p>I. grant there may be use of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive
manner of arriving at Christ's Death
for support of our Faith as we confine its
regards to the Gospel-Covenant, and examine
our Interest thereby as a Rule of Judgment.
But I humbly think that when we plead with
God for Pardon for the sake of Christ's
Merits, we have a more direct Eye to the
Covenant <hi>of Redemption,</hi> wherein a Pardon
was promised to Christ for Believers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of his Death, and which the Gospel
distinctly expresseth in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
is granted for the sake of Christ's Death,
as what procured it <hi>in se,</hi> as well as what
merited the Gospel-Covenant, which is the
Instrument of the Donation of it. And so
by keeping our Eye on the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
we plead Christ's Right as more
<hi>immediately</hi> imputable; and by keeping our
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43119:57"/>
Thoughts on the Gospel-Connexion between
Pardon and Christ's Death as the procuring
Merit of it, we plead Christ's very Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
<hi>mediately</hi> imputed, <hi>viz.</hi> as our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Security for our certain obtaining and
safe enjoying the said Forgiveness.</p>
               <p>6. The Reasons why these venerable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are so intent to deny an Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness <hi>in se,</hi> are, 1. An appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
that there's no such Imputation, unless
we are accounted by God to have done and
suffered what Christ did, which would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
induce the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Scheme as
most consistent. But that I deny to be the
only import of that Phrase; for when that
Righteousness <hi>it self</hi> is imputed <hi>relatively</hi> to
the special Effects of it, it's truly an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of it <hi>in se;</hi> and whereas they of the
other Extreme say, that its being a pleadable
Security for our Pardon, is but an Effect; I
answer, This Righteousness it self being that
Security is an Effect of the Compact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Father and the Son, and it's not
this Effect is imputed, but the Righteousness
it self, as such; and by the same Rule, as they
can deny it to be imputed <hi>in se,</hi> because it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
as a pleadable Security, they may better
say it's being imputed for Justification and for
Atonement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would make it to be no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of it <hi>in se,</hi> for those are but Effects,
and that by virtue of the same Compact.
2. A Zeal for the Gospel-Righteousness <hi>of
Faith:</hi> But that is very consistent with the
imputed Righteousness of Christ; and tho
both meet in our Justification, yet it's under
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43119:57"/>
very distinct Considerations, of which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>Nor can I forbear again to inform the
World that both Extremes arise from too
much disregard of the one or the other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
wherein the Salvation of a Sinner
is adjusted. These Brethren, forgetting the
Covenant of <hi>Redemption</hi> to which the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant
is subordinate, too little men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Righteousness of Christ; the other
Brethren overlook the <hi>Gospel</hi>-Covenant, and
darken a Gospel-Righteousness of Faith:
Whereas a distinct respect to the Rule of
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Impetration</hi> on the one hand,
and to the Rule of the <hi>Application</hi> of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
Benefits on the other hand, would put
a Period to their principal Disputes.</p>
               <p>From this Representation of the several
Sentiments of the Brethren concerned in the
Point before us, a mutual Forbearance seems
no unjustifiable thing between them who
differ most; and no considerable Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
remains between the others. 1. They
who think the Imputation of Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<hi>in se,</hi> is God's reckoning we did and
suffered what Christ did, claim a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
from them who say it's imputed only
as to Effects, for they disown the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi>
Consequences of it, and abhor all Abuses
of it to carnal Boasts and profane Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinism,
of which before: How unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
then were it to perpetuate Contests about
this Point from the ill Consequences of it,
when those Consequences are denied? On the
other hand, it appears too like uncharitable
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43119:58"/>
Rigidness for them to condemn as intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
such who say Christ's Righteousness is
imputed only as to Effects: For whatever is
the sound of their words, they ascribe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Faith or Works which belongs to
Christ's Righteousness; nor do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from the Honour of Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
any thing which these Brethren ascribe
thereto, and are Orthodox in the Doctrine
of Satisfaction against <hi>Socinianism</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
When they say Faith is an accepted
Righteousness, mean they that it's a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
either to atone for Sin, or merit Life?
No, they abhor it, and confine both to Christ's
Righteousness entirely: But they do not say
<hi>Christ's Righteousness is imputed,</hi> that's not
true, for they say it is imputed; Ay, <hi>but not
in se.</hi> But should that be so, would not it
be far from a Christian Spirit, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
for not using a Phrase which the
Spirit of God makes no use of, who surely
knew how to express Truth as properly as
fallible Men should pretend to? <hi>Yea, but the
Scriptures speak what amounts to this Phrase.</hi>
And so do they in granting Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
to be the only Atonement and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
Cause of Pardon and Life, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
with God as righteous Persons.
<hi>But do not they think we stand before God
only in this Righteousness of Faith, and not of
Christ?</hi> No; they assure us, that what Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
Faith is, it's so by Christ's Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Merits, and it's only a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as a performed Condition of the Gospel,
describing the Persons who obtain that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43119:58"/>
which is the Effect of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ; and whose Satisfaction still
interposeth between the Justice of God and
a believing Sinner: Neither are they back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to ascribe to efficacious Grace that
Virtue whereby we are enclined and enabled
to believe. Men may expose each other by
fiery Debates after such Concessions, but he
who expresseth most Heat, discovers the
more ungospel Spirit, if not the weaker
Cause, and weaker Judgment.</p>
               <p>2. As for such who own Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<hi>in se</hi> to be imputed in the second
sense, and those who say it's not imputed in
it self but as to Effects; if they contend,
the first must quarrel the other for denying
in words what he grants for substance; and
the latter must be warm against the former,
because he will not join with him in offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the weak, and hazarding Truth by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
a Phrase, which, well explained,
doth properly express what both intend.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">An Abstract of what helped me to avoid
some Perplexity concerning Iustification,
with some account of our being justified
at the Creator and Redeemer's Bar.</head>
               <p>THO I avoid arguing any Controversy
in these Sheets, which are designed for
Peace, yet I think it may promote this heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Design, to give a short Abstract of some
Thoughts whereby I arrived to Satisfaction
in the Doctrine of Justification.</p>
               <p>§. 1. Justification being a <hi>forensick</hi> Act, our
Thoughts ought not to wander beyond what's
necessary to it as a <hi>judicial Sentence,</hi> nor
disregard whatever belongs to that. Here
the principal Considerations are the Judg,
the Rule of Judgment, the Cause and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be tried by that Rule, and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to be past by the Judg on the Person
whose Cause is so tried, which must be no
other than what that Rule of Judgment, duly
applied, containeth. Hereby what some call
<hi>Constitutive</hi> Justification, is strictly no other
than the Conformity of the Person to the
Rule of Judgment, by which he is acquitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or rewardable, or both. <hi>Passive</hi> Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is no other than the Effect of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Sentence, or the Person's State consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as absolved, or to be rewarded, or both,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43119:59"/>
by the Sentence now judicially past upon
him, and supposeth a Sentence, and is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by it.</p>
               <p>§. 2. A justifying Sentence <hi>is past</hi> upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
justified Person, and <hi>continues</hi> to pass up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him by the Gospel-Promises applied by an
Omnipresent, All-seeing, Infallible, Faithful,
Almighty God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2. The Gospel-offer
is the <hi>Rule</hi> of Judgment, the Gospel in
its respective <hi>Promises</hi> complied with, is God's
justifying Sentence, and that, conclusive and
effectual, tho not so discernable by us, as if
it were solemnly pronounced. 1. Here the
transcendent Perfections of God must raise
our Minds above Human Judicatories: he
needs no <hi>Evidence,</hi> because he knoweth all
things; there needs no Summons to <hi>appear,</hi>
for he is ever with us; he cannot <hi>err</hi> in
Judgment, for he is inflexibly righteous, and
knows the Rule of Judgment in its extent
and allowances. 2. We know not what So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
this Sentence may be pronounced
with <hi>concerning us,</hi> tho out of our hearing,
what in <hi>Heaven,</hi> where there is Joy for the
Conversion of Sinners; what at the <hi>Throne,</hi>
where Christ is our interceding Advocate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And sometimes God condescends to make it
audible to our own <hi>Consciences</hi> by the received
Testimony of his Spirit. 3. This Sentence
is in part <hi>executed</hi> upon every Believer as to
what is promised for the present, as well as
his <hi>Title</hi> is adjudged to what is reserved for
the future. The in-dwelling Spirit, Assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
peculiar to Christ's Members, Answers of
Prayer, the Comforts of the Holy Ghost,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43119:60"/>
and whatever special Actings of Providence
belong only to God's adopted Ones, are the
Execution of the justifying Sentence, and
suppose such a Sentence past, as well as that
it is a gracious one. 4. God still pronounceth
a justifying Sentence according to the <hi>variety</hi>
of his Gospel-Promises, tho that great one
which <hi>alters</hi> our State passeth upon our first
believing. As he adjudgeth us to Pardon and
Adoption upon our first acceptance of his
Grace, so he adjudgeth us non-forfeiters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our abiding in Christ, or persevering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
instanced as the various Promises
describe the <hi>Heirs</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>§. 3. The <hi>same</hi> justifying Sentence that
God past by his Promises applied by himself
in this Life, will be more solemnly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly
pronounced at the Judgment-day,
when the full and perfect Execution of the
Sentence is to take place.</p>
               <p>1. We shall be as <hi>truly</hi> judged at that day
as if we had not been sentenced, or the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
executed at all in this Life, or at Death.
The wise God who knows the Subserviency
hereof to <hi>Practical Religion,</hi> doth oft and
most expresly deliver it, and in words as if
we were all to be among those found alive
when the Trumpet sounds. 2 Cor. 5. 10. <hi>We
must all appear before the Iudgment-seat of
Christ, that we may all receive,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 14.
10, 12. <hi>Every one of us shall give an account of
himself to God, 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 5. And what must
we give an account of? <hi>Our Words,</hi> Mat. 12. 36.
<hi>Secrets of Hearts,</hi> Rom. 2. 16. use of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi>
Mat. 25. Heb. 13. 17. <hi>our Works,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43119:60"/>
that is, every thing as gives Evidence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mens Condition, as it's determinable by
the Rule of Judgment, and principally cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in this, Have they <hi>sincerely accepted</hi> of
the Salvation offered by the Redeemer?</p>
               <p>2. The Rule of Judgment and Sentence at
that day will be <hi>the same</hi> as that by which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Believer is justified on this side Death; it's
no new or other Sentence, but the same more
solemnly declared, unless you'll say it includes
the entire extent of the Rule for the time of
trial, as well as that which changed our
State.</p>
               <p>3. The great design of that solemn Process
and open Sentence, is to vindicate God in
Christ as <hi>no Respecter of Persons,</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
different State of the Damned and
the Saved, both in this Life and Eternity,
especially such as lived under the offers of
Salvation; and withal to vindicate his own
mysterious Methods towards the Justified in
their past Life, as also them from unjust
Aspersions, 2 <hi>Thess. 1. Dan. 12. Mat. 22. &amp;
25.</hi> But to instance no more than the first,
he'll convince Angels and Men by <hi>manifested
Instances,</hi> that they whom he justified, and
now saveth, were Persons justifiable by that
Rule of Judgment whereby the others are
condemned; and that the Sentence he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
and executes <hi>on each,</hi> is the very
Sentence which that Rule impartially applied
to their real Cases denounced.</p>
               <p>§. 4. The Rule of Judgment in its nature
and scope is to be principally regarded in
order to right Apprehensions concerning the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43119:61"/>
justifying Sentence: This determineth what
is a justifying Righteousness, and what is not;
this declares the nature of the adjudged Title,
whether it be of Grace or Debt, dependent or
independent; thereby is evident what we are
adjudged to, and whether the Sentence pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
upon several complex Conditions, or one
particular one; for we must be free from
whatever the Rule of Judgment denounceth
condemnable, and not be without what it
confineth its promised Absolution or Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
to; seeing the Lord our Judg doth sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
us as this revealed Rule takes hold
of us.</p>
               <p>§. 5. I find nothing plainer, than that on
the one hand we are made righteous by
Christ's Obedience, <hi>Rom. 5. 19. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 21.
and accepted in the Beloved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6, 7. and
washed from our Sins in his Blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5.
and we receive the Atonement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11.
And on the other hand, that Faith is imputed
for Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9, 11, 22, 24. and we
are justified by Faith, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. chap.</hi> 3. 30.
and by our words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 37. and by our
Works, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 24. and Men are called
righteous with respect to their Graces and
Actings short of Perfection; and that Christ's
judicial Proceedings are upon Mens Temper
and Behaviour, <hi>Mat. 22. 25. chap.</hi> 10. 32. and
Promises of Pardon and Life are made still
to Repentance, Faith, and Perseverance; and
the Gospel denounceth Death against impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
Ones, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 3. Infidels, <hi>Iob.</hi> 3. 36.
Disobedient, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 8. Barren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 8.
Apostates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. and Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43119:61"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 27. Nor can it be overlook'd
that Perfection is not intended in what the
Gospel-Promise is made to, nor is the Gospel
threatning of Damnation levell'd against any
Offences consistent with Sincerity. Hence I
conclude, that when God justifies a Sinner,
the Rule by which he judgeth requires a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
regard to inherent Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. By one Rule of Judgment the same
justifying Sentence, in all respects, could
not be pronounced upon Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and upon that of a believing Sinner,
unless that one Rule did either,</p>
               <p>1. Originally promise Life to <hi>perfect</hi> Legal
Obedience, and also to that which was <hi>not</hi>
a perfect Obedience to the Law: But if I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this, I must admit that the Law did not
denounce Death for the least Sin; for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
to Death for the <hi>least</hi> Sin, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
Life to <hi>imperfect</hi> Obedience, consist not:
yea, I must then consider God to enact that
Rule of Judgment as in his <hi>first</hi> relation to
innocent Man, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>Creator,</hi> governing by
virtue of his absolute Propriety in Man as his
<hi>Creature.</hi> But if God be considered only in
that relation, it was inconsistent with his
<hi>Perfections</hi> to enact a Rule of Judgment
which promised Life to any thing short of
<hi>perfect</hi> Obedience to the Law he delivered,
and which Man was originally capable to
obey. And moreover, we find in the Rule
of Judgment, by which he now justifies Men,
a direct respect to many things which that
first Law was inconsistent with, as the Death
of a Redeemer for our Sin. Faith in this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43119:62"/>
Redeemer, Pardon of Sin, and Absolution
from the Curse which condemned us as Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Or unless that one Rule of Judgment
were the <hi>Gospel-Promise of the Redeemer,</hi> viz.
<hi>He that believeth shall be saved.</hi> Hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the justifying Sentence would directly
pass upon Man as a <hi>Believer,</hi> and adjudg
him to a right in whatever the Gospel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to Believers, <hi>qua</hi> such. And considering
the chief design of the Gospel is to induce
fallen Sinners to believe upon a supposition
and assurance given that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made by our Redeemer, and not <hi>now</hi>
to be made or adjusted: Many are apt to
confine their thoughts of Justification to this
as the alone Rule of Judgment, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the final Judgment generally states
it in this manner; nor can I deny but this is
in some respects a safe as well as easy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
               <p>But I cannot agree that the justifying Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is by this Rule so abstractedly taken:
For, 1. This would too much confine the
Influence of Christ's Merits to the <hi>mere</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of the Gospel-Promise; whereas we
find it more <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> connected
with Pardon, and all other saving Benefits.
2. We must be made <hi>righteous</hi> by Christ's
Obedience in some way less remote than this.
3. The Satisfaction of Christ is not hereby
sufficiently <hi>acknowledged</hi> nor <hi>applied</hi> in our
Justification. Many other Reasons might be
given why I am convinced, that when God
ustifies a believing Sinner, the Sentence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43119:62"/>
him under some further judicial Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
than merely a Believer; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Rule of Judgment extensively
taken, required somewhat more to constitute
him a justifiable Person.</p>
               <p>§. 7. I therefore take the Rule of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be the Gospel-Law in a subordinated
Connexion with the Law of Mediation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Honour of our Creator governing us
by the Law of Works is provided for, and
the Ends of that Law fulfilled; and so the
<hi>Sentence</hi> will respect the imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>of Christ,</hi> and the Righteousness of
<hi>Faith</hi> too; the <hi>first</hi> as satisfactory and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
with our injured creating <hi>Lawgiver,</hi>
the <hi>latter</hi> as the performed Condition of the
<hi>Redeemer</hi>'s Grant of the blessed Effects of
Christ's Satisfaction and Merits; and whereby
<hi>this</hi> Man who believes is discriminated from
such who <hi>rejected</hi> the Offer of Salvation. In
the <hi>first,</hi> Justice is satisfied that a <hi>Rebel</hi> should
be absolved and glorified; in the <hi>last,</hi> the Rule
enacted by governing <hi>Grace</hi> is answered by
the Believer; so that the Judg is no more
a <hi>Respecter of Persons</hi> in <hi>applying</hi> these Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
as Redeemer, than he was regardless of
governing Justice in the Condition upon
which they were <hi>procured</hi> by our Saviour.</p>
               <p>§. 8. The <hi>Rule of Iudgment</hi> then must be
this: That the Believer (tho a Sinner) whose
Absolution, Pardon, Acceptance as righteous,
and Salvation were promised <hi>to Christ</hi> by the
governing <hi>Creator</hi> in reward of his Obedience
and Sufferings, and promised to <hi>himself</hi> for
the sake of Christ in the Gospel upon his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43119:63"/>
believing with that Faith which it appoints,
is to be absolved, pardoned, accepted as
righteous, and saved.</p>
               <p>From this Rule of Judgment is easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
that justifying Sentence on which our
State is changed, <hi>viz.</hi> Thou art that <hi>true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi>
whose Absolution, Pardon, Acceptance
as righteous, and Salvation were promised to
Christ in the <hi>Covenant of Redemption,</hi> and to
thy self personally in my <hi>Gospel;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou art <hi>adjudged</hi> absolved, pardoned,
accepted, and an Heir of Glory by virtue of
that Promise made <hi>to Christ,</hi> and the Gospel-Promise
made to <hi>thy self,</hi> and hast a Title to
plead Christ's perfect Obedience and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for thy certain enjoyment thereof, which
will also be continually pleaded by Christ
thy <hi>Advocate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner we see <hi>Constitutive</hi> Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is our being made such Believers, through
the Influence of the Spirit of Christ, as fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the foresaid Promise made to Christ in
the Covenant of Redemption, and the Gospel-Promise
made to our selves, and so are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>
to the Rule of Judgment, but yet
considered as not <hi>judicially sentenced</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it. Again, <hi>Passive Iustification</hi> is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than our Persons and State considered as
affected by that Sentence as already <hi>past</hi> upon
us, <hi>viz.</hi> absolved, pardoned, accepted as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and intitled to Glory. Finally, <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Iustification</hi> is no other than God's dealing
with us as Persons so absolved, pardoned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
and entitled to Glory, and his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi>
whatever is included in the justifying
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43119:63"/>
Sentence, yet in the way, time, manner, and
limits which the Gospel declares.</p>
               <p>§. 9. The Consideration of the <hi>Rule of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
as before explained, led me to affirm that
the Justification of a believing Sinner is <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi>
to a twofold Justification, the one at our
<hi>Creator</hi>'s Bar, the other at the <hi>Redeemer</hi>'s; the
<hi>first</hi> by the imputed Righteousness of Christ,
the <hi>other</hi> by that of Faith, which I have insisted
on in <hi>PS.</hi> to <hi>Gospel-Truth,</hi> p. 276, 279, &amp;c.
<hi>3d Edit.</hi> And being desirous to prevent Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
in this Point, which I think is probable
to prevent furious Debates concerning the
Doctrine of <hi>Iustification,</hi> I'll give a few hints
of fuller Thoughts about it, premising only
that I hoped none would think that I said
there is a <hi>twofold</hi> Justification, for I make the
Sentence to be but <hi>one,</hi> tho that includes what's
<hi>equivalent</hi> to a twofold Justification: Nor yet
that I denied Christ as of one Essence with
the Father to be <hi>Creator,</hi> or said there be two
actually <hi>existing</hi> Bars. But these are things
too low for many words.</p>
               <p>1. I consider God at our first Formation
as our <hi>Creator,</hi> governing Men by a Law su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their rational, innocent and perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
by which Law he promised Life to <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>
Obedience, and threatned Death for <hi>all</hi>
Disobedience; God considered in this relation
cannot be apprehended to enact a Gospel-Law,
with a Promise of Pardon and Life to
the <hi>imperfect,</hi> tho sincere, Faith of Sinners.</p>
               <p>2. I consider this Creator <hi>offended</hi> by Man's
Violation of his holy Law: Under this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
1. He condemns the Sinner unless <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:43119:64"/>
be made, and excludes him from Life
unless <hi>purchased</hi> by one capable of meriting it.
2. He would reject Faith and every Work
of a Sinner as <hi>satisfactory</hi> or <hi>meritorious,</hi> this
Offendor being incapable to satisfy for the
<hi>least</hi> Fault, or merit the <hi>least</hi> Blessing.</p>
               <p>3. I consider our <hi>Mediator</hi> transacting with
our <hi>offended creating Lawgiver</hi> in the Covenant
of <hi>Redemption;</hi> wherein, 1. Our governing
<hi>Creator</hi> demands of Christ, if he would save
Sinners, that in their Nature he must obey
the violated Law, and endure Death, and
what was equivalent to its threatned Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their stead. 2. He declareth that this
Obedience, and those Sufferings of this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
considering the <hi>Dignity</hi> of his Person,
should be accepted for <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for Sin and
the <hi>Merit</hi> of eternal Life, and of whatever
subserved Sinners obtaining thereof. 3. He
promiseth Christ as a <hi>Reward</hi> of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Sufferings, that whoever of fallen
Men should believe on him, should be absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
pardoned, accepted as righteous, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
glorified for the sake of what he was to
do and suffer; and that a certain number
should believe on him, and so be absolved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to <hi>his</hi> Glory, and he have all Power, Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and <hi>Iudgment</hi> committed to him. 4. Christ
our Mediator covenanteth to do and suffer
what was proposed, and accepts of the said
Rewards. 5. In due time Christ <hi>porforms</hi> his
Undertaking, and becomes entitled to the
said Rewards, and invested in a right thereto,
with respect to which <hi>he</hi> is said to be <hi>justified.</hi>
6. His Undertaking is allowed to <hi>operate</hi> as if
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43119:64"/>
performed, at least from <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Fall;</hi> and
thereby his Kingdom, and the saving Effects
of his Obedience and Death antecede his obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and dying. 7. Whatever concerned the
Sinner's Salvation, was to be <hi>founded</hi> upon the
satisfactory and meritorious Death and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ our Mediator. 8. <hi>Man</hi> is
to be considered under the <hi>first</hi> Head as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Subject in a state of Trial, according
to the Law of Works; and under the <hi>second</hi>
Head as a Sinner obnoxious to the <hi>Curse</hi> of
the Law, past Relief by his own Merit, and
yet upon Christ's Satisfaction (pursuant to
the Covenant of Redemption in this <hi>third</hi>
Head) <hi>as savable</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>Curse</hi>
of the Law.</p>
               <p>4. As an Effect of this Transaction, I do not
consider only <hi>Christ our Mediator</hi> under the
Notion of a Redeemer, as all will grant him to
be in an <hi>especial</hi> manner, because he alone <hi>paid</hi>
the redeeming Price: But I consider also the
<hi>Creator</hi> to be Redeemer as he gave his Son to be
a Saviour, accepted the Satisfaction made by
him, promised to him the foresaid Rewards;
and so far executed them as to invest him in
his Office of an <hi>accepted authorized</hi> Mediator,
admitting his Kingdom to commence (as well
as his Death to operate to saving Effects) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he actually dy'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon these and
the like accounts I apprehend the blessed God
(considered <hi>essentially,</hi> tho the <hi>Father</hi> emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
bears the Title of <hi>Creator,</hi> and sustains
the Dignity of the Divine Essence and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>proposing</hi> the Terms, and <hi>receiving</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction)
to stand towards us in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43119:65"/>
of a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who hath received Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and transacting with us in and by our
Mediator, in whom he is well pleased.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Creator</hi> being considered thus as <hi>God
in Christ,</hi> who is satisfied as to the Violations
of his Law, the Honour of his Government
vindicated, and the Ends of it secured, tho
Pardon and Life be granted to Sinners, it will
follow, that in a consistency with rectoral
<hi>Iustice,</hi> he can so far suspend the <hi>Curse</hi> of the
Law towards sinful Man, and exert his Mercy,
as, 1. To be <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>admit</hi> to Peace and
Favour all whom Christ shall present to him.
2. To be <hi>ready</hi> to forgive our Offences. 3. To
make <hi>Offers</hi> of Peace, Pardon and Salvation to
lost <hi>Sinners,</hi> begging them to be <hi>reconciled,</hi> &amp;c.
4. To return his expelled forfeited <hi>Spirit</hi> to
strive with and work on dead Sinners in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their acceptance of this offered Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
5. To be long-suffering, and waiting to
be gracious in the use of fit Methods and Means
to conquer their Resistance. These and the
like immediately ensue upon Christ's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
and if Men intend but Instances of
this kind when they say God was reconciled
to us by the Death of Christ <hi>before</hi> Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we should allow it: yet intreating them to
<hi>note,</hi> that the Curse <hi>suspended</hi> thus far, and the
Curse <hi>removed</hi> by an actual <hi>Interest</hi> in saving
Blessings, are very distinct, as be Forgiveness
<hi>with God,</hi> and Forgiveness bestowed <hi>on us;</hi>
and yet I fear many do detract from this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
<hi>viz.</hi> that there is <hi>Forgiveness with God</hi>
for guilty <hi>Sinners,</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> for undone
<hi>Apostates:</hi> this is <hi>in it self</hi> a higher thing than
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43119:65"/>
that this or that Man is <hi>Partaker</hi> of it, tho our
personal Advantage consisteth in the latter.</p>
               <p>5. I consider God in Christ <hi>Redeemer, making</hi>
his offers of Salvation to Sinners, and stating the
<hi>Conditions</hi> upon which he will give the merited Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and eternal Life personally <hi>to them,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their acceptance, with a <hi>Promise</hi> of applying
Christ's Satisfaction in those Effects upon their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
and <hi>denouncing</hi> their abiding under Guilt
and Misery, with <hi>sorer</hi> Punishments if they finally
refuse. This is by the Gospel: To explicate which,
<hi>Note,</hi> 1. Compliance is injoined by a <hi>governing</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
tho with a display of <hi>Grace;</hi> it supposeth
Christ's <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Offering over, and is an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Government resulting from a <hi>Dominion</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
as Redeemer; and therefore may well be
called <hi>a Law,</hi> yea, and that by which he will <hi>judg</hi>
us. 2. The Historical <hi>Account</hi> of Christ's Offices,
Fulness, Love, Death, and of Man's Misery; the
Displays of Covenant-<hi>Benefits</hi> present and eternal,
Revelations of Divine Truths and Mysteries, Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Institutions,
and Directions whence to derive
Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all to <hi>subserve</hi> our due acceptance
of this Offer. 3. If Christ had not <hi>proclaimed</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and Life to Sinners, we had not known that
these were to be obtained by <hi>any</hi> of us. If he had
not declared that he gave Pardon and Life to such
as <hi>have Faith,</hi> and <hi>none else,</hi> we had not been certain
whether it were the Believer or Unbeliever were
pardoned: If he had not told us he gave Faith and
<hi>then</hi> Pardon, there had been no known <hi>Order</hi> of
these Gifts: If by his Gospel God had not <hi>offered</hi>
Pardon to all <hi>if</hi> they would accept it, <hi>commanding</hi>
their acceptance in <hi>order</hi> to it, <hi>promising</hi> it upon their
acceptance, and <hi>determining</hi> to judg Men as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
or refused, then there had been <hi>only an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
in giving Faith and then Pardon, but Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been no <hi>Condition</hi> nor <hi>Righteousness,</hi> nor had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43119:66"/>
Man been <hi>justifiable</hi> by it, or <hi>condemnable</hi> to the want
of Pardon for rejecting it. 4. Acceptance of offered
Salvation, tho a Righteousness supposeth a <hi>meritng</hi>
Righteousness of Christ, and can be no higher a
Righteousness than a <hi>performed</hi> Condition of a Law
of <hi>Grace,</hi> by which Benefits already impetrated are
given: Which Law differs not from a <hi>Deed of Gift,</hi>
but that the Donor expresseth a <hi>governing</hi> Authority
in the method of applying these Blessings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to <hi>judg</hi> them to whom that Offer is made, by
their acceptance or nonacceptance. 5. Our <hi>Right</hi>
adjudged upon our acceptation is a Right <hi>of Grace</hi>
and Mercy, and tho infallible, it can infer no Claim
<hi>of Debt.</hi> 6. This Acceptation is <hi>described</hi> by the
Gospel, and nothing is an Acceptation upon which
we shall <hi>receive</hi> the offered Blessings, if it be not in
its Principle, Nature, Extent, Operativeness and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>such</hi> an Acceptation as the <hi>Gospel</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
its saving Benefits to. 6. Tho this <hi>Acceptation</hi>
merit nothing, yet Christ's Righteousness being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to merit Salvation for such as <hi>shall accept</hi> of
it, and this Acceptance being the Gospel-ordained
<hi>Condition</hi> of our personal Interest in that merited
Salvation, we can be saved without neither of them.
7. To prevent Mistakes I add, the <hi>Elect</hi> shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
be brought <hi>savingly</hi> to accept of this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>6. I consider God <hi>applying</hi> Pardon, Peace, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Men that have <hi>accepted</hi> of this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
according to the Gospel-offer. 1. He acts here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as a <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. The Relations he stands in are as
<hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Redeemer;</hi> the first ceaseth not, tho
the other is superadded. 3. The <hi>Cause</hi> is adjusted
by the <hi>Rule</hi> of Judgment described in §. 8. and
this Cause <hi>partly</hi> refers to what satisfied the offended
Creator for this Sinner's <hi>Fault,</hi> and merited Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for this <hi>forfeiting</hi> Rebel. Here Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is the only <hi>justifying</hi> Righteousness, Faith
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43119:66"/>
hath no place in God's regard, who as <hi>Creator</hi>
judgeth in this matter. The Cause is <hi>partly</hi> also: Is
this a true <hi>Accepter</hi> of Salvation, <hi>for whom</hi> Pardon,
Peace and Glory were promised in the Covenant of
Redemption <hi>to Christ</hi> in reward of his satisfying,
meriting Death and Obedience, and <hi>to whom</hi> these
were promised in the <hi>Gospel?</hi> Here Acceptation is a
<hi>Righteousness,</hi> the want whereof Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is not appointed to supply; and the adjudging
a Man a Believer, intitled to Pardon, Peace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
upon the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ, I call Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
active, or the Judg's justifying Sentence.</p>
               <p>7. I call it a Justification at the Creator's and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer'S
Bar; at the <hi>Creator's Bar,</hi> as far as the
Sentence refers to what <hi>vindicated</hi> the Honour of
God's violated Law, <hi>secured</hi> his governing Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as our Maker, and <hi>merited</hi> the Blessings, before
which there was no Pardon, Peace, or Glory for
the <hi>Sinner,</hi> tho a Believer, none to be <hi>offered,</hi> none
to be had by accepting. Nor is it a needless thing
that the justifying Sentence have an express regard
to what that refers to, <hi>viz. Christ's Righteousness:</hi>
for as it was the alone <hi>Condition</hi> of Christ's Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of Pardon, Peace and Life for Sinners, so
when these are to be adjudged to the Sinner, the
<hi>Honour</hi> of the Creator, of the violated Law, and
of Christ's Satisfaction, is wisely provided for by an
express acknowledgment of, and reference to <hi>that
Righteousness.</hi> I call it a Justification at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's
Bar,</hi> as far as the Sentence refers to our
Acceptation, or <hi>Faith as a Righteousness;</hi> for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
<hi>Creator,</hi> who governeth and judgeth by the
<hi>Law of Works,</hi> could make no <hi>Offers</hi> of Pardon and
Glory to Sinners, if they would accept, nor admit
Faith to be a Righteousness; and yet considered as
a <hi>Redeemer</hi> (as God was, when he had received Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction)
he could not again demand a satisfying, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
Righteousness to acquit the Believer now
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43119:67"/>
upon; no nor, unless under the Notion of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
require Faith as a <hi>proper Condition</hi> of
Pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
it was promised to Christ for Sinners
as meerly <hi>described</hi> by Faith. But God in Christ
as <hi>Redeemer</hi> could make the Gospel-offer of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
upon condition of Acceptation, injoyning
that acceptance, and promising thereto the Pardon
impetrated by Christ; and so that <hi>Acceptation</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to in the justifying Sentence of God in Christ
<hi>as</hi> Redeemer, as what discriminates one Man who
obtains the Pardon, according to the Gospel-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
from him who is judicially debarred of it.</p>
               <p>8. I think they who are altogether for Faith as
the only imputed Righteousness in Justification, do
too much contract the justifying Sentence by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
that distinct Respect which ought to be to
the Satisfaction and meriting Obedience of Christ,
whereby God as our governing Creator can admit
the Absolution of a Sinner. And they who are
altogether for the Righteousness of Christ as only
imputed in Justification, do also too much limit
the justifying Sentence, by excluding the Gospel-Righteousness
of Faith which the Redeemer regards,
and by which he judicially discriminates who among
them, to whom Salvation was offered, shall obtain it,
and who of them shall not obtain it. May these
Hints contribute to an Agreement between these
worthy Persons, at least encline all to Christian
Forbearance, I shall reckon it worth all my Labour
and Sufferings. O that the God of Peace would
give us Peace by any <hi>just</hi> means!</p>
