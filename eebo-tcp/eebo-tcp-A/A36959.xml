            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Particular favour your Lordship has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pleas'd to bestow on my Genius and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and not only on mine, but on Poetry in general, which has still appear'd by your good-natur'd Condescension, and Readiness to assist the Stage against its Enemy's Injustice, has engag'd me not only to give your Lordship my grateful thanks, but to beg leave to dedicate my last off spring to your service; in hopes it will be so happy to make an hour pass plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly in the Country, at a time when your Lordship has a little leisure to retire from your Affairs at Court.</p>
            <p>As I doubt not but your Lordship has been Entertain'd with the baiting of the Poets, by a late horrible Severe and Rigid Critick, so I also hope, that now, or very sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you will be diverted with the aforesaid Critick's being exercis'd by the Poets. That Performer, by those who are taken with Glosses more than Realities, has had a
<pb facs="tcp:49118:3"/>
mighty Cry of his side; but, as one mans Tale may not always be so good as 'tis thought when anothers comes to be heard, so it may happen that his ill-manner'd Remarks upon me may give occasion for as good a Scene to please your Lordship, in an Answer of my Writing, as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Lampoon did of his.</p>
            <p>My Lord, 'tis fit that I inform your Lordship that I would not have presum'd to have troubled you with this Dedication, had not the following sheets been Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd by men of the first rate understandings in <hi>England,</hi> whose Commendation made me think 'em consequently fit for your perusal. Besides, having been for many years so happy to know that your Lordship is of a Judgment so Clear, a Temper so Generous and Just, and a Humour so Charmingly obliging, that a Poet is not only Honour'd and Caress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, but his Labour from Injustice and Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Malice nobly indulg'd and defended.</p>
            <p>'Tis certainly therefore proper, that to such a Patron a soaring Muse shou'd be entirely devoted: The Poet's Song has always the greatest Influence when the Theme improves the Harmony: And your Lordship's Character is of such Efficacy with me, that whenever I am Inspir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with it, which I hope I shall often be, as well as now, I am very well assur'd, my Auditory, when they shall hear me sing on that subject, will never imagine the time lost or ill spent, or me out of Tune.</p>
            <p>But to avoid Prolixity on a subject, which I know is ungrateful to your Lordships Admirable Temper, (I mean Praise) I will unwillingly leave off here, and only beg to be rank'd amongst those many that have a true sense of your valu'd qualities. And if the following Piece diverts, as I hope it will, and gains that favourable reception, which your Indulgence, Affability and Good Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, through all your Actions, to all those who are so happy to be concern'd with you, it will be a surprizing satisfaction to,</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Must necessarily inform the Partial, as well as Impartial Reader, that I had once design'd another kind of Preface to my Comedy than what will appear in the following sheets; but having in the interim been entertain'd with a Book lately Printed, full of Abuses on all our Antient as well as Modern Poets, call'd <hi>A view of the Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Prophaness of the</hi> English <hi>Stage</hi>; and finding the Author, who, no doubt, extreamly values himself upon his Talent of <hi>Stage-reforming,</hi> not only (to use his own Ironical words) <hi>particular in his Genius and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,</hi> but indecently, unmanner'd, and scurrilous in his unjust Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on me,<note place="margin">Collier, p. 196.</note> and two of my Plays, <hi>viz.</hi> the first and second parts of the <hi>Comical History of</hi> Don Quixote. I thought I cou'd not do better, first as a Diversion to the Town, and next to do a little Justice to my self, than (instead of the other) to print a short Answer to this very Severe and Critical Gentleman; and at the same time give him occasion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seant upon the following Comick Papers, and my self the opportunity of vindicating the other; with some familiar Returns (<hi>on Raillere</hi>) upon his own Extraordinary <hi>Integrity,</hi> and Justness of the <hi>Censure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But first, lest I should plunge my self out of my depth, or like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Swimmer, endanger my self by a too precipitate Rashness, let me warily consider the Office and Habit of this unchristianlike Critick before I Attack him: He has, or had the honour to wear the Robe of a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> A Church, which for its Purity, Principles, and most Incomparable Doctrines, surpasses without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection all others in the world, which with a number of its pious, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and learned Rulers and Ministers, I admire and acknowledge with all the faculties of my soul, heart and understanding; and on which I never seriously reflect, but I feel a secret shame for my remissness of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and my neglect, in not living hitherto up to its Admirable Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. This reflection would indeed have been enough to awe any one in my circumstances from proceeding to answer his bold Censures, had I not Courage to consider that the rest of the worthy Gentlemen of that Robe are so good, that they will not excuse or defend our aforesaid Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick's Injustice or Mistakes in some places, tho they are pleas'd with his Truths in others; or be angry at me for endeavouring to gain their good opinion, by defending my self from most of his black Aspersions (how fair soever as yet they seem) and by unfolding him be judg'd by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial reason, start a question, whither he, tho a happy member of the aforesaid Adorable Church, does not come in for his share of <hi>Immorality,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49118:6"/>
and other frailties; and consequently is not as fit to be detected, by the Wit of a Satyrical Poet, as the Poet by the positive Authority of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Malecontent, tho in the garb of an humble Churchman.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fates,</hi> or Poets in antient times were held in special veneration, even their Kings, and other chief Rulers, often submitted to the virtue of their Inspiration: Amongst which, the never enough admir'd Mr <hi>Cowley,</hi> in his noble version of the <hi>Davideidos,</hi> gives the <hi>Royal David</hi> this Title, <hi>Rex olin &amp; Vates duo Maxima munera Coeli</hi>; and numbers of others might be inserted to prove Poetical Authority, and the respect it bore in past Ages; which, tho I have not capacity to parallel, I hope I may be allow'd to imitate on another subject; and in this have leave to acquit my self of several heinous Accusations, which this Tyrannical Critick has Impos'd upon me.</p>
            <p>I am not at all Ignorant of his eminent parts, Learning, and other qualifications; nor am I insensible, as well as the rest of his Readers, that his Book has a very fair and engaging Title-page, and is no less Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iustrated with many weighty and just censures upon the <hi>Immorality of the Stage,</hi> and our licentious Writings for many years past; and tho this has been proved by the late Ingenious Author of <hi>the Vindication of the Stage</hi> to be occasion'd by the vices of the Times, and not those of the Poets; yet thus far we can endure the Scourge, and kiss his Rod with patience enough: And for my own part, I declare if I had found his Severity had been moral, and had ended in the good design of cleansing the Stage from its Impurities, and had been only a kind Instruction to my Brethren and my self, to reform our Immoral errors, I had, as the rest of us, with all humility imaginable, thank'd him for his wit and good reproof; and had been so far from answering in this manner, that I should have been proud to have my name before his Book, with a Copy of Verses in' applause of his Admirable Design. But when, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of this, I find he strikes at the root of our Dramatick Labours, and the Town's diversion, for some sly and selfish ends; and instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving us with a Pastorly Mildness, Charity and Good Nature, gives us the basest language, and with the most scurillous expressions, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times raging and even foaming at mouth, taxing the little liberty has always been us'd, with horrid horrid Blasphemy, Prophaneness, and Damnable Impiety; when Reason must inform every one we intend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the matter, besides the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or priviledge of <hi>Poetica Licentiae:</hi> and pretending to prove this with false Quotations, unnatural Mistakes, and Hypocritical Hypotheses, I reselv'd to controvert him, and endeavour to prove that 'tis meerly his malice that has abus'd me and the rest, without Reason or Provocation; and that his own Wit and Morals are not so Infallible, but they lye also open to the censure of any Poetical Critick, who has Courage and Sense enough to attack em.</p>
            <p>I once more therefore address my self to the Reverend of the Gown, from highest to the lowest, and humbly desire that they will not appear Interested against me, because I defend myself against one that has abus'd me, and has the honour to wear one, (to what purpose the Judgment and Clemency of our Government knows best) I assure 'em my design is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to turn, like the Worm that is trod upon, complain being hurt, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my self from abusive malice, and at the same time am heartily sorry that ever I had the occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49118:6"/>'Tis a pleasure to me however to know that I have for many years, as well as now, the honour of the Conversation of several eminent men of the Church; and I dare say, upon occasion I could easily gain their good words to prove my good behaviour. I do declare I never abus'd the sacred order in my life, but have always had, and still have, all the veneration for 'em that's possible; nor have any of my printed Writings contradicted this, unless when spoken in the person of Atheists, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and Ignorants, where tis natural in Comedy; nay, in my Book of Poems you will find a <hi>Satyr against Atheists,</hi> and in another Book, call'd <hi>Colin</hi>'s <hi>walk thro London and Westminster,</hi> a Moral through the whole, and design'd in the honour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to shew the stubbornness of <hi>Romanists,</hi> Grumblers, and other dissenting Sects; but this my partial Antagonist never read, nor heard of; nay, tho by his Book we may suppose he has read a thousand, yet amongst twenty of my Comedies Acted and Printed, he never heard of the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alist,</hi> the <hi>Boarding School,</hi> the <hi>Marriage Hater Match'd,</hi> the <hi>Richmond Heiress,</hi> the <hi>Virtuous Wife,</hi> and others, all whose whole Plots and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs I dare affirm, tend to that principall instance, which he proposes, and which we allow, <hi>viz.</hi> the depression of Vice and encouragement of Virtue. Not he, he has not had leisure since his last <hi>holding forth in the late Reign,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collier, p.</note> to do me this Justice, 'tis enough for him that he has encounter'd <hi>Don Quixot</hi>: And truly, I must own, was a most proper Combatant for him; for if he had not been mad with the Wind-mill that was in his pate, or had ever perus'd that <hi>Giant</hi> of an Author, upon whom I am the <hi>Pigmy,</hi> as he wittily observes, he would have found the Bockheaded Chaplain had been greazing his old Gassock there long before I new rigg'd him: But that's all one, I, poor I, must be denounc'd as Criminal; I brought him upon the Stage, I wash'd his Face, put on a new Crape Vest, and a clean Band, which, eh, fatal accident, made him look so like somebody, that I, in his opinion, and condemn'd by his infallibility, have been no body ever since, <hi>vox &amp; praeterce nihil.</hi> Well, however this is determin'd, let me beg of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Readers, to give me leave to try what I can be, I have had good fortune I am told by others in Lyrical Verse, which I am sure is one principal part of Poetry, I'll see now if I can match my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist in Rallying Prose. Several ingenious Authors have already, I think, so well confuted his Assertions against the Stage, by proofs from the Antient Poets, the Primitive Fathers, and their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they have far excell'd what I can pretend to do there; only, I could have wish'd one who is best able, and whose admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Genius and Skill in Poetry would have been remarkably service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, had drawn his Pen to defend the Rights of the Stage, tho he had own'd the loosenesses of it, and had ventured the being presented for it; but since we, the forlorn, are not so happy to have that Aid, let my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist, the Reformer, who, for all the gravity in some part of his Book, and the solid Piety he would insinuate in his Arguments, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be a Joker, and as full of Puns, Conundrums, Quibbles, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginquipetites, and Tipiti-witchets, as the rest of us mortals, be pleas'd to take the length of my Weapon at that sport, for now I cannot help telling my Audience, which is the Town, that he has laid his reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Now that such a Person should set up for a Protestant Example, and a Teacher of Morality, is somewhat new, for upon my veracity, this Gentleman may insinuate as he pleases, that our Church, and its Doctrines govern his heart; but as to that matter, what may be in his heart I can't tell, but if a Pope is not crept into his belly, very near it, I am very much mistaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> indeed, in his Natural History, <hi>Lib.</hi> 28. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. tells ye, He that is bitten by a Scorpion may have relief, if immediately he go and whisper his grief into the Ear of an Ass. This Historian, perhaps, had so great credit with these Malefactors, that they thought the remedy, by Auricular Confession, might serve too in their Concerns. But we are confirm'd, they were enough mistaken in the rest of their Opinions, and so 'tis very likely were in this. If this Parallel be found a little gross, I hope the Reader will excuse it, when he examines the bold Critick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But before we inspect further, or touch upon the Moralist's Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for I dare ingage it is not altogether impossible to prove, the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piteer</hi> may be tainted a little as well as the <hi>Poetaster,</hi> let us see whether we can find him guilty of the first Charge against us, which is <hi>Immodesty</hi>; and upon this subject indeed, if our Learn'd Reformer did not impose upon us with a Fallacy, I should (to shew my good Nature walk hand in hand with my resentment) once more admire him for his Character of Modesty in the 11th page of his Book, which is, to do him Justice, very fine; but then he only tells us of one kind of Modesty, when he knows there are two, and therein he is Falacious, in not exposing the other, which is decency of Speech and Behaviour; and truly, meerly, I believe, through a conscious reflection of his own frequent miscarriages in that case. If therefore, these Papers differ a little from that Civi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For, in the first place, he does not shew his own, nor, indeed, any part of decent modesty, in exposing any Gentlemans Name in print, when the subject matter is Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49118:8"/>And yet, as to his own humour, we find it to be, by his Book, more sickle than even the Wind, or Feminine frailty in its highest Inconstancy. One while he's for Instructing our Stage, Modelling our Plays, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Drama, the Unity, Time and Place, and acts as very a Poet as ever writ an ill Play, or slept at an ill Sermon; and then, presently after, wheiw, in the twinkling of an Ejaculution, as Parsen <hi>Say-grace</hi> has it, he's summoning together a Convocation of old Fathers, to prove the Stage in past Ages exploded, and all Plays horrible, abominable Debauchers of Youth, and not to be encourag'd in a Civil Government. VVhat can we think of this, especially when I find him in this Paragraph of his Book <note n="*" place="margin">Collier, <hi>p.</hi> 261.</note> raving on at this rate, and quoting to us, That St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or the Author <hi>de Spectaculis,</hi> argues thus against those who thought the Play-House no unlawful diversion; 'tis too tedious to recite all, but enough of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> for my purpose runs thus: <hi>What business has a Christian at such Places as those? A Christian who has not the liberty so much as to think of an ill thing, why does he entertain himself with lewd Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations? Has he a mind to discharge his Modesty, and be flush'd for the Practice? Yes, this is the consequence, by using to see these things, he'll learn to do them; what need I mention the Levities and Impertinencies in Comedies, or the Ranting distractions of Tragedy, were these things unconcern'd with Idolatry, Christians ought not to be at them, for were they not highly Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lery of them is Egregious, and unbecoming the gravity of Believers</hi> And then again, before he is out of breath, <hi>A Christian has much better Sights than these to look at, he has solid Satisfactions in his power, which will please and improve him at the same time. Would a Christian be agreeably refresh'd, let him read the Scriptures, here the Entertainment will suit his Character, and be big enough for his quality. Ah, Beloved, how noble, how moving, how profitable a thing is it, to be thus employ'd, to have our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations always in prospect, and be intent on the glories of Heaven:</hi> Very good, and who is he so reprobated, that will not allow this to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, and admirable good Counsel? But now let us see how the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solver,</hi> for all Pious quotation, has follow'd St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Advice; that holy Father charges him not to entertain himself with such lewd things as Plays, and he very dutifully reads a thousand as fast as he can; nay, scans and weighs 'em, and, no doubt, not without tickling satisfaction, at the present, for all his Saturnine Remarks at last. Now if his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this is, That it belongs to his Office, as a Church-man, and that he could not reprehend the Vices in 'em without reading the Books themselves, I must tell him, That St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> nor the rest of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did not allow that, neither do we find they did it themselves, for all their inveighing against the Stage; so that he makes his own Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion altogether invalid, <hi>He not being to do ill that good might come of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, why may not a Poet now, who, perhaps, is a greater. Votary to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in other Matters than the <hi>Absolver</hi> is in this, rally him thus, and turn his Quotation upon himself, Phrase by Phrase?

What need I mention the Sham-Oaths, and looseness of Farce, or the Fustian raving against the Gods in Tragedy, were these things really unconcern'd with Idolatry, a Parson, of all Mankind, should not be known to ogle them, for were they not highly Criminal, the foolery of them is Egregious, and unbecoming the gravity of all that thump the Cushion, or intend to thump a true Belief into the Pates of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible Congregation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And now methinks I see the Spiritual Critick, with a certain fallow Male-contented Phiz, poring upon this Page, and sucking his Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger, gives himself an unpleasurable minute to Judge whether I have paraphras'd right or no; well, all's one, fall back fall edge, I'm resolv'd to ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>A Parson has, or should have, much better Books than Plays to look in; he has many Authors of Pious and Solid Authorities to please, and improve himself with, at the same time. Would a Parson be agreeably refresh'd, let him read the Scriptures, let him find out Treatises of Morality, Meekness, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and holy Life, there the Entertainment will suit his Character. Ah, Beloved, how noble, how moving, how profitable a pleasure would it be to us, to see a Parson thus employ'd, to let the Stage's diversions be too little for his grave Consideration, and be intent himself on the glories of Heaven!</q> And here now, I do not at all question but the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solver,</hi> a little nettled at this last Parallel, will fall to biting of his fingers again, his Righteous Spirit being offended at my Insolence, in scribling the Word <hi>Parson</hi> so oft, it being a Nickname, and only invented by some idle fellow, who resolv'd to use the Order with no more respect. Why truly, I confess, in this Case, Modesty is a little gravell'd, but then she may thank him for it, for he has dignify'd the Poets with so many <hi>Hell-defying, deep-mouth'd Swearing, Relapsing, Witch-riding Titles,</hi> that the worthy Ministry cannot reasonably be angry, especially when the Word is only meant to him, whom I shall prove has lessen'd the true Title, by his <hi>Immorality</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> more than ever the Poets did the Reputation of the Stage, by their Time-serving Loosenesses and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Diversions.</p>
            <p>It is, no doubt, a considerable Maim to us, in some Peoples opinions, who never digested the benefits arising from the Stage in its Moral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations, that this smarting Lath is given us by a Clergy-man of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that is, good friends, if he be so, for some Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heads are not resolv'd in that Affirmative—but let that be <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss'd</hi> in another place, I'm sure, if he is, <hi>Obedience to Government, in the first place, should be his principal Tenet</hi>; and whether that is a part of the <hi>Absolver</hi>'s Character, I think has sufficiently appear'd.

Here was a pretty Compliment to our Art now, a good Moral with good Manners into the bargain; and yet 'tis certain the times then were as Licentious as now, and the Poets took as little care of their Writings; but Mr <hi>Randolph</hi> always made his good Nature agree with his Wit, and put as favourable construction upon Scenes of Diversion, as reason would allow, tho he perhaps had as much occasion for 50 <hi>l.</hi> as the Absolver when he writ his Book. He knew that if there was so stupid a Temper, that the Moral of a Play could not reform, the looseness that was in it could not prejudice; nor if a wild Town-fellow, or a baffl'd Bully, or passionate Lover, being characters in a Play, spoke some extravagances proper for 'em, would he roar it out for Balsphemy, Profaneness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and make a malicious scrutiny, and unreasonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of words, which had no other intention but to make the Character natural by customary manner of Speech, as he has shewn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples by two of his own, in the extremes of Vain-glory and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie: And yet this Gentleman was as Learned, as good a Critick, and as Consciencious a man, as our Absolver can pretend to be; and if I say,' had somewhat a better Title to Modesty and good Manners, I think it may be made out, he having a civil regard to the Poets, defended their Cause, and excus'd some failings for the sake of some other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, when this treats 'em all like fools, tho he has only rak'd up a few of their errors, which he has made a huge heap of Rubbish, by peering through his own Magnifying Glass, without any allowance to their qualifications, or any modest care to do 'em justice, which ought to have been one way as well as another.</p>
            <p>So much then for his <hi>Modesty</hi> in one of its kinds, which is decency of behaviour and expression; as for the other, he has plaid such a Game at Hide and Seek with us, that we have been long in a Mist, not knowing how to discover it: But the Air clears, and tis time for us now to take the right end of the perspective, tho he would give us
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49118:9"/>
the Wrong, and then try if we cannot discern, in the midst of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Divinity, a near friend of his call'd Immorality, tho he would subtly insinuate him into the world as a stranger, leading his darling daughter dear Hypocrisie into an Arbor; where, after they had been some time alone, our Critick knowing how to be civil to his own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to give 'em time enough to beget a right understanding, he is very glad at last to be a third in the company.</p>
            <p>I should not have put him upon this warm Office, if I had not found him too hot and bold with our Famous Antient Truth-telling Poet <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> when in his Book he tells us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Collier,</hi> p. 70, 71.</note> 
               <hi>he teaches those vices he would correct, and writes more like a Pimp than a Poet</hi>—But upon just consideration, I believe if the Absolver taught the Art of Rebellion no more than <hi>Iuvenal</hi> the Art of Pimping, the one would be respected in after Ages, as much as we know the other has in the former: But every one is Fool or Knave that is not of this Gentlemans kidney. A little while after, at the usual rate of his own accustom'd civility, he falls upon the <hi>Renown'd Shakespear,</hi> and says,<note place="margin">Collier, p. 50.</note> he is so guilty, that he is not fit to make an Evidence. Why now if'twere possible for his Complexion to blush, there's ne're a Robe of any Friend Cardinal the Absolver has at <hi>Rome,</hi> that can be redder than his would be for such a Position: Nor does it end here, but is mixt with some more foolish and insolent Remarks in another place, upon the admirable Tragedy of <hi>Hamlet.</hi> And here he has no other way to shew his malice, but by ridiculously quibbling upon the prettiest Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in it,<note place="margin">Collier, p. 10.</note> the innocent young Virgin <hi>Ophelia,</hi> who, because the Poet makes her run mad for the death of her Father, and loss of her Lover, and consequently makes her sing and speak some idle extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant things, as on such an occasion is natural, and at last drown her self, he very masterly tells us, the Poet, <hi>since he was resolv'd to drown her like a Kitten, should have set her a swimming a little sooner; to keep her alive, only to sully her Reputation, is very cruel.</hi> Yes, but I would fain ask Doctor Absolution in what she has sullied her Reputation, I am sure five hundred Audiences that have view'd her could never find it out, tho he has; but the Absolver can't help being positive and partial to his own humour, tho he were to be hang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is not enough to prove a Man is a Moralist, only because he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a Regular Life; that may be one good instance indeed, but it can never arrive to a proof of the whole, for his living Soberly, and by Rule, may as well be caus'd by the defect of his Constitution, as by the effect of his Inclination, but 'tis the Spirit and Will, by the fire of whose other Virtues, this of Morality is kindled and illustrated.

To detect us indeed fairly, and prove it upon us, would deserve severe Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but if it be mistake, and our reputations are injur'd by Rashness and Injustice, or Ignorance, reflection upon it is at least reasonable, and just reproof I think not improper.

Here on one side the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is obliged by Bond, to give me three thousand pounds for my assistance, and this I keep her ignorant of. On t'other side she's for having an Heir, forsooth, and hooking it in that way; nay, is so ravenously greedy of it, that she plagues me almost to death. <hi>Tomas,</hi> she crys every night, remember the Estate <hi>Tomas,</hi> think on two thousand pound a year <hi>Tomas,</hi> tho she be so fat, and so incapable of Childing, that an <hi>Irish man</hi> may as soon get a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling out of a Bog; and all the Doctors in Town have declar'd nothing can swell her bigger than she is, but a Tympany. <hi>Ecce signum,</hi> here she comes.

                     <p>'Tis an undecent humour, and were I to converse much with the Prince, I would argue him out of it. There is one of your Country Proverbs, which I remember, very pertinent to this purpose, which is, Play with a fool at home, and he'll play with you in the Market place. I think it wants no application: Not but I can wink at his folly my self now, having some present business with him—Dost hear, fellow?
