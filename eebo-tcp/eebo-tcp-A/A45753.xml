         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y whileſome Father who had no help but from experience and his own
nature, yet of an unſpotted judgment hath heretofore told me, that
he much deſired to bring in this cuſtome, which is, that in all Cities
there ſhould be a certain Appointed Place, to which whoſoever ſhould
have need of any thing might come, and cauſe his buſines to be Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
by ſome Officer appointed for that purpoſe. As for example, if
one have Pearls to ſel, he ſhould ſay, I ſeek to ſell ſome Pearls; another I ſeek to buy ſome
Pearls: ſuch a man would fain have Company to travell to <hi>Paris:</hi> Such a one enquireth
for a Servant of this or that quality: Such a one ſeeketh for a Maſter, another a workman,
ſome this ſome that every one as he needed. And it ſeemeth that this means of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning
one another: would bring no ſmall Commodity unto Common Commerce and
Society. For there are ever conditions that enter-ſeek one another, and becauſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
not one another, they leave men in great neceſſity. I underſtand to the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
reproach of our Age, that even in out ſight two moſt excellent men in knowledge
have miſerably periſhed for want of food and other neceſſaries, <hi>Lilius Gregorius Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtianus Caſtalio</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> And I verily believe there are many
thouſands, who had they known or underſtood their wants, would either have ſent for
them, and with large ſtipends have entertained them, or would have conveighed them
ſuccour where ever they had been. The world is not ſo generally corrupted, but I know
ſome that would earneſtly wiſh, and with hearty affections deſire the goods which their
fore-fathers have left them, might ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe God they may enjoy them, be
employed for the relief of rare, and ſupply of excellent mens neceſſities, and ſuch as for
any kind of worth and vertue are remarkable, many of which are daily ſeen to be purſued
by poverty even to the utmoſt extremity, and that would take ſuch order for them as had
they not their eaſe and content it might only be imputed to their want of reaſon, or lack
of diſcretion.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we fell into theſe laſt fears and troubles, a
Brief Diſcourſe was preſented unto the High
and Honourable Houſes of Parliament; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Means to accompliſh the Work of
our Reformation: tending to ſhew that by an
Office of Publick Addreſſe in Spirituall and Temporall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
the Glory of God, and the Happineſſe of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be highly advanced.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe hath fully approved it ſelf unto the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all thoſe that have ſeen it hitherto, and hopefully
it would have wrought ſome effect upon thoſe that mannage
the Affairs of this State, if the Danger of this laſt Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
had not employed all their ſtrength and Attention, to
ſave us from ſudden Shipwrack. Nor is the Sea yet quieted
after ſo great a ſtorme: but the fears and expectations of
what will follow do keep the minds of moſt men in ſuſpenſe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65541:3"/>
till they ſee a ſafe Harbour, that is, what the way of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſettlement will be.</p>
            <p>And truly this Conſideration might alſo ſuſpend our
thoughts and ſolicitations in this matter; if we would look
onely to the outward Appearance of Affairs, and make Our
ſelves as many do by their Conjectures fearfull.<note place="margin">Ecel. 11. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>2, 4.</note> For <hi>He that
obſerveth the winde ſhall not ſowe; and he that regardeth the Clouds
ſhall not reap:</hi> But we have learned to caſt our bread upon
the waters, in hope that we may finde it after many dayes:
and we are willing to give a portion unto ſeven, and alſo
to eight, becauſe we know not what evill ſhall be upon the
Earth. So then, even that which maketh others leſſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of the Publick, doth increaſe our care for it. For moſt
men will not intend any Publick Ayme till they can ſecure
their own Intereſts, and ſee a way to get advantage by that
which they call the Publick: but we ſhall never ayme at
this; our delight ſhall be, that all may be advantaged, and
the Publick Intereſt of the Common-wealth ſetled, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it ſhould be to our coſt and diſadvantage: For we
know the promiſe, that if we faint not, and become not
wearie in well-doing, we ſhall reap in due time the fruit of
righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore upon the grounds laid in the former Diſcourſe,
we ſhall endeavour now to proceed to offer ſome Particulars;
which perhaps will take more with thoſe men, then that
which we ayme at principally. For our ayme is mainly to
lay the grounds of that Reformation in this change of our
Affairs, which may reach the ſpirits of Men to affect them
with a Goſpel-frame: But if we therein cannot come neer
them immediately; yet we ſhall endeavour to come as neer
as we may by the things whereof they are capable; becauſe
we are reſolved rather to venture the looſing of our Labour,
then to ſit ſtill; and not give our ſelves this ſatisfaction that
we have diſcharged a good Conſcience in performing our
Dutie.</p>
            <p>We ſhall declare then with that ſimplicitie, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65541:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a good conſcience in the preſence of God, that our
deſire is to ſerve all men freely in the Publick Intereſt ſo farre
as God doth inable us; and that by this Deſigne we Aime at
a ſpeciall Advantage to the Goſpel of Chriſt rather then at
any thing elſe; and if we can but awake thoſe, that are in
Places of Power and Authoritie; to take notice of the Means,
whereby all Mens talents may become uſefull to each other,
in this Common-wealth; that for their own Temporall
Ends, they would countenance, and promote the ſame; we
ſhall have our End at this time in this undertaking.</p>
            <p>Therefore now we make our application as to all indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
that love the proſperity of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the wellfare of
this State; ſo more particularly to thoſe whom God hath
appointed to be our Leaders in every good work, and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers
of thoſe that apply themſelves thereunto, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they lay the matter to heart or no, they may not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a witnes before God and the world, that this is a duty
belonging to their charge; which without any charge, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or difficulty may be moſt eaſily brought to paſſe, by a
few words in the way of Order, to Authorize the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of ſuch an Office, for the unſpeakable Benefit of all, and
without the leaſt imaginable Inconveniencie unto any.</p>
            <p>And that the thing it ſelf, may manifeſt the truth of this,
We ſhall come to a more particular Diſcoverie of the Office
in the matters of Temporall Accommodation; which unto
the men of this world are ſenſible Inducements towards all
Enterpriſes.</p>
            <p>Let us then conſider, What it is that maketh a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and all thoſe that are in it, happy, as to the Life of
Nature. The chief End of Common-wealths is Society, the
End of Society is Mutuall Help, and the End and Uſe of
Help is to enjoy from one another Comforts, that is, every
thing lawfully deſirable or wanting to our contentation.
Whereſoever then, in a Common-wealth ſuch a Conſtitution
may be had; whereby the Members thereof may be inabled
to enjoy from each other all the Helps which Nature doth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65541:4"/>
afford unto them for their Mutuall Contentation, there the
State and all thoſe that are in it may be ſaid to be as happie
as this world can make them.</p>
            <p>For no man can be more happie in Nature, then to have
all his lawfull deſires ſupplied ſo farre as they are attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
But in this Common-wealth ſuch a Conſtitution may
be had, and that eaſily, which will do this: Therefore this
Common-wealth and all the Members thereof may be as
happie as this world can make them; if their Rulers will
either aſſiſt them, or at leaſt ſuffer them to become ſo.</p>
            <p>Now this Conſtitution whereof we ſpeak is nothing elſe,
but the Deſignation of a certain place, whereunto it ſhall be
free for every one to make his Addreſſe upon all Occaſions,
aſwell to offer unto others, as to receive from them, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
which are deſirable, and the Informations of
things profitable to be taken notice of in a private or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
way.</p>
            <p>In this Place an Officer is to be appointed, who ſhould
have power to direct and order the work of the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He ſhould have certain men under him, ſo many as he
ſhould think fit to keep Regiſters, and make extracts thereof,
to give to ſuch as ſhould deſire the ſame for their Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Regiſters ſhould be of all things which either may
be any way offred by one man to any or to all, and deſired
by another from Any or from All; or which otherwiſe may
be of publick uſe, though not at all taken notice of by any
to that End.</p>
            <p>And the E<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d wherefore theſe Regiſters are thus to be kept,
is onely, that therein may be ſettled a Center of Encounters
to give Information to All of All uſefull matters. For one
of the great Cauſes of our Miſerie in this preſent life is this,
that we are not onely in the dark, not knowing what good
things are exſtant in private, or publickly attainable for
Vſe: But we are in diſorder and confuſion, becauſe when
we know what things are attainable, yet we have no way
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65541:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
contrived how to encounter readily and certainly with them
our ſelves, when we have need of them, or when we have
them, to impart them to ſuch as want them.</p>
            <p>Now to remedie both theſe evils, this Office may be an
Inſtrument, by being made a Common Intelligencer for All,
not onely of things actually offered or deſired by ſome to be
communicated, but alſo of things by himſelf and others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
which may be an occaſion to raiſe matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
for the Information to All.</p>
            <p>The multitude of affaires in populous Places doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
run into a confuſion, except ſome orderly way be found
out to ſettle Times and Places wherein thoſe that are to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them, may meet together for the tranſaction thereof.
If there were no Exchanges, nor ſet houres thereof, for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to meet and tranſact matters; What a diſorder and
obſtruction would there be in all trading? And if a man that
hath to do in the Exchange with five or ſix men; doth come
to it when it is thronging full, and knoweth not the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
walkes of thoſe ſeverall men; nor any body that can tell
him where their walkes are; he may run up and down, here
and there, and wearie himſelf out of breath, and not meet
with any of them, except by great chance he light upon them
at an inſtant: So it is with all other men in reſpect of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conveniencies in great and populous Cities or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
They run up and down at random to ſeeke for their
Accomodations; and when they have wearied themſelves
a long time in vain, they ſit down oft times unſatisfied: But
if there were but a place of common reſort appointed, like
unto the Exchange, where they ſhould be ſure to receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of all that which they would deſire to know, they
might without any loſſe of time come inſtantly to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their deſires, ſo far as they are attainable.</p>
            <p>This Place then is that, which we call the Office of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe.
Here ſufficient Regiſters ſhould be kept of all deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Matters of Humane Accommodation, ſhewing where,
with whom, and upon what conditions they may be had.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65541:5"/>
And this would be as it were a National Exchange for all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
Commodities, to know the readie way of encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
with them and tranſacting for them.</p>
            <p>This then is the proper End and Vſe of this Office, to ſet
every body in a way by ſome direction and Addreſſe, how to
come ſpeedily to have his lawfull deſires accompliſhed, of
what kind ſoever they may be.</p>
            <p>This Conſtitution will be a Means mightily to increaſe
all Trade and Commerce amongſt Merchants and all ſort
of People, but eſpecially to relieve the neceſſities of the
Poore, for whoſe ſake alone it doth deſerve to be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
although there were none other conveniencie in it. But
to ſhew that by the advantage of ſuch an Addreſſe, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by this Office to be ſet a foot, all Trade will be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advanced: Conſider how for the want of it, occaſions of
Trading and Tranſacting of buſineſſes are hindred between
man and man, to their mutuall diſadvantage, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
of the Common-wealth. As for example: I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to let out a parcell of ground and an houſe upon it to
be rented; another is deſirous to have ſome ground with an
Houſe upon it to farme, we for want of knowing each others
deſires do not meet to treat upon the buſineſſe, and cannot
find our accommodations perhaps in a yeer or two, to our
content: Here then the Commerce which we might have
with each other is ſtopt; the publick Notarie is not employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
between us; the Counſellour, whoſe advice is to be uſed
in drawing the Leaſes, is not employed; I want Money which
I might trade withall another way to my great profit and
the publick benefit; the Farmes is idle, the Houſe not inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
and out of repair; the ground either not at all, or not
ſo well cultivated, as otherwiſe it would be; the Inheritance
doth go to decay; leſſe fruit is reaped of the ground; leſſe
imployment for labouring men; leſſe works and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of Tradeſmen and Shop-keepers uſed, fewer Cuſtomes
and duties payed to the publick: and conſequently in every
reſpect both to my ſelf and others to whom I am aſſociated
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65541:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a diſadvantage doth befall; becauſe I cannot encounter
with the conveniencie whereof I ſtand in need; nor the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
with his Accommodation: But if we could have met
with each other, and tranſacted our buſineſſe to our mutuall
content, all theſe Inconveniencies would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
both to us and the Publick: It is undeniably true,
that the multitude of People doth beget Affairs; and the
readie tranſaction of Affairs in a State, is the onely Means to
make it flouriſh in the felicitie of the Inhabitants; and that
nothing can advance ſuch a readie tranſaction ſo much, as a
Common-center of Intelligence for all ſuch Matters; is quite
out of doubt.</p>
            <p>As for the Benefit of the Poore, and the Relief of their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
(which alone might move us to the proſecuting of
this buſineſſe) there is nothing imaginable, that can be more
beneficiall unto them. For conſider, amongſt all the Cauſes
of Humane Povertie (which are many) this maine one;
namely, that moſt men are poore for want of employment
is, either becauſe they cannot find Maſters to employ them;
or becauſe their abilities and fitneſſe to do ſervice are not
known to ſuch as might employ them: or laſtly, becauſe
there is perhaps little work ſti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring in the Common-wealth
for them. All theſe cauſes will be clearly remedied by this
Conſtitution; for here not onely the Maſter ſhall be able to
encounter with a Servant, or a Servant with a Maſter, fit for
each other, when both have given up their names, and the
tenour of their deſires, with the places of their abode; to the
Regiſte<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the Office: but by the collection and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things profitable to be improved for the Publick
uſe; much matter of employment, will be produced and
found out, which now is not at all thought upon. When
poore Work-men or Tradeſmen come to a great City, ſuch
as <hi>London</hi> is, in hope of getting employment; if they fail of
their expectation, or meet not with the Friends upon whom
they did relye; they betake themſelves to begging; or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to farre worſer courſes; which brings them to a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65541:6"/>
end: but in ſtead of their particular expectation and
Freind, they can betake themſelves to one, that can give them
addreſſe to th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> emploiment which in the Common-wealth
can be found for them; they not onely may be preſerved
from beggerie and miſerie, but become uſefull unto their
Neighbour.</p>
            <p>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>herto we have ſpoken of the Office, and the uſefulnes

whereof Regiſters ſhould be kept in the Office for Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and addreſſe, to ſatisfie all mens deſires.</p>
            <p>The deſires of men are infinite in reſpect of the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and therefore it is not to be expected, that a particular
enumeration thereof ſhould be made: We muſt reflect upon
the principall heads whereunto all may be referred, that
when particulars are offred they may be brought unto their
proper places in the Regiſters, where they may be found in
due time for Information and addreſſes of one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>There be two kindes of Regiſters or Inventaries of addreſſe;
Some are of things which are perpetually the ſame, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
exiſtent in the Society of Mankind in generall, and in
a diſtinct Common-wealth, Kingdome, Province and City
in particular, and others are not perpetuall but changeable
Regiſters containing all matters of daily Occurrence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
man and man to be imparted.</p>
            <p>The Matters whereof the perpetuall and unchangeable
Regiſters ſhould give Information to ſuch as may enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame, are chiefly theſe.</p>
            <p>1. For ſuch as would know concerning any thing exſtant
in the world, what hath been ſaid or written of it, the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Regiſter ſhould containe a Catalogue of all Catalogues
of Books; whereunto the Enquiſitor may be referred to ſeek
out whether or no be can find any thing written of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
whereof he doth make enquirie in any of thoſe Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,
and the Office ſhould have one or more Copies of
each of thoſe Catalogues to which the Regiſter of Catalogues
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65541:6"/>
ſhould referre them to make their ſearch.</p>
            <p>2. For ſuch as ſhould make inquirie concerning this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to know the ſcituation of any of the Provinces, Shires,
Counties, Cities, Towns, Villages, Caſtles, Ports; and ſuch
like places; the Office ſhould have <hi>Speeds</hi> Deſcription of
this Kingdome, and Mercator, or others, to referre them
thereunto.</p>
            <p>3. For ſuch as would deſire to know, what publick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and Employments, and what particular Trades are of
uſe in this State; the Office ſhould ſhew a Regiſter thereof.</p>
            <p>4. For ſuch as would know what Families and Perſons
of eminent note and qualitie are in the Kingdom for Birth,
or for Place and Emploiment, or for Abilities and ſingular
perſonall Vertues, the Office ſhould ſhew who they are, and
what their property is, and where to be met withall.</p>
            <p>5. For ſuch as deſire to know the ſtanding Commodities
of the Kingdom; what they are in the whole, and what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to every place? How they are tranſported from place
to place? Where and when the Markets thereof are kept? And
how to get intelligence of the particular prices thereof? The
Office ſhould have Regiſters for Information of all this.</p>
            <p>6. For ſuch as deſire to know what Commodities are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
from forraine parts conſtantly into this Kingdom?
Where and at what times to be found? With Information
concerning the prices thereof; the Office ſhould be able to
give notice hereof.</p>
            <p>As for the Matters of daily Occurrence, which by reaſon
of circumſtances are changeably to be taken notice of, and
differently to be propoſed, as offered from one man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or deſired by one from another, for mutuall Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
the Regiſters thereof muſt be divided into ſeverall
Books, and the Books into chapters, to whoſe heads all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of that kind ſhould be referred</p>
            <p>The Titles of theſe Books ſhould be at leaſt theſe foure. 1.
One for the Accommodation of the Poore. 2. Another for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65541:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Accommodation of Trade, Commerce and Bargains for
profit. 3. A third for the Accommodation of all Actions
which proceed from all relations of perſons to each other in
all Eſtates and conditions of Life. 4. A fourth for Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and matters of delight unto the mind in all Ve<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Theſe foure Regiſters may be diſtinguiſhed and intituled
from the properties of their Subjects thus. The firſt ſhould be
called the Regiſter of Neceſſities, or of Charity: The ſecond

               </gap>mance or of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
And the fourth of Delights or of Honour. And to theſe
Heads all humane Occurrences, wherein one man may be
helpfull unto another may be referred, if not very directly,
yet in ſome way, which will be without difficulty under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
and fit to avoid confuſion in the matters of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>

Either a new diſcovery of a Truth, or an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment

for the ſatisfaction of curioſity, and obſervation of Art, by
the means of this Office it may be known, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have with as much brevity as could be (for
if we would have been large; a Volnme might have been
filled with them) ranked theſe Heads of Matters in ſome
Order, to ſhew, how by the means of an Office (wherein
all things may be regiſtred, which by any are either offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or deſired for their accommodation) the ſociety of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65541:15"/>
mankinde in a well-ordered Common-wealth, may be
made flouriſhing, and as happy in the life of Nature, as
the ſatisfaction of their lawfull deſires can make them. For
therein, as in one Magazin or Market-place, all things
Neceſſary, Profitable, Rare, and Commendable, which
are extant in ſeverall places, and ſcattered here and
there, are brought together; and expoſed to the view of
every one that ſhall be willing to ſee them, that according
to his reach and capacity they may be made ſerviceable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and he thereby in his degree and ſtation more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
unto the publike a hundred fold then otherwiſe he can
be without the help of ſuch an addreſſe. For it is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
to any that will take it into conſideration; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the private ſatisfaction of any one in his particular
deſires, which may be had by this means, ſo far as it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
in an orderly way, the publike aymes alſo of thoſe
that are over the affairs of State, to reforme and direct
them towards the good of all may be infinitely improved,
if they know but how to make uſe of ſuch an Engine. He
that can look upon the frame of a whole State, and ſee the
conſtitution of all the parts thereof, and doth know what
ſtrength is in every part, or what the weakneſſe thereof is,
and whence it doth proceed; and can, as in a perfect modell
of a Coeleſtiall Globe, obſerve all the Motions of the Spheres
thereof; or as in a Watch, ſee how all the wheels turn and
worke one upon another for ſuch and ſuch an ends, he
only can fundamentally know what may and ought to be
deſigned; or can be effected in that State for the increaſe of
the Glory, and the ſettlement of the Felicity thereof with
Power according to Righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>And it is very credible that the great States-man of our
neighbour Nation, who raiſed himſelfe from the condition
of an ordinary Gentleman, to become the Ruler of Princes;
and who by the management of the ſtrength of that State
wherein he lived, hath broken the whole deſigne of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65541:15"/>
Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in the affectation of the Monarchy of
<hi>Europe,</hi> and did make himſelfe, and the Kingdom which
he did rule, the onely conſiderable power of Chriſtendome,
whilſt he lived in it. (We ſay) it is very credible that this
man was enabled from ſo mean beginnings, to bring ſo
great deſignes to paſſe, chiefly by the dexterity of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie
in making uſe of this Engine, which never before
was ſet a work in any Common-wealth, to reflect upon a
whole State, till he did ſet it a foot to that effect.</p>
               <p>He that is not blinde may eaſily perceive this, that it was
not poſſible that his intelligence could be ſo univerſall in
all things as it was, and his deſignes ſo effectually carryed
on in all places as they were, without an exact inſight of
all circumſtances, and a ſpeedy and ſecret correſpondencie
with all parts, and that to have ſuch an inſight in all things
and maintain ſuch a correſpondencie with all parts, nothing
is ſo fit as ſuch a way of Addreſſe, erected in all the chiefe
Cities of every Province of a Kingdom, is altogether unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable:
therefore it may be lawfully concluded that by this
means chiefly he was enabled both to contrive and execute
all his undertakings.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo muſt be obſerved, that to have ſuch an Office
in one place, is not enough, but that there ſhould be one in
every principall place of reſort, where there is the greateſt
concurrence of men for mutuall Society and Negotiation
in every Province, that all the Commodities or Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which are offered or deſired in any place, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
or made known unto all places unto which they are
by any means communicable.</p>
               <p>Now that ſuch Regiſters in thoſe places and chiefly in
<hi>London,</hi> may be kept for all theſe both Private and Publike
Advantages; nothing is wanting, but the Countenance of
Authority, that the Matter may be Regularly and Orderly
carried on, becauſe it is not enough to intend a good Work,
but the way of carrying it on muſt be good alſo; therefore
the buſineſſe is to be ordered by thoſe that are in place of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65541:16"/>
Supream Command, that as the Motion doth ayme at the
Publike Good of all by the Benefit and Profit of every one
in Particular: ſo all reſpect may be ſhewed towards thoſe
that are over the whole Body, that nothing may ſeem to be
attempted to their prejudice. As for that which remayneth
to be certified further in this buſineſſe, it is not much, only
this may be added, that theſe Regiſters muſt be again and
again ſubdivided, and eſpecially that ſome muſt be kept ſecret,
and ſome expoſed to the Common View of all. In the
ſecret Regiſters the Particularities of the Memorials are to
be kept; ſpecifying things Circumſtantially, by the Names &amp;
Places of abode of them, that doe offer or deſire the ſame,
with all the Conditions upon which they are offered or
deſired. And in the Open or Common-Regiſter the ſame
Memoriall is to be kept under a Generall Intimation of the
Matter only; with a Reference unto the Particular and
Secret Regiſter, that ſuch as ſhall ſee the generall Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſhall deſire the particular information thereof; may
be accommodated, therein by an Extract thereof for their
Addreſſe where to finde their Conveniency: and for this
Extract ſome ſmall and very inconſiderable duty, as a peny
or at the moſt two pence may be paid.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe that are to bring Memorialls unto the Office
ſome patterns or forms are to be made, and ſhewed unto
them hung up in the Office; to teach ſuch as are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the way. How to draw up their <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums,</hi>
which they would bring in. Thoſe then that will
make uſe of the Office ſhall be directed to come, with an
Exact Memoriall, of that whereof they deſire either to give
or receive Advice, &amp; upon what Conditions. When therefore
they ſhall come with their Memoriall, if they be poor, it ſhall
be regiſtred, or an Extract ſhall be given them out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter-book
for nothing; but if they are not poor, the duty
is to be paid for the Regiſtring, or for the Extract, which
may be taken out of a Memorial, and when they have found
the Perſons to whom the Extract ſhall give them Addreſſe,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65541:16"/>
if the Bargain whereof the Memoriall doth give Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be concluded; or the Effect of the Memoriall be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
made void; the Regiſter is to be diſcharged of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
foure and twenty houres, and for this diſcharge of the
Regiſter nothing ſhall be paid: Now the Regiſter ſhould
be diſcharged of the Memorialls which are made void; leſt
fruitleſſe Addreſſes be made to any concerning a Matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
diſpatched; and leſt thoſe that have received the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
which they deſired by their Memorialls be troubled
with new Viſitors which the Office may ſend unto them, if
this be not done.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, by all that hath been ſaid, this is very evident,
that this Way of Addreſſe will be the moſt Uſefull and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Conſtitution, for the ſupply of all mens wants,
and the diſpatch of all Buſineſſes, that can be thought upon
in this or any other Common-wealth. And that this way
may eaſily be ſet afoot, is apparent from this, that to ſettle it
nothing is wanting, but the Deſignment of a Place, in which
the Office ſhould be kept, and an Act of Authority to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Solicitour of Publike Deſignes, Whereby hee
ſhould be ordered to proſecnte this matter. This Act then
might run in ſuch terms as theſe, or the like.</p>
               <p>Seeing the Proviſion for the Poore to ſupply their Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
and give them and others addreſſe unto ſome Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
is not only a work of Chriſtian Charity, but of
great Uſefulneſſe to a wel-Ordered Common-wealth: It
is therefore Ordered and Ordained by both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that <hi>N. N.</hi> ſhall be a Superintendent Generall for
the Good of the Poore of this Kingdom; to finde out and
propoſe the Wayes of their Relief, ahd give to them and all
others, ſuch Addreſſes, as ſhall be moſt expedient to ſupply
their wants, and to procure to every one their ſatisfaction in
the Accommodation of all their Commendable or Lawfull
Deſires, to which Effect the ſaid <hi>N. N.</hi> is Authorized
hereby to appoint, firſt in <hi>London,</hi> and then in all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65541:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this Kingdom, whereſoever he ſhall think it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
an Office of Encounter or Addreſſe in ſuch Place or
Places, as by Authority ſhall be deſigned to that Uſe. In
which places he ſhall have power to put Under-officers, &amp;c.
who ſhall according to his Direction be bound to keep
Books and Regiſters, wherein it ſhall be free for every one to
cauſe to be Written and Regiſtred, by ſeverall and diſtinct
Chapters, every thing whereof addreſſe may be given, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſaid Neceſſities and Accommodations, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it ſhall be free for every one to come to the ſaid Offices,
to receive Addreſſes by Extracts out of the Regiſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon
Condition that the Rich ſhall pay for ſuch an Extract or the
Regiſtring of a Memoriall but two pence; or three pence at
the moſt, and that the Poore ſhall have this done on their
behalf for nothing, nor ſhall any be bound or obliged to
make Uſe of this Office by giving or taking out Memorials
further, then of their own accord they ſhall be willing.</p>
