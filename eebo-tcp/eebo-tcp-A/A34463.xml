            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ct nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that which doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vince you, though
bound with an Oath, although you bring your ſelves
in never ſo much diſgrace in breaking your Agreement;
for in ſuch a caſe you may reject the Counſel of God
againſt your own Knowledge, and ſo appearing to pleaſe
the world that looks upon you, the unjuſt acts againſt
the Juſt; herein you'l do deſpite to the Spirit of Grace,
wilfully acting that which he knows he should not: So here comes mans
condemnation juſt from God; therefore before you do act conſider; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you do give Sentence fear; for Blaſphemy proceeds from the root of
Tranſgreſſion; and ſee that you be firſt out of it before you of it do judge:
There is no Blaſphemy in the Light which is truth. And to witneſs the light
is not Blaſphemy. And to witneſs the Prophets Life, and the Apoſtles Life
that had the Life of Jeſus made manifeſt in his mortal flesh. And to
witneſſe the Life of God, and God dwelling in man, is not Blaſphemy.
And to witneſſe the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven, and as he is, ſo
to be in this world, is not Blaſphemy; but not to witneſſe this, and to be in
the tranſgreſſion, he is in the Root that will blaſpheme; and for a man to ſay
he witneſſes theſe things, and himſelf in the tranſgreſſion, he blaſphemes,
and is the Synagogue for Satan, who did tranſgreſſe, and not abide in the
truth, who is in the tranſgreſſion. Now it is not becauſe men can ſpeak the
Scriptures of truth, therefore they are able to judge of Blaſphemy; for the
Jews could ſpeak the Scriptures of truth, but judged the Truth Blaſphemy;
Now if you would know what's Blaſphemy, this is blaſphemy, and theſe
were out of the life of the truth that judged the life blaſphemy; and you do
not read that any that was in the life of Chriſt, did whip, banish, priſon, put
to death any for blaſphemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alas! here is blaſphemy heard all up and
down the ſtreets, men profeſſing what they are not: Now the Jews which
had the Scriptures, and out of the ſpirit of Chriſt, did put to death for
blaſphemy: Now with this examine and judge your ſelves, that you may
not be judged of the Lord: Although <hi>Darius</hi> could not change after ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet 'twas much grief to him: conſider what Act that was, and Law that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44767:2"/>
was not to be changed after ſealed. And conſider <hi>Herods</hi> Oath againſt
<hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and the counſel and chief Prieſts againſt Chriſt for a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Is Chriſt in you? Now where is this councel and chief Prieſts againſt
him? It is better to judge of things which you truly underſtand, pertaining
to this life (but that you cannot) till you come to the Light that enlightens
every man that comes into the world, and ſo leads into the Kingdom of God
and Chriſt that is not of this world; for there is a Kingdom of the world
which is not become the Kingdom of Chriſt, which is in the tranſgreſſion;
and there are the blaſphemers in the tranſgreſſion of the life which the
Scriptures of truth is given forth from, which judges the truth blaſphemy.
Now wait in the Light that you may receive the wiſdom of God which
comes from Chriſt, by which all things was created, that with it you may
come to uſe the creatures with the wiſdom by which they were created to
the Glory of God. I know the Lord is ſtriving, that innocent blood you
bring not upon your heads, and hath opened your underſtandings for to
ſee more then at the firſt; and in many of you hath he wrought a noble
Principle of tenderneſſe and moderation, in which if you abide faithful to
act what it requires, the arm of the Lord you will ſee revealed, and great
things brought to paſs; and ſo will you be clear (whatever becomes of the
Innocent) in the day of Gods viſitation when he makes Inquiſition for
blood; you whoſe underſtandings the Lord hath opened and moved to
plead the cauſe of the Innocent; be faithful to God; be your talent never
ſo ſmall, take heed of hiding it, leaſt your ſin become greater then you will
be able to bear.</p>
            <p>It concerns no man farther to judge
then he is judged, and is in the
truth.</p>

            <p>If you be able to ſee theſe things, do; but if not, take heed what you do,

            <p>There's none able to judge of theſe things before the luſts of the flesh,
and the luſts of the eyes, and the pride of life be judged and overcome in
them, and the love of the world.</p>
            <p>That's blaſphemy for a man to ſay he is a Jew or a Chriſtian, and is not,
but ſtill is in the old nature, that was a murderer from the begining; he blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheams
the Name of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. for God hath no ſuch children in the
New Covenant. As it was then, he that was born after the flesh perſecuted
him that was born after the ſpirit, ſo it is now, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. But he that
is born after the ſpirit never perſecutes him that is born after the flesh.</p>

To let the tares (if tares) alone with the wheat, according to Chriſts
own Doctrine; this will not repent you, becauſe it is his own command;
