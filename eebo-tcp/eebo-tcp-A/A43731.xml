         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Friends and people, J am conſtrained in my ſelf to publiſh to you ſome lines, not crave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of you but what is meet.</head>
            <p>NOw concerning my Friend and Brother; who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to go naked in publike view, about ten miles, unto the Town of <hi>Newbery,</hi> which in appearance unto men might hazard his life, yet through that powerful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and conſtraint of that Spirit of God in him, he was made to effect that which he was commanded to do, which was to go naked, and take a Sword in his hand, and fire on the top of it, and a golden girdle on his loyns, and ſtandalls on his feet; for this his obedience he is condemned, and cried out againſt with ſcorn and contempt, ſaying, he is mad, and hath a devil, with more ſuch like cruelties as their ſcorn can afford him, yet his joy ſtill continues, and his heart ſtill moveth towards God, for the day of our Redemption draweth nigh.</p>
            <p>Therefore hearken now my beloved friends, and you our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to what the Lord ſhall ſpeak to you in this matter, and is made good unto us by his ſpirit in love, and ſo bringing of us unto the glory of the Father, and alſo to the fellowſhip of the Saints, by the overturning of iniquity, and ſlaying of ſin, and giving to us the true life of the Goſpell, in the Spirit of peace, to walk in it in our generation, that ſo the light of God may ſhine, and have its day in true appearance and manifeſtation of love, then ſhall the fire of God be kindled in your conſciences, then you ſhall ſee that you are one ſlaying of another, yet you ſhall have a pretence of godlineſs, but woe unto all that go down unto Egypt for help, for his Sword is a Sword of peace.</p>
            <p>Now again my beloved, the truth of Religion is a myſtery to Magiſtrates, Prieſts, and people, which have a pretence to maintain the fundamentals thereof, for they are true in none, except they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re truly practiſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:39013:3"/>Therefore in the firſt place I ſhall write a word unto the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and ſhall bring or compare their life with the life of Chriſt, to prove whether it is one with his.</p>
            <p>When he appeared amongſt the ſons of men, to make manifeſt his life, he appeared in the love of his Fathers will, and that he might be an example of it unto us, to ſhew the righteouſneſſe of God amongſt men, and that it might be followed by us who own the righteouſneſs of God.</p>
            <p>Then you Magiſtrates take notice, had he honour of men, or did he crave it? or was he full of pride and did uſe it? was he a follower of the cuſtomes and traditions of men? was he full of ſuperfluities in meats, and drinks, and apparel? or was he chiefeſt among them that did meet in the Synagogues? did he lord it over Gods Heritage as ye do? or was he ever inriched by the things of this world, or gained he by the Sword, or did he by his obedience to his Fathers wil get into the honor of men, and ſo raign over them? He rid unto <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> upon an Aſſe, but ye Rulers of men now ride upon horſes, that is ſwift judgment to be put in execution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſimple, the ſtrangers, and widows, and them, which have no Father on earth, he was not ſwift to deſtroy, as thoſe are who have a pretence to the doctrine of the Goſpel, by one name or other, or one Ordinance or other, and ſo call themſelves Saints, when they differ not from the world but in words, for who have gained honour and riches more then they that pretend for Religion? or who have divided the ſpoil but they? or who are more proud then they, or have more ſuperfluities of meats and drinks then they; ſo let the light in your own conſciences diſcover to you that you are not riſen with Chriſt, neither know you what it is to bear his croſs, or Religion what it is, for that is it which tyeth us to God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo one to another, but the Daughter of <hi>Sion</hi> is leſt as a cottage, therefore give ear ye Rulers of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and ye people of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> may not I ſay unto you, as it was ſaid unto them, ye pray and keep daies of faſting, and appointed times, it is iniquity before the Lord, your hands are full of blood, do not theſe things fall upon the back of the righteous? and can ſuch that practiſe theſe things main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain true Religion? how many were laid up in priſons of thoſe that held up the power of Antichriſt, by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, it is the cruel one that doth impriſon, but it is mercy and love that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39013:3"/>
ſets free; is Chriſt your patern, then where will you find that he impriſoned or puniſhed any for the breach of the Law of God? if he did not ſo to wicked, then why are you ſo to the righteous? I am now called to ſpeak to you in truth, and let the light within you teſtifie that theſe are the enemies Laws and unrighteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Do we not daily ſee that thoſe Rulers that are put in Authority, for to judg of matter concerning the Civil State, will alſo take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to examine the ſpiritual man, and inflict, puniſhments if there be a crying out againſt wickedneſs, or vain-glory, or ſuch like things, they take advantage againſt the ſimple, which do not, nor cannot do wrong unto State or people, for they have a Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, which is Chriſt, though they come in appearance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, which is Chriſt, though they come in appearance with ſword, as this my Brother did, where are the wrongs that are or were done by him, or any of thoſe, who of late have been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by the Officers of State? are all Magiſtrates full of Divine Myſtery, ſurely no, but ſit as Judges to let <hi>Barrabas</hi> go free: The people of God in former times were cloathed in ſheep skins, and goat-skins, and dwelt in dens and caves of the earth, and what we may undergo now we know not, but the Lord is our peace, and our all, and when Chriſt who is your life ſhall appear in you, then ſhall you be changed even as this my Brother, for all naturall men have a Spirit which manifeſts unto them that the life which they now live ſhall be caſt out, now he that is ſpiritual, his life runneth after love, after peace, even to beget, to convince, and bring deniall of all propriety upon himſelf, as he did, that is now gone forth from all his honour, his credit among men, his pride, his oxen, his farm, and his wife, ſo as not to live to his luſts, even to be ſtripped naked of all, and to be a ſign to all, and that it might appear that it is the Virgins chaſtity which holds forth Chriſts Divinity in all things, Oh look, look, and behold it is the chaſt Virgin which knoweth Chriſts Divinity, for the deeds thereof are not evil, neither can a Virgin bind heavy burthens upon ſtrangers, for the Magiſtrate, the Prieſts, and the people, are the ſtrangers to the Miniſtery of Chriſt, for the Magiſtrate is carnal, the Prieſt is carnal, and the People are carnal; the Magiſtrate loveth honour with great revenues, and by that means ſetteth himſelf in judgment and places of authority, and ſo judgeth for money, and paſs cenſures for reward, their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39013:4"/>
and love is to be obtained for money, if any one is counted wiſe amongſt them, it is becauſe he hath ſtore of money, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to oppreſs, ſo that the innocent are made beggerly by them; but he that is born of God hateth all this, and they which live in this are carnal, and know not the fundamentals of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for they that know them cannot lord and judg for money; therefore be wiſe. O ye Kings, and be inſtructed ye Judges of the earth; if you are born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, you will feel within you your ſpirits to be renewed, your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly teeth to be broken and ſtripped of your honor, and will leave off judging for reward, and will find that you have no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the life of Chriſt, but in ſimplicity, it will take you from your farms, your oxen, your wives, your luſts, and all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before you can dwell with Chriſt, for whilſt ye live in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of a carnal Government, ye deny Chriſt, and are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety with the devil.</p>
            <p>Now as for thoſe poor lambs which have gone up and down your ſtreets, ſome naked, ſome preaching the Law of the Father, and ſome deſtruction, which God will bring upon the Man of Sin, and ſome againſt the deceipt of the Prieſts, and ſome againſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of buying and ſelling, and ſeveral other voices, as againſt crimes which you ſay are puniſhable by your Law, ſo that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual being come to preach againſt it, and in his converſation to deny it, you judg him mad, and impriſon him, when indeed the Law cannot take hold of any unrighteouſneſs in their lives, or wrong done to any man by them; ſo that all the heavy burthens which they bind upon your ſhoulders, are to lay open all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is committed in ſecret, and to manifeſt it upon the houſe top, ſo as that the deed of the wicked are not juſtifiable before the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
            <p>Now to the carnal Prieſts and Miniſters ſo called, I write unto you, that you would be exhorted to amend your lives, and ceaſe from cruelty, leſt ye be daſhed in pieces like a Potters veſſel, for the wrath of God hangeth over your heads; to prove that you are carnal, I need not trouble my ſelf, becauſe ye prove your ſelves ſo to be, for ye covet a recompence for preaching, more then to preach, and will not ſuffer the people to be free; if you read much, you cannot but read your own covetouſneſs, for you eat the ſins of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39013:4"/>
people, and as troops of robbers wait for a man, ſo do the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Prieſts murder in the way. Read the fifth of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> there is ſpoken of Gods judgments againſt Prieſts, and People, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ver. 4. they will not frame their doings to turn unto their God, and the pride of <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth teſtifie to their faces; and this I ſay as Baſtards at their doors, for he that lives not the life of Chriſt is a Baſtard: in all ages we find that the Prieſts were joyned to the Magiſtrates againſt the Prophets and Apoſtles, for they marry themſelves one to another in deceipt, they cried not unto me with their hearts, when they howled upon their beds, they aſſembled themſelves for corn and wine, they rebelled againſt me; is it not clearly to be ſeen, that <hi>Ephraim</hi> is oppreſſed and broken in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? there is a broken judgment amongſt Profeſſors, take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a view of the Prieſts in every Pariſh, which takes upon them to preach the Gſpel, they preach and pray to God for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that they may be inveſted with the bleſſed Spirit, I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that they were ſo, and that they themſelves were filled with that Unction Chriſt, then they would be debaſed in themſelves, and not take upon them the title of Miniſters, to miniſter life and ſalvation, whileſt all their Miniſtery tends to no other end, but to ſerve themſelves, and favour the Magiſtrates, becauſe they favour them; and ſo ſtiling themſelves Divine Miniſters for their own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ends, deceiving the poor, by telling them that God is love, and yet they themſelves are ſervants to malice, contentious ſtrife and debate; and therefore take notice, that it is not love that joyneth the Prieſts to the people, but the power of the Magiſtrate, for he is not tyed to the people, but hath his liberty to leave them, and ſo are free for their own advantage, and make gain of the Peoples ruine, gathering aſſemblies for corn and wine; but he that is taught of God, hath his Magiſtrate in him, his Miniſter in him, and by that love to the people, will follow him, and will live to that which is everlaſting in God, with thoſe have fellowſhip in the communion of love. There be many that give themſelves the name of Preachers of the word, but there are but few that are doers, for moſt are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt: I find them not to follow Chriſt in love, neither in peace, for they get a Priſon for the poor, and cry out of Blaſphemy in thoſe which are rich in the faith, and make manifeſt the love of God to be in them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking

            <p>Therefore a word to all ye people that are led by your Prieſts, as may be witneſſed by your following them, there is pride in the Prieſt, and alſo in the people, covetouſneſs in the Prieſt, ſo in the people, envy in the Prieſt, ſo in the people, the Prieſt his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is propriety, ſo is the peoples, the Prieſt hath a clamorous tongue, ſo have the people, the Prieſt denieth the coming of Chriſt to be the Reſurrection of God in man, ſo do the people, the Prieſt denieth a true Judgment day of God to be come upon the Man of Sin and unrighteouſneſs, and that Chriſt will not bring us to the perfect life of holineſſe here, and ſo do the people, the Prieſts have not laid down their lives for Chriſt, neither have the people; for if the Magiſtrates, Prieſts, and Lawyers had no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rewards of men for following the world and its wayes, then they ſhould have for following Chriſt and his wayes, it's poſſible we ſhould have neither Magiſtrates, Prieſts, nor Lawyers, to ſupply the places they now ſtand in; therefore, O ye people, give not up your ſelves to others, to be led contrary to what your own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences guideth you to, but walk according to that which ye are fully perſwaded of in your own minds, for there is a light within you, to which if you take heed, will lead you into the way of all truth, and being guided by that, you need not crave the power of the Magiſtrate to defend, nor the help of the Lawyer to plead for you, neither need you go to the Prieſt to direct you, for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lord are all taught of him, and they know his voice, and the voice of the Hireling they will not hear; but if you give not heed, nor take not warning by him, he will ſcatter the Sheep with the Shepherd, and deliver you up together for deſtruction: And be it known unto you all, that I have not writ this out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to any mans perſon, but I have written it to that end, to ſhew you the envy within you, and that enmity is Judge when you condemn without cauſe; therefore take notice that I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Magiſtrate for puniſhing evil doers, but thoſe that do well, and ſuch are all thoſe that in obedience to the will of God,

go forth to manifeſt the things they have ſeen and heard from him; neither do I condemn the Lawyers, ſeeing there is a right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men for endeavouring to help each man to his right, but for coveting the reward or fee, more then the pleading the cauſe of the ſimple, neither do I condemn him that ſtands in the place of a Miniſter of the Goſpel for doing righteouſneſs, but becauſe he doth it not, but walketh contrary to the life of Chriſt, as it was made manifeſt amongſt the ſons of men.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39013:7"/>
&amp; in my earth I have had fallen upon me the pure water diſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Rock of God, which came down to cleanſe the mind, and to water my earth, ſo that it might be repleniſhed to bring forth with increaſe that pure ſeed of God which he hath ſown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the well-husbandred land, for in the new earth doth God plant his Paradiſe, and therein ſoweth the ſeed of his bleſſed Spirit, and himſelf is the Husbandman thereof: So that whom he hath made the earth ready, which is man, he will poure in his love, his life, his ſpirit, and true righteouſneſs, and ſhoweth to me the pure Law and the Goſpel fellowſhip, enjuring no man, but looketh for encreaſe. Truly friends, I am to write to you what I am made by God, and no more, and what he is made to me is this, in the Husbandry of his own work he is this, he follows me with peace to all men, and makes me to know that a brother is as my ſelf, in ſhort, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs what I am, is to expreſs, God, or that power in me, or that powerful power of God to expreſs it ſelf, when Chriſt who is your life ſhall appear, then ſhall I appear with him, or that Son born in me, which is the very expreſs image of God born in man, which can declare the Father, and accordingly he is love in truth, and that is the ſeed which God hath ſown in my earth, and when the time of the harveſt is, it will bring forth the ſame body as it was when it was ſown; and in the mean time I am but a ſtranger to my own Countrymen, a ſtranger to profeſſors, and ſo to the world. Truly friends, Love mates it ſelf with no other then the Son of Love, which is to be born in our earth, and ſo lives in judgment within, til the day of the pure manifeſtation be brought forth, then love wil ſhine, or be like a City built upon a hill, that love of God which is born in others, is that fellowſhip which I have choſen above all things beſide it ſelf; love hath compelled me, love doth bind me to the life of it, and hath governed me, and not I my ſelf to govern it, love hath deſtroyed me, and bound me up again; God will bring forth us in thoſe things which are his own, ſo that we might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute of the ſame one to another, which my heart have felt and known, ſo that I drink in the cup of my own ſalvation, which God gave me to drink of to you; God is my witneſs, that no unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, falſhood, nor injury, nor have I any toleration to it in my heart, nor againſt the State, in the things which are of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſtate, nor any perſon whatſoever to enjure but he that is filthy, let him be filthy, where love is ſown, it brings forth the ſame again; love is like to the ripe grapes, which give a reliſh to the wine, ſo

is the life of God in me, when it ſhall be brought forth in order, and have divine evidences to witneſs it in the demonſtration of the godly nature in creature; ſo he that is in true love, abideth in the life everlaſting which cannot end, when God hath taught me his love by the quickning ſpirit, and he hath opened to me the union and communion, which is Gods in fellowſhip, which is in order to the Reſurrection of that body of Chriſt, who maketh it manifeſt, by ſubduing all things under his feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when all things are ſubdued, then is God all, and my ſelf nothing; but I have had this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation read in me, which is to take up the pure life of Chriſt, and his Government and to live in the family of his protection, ſo that they which live in it, walk as thus, ſo that he and his are one, ſo that there is a oneneſs in all, and all but one, ſo that there is but one diſpoſition, one quality, one nature, one judgment, one in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; one in life, one in death, one in mercy, one pity, one in all ruling over all, which is God bleſſed for ever. This being a true harmony amongſt us, with ſuch regulation as holds to the ſingular number one, ſo that all are to ſtand ſtill, let God work in them by the power of his will; ſo now let him that gather, gather in God, ſo that he that is alive, lives to God; but God is free in me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo if he pleaſe to diſpoſe of himſelf, which is his own in me, it will be in the bright day of God, to manifeſt love to that Majeſty, for God doth dwell in our Temples in the acting power, and we have the oneneſs of that Divine Nature planted in ours; ſo now we are <hi>Simeon</hi> like Lord let us depart, for we know we have ſeen thy ſalvation; and as for my part, or that party which is now in me, ſeeks no propriety in community, but only to know the godly nature which approves it ſelf, and quits it ſelf, it will ſpoil all our qualities, all our faſhions and degrees of our fleſh, and rewards of mankind, and from being our ſelves any longer that union and communion which I have had with my brother and others, is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible, that the carnal cannot believe, for love is to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by divine acts. Truly he that is born of God, and is in the life, and dwelleth in the life; he is the true looking glaſs, in which love can ſee its ſelf, a univerſal deluge is come upon our old world, but <hi>Noah</hi> ſhall live, truth and a oneneſs is my delight; where there is a true oneneſs in love, there can be no diſtance in order not being; I am free to lay down my life to enter into the new Covenant to live with God, love cannot be known by words, nor that love which we have to all men, love is to be opened, when
