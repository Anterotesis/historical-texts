            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is a ſhorte ſumme of their doctrine, concernyng the ſupper.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the ſacrifice <note place="margin">Of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryfyce.</note> they teache, that though oure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyoure hym ſelfe dyd in dede make a full and perfect ſacrifice propiciatorye and ſatiſfactory, for the ſynnes of all the whole world, neuer more ſo (that is to ſay bloudeli) to be offred agaie: yet in his ſupper he offred y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame ſacrifice vnto hys father, but vn
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9771:32"/>
bloudely: that is to ſay, in wyll and deſyer, whych is accompted often euen for the deed, as thys was.</p>
               <p>Whyche vnbloudy ſacrifice he commaunded hys church to offer, in remembraunce of hys bloudy ſacryfyce: as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal meane, wherby hys bloudye ſacrifice is applyed both to the quick and dead, as baptyſine is the meane, by the whych regene racion is applyed, by the prieſte, to the infaunte or chylde, that is baptyſed.</p>
               <p>For in that, the ſupper of Chryſte is to them not onely a ſacramente, but alſo a ſacrifyce: and that not only applicatorye, but alſo propiciatory, becauſe it applyeth the propiciatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce of Chryſte, to whom the pryeſte or miniſter wyll, bee he

dead or alyue. And in that, euen from the begynnig, the fathers, ſay they, were accuſtomed in the celebracyon of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſupper, to haue <note place="margin">Prayer for the dead.</note> a memorial of the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo in that thys ſacrifice is a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the whole churche, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> dead being members of the churche, of charitie as they can not but offer for them, euen ſo they can not but pray for them after the en ſample of the Catholyke church: becauſe it is a wholſome thyng, ſayeth Iudas Machabeus, to pray for the dead, that they may be delyuered from theyr ſynnes. Wherevnto, all the doctors doe conſent, ſay thei.</p>
               <p>Now, as for prayeng to ſaintes, they teache, that al be it there is <note place="margin">Prayer to ſaynctes.</note> but one mediator of Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet of interceſſyon the holy ſaits of god, departed thys lyfe, maye

wel be counted mediators. And therfore it is a poynt of a lowly hart and humble ſpirite, whiche god wel lyfeth, to call vpon the ſayntes to pray for vs firſt: leſt by our preſumpcion to come into gods preſence, we beeyng ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and god beyng ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ful of maieſtie, we more anger and diſpleaſe god. Where as by their helpe god may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, to make vs more worthy to come vnto hym, and the ſoner to graunt vs our peticions.

And therefore to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende

ther ſacrifice propiciatori, which in the maſſe they offer, maye be the more avaylable, they vſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, much praying to ſaintes. So of theſe. 4. as of. 4. pillours, theyr maſſe ſtandeth.</p>

               <p>For in the. 17. of S.

So that now as ye haue Chryſtes one on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice, whych he hymſelfe on the croſſe offred once, as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient for all that doe beleue, and neuer more to bee reiterated: ſo haue you, that for the applyinge of it to hys church, the miniſters ſhoulde preache and praye, that theyr preachyng myght be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall in Chryſt.</p>

               <p>Whereby we maye well ſee, if we wyl, that as prayer for the dead is not avaylable or profita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to the dead: ſo is it not of vs allowable or to bee exercyſed.</p>

               <p>Whereas they prate of Chriſtes wyl, that it was accepted before his father for the dead: as they ſhall neuer bee able to ſhewe ſo much as one word, to proue that Chryſt would in hys ſupper, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice himſelfe to hys father for the ſynnes of the world (for ther is not one worde therof through out the whole byble) ſo doe thei belie god the father, which wold in dede haue hys ſonne to drinke the cupp, that he prayed to be ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken from him: or els mak chriſts death fruſtrate, and more then

               <p>For hoc facite (doe you this) perteineth to the whole action of Chryſtes ſupper, of taking, eati<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and drynkynge of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſacramente

For they make themſelues equal wyth Chryſt, yea better then he: whych thyng indede their holy father and graundſire, the pope, doth.</p>
               <p>For where Chryſte woulde take vpon him to teach nothing, but that he had receaued of hys father: And therfore willed men to ſearch the ſcriptures, as al his Apoſtles did, whether their doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tryn was not according thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: the pope, and his prelates, wil be bold to teach what pleaſe them more, then God byddeth, yea cleane contrary to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, whyche god biddeth.

al theſe. 4. pointes, tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciacion, ſacrifice, praying for the dead and to the dead. But ſee, I pray you, theyr abominacions.

wyll, bee he dead or alyue: as I woulde haue you to note, howe they graunt, that of it ſelfe it is not a propycyatorye ſacryfyce, whereby they varye from that, which they els where teach, that it is the ſelf ſame ſacrifice, which Chryſte offered on the croſſe, vn bloudely: ſo I praye you forget not, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſt is gods felowe: for he may apply it to whom he wyll.</p>
               <p>Therfore honor ſir Iohn, and make much of ſir Thomas. For though god could make thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: yet alone, wyth oute the prieſte, he can not ſaue thee.

               <p>Wheras they ſay, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the beginninge were accuſtomed to make memorials for the dead: thys I graunte to be true, as we doe in our commu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>But to gather, that therefore they prayed for them: it nomore foloweth, then to ſaye, that oure englyſhe ſeruice doeth alowe it, where it doth not. For ye muſte note, that there is a memorial for the dead aſwel in geuing thanks to god for them, as in praying for them: for to ſaye, to praye for the dead, is a generall worde, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng in it geuyng of thankes.</p>
               <p>And therfore whan we read in

the aunciente fathers of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue church, of the memorials for the dead or prayinge for the dead, it is not to be vnderſtand, that they prayed for to delyuer them from purgatory (for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> was not founde out then) or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hell, as oure papiſtes doe in theyr prayers of the maſſe, forther is no redempcion: or for pardon of theyr ſynnes, as thoughe they had it not, for if thei depart with out it, they are damned: or for to get them a hier place in heauen, for that wer iniurious to chriſt, that we ſhould purchaſe places, and hyer rowmes in heauen for others: But eyther for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyer of the more ſpedy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt, to haſten the reſurreccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thei might not be thoght negligent or careles ouer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> deed: tyther that the liuing myght be

occaſioned to increaſe in loue to the church here in earth, who ſtil foloweth with good wil &amp; loue, euen men wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei be departed: eyther to admoniſh the churche to be diligent ouer ſuch as lyue, and careful to extende her loue, if it were poſſible, euen to the deed.</p>
               <p>On this wiſe ſhoulde we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde not only the former, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> later fathers, as Auſten, Chriſoſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e and others.

Where they ſaye, that beecauſe thys ſacrifice is the ſacryfice of the whole churche, whereof the dead be members, therfore they ſhould be prayed for: as beefore I haue ſhewed, that we muſt put a difference betwene the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the churche militaunte here on earth, and thoſe whyche bee now in reſt and peace with god: ſo wold I haue you to note here, that they ſhould pray for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead then ſuche, as be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chryſtes Churche.</p>

               <p>And ſo came vp this pelfe of prayinge for the dead, whyche Paul, the apoſtles and al the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phetes neuer ſpake one word of. For all menne maye eaſelye ſee, that it is a thinge which helpeth much vyce, and hyndreth godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

               <p>Chryſtes teachyng is, that we ſhoulde liue in loue and charite: the Sonne ſhould not go down on our wrath.
