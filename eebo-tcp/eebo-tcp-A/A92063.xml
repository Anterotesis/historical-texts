            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>M. SPEAKER,</salute>
            </opener>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee doe all know, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you Sir let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That we are in a war, That a war doth alwaies carry a ſting of Gods anger in it, That a Civill war is the height of his fury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Romans, <hi>a wiſe People, no Chriſtians were ſo ſadly ſenſible of a</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:123984:3"/>
               <hi>Civill war as they; who did manage it, would never advertiſe the Senate of any ſucceſſe whatſoever: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were exceedingly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with the glory of a triumph, yet their Lawes did not permit any man to enter the City in triumph, for the finiſhing of a Civill warre. One of the wiſeſt of them ſaid,</hi> Omnia ſunt miſera in bello Civili, ſed nihil miſerius ipſa Victoria; <hi>All things are miſerable in a Civill war, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more miſerable then a Victory it ſelfe. A Civill war is a two-edged Sword, it cuts and devoures on both ſides; if it continne amongſt us, wee may kill up on another till wee make our ſelves an eaſy and ſcornfull Prey to ſome ambitious Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now we probably fore-ſee, That</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:123984:3"/>
               <hi>there is likely to be a great alteration in the Affaires of Chriſtendome, by the death of Cardinall</hi> Richelieu. <hi>The King of</hi> France <hi>had ſigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand a Treaty of Peace with the King of</hi> Spaine: <hi>But the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall by his power and intereſt brake that Deſigne; it was his laſt worke. Now, Cardinall</hi> Mazarini <hi>is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his Imployments, an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, a ſtranger, and therefore may proſecute other Ends; Beſides, the King himſelfe may relaps into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Opinion: So that if there ſhould bee a Peace betweene</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spaine, <hi>the French will have leiſure and opportunity to aſsiſt here. And it hath beene twice the Fate of this Kingdome to be conquered by Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries. Jt is frequent in Histories,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:123984:4"/>
               <hi>That many other Nations have bin ſubdued by thoſe whom they called in to helpe them. Jf we do not rid our ſelves of this Warre by the Spring, we ſhall ſee this Kingdome fill'd and infeſted by Forraigne Armies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, if the King and wee were now One, and ſhould joyne in one way, we ſhould finde worke more then enough to make up the torne, broken, ſhatterd Pieces that lye preſently before us in two Kingdomes: What then ſhall we doe in greater Diſtractions, in greater Neceſsities, in greater Perplexities ſtill growing upon us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jf but</hi> Ireland <hi>were loſt, the Jriſh would prove the moſt dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that ever this Kingdome had. They would ſoone grow rich, by the opportunity of their ſcituation for</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:123984:4"/>
               <hi>Trade, they would ſoon grow ſtrong in Shipping, having ſo many good Harbours, and then confederated with other Enemies, what Miſchiefe, what Ruine may they not bring upon us? But what may ſooner come from thence J will not mention. No man is able to ſee thorow the miſeries that neerly threaten us, even ready to fall upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore (Maſter Speaker) let us as wiſe Men, as charitable Chriſtians, as loving Subjects, ſend Propoſitions of</hi> Peace <hi>to the King. J do verily beleeve, that God will bleſſe us more in a Treaty, then in more Bloud. His will be done.</hi>
