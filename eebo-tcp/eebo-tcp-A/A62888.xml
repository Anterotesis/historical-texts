            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

inexpedient (as there is good cause to
believe, that the most considerable
Persons, and those in no small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
among them, do suppose no more)
then I would fain know, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expediency
alone is a sufficient and
just cause of Separation? And how
well soever any particular man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them may think of the Grounds
of his own Separation; there is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good evidence, that there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
among themselves who do
plainly perceive, and much lament it,
that by the means of this present Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
there hath been an entrance
made for such Doctrines and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into this Nation, which are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with (to phrase it modestly) the
very highest degrees of inexpediency.
When the rule and measures of inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency
are well considered of, and
regard is had to that great variety of
Respects in which one and the same
thing may be both expedient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expedient;
it will then be found, that
inexpediency is a thing, which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98410:6"/>
persons cannot easily determine,
indeed are no competent Judges of:
Besides if it were a clear case, that in
the present settlement there were
something not altogether so expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
as were to be wished: Is this a
sufficient warrant for any not only to
mislike so much of the Law as they
think capable of being mended, but
withall openly and avowedly to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
to unite and joyn in great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations
against the Publick Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
only because they are not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
in their esteem, at all possible
degrees of perfection? He who can
submit to no Law but such a one as is
exactly made to his own mind in all
particulars, must resolve, for any
thing I know, never to obey, as long
as he lives, any Law which is not of
his own making; and not only so, but
he will find that he must not obey
many Laws of his own making for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
long time neither: If therefore a
supposed inexpediency be the utmost
of the charge, as I suppose in the end
it will appear to be, then all wise men
should consider with themselves, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98410:7"/>
any fancied Alteration can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from equal, if not greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?
And before that any such Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
be made, it seems to be but just
and equal that the New Model be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon by those who do design
it, and that it be proposed either to
our Governours, or to the publick
view, that it may be examined, before
admitted; and seeing that it is to be
of lasting Consequence, it is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
that it will not be too hastily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
upon.</p>
            <p>A late ingenious Person set forth an
handsome Discourse upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
entituled, <hi>Of the Religion of</hi>
England, <hi>asserting, that Reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
setled in its due Latitude is the
Stability and Advancement of this
Kingdom.</hi> Wherein he hath attempted
something like a Model of a future
Settlement; his Discourse is plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and desires seem to be bent on
Peace, and many of his Principles
look as if they did seem to tend much
that way, but there seems to be this
one thing very observable in his
whole way of Writing, that with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98410:7"/>
great Art he doth very dexterously
take care not to come too close up to
the Argument, and he brings his
Reader even to the very Point where
the business lies, and almost unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably
steals by and passeth on to
something else; and to a narrow view
it will appear plainly, that he keeps
himself within the compass of such
wide Generalities, that he leaves the
Reader in the same uncertainties in
which he found him. The Draught
of his Design is to be seen, <hi>Sect.</hi> 14.
<hi>pag.</hi> 28. which doth consist in these
three Contrivances. First, <hi>That there
is to be an established and approved Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi>
But, because that this alone he
finds not to be sufficient; therefore
in the second place, there is to be a
Provision for a sort of men who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come within the establishment,
and <hi>they are to be tolerated under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Restrictions:</hi> Nor is this all; for
neither the establishment alone is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
neither will a Toleration of
Dissenters from it suffice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the third place, there are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort of men, <hi>who must be only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98410:8"/>
at.</hi> Each of these Particulars
are afterwards considered: The esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
hath the honour of the first
place, and hath, as it well deserves,
incomparably the greatest part of the
pains bestowed upon it, and of this
he tells us, <hi>Sect. 15. That it must not
be loose and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>herent, but well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted,
that it may attain the ends of
Discipline, which are to promote sound
Doctrine and Godly Life, and keep out
Idolatry, Superstition, and all wicked Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and Practice that tends to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing
of the power of Christianity:
Now these things do not require a consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of narrower bounds than things
necessary to Christian Faith and Life,
and godly Order in the Church,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now is it not very plain, that such
a Comprehension as is here described,
that it shall be enabled to attain all
these great and publick ends here
provided for, hath left no place for
Toleration or Connivance? and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
both those things are hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together, and in a very few words
dispatched, <hi>Sect. 18. pag.</hi> 38. I shall
lay them down and leave the Reader
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98410:8"/>
to judge upon them: <hi>As for others
that are of sound Belief and good Life,
yet have taken in some Principles less
congruous to National Settlement, I
would never be a means of exposing them
to oppression, Contempt and Hatred, but
would admit their Plea as far as it
will go,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nevertheless, their Liberty
pleaded for is not to be inordinate but
measured and limited by the safety of
true Religion in general, and of the
publick and established Order,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And now I shall take leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
those Persons, who cannot come
within the Comprehension, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with themselves, how very little
they are beholding to this their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate;
he hath not in the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
to us what kind of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
those are which he would have
connived at, as <hi>being only less congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to a National Settlement;</hi> nor
given us any manner of mark where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to know them: Besides, whatever
Favour he doth intend for these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Brethren, he hath so clogged
it with many Qualifications and Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that he hath rendred it so
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98410:9"/>
plainly useless, that I much doubt
whether he did ever really intend
them any favour at all. First, <hi>They
must be of sound Belief and good Life,</hi>
Secondly, <hi>Their Plea must be admitted
as far as it will go;</hi> Now how far that
is he hath not told us: Thirdly,
<hi>Their Liberty must not be inordinate,</hi>
but must have two measures; First,
<hi>The safety of Religion in general:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>The safety of the publick esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Order.</hi> Upon these Terms, and
upon the whole matter, I think, that
it is no easier a thing to understand
the Nature and Bounds of that Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
which our Author is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing,
by the placing of several
sorts of men in the three Ranks of,
First, an establishment; Secondly, a
Toleration; and thirdly, a Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
with this Reason, for the two
latter; For <hi>if God hath received them,
why should their fellow-servants reject
or afflict them causlesly? Every true
Christian should be tender of all that
love the Lord Iesus in sincerity;</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
I say, as little by all this,
what those Particulars are which he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98410:9"/>
would have from us, as if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
himself with Mr. <hi>Sterry's</hi> three
Forms of Believers; and methinks
the one Harangue is as edifying and
intelligible as the other: <hi>Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
one another into the Glory of God,
as Christ receiveth us, though that
cloathing of the outward form be not
on the same fashion in all, nor on some
so well shaped as on others, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the Body, which is Christ.
The Lord Iesus hath his Concubines, his
Queens, his Virgins; Saints in remoter
jorms, Saints in higher forms, Saints
unmarried to any Form, who keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
single for the immediate embraces
of their Love,</hi> in his Epistle before
<hi>England's</hi> Deliverance from the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Presbytery.</p>
            <p>Now In these two Gentlemen of
very differing Dispensations, there
are three sorts of People proposed to
our Care, and it is not unlikely that
they may be suited each to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But this one thing is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in that Discourse of Mr. <hi>Sterry,</hi>
that the Presbyterians can, at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
best, hope for no higher Rank than
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98410:10"/>
that of Christ's Concubines, as being
according to the tenor of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
if at all Saints, at the very best,
Saints in the remoter Forms. The
more moderate sort of Independents
may indeed by him be accounted
Queens, as being <hi>Saints in higher
forms,</hi> but for Christ's Virgins, <hi>who
are unmarried to any form, and keep
themselves single for the immediate em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
of their love;</hi> I cannot imagine
who these should be, unless those
Saints who are above Ordinances:
And for my own part, I must freely
profess, that for all the account which
our Author hath given us of his three
Contrivances of Comprehension, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
and Connivance, I cannot at
all perceive but that Mr. <hi>Sterry</hi>'s way
of sorting out the several Ranks of
Saints, doth well suit with, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to it: And here let any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
man judge, whether the Settlement
pretended for in the first of these
three Proposals be not absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled
again in the two other.</p>
            <p>But in the next place I must go on
to consider a Pretence, much oftner
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98410:10"/>
supposed than owned, and that is this;
Suppose that the Terms of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church are not only
inexpedient, but really sinful; if so,
then I shall readily grant, that the
Church ought not to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with, while the Terms of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
are such. But in this part of
the Argument I shall presume to say
with some confidence, and I hope
without offence, that however the
Teachers of the separated Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may sometimes slily insinuate
some such Jealousies into the Heads
of their unwary Hearers; yet it is
not easie to find a considerable man
amongthem, who will not be ashamed
to own it publickly, or who doth
himself really believe it.</p>
            <p>Now though this Assertion may
seem to carry something of unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness
in it; because that the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the Church is so avowed
and pressed upon the People, as if that
it were highly necessary, and that
Communion with the Church was
highly criminal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at least in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Teachers. It being a plain
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98410:11"/>
case that the People are wheedled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Separation, upon the account that
they suppose their Teachers know it
to be unlawful: Now as to this, I
must needs say, it is shrewdly to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that there is in this case a very
great Cheat imposed by the Preachers
and the People upon one another, and
by both upon the whole Nation;
because that it is as often evident as
there is occasion for making it so,
that among the Pastors and the Flock
there are not many, who in a time of
Tryal approve themselves to be in
good earnest; I have been credibly
informed (not to say that I am able
to make it good) that Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> did
before His Majesty, and divers Lords
of the Council profess, that there was
not any thing in the Constitutions of
the Church to which he could not
conform, were it not for the scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
of others; so that in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
the Constitutions of the Church
were in themselves Innocent, and the
whole Objection against them lay in
the mistakes of other men. Mr.
<hi>Tombs</hi> the Leader of the Anabaptists,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98410:11"/>
hath writ a Book to shew the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of resorting to the Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.
The Author which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned assures us in behalf of
the Presbyterians, that they not only
<hi>maintain the Doctrine of the Church
of</hi> England, <hi>but likewise communicate
in her Publick Worship,</hi> in his second
Discourse of the Religion of <hi>England,
pag.</hi> 17. By which acknowledgment
we may take an estimate of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
of their Separation.</p>
            <p>Nay, I shall venture to say thus much
farther, that the lawfulness of joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Publick Worship is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the Layety as well as Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
amongst them, is evident from
these three Things: First, that there
are those Persons to be named, who
came to Church before the Act of
Oblivion, who never did since: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that immediately after the
Act of Uniformity, whilst the Hopes
of Toleration were very uncertain,
there was a much greater Conformity
both in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and over
the whole Nation than ever hath
been since: Thirdly, that I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98410:12"/>
and could never learn that
there was so much as one example to
be given of any one of all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
or Proselytes of the Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
who did leave the smallest Office
whatever, rather than he would, in
obedience to a late Act of Parliament,
joyn in the Prayers and receive the
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Order of the Church
of <hi>England:</hi> From which it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
plainly, that in these mens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,
either there is no sin in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or else, that these Gentlemen of
so extreamly tender Consciences, can
deliberately commit a sin, and that
when they are performing the most
solemn Act of Adoration of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, and with all the shews of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
imaginable: And seeing that
these things are so, is it not huge pitty
that a setled Church, and a Church
in great Reputation over all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Parts of Christendom, should
be run down by a meer noise of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
when it is very plain that
when ever there is a real Case put,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98410:12"/>
where Conscience ought to shew it
self, that then no such thing appears,
neither is there the least evidence
that it is so much as thought upon.</p>
            <p>If there be any Objection against
the present Constitution; it must be
either against the Articles, the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
the Canons or the Ceremonies;
As to the Articles, there is scarce so
much as one Objection pretended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, farther than as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the following Heads; and if
there were, such an Objection could
not easily be alleadged by the People
as a just excuse for their Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
because they are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for to subscribe them, unless
they bring upon themselves a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Obligation by some Act of their
own, as taking a Degree in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity:
But in this Point many words
are needless; for besides the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of all Churches abroad, we
have at home two Witnesses beyond
all exception to the Innocency and
Honour of the Articles, even the two
late celebrated Advocates, the one
for Comprehension, the other for To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98410:13"/>
The former assures us in the
behalf of those whose Cause he pleads,
that <hi>they do receive the Doctrine of
Faith contained in the Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
pag. 2. and again pag. 22. <hi>That
they heartily embrace the</hi> English <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
established by Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and
that they do assent to the Doctrine of
Faith contained in the Articles of the
Church of</hi> England, <hi>and worship God
according to that Faith,</hi> pag. 22. <hi>The
Peace-offering</hi> doth likewise bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for us of that great esteem which
is bore unto the Articles of the
Church of England in all the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Churches abroad, and withal doth
assure us in behalf of the Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
at home, that as to <hi>all which is
purely doctrinal in them they do fully
embrace and constantly adhere to,</hi> &amp;c.
And accordingly he undertakes to
profess in the name of them all; <hi>We
have no new Faith to declare, no new
Doctrine to teach, no private Opinion to
divulge, no Point or Truth do we profess,
no not one, which hath not been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
taught, divulged and esteemed as
the common Doctrine of the Church of</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98410:13"/>
England, <hi>ever since the Reformation,</hi>
pag. 13.</p>
            <p>Thus far therefore our way is clear,
that the Doctrine of the Church is
sound and esteemed to be so in the
Opinion of its greatest Adversaries.
In the next place therefore we are to
consider, whether any reasonable Plea
for Separation can be drawn from any
just Exception which may be taken
against the Liturgy; and here there
are two sorts of men to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
First, those who dislike all
Forms of Prayer in general: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
those who are only disgusted
at some particular things in ours.</p>
            <p>As to those who are against all
Forms of Prayer; I believe that the
number of them, among considering
Persons, is not so great, as that any
great regard ought to be had unto
them; and this must needs be so, for
a reason which can never fail; For it
cannot choose but seem strangely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and infinitely unbecoming the
great distance which is between us and
Almighty God, and that great awe
which we ought to bear unto him;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98410:14"/>
that all the Expressions of the Publick
Devotion of every Congregation in
the whole Nation should be left to
the arbitrary, and especially the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
conception of each single
Person, who is bold enough to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon the taking so much upon
him. It were very strange if this
Kingdom should at this day be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
how very frequently Folly, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
nay and Blasphemy, hath been
uttered in such kind of Prayers; and
it is utterly impossible, that upon the
indulgence of any such Liberty, such
Extravagancies, can with any security
be provided against; And it is not
unlikely that the greatest Pretenders
to the highest Attainments in that
way would be not a little out of
Countenance; If so be that their
own Prayers were faithfully taken
from their Mouths, and after some
reasonable space of time, when they
might be supposed to have forgot
them, presented to their view. And
that which renders this evil utterly
intolerable, is this, that these Prayers
which either really are extemporary
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98410:14"/>
else only pretended to be so) are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that pretence recommended and
regarded by the People as the only
way of praying by the Spirit; and
by that very means the ever blessed
Spirit is, as far as these mens endeavours
can be succesful, entituled to all the
Follies, Vanity, and Weaknesses, all
the Sin and Errour, and even those
very Blasphemies which are every
day committed against him. And I
think all good Christians are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to endeavour, that if a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
must be given to these Persons
to go on and to abuse the People,
yet however that it may be done
some other way, and they not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to bely the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>As for Forms of Prayers, the great
reasonableness and even necessity of
them is very apparent, and in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it self there are Examples enough
to be produced; and if any man
pleaseth to enter upon that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I no way doubt but there will
be those found who will debate it
with him. It shall suffice at present
only to say, that our Saviour Christ
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98410:15"/>
did compose a Form of Prayer, and
gave it to his Disciples to use: Now
if, as great numbers of the People are
brought to believe, that there is no
praying by the Spirit, besides praying
<hi>Ex tempore,</hi> then no man ever did, or
ever could say Christ's Prayer by the
Spirit of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now, as to the other sort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who have some exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
some expressions in our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
those things have been so fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
that of late we have heard ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little of them: And the matter of it
is all along so clearly unexceptionable,
and so fitted for the common use of all
Christians, that all controversial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
were designedly avoided: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that I do not know of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Sect amongst us which may
not joyn with us in every expression in
it, except the <hi>Socinians.</hi> Now here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some Jealousies may arise in the
minds of men, that if there were not
some real exception against the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
then so many good Teachers
would not lay it aside; nay, and not
only so, but, as far as mens Intentions
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98410:15"/>
can be guessed at by their words and
actions, very much abhor it.</p>
            <p>Now, as to the behaviour of our
dissenting Brethren in this particular,
I shall desire their admirers to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this one thing, that His Majesty
not long after His Happy Restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orth a Declaration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Ecclesiastical Affaires, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
He did very graciously indulge,
much to the dissatisfied Part of the
Clergy, in hopes thereby to win up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; and in that Declaration He
did propose this unto them, as a way
whereby they might shew their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
for so great a Condescention,
<hi>That they would read so much of the
Liturgy as themselves had no exception
against:</hi> But with many of them He
could not prevail for so much as one
Syllable, not one Collect, no nor so
much as one Chapter according to
the Rubrick; So much doth yielding
work upon that good-natur'd Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Now whether this Refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness,
as to the whole Book, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part and parcel of it, could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
proceed solely and altogether
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98410:16"/>
from Conscience, and not very much,
if not altogether, from Design or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
let their best Friends speak.</p>
            <p>In the next place, now as to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
I do not know that there doth

               </gap>ly any Objection against them
which our present Debate is concerned
about; because they are no immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Parts of the Publick Worship, and
therefore can be no cause of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Separation, especially as to the
People. As to the Canons made in
the year 1640. I must needs confess,
that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commissioners did
complain much against them, and
some <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen made witty
Speeches upon them; but they had
both of them the ill luck to confess
the real cause of the Pique which
they had against them, <hi>viz.</hi> The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of His Majesties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as being Independent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all Coercion, either Papal or
Popular. A Doctrine which I must
needs say was very inconsistent with
those Designs which those angry Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots
were at that time carrying on.
And I am very much mistaken if, at this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98410:16"/>
very day, a great part of that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
which is taken up against the
Church be not founded upon this,
that it is too faithfully devoted to
the Interests of the Crown; and that
many Persons are Presbyterians, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
Fifth-Monarchy-men,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as so many sanctified disguises un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they act the Part of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths-men.</p>
            <p>In the next place come we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the Ceremonies; and there
indeed the noise is very great. An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Person, who for his pious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
upon a noble Argument, and
much more worthy of his Pen, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
much honour, hath in this part
of the Question exprest much more
Concern, than, I hope, himself upon
a serious review will admit the Cause
to bear, in a Book entituled, <hi>Liberty
of Conscience upon its true and proper
Grounds asserted and vindicated,</hi> &amp;c.
hath thus expressed himself, <hi>p. 49. How
may we lament over the present Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ceremonies now enjoyn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us in</hi> England, <hi>which are no
part of divine Truth, nor any of Christ's
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98410:17"/>
Institutions, but things perfectly Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
in their Creation; and yet are
enforced by the Civil Power upon the
Practice and Consciences of men.</hi> Now
here, with all due respect to that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gentleman, I shall desire him to
take notice, whether it be not an
Excellency and a Felicity almost pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that
in all her Constitutions, her greatest
Adversaries are forced to betake
themselves to the scanning of a few
Ceremonies, to find a cause, or, to
speak more properly, a shew of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie;
and that himself in his own
great Judgment hath not been able
to find out any other flaw in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of all her Laws, as much soever as
he doth mislike the Imposition of
them. As for the Cermonies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the Exceptions, or at least the
Clamours are very many; That they
are uncommanded by God; that they
are significant; that they are Will-worship;
that they are teaching for
Doctrines of God the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men; and lastly, that they
do give scandal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98410:17"/>As to the Ceremonies being uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by God, I never heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man who pretended them to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
and therefore it is most
clear and certain, that that Church
doth not teach for Doctrines of God
the Commandments of Men, which
doth own publickly, that these are
not the Doctrines of God, but only
the Commandments of Man: And if
any man doth mistake in this Case,
which is a thing incredible that any
should do so; but if there be such a
one, I am sure that the mistake is his
own and not the fault of the Church:
For she hath taken care to prevent
it, in the Chapter of Ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Common Prayers, wherein
she declares that the Ceremonies which
are retained, <hi>are retained for Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Order, which upon just Cause
may be altered and changed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are not to be esteemed equal with
Gods Law.</hi> But however, this is plain
in the nature of things, that although
among the Ceremonies no one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
is necessary, yet in general it
is necessary, so far as Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98410:18"/>
is necessary, that some such there
should be.</p>
            <p>But in the next place there is an
Objection, supposed to be of much
greater force, and that is this; That
the Ceremonies are significant:
And here I must needs confess, that if
they could have alledged, that the
Ceremonies had been insignificant,
the Objection had been much more
worthy of having some notice taken
of it; because that the very nature
and whole use of Ceremonies doth
consist in being significant. And in
this I appeal to all Mankind, whether
in any one Action Sacred or Civil,
any one Ceremony was ever institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
unless it were in order to the
signifying, denoting or expressing
something by it. Nor is thisall; for
the Church hath taken care not only
to vindicate the Innocency, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to declare the usefulness of the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy
of her Ceremonies in the
fore-mentioned Preface; <hi>That they
are neither dark nor dumb Ceremonies,
but are so set forth that every man may
understand what they mean and to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98410:18"/>
what use they do serve: so that it is not
like that in time to come they should be
abused.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after all this, methinks, our
Brethren of the Presbytery should for
their own sakes have had a great care
of making use of this Objection, as
being themselves as liable to it as any
other Persons. The Authors of the
Admonition to the Parliament in
Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days, Part 2. have
recommended Sitting at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon this very superstitious
score of Significancy (as in our Case
they always call it) in these words:
<hi>As in the Old Testament eating the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Lamb standing, signified a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to pass; even so in the receiving it
now sitting, after the example of Christ,
we signifie Rest, that is, a full finishing
thorough Christ of all the Ceremonial
Law, and a perfect Work of Redemption
wrought, that giveth rest for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in our own dayes, in that
which by them was looked upon as a
considerable Act of Divine Worship
and Religious Adoration, the entring
into a Publick Solemn National Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98410:19"/>
with Almighty God, as they
phrase it: The doing of this was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
with several Ceremonies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded
in Scripture, and by
themselves intended to be very signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant;
as it to be found by every one
who pleaseth to look in the Ordinance
of <hi>Febr.</hi> 2. 1643. In this Case without
referring us to any Book, Chapter, or
Verse; they thought it sufficient to
say, That it is ordered and ordained
by the Lords and Commons in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
that the said Covenant be <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly</hi>
taken in all places, <hi>and for the
better and more orderly taking thereof,
that these Directions ensuing are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and enjoyned to be strictly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed:</hi>
Of which Directions the
thirteenth is this, the manner of
taking it to be thus; <hi>The Minister
to read the whole Covenant distinctly
and audibly in the Pulpit, and during
the time of reading thereof the whole
Congregation to be uncovered</hi> (which
by the way is a much greater shew of
Reverence than they have taken care
for, either at the reading of the Ten
Commandements, or our Saviour's
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98410:19"/>
Sermon upon the Mount) <hi>and at the
end of reading thereof all to take it
standing, lifting up their Right Hand
bare.</hi> Now I think that it is highly
requisite for these men to consider
with themselves, whether every one
of all their own Pleas of the Purity
and Simplicity of the Gospel way of
Worship without the mixture of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Inventions, and their bold sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of invading the Throne of Christ
by determining those things which
Christ hath left free, have any the
least force against the Ceremonies of
the Church, which they have not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this prescribed Formality of
their own, in taking the Covenant.</p>
            <p>But after all which is possible to be
said in order to the clearing of the
mistakes about the Ceremonies, there
is an Objection which is supposed not
to be capable of any answer to be
made unto it; and that is this, That
be they what they will in themselves,
good men are offended at them, they
grieve thousands of the Godly Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and though we should grant
such men to be mistaken, yet we must
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98410:20"/>
not offend our weak Brethren.</p>
            <p>The Case of Scandal hath been so
often and so clearly stated, that I
shall say the less upon it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
instead of the Argument, I shall
rather choose to say something to
the Persons who use it. In the first
place I shall readily grant, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Persons are really <hi>offended</hi> at the
use of the Ceremonies, in their own
way of understanding that word,
they must needs be very weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and I shall only ask them the
old Question, <hi>How long they will be
weak?</hi> And I shall profess my self to
have no very honourable Opinion of
the means of Knowledge, the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of choyce Attainments which
are to be had in the Conventicles:
If so be that those, who are such weak
Brethren as not to be got above such
silly Scruples, are looked upon to be
sufficiently gifted to be Publick
Teachers amongst them.</p>
            <p>In the next place I shall ask, who
taught the People to be offended at
a few harmless Ceremonies? Who
raised all their causless Scruples, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98410:20"/>
so many senceless Jealousies, and
not being content to have at first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
these needless fears, do still go
on to nurse up and cherish them? Who
first betrayed great numbers into fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ever after continued to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
them in it? He who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himself, and yet refuseth to do
so, for fear lest his Auditory and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
should abate in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
or contributions towards him;
If he means sincerely, &amp; to shew himself
an honest man, he ought to deal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with his Admirers, &amp; tell them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
what himself thinks, communicate
the Satisfaction which he hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and perswade them not to be long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
needlesly afraid where no fear is:
It is very plain that the generality of
Dissenters do entertain wild suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about the Service of the Church,
upon no other ground than an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
faith which they have in the
skill and honesty of their Teachers.
Such and such a one is a very precious
and knowing man, and do you think
that he would not conform, if he did
not know Conformity to be a sin?
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98410:21"/>
The Pastor and his Flock in this Case
do mutually guide and are guided by
each other; he makes it his business
to please and humour them,, and
they look upon it as a great mark of
their Judgment, and an infallible
token of their Election to admire
him.</p>
            <p>But if the weakness of these our
Brethren hath so great a privilege
entailed upon it, as that we must do
nothing which they have taken a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
against; a thing in it self lawful
and imposed by lawful Authority,
must immediately become unlawful,
if so be that any scrupulous man can
be brought to entertain a foolish jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
about it: Then is this kind
of weakness endued with a very
strange degree of Omnipotence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that upon this supposition, the
very mistakes of men are able to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Nature of things; A thing in
it self innocent, doth according to
this Doctrine, immediately become
unlawful, as soon as ever that any
fanciful deluded man doth errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
conceive it to be so; But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98410:21"/>
that those who pretend to be
such eager asserters of Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
as this sort of men have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
done, should, of all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
the least endure to have it thus
trifled with; as to have it believed to
be openly exposed to lie perpetually
at the mercy of all the Humour, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
Artifice, Cheat and Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>But if this be the meaning of those
Texts of Scripture, where we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to avoid the giving of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
(as most certainly and evidently
it is not) That the Actions of all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Men, and the Authority of all
Publick Constitutions must be as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
over-ruled as any single Person is,
either by his own Folly or by the Arts
of other men, imposed upon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
evil of them; then can no man
tell in any matter of Action Sacred or
Civil (except in the Matters of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
and plain divine Precept) what
one thing shall be lawful for him to do
in the very next moment.</p>
            <p>But if it be thus appointed by the
Apostle, That the mistakes of other
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98410:22"/>
Men, though we should suppose them
to be well-meaning ones, are to have
so uncontrollable an influence upon
the Actions of all private Persons, and
the Decrees of all Publick ones; If it
be thus, I say, it will thence follow
very apparently, that there is a great
necessity lying upon the Government,
of taking care what kind of Persons
are intrusted with teaching the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For if Conscience, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so erroneous, are of right, and by
Apostolical appointment to have so
great a regard had unto them; then
of all things great circumspection
should be used, and security taken,
for the Understanding and Honesty
of all those who are intrusted to be
Guides of Consciences. For if the
Errors of Conscience are things of so
great Authority, as to be an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<hi>Supersedeas</hi> to our whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Liberty, to all sorts of Humane
Laws, then it is the greatest Phrenzy
imaginable, to grant a promiscuous
Liberty to whoever pleaseth to teach
and instruct the People. Alas! the
Vulgar are easily imposed upon; and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98410:22"/>
it is not impossible but that we may
find in our days, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> did in
his, That there are those <hi>who will
speak lyes in hypocrisie because of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;</hi>
and bring their Auditories to
admire those very Doctrines which
themselves do heartily despise; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
court their Hearers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
laugh at them. And in the
mean time, are not Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
like to be at a very fine pass?
when who so pleaseth shall have the
Privilege of making all possible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of that very Scruple which
himself was Author of; and, when
all other Objections fail, shall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to plead his own exemption
from all Obedience to the settled
Constitutions, from the dissatisfaction
of other men, who, if it had not
been for him, had never entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the least thought of being dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p>But in the next place it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
urged, That those Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
are not looked upon as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
which were always looked
upon as such in former days; but there
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98410:23"/>
are newer and straiter Bonds added
to them; a new Declaration of
Assent and Consent: And besides all
this, the Consciences of men are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
which otherwise would have
remained silent, if not satisfied; new
Scruples are raised in the Minds of
Men, which before lay buried, and
which would otherwise have been
quite forgot; in that it is not thought
sufficient that the Covenant should be
laid aside, but that it should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
renounced; and not only so,
but it is required that men must
swear not only for themselves, but
that no man else is obliged by
it.</p>
            <p>Now after all this wonder, there is
not any one Thing which is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easily accounted for: For surely
it hath been among men not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual,
nor in it self strange, that where
former securities have been found too
slight, to add others to them. As for
the Declaration of Assent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
the addition which it doth make
to the former Subscriptions is not so
considerable, as to raise a scruple in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98410:23"/>
the mind of any man who was real
in them. And I suppose that the great
Mystery which is pretended to lie in
the terribie sound of Assent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
which the People are taught to
be affrighted at, as if some dismal
meaning were hid under it, is nothing
else but an Art to raise their Jealousie,
that so they might be the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the finding out some
plot or other in the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of the Covenant. A thing
which was ordered not without great
cause; and it is very suspicious that
that Cause doth not only continue,
but increase, as appears but too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from this, That there is so great a
Clamour raised upon it. And this
Cause did in a great measure proceed
from themselves, and that great stir
which they made about the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Covenant, in the first and
second year immediately after the
Restoration of his Majesty, both from
Press and Pulpit: Parties were made
in the City, and endeavoured to be
made in Parliament, for the owning
of that Obligation. It was with great
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98410:24"/>
confidence urged, that it was <hi>A Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and National Oath, binding all
Persons of this Nation, whether they
did swear it personally or not, and all
Posterity after us in their particular
places; and all that shall succeed into
the Publick Places and Politick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of this Kingdom, to pursue the
things covenanted for: And this Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is for ever to remain and abide,
and by no Humane Act or Power to be
absolved or made void;</hi> as, amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> hath endeavoured
to prove at large in his famous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
on that Subject. And, to speak
the truth, if we once admit the
Grounds which this Party of Men do
go upon, what he doth alledge hath
great reason in it; it being very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that those Clauses which he
doth produce out of the Covenant,
do suppose all Posterity to be involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them: And this he urgeth not
as his own single Opinion, but as the
Sence of his whole Party; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Evidence of the thing, he
alledgeth, The Testimony to the Truth
of Jesus Christ and the Covenant, by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98410:24"/>
the <hi>London</hi> Ministers, <hi>Dec.</hi> 14. 1647.
several of which are at this present
Preachers to the separated Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
In which it is plainly declared,
That it is not in the Power of any
person or persons upon Earth to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with or absolve us from it. Nay,
the Power of Parliaments, which in
other cases is allowed to be large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
is in this bound up, as Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi>
tells us, <hi>p. 139. That the Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of Lords and Commons, and that
in their Publick Capacity as a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the House of Commons assembled
in their House, and in formality of the
Body of the Nation, with their Speaker
before them, went unto St.</hi> Margarets
<hi>Church in</hi> Westminster <hi>with the greatest
Solemnity imaginable, did, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
Body of the Kingdom, swear
this Covenant: which, as a farther Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
that it was a National Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
they caused to be printed with
their Names subscribed, and to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in all Churches, and in their own
House, as a Compass whereby (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to right, Reason and Religion)
to steer their then Debates, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98410:25"/>
TO ALL THAT SHOVLD
SVCCEED IN THAT PLACE
AND CAPACITY what obligation
did before God ly upon the Body of this
Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those who plead for the removal
of the Renunciation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
either they do believe, that the
Covenant doth oblige at this time,
or, that it doth not oblige; if they
do believe that it doth not oblige,
why may they not declare that they
do believe it not to do so? One Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
may indeed be given, why the
Preachers themselves may believe the
Covenant not to oblige, and yet that
they should by all means avoid the
declaring that they do thus believe;
and that is this, that they would have
the People believe it to have an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
although themselves believe it
to have none. A Perswasion this,
which, in some juncture of Affairs or
other, they may chance to make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great use of; and that this may
not be altogether incredible their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
hath not been one jot hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
than this amounts to in another
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98410:25"/>
part of the Controversie between us.
It is well known that there are among
them, and not among the meanest of
them who have believed the Liturgy
and Ceremonies to be very Innocent,
and yet could be never brought to
say one word to the People of this
their belief; But on the other side
now, if they are really perswaded
that the Covenant doth carry a lasting
Obligation along with it: In that
Case I shall not, during that Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of theirs, desire them to renounce
it; but withall I must crave their
leave to add this further, that during
that Perswasion of theirs, I think it
but reasonable, that the Government
should cast a very watchful eye over
them. And of this I shall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
from the Covenant it self,
wherein there are so many things, and
of such fatal and universal conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
covenanted for, that the
whole Nation is highly concerned
that no considerable Part of it should
look upon themselves, and every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
else, as lying under the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Oath of God, to watch all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98410:26"/>
opportunities wherein they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
such great and publick mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,

in <hi>England,</hi> if he keeps himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his own Place and Calling, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
either in the Preservation or
Alteration of the Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Scotland?</hi> Nay, by what
Authority can any Person in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
whatever, be he in what Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Capacity he will (His Majesty on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excepted, or those who act by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from Him) have any thing to
do with the Concerns in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
And secondly, this first Part of
the Article may upon very good
Grounds be supposed to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the remaining Parts of it:
For we are sworn to <hi>preserve the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Discipline,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of</hi> Scotland, and
withall, <hi>to bring the three Kingdoms to
the nearest Uniformity in Religion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith, form of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
Directory for Worship and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98410:27"/>
Catechizing;</hi> So that <hi>Scotland</hi> must
necessarily be our Pattern; and yet
in the same breath we are sworn to
reform <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Word of God, and the
Example of the best Reformed
Churches: And it is more than possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that our own Church, as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
by Law established, or at least
some other Church beyond the Seas,
may come altogether as near the
Word of God, as that of <hi>Scotland:</hi>
And what is to be done in that Case?
And in the third place, all the other
Dissenters whatever, besides the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
are highly concerned to see
that the Covenant is not looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a thing of any obligation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that that is express for Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and as such, is not less than ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
inconsistent with Liberty of
Conscience; and as hard thoughts
soever as the smaller Sects have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
concerning the Bishops; they
are much more concerned to secure
themselves against not a few, nor the
least Considerable, among their own
dear Brethren,</p>

               <p>That we shall in like manner, without

to sound Doctrine, and the Power

mens sins, and thereby be in danger to
receive of their Plagues; and that the
Lord may be One, and his Name One in
these Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>As to the former part of this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
that which concerns the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the established Government
of the Church, I shall only say this,
that the Modesty of these men is in
this case very admirable, and there is
no doubt to be made, but that in any
other Kingdom it would be thought
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98410:28"/>
to be so; in that they do expect to be
admitted into the Preferments of the
Church, and to be allowed to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Preachers in it; and yet at the
very same time, they do desire to be
excused from declaring, that they are
not of a Perswasion, that there doth
ly an obligation by Oath upon them
themselves, the whole Nation, or (to
say no more) at least upon some other
Person, who ought to be nameless, to
overthrow the whole frame of the
Government of that Church, which
they desire to be admitted into the
Preferments of, and particularly of
that Bishop by whose hands they are
admitted. I would fain know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any other Part of the
World, where any Persons dare to
demand of the present establishment,
that it would for their sakes so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax
it self, in order to their admission
into it. Sure these menimagine, that
the Church is in a very great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them, that it cannot stand one
moment without them; when, in
the very Terms of their Admission,
they do demand no less than this, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98410:28"/>
a new Law should be made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
whereby they may be privileged
from declaring, whether or no it is
lawful for them to suffer the Church
to continue two moments longer than
there shall arise an opportunity,
wherein they may be able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
it.</p>
               <p>As for the remaining Part of the
Article concerning <hi>Superstition, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
Schism, Profaneness, and whatsoever
shall be found contrary to sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or the Power of Godliness,</hi> &amp;c.
I shall leave that to our Friends of the
Presbytery and their Separating Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to dispute about it: And it is
clear enough, that they are altogether
as unlike to agree in those Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
as I am with either of them: As
lovingly as ever they may look upon
one another at present, I am sure that
the Covenant, when opportunity
serves, will be found to be levelled
as directly against the Conventicles,
as against the Cathedrals. I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
no more in this Article besides
the great Charitableness of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
<hi>That the Lord may be One and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98410:29"/>
his Name One in the Three Kingdoms:</hi>
As if the Church of <hi>England</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>We shall with the same Sincerity, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
and Constancy in our several Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
endeavour, with our Estates and

That the World may hear witness with

               <p>This Article hath been very much
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98410:29"/>
and very much insisted on and gloried
in for the seeming Loyalty of one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
in it: But, in order to a
right understanding; let us consider
how Affairs stood at that time: It is
well known, that the Compilers and
Enjoyners of this Covenant were, at
that very time, in actual Arms (I hope
that it is no offence, if I say in actual
Rebellion) against the King. This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Covenant was a great Instrument
by which they did carry on their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
then on foot against Him: The
King was betrayed and sold by one
part of the Covenanters, those from
<hi>Scotland,</hi> he was bought, imprisoned,
and in effect deposed by another part
of the Covenanters, those in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and by the most Loyal of them,
even the Lords and Commons Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at <hi>Westminster;</hi> who by their
Votes of Non-address, <hi>Febr.</hi> 17. 1647.
(which, let us note, was long before
the Seclusion by the Army) did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
First, <hi>That they will make no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Addresses or Applications to the
King:</hi> And in the fourth Vote, <hi>That
they will receive no more Messages from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98410:30"/>
the King, and do enjoyn that no Person
whatever do receive or bring any Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from the King to Both or either
Houses of Parliament, or to any other
Person;</hi> which Votes they published
with a Declaration, wherein they lay
down some few of those many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(as they express it) why they
cannot repose any more Trust in Him.</p>
               <p>Nay, long before that time, when
the <hi>Scots</hi> complained of some rigours
used towards His Majesty, as being
contrary to the Covenant, the House
of Commons did return them this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>Novemb. 18. 1646. We observe
that you mention the Defence of the King
twice, from the Covenant; but in both
places you leave out, in the preservation
of the true Religion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A main Clause
without which the other ought not to be
mentioned.</hi> Which very Answer
themselves did afterwards receive
from their own Army, in a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from St. <hi>Albans, Novemb.</hi> 18. 1648.
Where they reminded their Masters
of their own Doctrine, <hi>The Defence
of the King,</hi> say they, <hi>is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
with this restriction; In the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98410:30"/>
of,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or otherwise the whole
Proceedings of Both Kingdoms in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and maintaining War against Him
in Defence of Religion and Liberties
are questionable for breach of Covenant;
since that way of preserving did proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
tend to the destruction and was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any safe provision, either for his
Person, or that Authority which can
properly be called His, or understood in
Conjunction with His Person; but that
therein His Person might probably have
been destroyed under the Sword or by a
Bullet, yea was ordinarily endeavoured
to be so, as well as the Persons of others
in Arms with Him; and that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of His was certainly opposed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to be destroyed thereby, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being defended.</hi> Remonstrance
from St. <hi>Albans, P.</hi> 55.</p>
               <p>Indeed, about the time of the
King's Murther, many of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
did declare themselves a
little dissatisfied with that way of
Proceeding against Him; and did
(how reasonably upon their own
Grounds, I know not) urge the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
for His Preservation: But of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98410:31"/>
their Behaviour in this Case, I shall
give only the Account of an Author,
who lived in those times when they
had opportunities enough to have
taken what account of Him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
pleased. His Words are these,
in a Book entituled, <hi>A short View of
the Life and Reign of King</hi> Charles <hi>the
First, Monarch of Great</hi> Britain, <hi>pag.</hi>
94. <hi>The Presbyterians carried on this
Tragedy to the very last Act, from the
first bringing in of the</hi> Scots <hi>to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the War, and from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the War till they had brought
Him Prisoner to</hi> Holmby-House, <hi>and
then quarrelled with the Independents
for taking of the Work out of their
hands, and robbing them of the long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
fruit of their Plots and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
They cried out against them in their
Pulpits and clamoured against them in
their Pamphlets for that, of which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were at least parcel-guilty, Et si
non re at voto saltem Regicidae, &amp;c.
On the other side, the Independents, who
washed their hands in the blood of the
King, seemed as desirous as the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
to wash their hands of it: By them
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98410:31"/>
it was alleadged more calmly, that they
had put</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>to death, against
whom they proceeded as the Cause of so
much bloodshed; but that the King had
been muthered a long time before by the
Presbyterians, when they deprived Him
of His Crown, His Sword, His Scepter;
of His Crown, by forcing from Him
those Prerogatives which placed Him in
a Throne of Eminency above His People;
of His Sword, by wresting the</hi> Militia
<hi>out of His hands, by which He was
made unable to protect them; and of
His Scepter, in divesting Him of His
Power of calling Parliaments, and of
His Negative Voyce in making those
Laws by which He was to govern all
Estates of Men under His Dominion:
And more than so, they had deprived
Him of His Natural Liberty as a Man;
of the Society of His Wife, as he was a
Husband; of the Conversation of His
Children, as He was a Father; of the
Attendance of His Servants, as He was
a Master; and in a word, of all those
Comforts which might make Life valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a Blessing: So that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left for the Independents to do,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98410:32"/>
but to put an end to those Calamities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which this miserable man, this</hi> Vir
dolorum, <hi>as He might very well be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
had been so accursedly plunged by the
Presbyterians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I shall only add this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that notwithstanding all that
Loyalty which the Covenanters have
so often boasted of, from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant; yet it is well
known, that the Covenant was placed
by themselves as a bar between him
and his Throne, that without sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to this, they could not endure
to think of His Restauration to that;
and this to so high a degree, that even
in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1648. Notwithstanding
the apparent danger which the King's
Life was known to be in, yet even
then, the General Assembly of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
did violently oppose all courses
thought upon for His Relief, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
earnestly, <hi>That His Majestie's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
and Offers concerning Religion
may directly and positively be declared
unsatisfactory to the Parliament, and that
there shall be no engagement for restore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
His Majesty to one of His Houses
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98410:32"/>
with Honour, Freedom and Safety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Security and Assurance be had from
His Majesty by His Solemn Oath under
Hand and Seal; that He shall for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and His Successors consent and agree
to Acts of Parliament enjoyning the
League and Covenant, and fully esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
Presbyterian Government, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory
of Worship, and Confession of
Faith in all his Majesties Dominions;
and that his Majesty shall never make
opposition to any of these, or endeavour
any change thereof. Vid.</hi> Declar. of Jan.
10. 1648.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, seeing it is so plain
a Case, that in the Opinion of the
Compilers and Enjoyners of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
all the fore-mentioned Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
both might and ought to have
been used against the King, by vertue
and in pursuance of the Covenant:
It thence follows unavoidably, that
His Majesty is not a little concerned
to be very watchful over all those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who are so tender of the honour
of the Covenant, that they demand
it as the Condition of their Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into the Church, that they may by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98410:33"/>
no means be questioned concerning
their Opinion about its Obligation.</p>

the discovery of all such as have
been or shall be Incendiaries, Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
or evil Instruments, by hindering
the Reformation of Religion, dividing
the King from His People, or one of the
Kingdoms from another, or making any

and receive condign punishment, as
the degree of their offences shall require
or deserve, or the Supreme Iudicatories

               <p>It is very well known what the
meaning of <hi>Incendiaries and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>
is, in this Article: And it is
shrewdly to be suspected, That those
who are perswaded of the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Oath, are likewise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that those <hi>Incendiaries and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98410:33"/>
Malignants,</hi> have not as yet been
brought to condign punishment; and
whatever benefit the Covenanters
themselves may receive by an Act of
Oblivion, it is much to be suspected,
that those who are covenanted against
are looked upon as not capable of
receiving any advantage by it: And
there is reason to believe, that those
who scruple the Validity of that Act
of Parliament which declares against
the Obligation of the Covenant, are
by no means to be trusted, lest, if
opportunity should serve, they would
not likewise scruple the Validity of
that Act of Parliament which gave
them Indempnity. For thus, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their own Grounds, they may
argue, The Act of Oblivion is against
the Covenant, and then it followeth
in the next place, that it is against
their Consciences; It is against the
<hi>Oath of God lying upon themselves
and upon the whole Nation and upon
all Posterity,</hi> and no humane Act or
Power can absolve them or any one
else from it; and every thing done
against the Covenant is null and void,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98410:34"/>
the whole Nation being bound up by
it to all Ages. For therefore it was
<hi>That the Covenant was hung up in the
Parliament, as a Compass whereby to
steer their Debates, and to dictate
to all, who shall succeed in that place
and capacity, what obligation doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God lie upon the Body of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as I have before observed. Now
upon these mens suppositions, there
is no Security to be had, but that
they who passed an Act of Oblivion,
to pardon any thing done against the
Covenant, are involved in guilt and
liable to punishment for so doing;
and are upon those very accounts to
expect, when Providence shall put
an opportunity into the hands of these
Zealots, the very same Return which
the Prophet made to <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 King. 20.
v. 42. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, Because
thou hast let go a Man whom I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to destruction, therefore thy
life shall go for his life, and thy people
for his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing which I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in this Article is this, That those
Persons who covenanted together,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98410:34"/>
among other things, to maintain the
Liberties of the Kingdom, have so
far forgot themselves, as that in that
very Covenant they have set up an
Arbitrary Government: The Rule
of condign punishment here set down,
is not any known Law, no, not so
much as a new one of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
<hi>but, as the degree of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
shall require or deserve, or the
Supreme Iudicatories of both Kingdoms
respectively, or others having power from
them for that effect, shall judge conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</hi>
By which words it is plain,
that they did not look upon it as
sufficient to take an arbitary Power
into their own hands, but likewise did
delegate it to as many else besides as
they pleased.</p>

of the Yoke of Antichristian Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to joyn in the same or like Associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Covenant, to the Glory of God,
the Enlargement of the Kingdom of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and the Peace and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Christian Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been often said in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Presbyterians, that they
did not engage in the late War under
a less Authority than that of the Two
Houses of Parliament: What Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the Two Houses of Parliament
have in raising a War against the
King shall be no part of this Enquiry,
nor whether the Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who at that time staid at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
were the Two Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?
Be these two things as they
will, although it is not unknown what
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98410:37"/>
may be said as to both those Cases;
yet however the Covenant, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
us of another sort of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
under which a War may be raised
at any time against all the Kings in
<hi>Europe:</hi> Because in these words is
held forth a publick Invitation to
all Subjects whatsoever, who do
either really groan under, or are
in any danger of any thing, which
our folk have pleased to call, or
themselves shall chance to fancy to
be a Yoke of Antichristian Tyranny,
to enter either into this or the like
Association or Covenant. Now I
suppose, that it is no easie task to
make out, that all Kingdoms have
Parliaments endued with so large a
share of the Soveraignty, as that they
have Authority to take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their respective Princes: And
if there were such Parliaments every
where, this Invitation is only made
to the Christian Churches, without
taking the least notice of Parliaments;
nay with a full assurance that there
were no such Parliaments to be taken
notice of. So that by this Doctrine
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98410:37"/>
the Church alone may enter into as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation
against the State upon the
score of Religion (especially if it can
but cry out Antichrist) may engage
the Subjects of all <hi>Europe</hi> against
their Soveraigns, be they Princes or
Commomwealths.</p>
               <p>I know very well that those who
urge the taking away of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
enjoyned concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of the Covenant, have one
evasion whereby to avoyd entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the merits of the Cause, and that is
this, The seeming unreasonableness of
that Clause; Also <hi>I hold that there
lieth no Obligation upon me, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Person from the Oath commonly
called the Solemn,</hi> &amp;c. Is it not unjust
that one man should be bound to
swear to the Obligations of another?
As plausible soever as this may seem,
no doubt it is but an evasion; for it is
well known whom they mean by that
other Person whom they suppose to be
obliged; and besides to make this Case
seem much harder than it is indeed;
They endeavour to perswade us, that
this renunciation is what really it is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98410:38"/>
not; for it is plain, that this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not an Oath, nor any thing
like one, only we are called upon to
declare what our Opinion is in a Case
there put to us; we are so far from
being required in this Case unto the
swearing for any one else; that we
are not called upon to swear for our
selves, we do not swear that there
doth ly no Obligation either upon
our selves or any other Person, but
only that we do not believe that there
doth.</p>
               <p>And after all this, the pretence of
being scrupulous about declaring any
thing concerning <hi>the Obligation of
any other Person</hi> hath one great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in it: For, the very supposal of
the possibility of <hi>that</hi> is in effect to
say, that the Covenant as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it is in every particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
lawful; for unless it be lawful in
every particular respect, no Body can
be obliged by it; and if once it be
granted to be a lawful Oath, it will
be very easie thence to deduce that it
is obligatory to more Persons than
one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:98410:38"/>And thus I have taken a short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of the Covenant, wherein it is
very plain that there are many things
of such universal and dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
therein Covenanted for, as
do render it not altogether unworthy
the care of those who are in Publick
Places to consider a little with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
what the meaning of it is, that
so many men do profess themselves to
have so deep a sense of the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Covenant, as that a Law
must be made on purpose to gratifie
them in that humour: The Publick
Constitutions must veil to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Scruples, and with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of having the Wisdom of the
whole Nation confess it self to have
been all along mistaken, they expect
to be admitted Publick Preachers;
This Plea is such a one as doth look
as if it had some deep meaning in it,
and ought to be thoroughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
before admitted; I shall end
this Argument as I did begin it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Either
these men do believe that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
doth oblige, or, they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, if they do not believe it to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98410:39"/>
oblige, I cannot see what Honest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can be given why they should
scruple to declare this their Belief;
But on the other side, if they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
believe that the Covenant doth
oblige them, it is much more advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that this Perswasion should keep
them out of the Church, than that
they should bring this Perswasion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: And whereas the Law-makers
hoped that the Peevishness of this sort
of People would within some reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
compass of time have grown
weary of it self, and accordingly had
provided that the Declaration against
the Covenant should, within a few
Years, of course have become anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated;
the Clamours of these men
have given so reasonable a Jealousie
about their retaining their old Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as may well serve to awaken
the Caution of those in Authority, so
far as to put them in mind of giving
New Life to their Old Act, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
the terms of its Duration:
For seeing that the Dissenters do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
themselves so much upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
the Covenant; our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98410:39"/>
have no small Concern to let
it be seen, that neither do they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it.</p>
               <p>To all which hath been already
said, I shall add this one Thing; It may
not unjustly seem a Cause of much
wonder how it should come to pass,
that the Covenant should be looked
upon as a thing much more sacred
and indissoluble now than it was in
former Dayes; That Correspondence
which Mr. <hi>Ienkins,</hi> and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other <hi>London</hi> Ministers held with
the <hi>Scots,</hi> for the sake of which he
and others were cast into Prison, will
not be denied to be in pursuance of
the Obligation of the Covenant, and
of that Part of it which they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
glorying in, the Loyal and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
Part, as to the Authority of
His Majesty: Now I dare appeal to
any Member of his present Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
whether he hath not renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
this part of the Obligation of the
Covenant, in these following Words.</p>

               <p>Here is a plain Renunciation of all
the Obligation of the Covenant, so
far as respects the King; the good man
is quit by Providence, nay did not
that whole Party, as scrupulous as
ever they may now seem, from that
time forward ever afterward till the
laying aside the Family of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,</hi>
absolutely lay aside all thought
of any manner of Obligation either
to King or Covenant.</p>
               <p>And now after all these dangers
which will be perpetually impending
over us from the Covenant, and which
we can never be secure from, so long
as there is the least pretence remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among us, that that Oath is at all
obligatory; there is another thing
which may justly raise our wonder,
and may concern us much more than
the generality of us are aware, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what may the meaning of it;
and that is this, to consider how it
doth come to pass, that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98410:41"/>
and the other Sectaries do all at
present unite in the Common Plea of
Liberty of Conscience; For it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
plain that in this part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
between us, their Inclinations,
Judgements and Interests are very
different, and their Pleas utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent.
It is not so long ago, but
that some alive remember it, that the
sweet noyse of Liberty of Conscience
made a very pleasant sound, and the
Dissenters from the legal Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were all for a while hugely
taken themselves, and did endeavour
to charm each other with it; but
within the compass of a very little
time, they themselves could not tell
what to do with it, fell out with one
another about the Nature, Bounds,
and Limits of it; and even at this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day it is a clear Case, That any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Person, without the least en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
upon the Authority of his
Superiours, may sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ely undertake, that
all the Pretenders to Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in the whole Nation, shall eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them have their utmost wish,
in the very same moment that they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98410:41"/>
themselves shall all agree about it;
I must needs say that this Plea is at
the first view something specious, and
hath some shews of reason in it;
But if it be a little narrowly looked
into, it will be found to be a fine
word, which no body knoweth the
meaning of, a thing which looks pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
but is of no manner of use, which
very many Persons do admire, and
very few if any at all will in the least
endure.</p>
               <p>And to make this evident, let us
consider that this Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
must be either limited, or unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited;
If limited, it is by no means
to be called Liberty of Conscience;
nay, it is a plain giving up of the
Cause, for it is an actuall granting, that
Conscience is neither so sacred, nor
hath any Right to be looked upon as
so tender a thing, but that it both
may and ought to have bounds and
limits set unto it; and I believe that
there are Few men who are not of
this mind, or, if they are not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
a little experience will quickly
bring them to be of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:98410:42"/>Now if Conscience be to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
then they who do not like
those limits which the Law hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
set unto it should do well (when
they have obtained lieve for their so
doing) to propose those other Limits
which they see cause to desire; and
after they are agreed themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
those Limits, let them in a dutiful
manner offer them to their Superiours,
alledge their reasons, and among
them, let them by no means omit this
one, which they so often boast of and
triumph in, the great numbers, and
Quality of those Persons who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon those Bounds and Limits,
who will acquiesce and rest satisfied in
them: And without the doing of this,
the Raisers of all these Clamours do
nothing else but put an intolerable
affront upon the Wisdom and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Nation, to demand so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately
the Alteration of the
setled Constitution, in order to the
Gratification of no Body knoweth
whom, why, or in what, either how
far the Alteration is desired, or what
is designed to be the effect of any such
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98410:42"/>
Alteration. Let, I say, the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who take themselves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
enough to expect a publick
Change for their sakes, declare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Themselves and their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
We are they who do desire an
Alteration; we do desire it to be made
only thus far, and then we will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in it, and <hi>in our several places
and Callings</hi> (according to a known
reading) will endeavour to make all
others to acquiesce in it; and we
know, that all the Sober, Serious,
Peaceable, Godly, Knowing, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
Part of the Nation will joyn
with us in it.</p>
               <p>When the Noise-makers have done
this, then, and not before, it will be
seasonable to harken unto them: Upon
these Terms, I say, and only upon
these, their Proposals will be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to be taken into Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
When it is once known what
the desires of any Party are, then there
is room for enquiry, whether or no,
or how far they carry Reason in
them. And it may sometimes so
chance, that such demands as are not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98410:43"/>
altogether reasonable in themselves,
may yet in some sort be thought fit to
be complied with in regard of the
Number, Quality, Merits or Interest
of those Persons who appear to be
fond of them. In a Debate about
the alteration of a Legal Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there are Two things highly
considerable; 1. The Nature of the
Alteration it self; 2. The Nature of
those who desire it, who they are,
how many, and what kind of People.
Now these are things which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
alone are qualified to make out
unto us; and till they have done
that, Authority is scarce in a Capacity
to concern it self about it: For it can
have no Measures to take, nor propose
to it self any End; it can neither know
what Concessions to make, nor to
whom; can have no way the least as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
either what will satisfie, or
who they are who are to be satisfied.</p>
               <p>And as for the late device of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
the nature of of it is as yet
unknown, and he must be a bold Man
who will undertake for the Event of
it. As to that which is by ordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98410:43"/>
to be understood of it, it amounts
to no more than a pretty artifice of
saving the Reputation of about a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Persons, who are sick of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Separation from the Church, and
stand in need of a plausible Pretence
under which to return unto it: Their
credit will not suffer them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their old Principles, and they
are weary of sticking longer to them.
Now if the Pride of these Men should
be thus far gratified, who can secure
us of any great Effect from it? Will
their Hearers imitate their Teachers
in their compliance upon these Terms
or abhorr them for it? And if we had
any assurance in getting above these
Difficulties, yet however, as to all
those who do not come within the
Comprehension, every one of all the
Pleas of Liberty of Conscience and
Persecution remain as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
so that such a Purchase will be
upon no prudent estimate worth the
price we pay for it.</p>
               <p>These Two things therefore I take
to be very clear; First, that Liberty
with Bounds and Limits set to it, is not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98410:44"/>
Liberty of Conscience: 2. That if
any other Bounds and Limits are to
be set besides those which the Law
hath already set, it is very requisite,
indeed necessary, that those Limits
should be known before admitted, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon among themselves before
they be desired from their Superiours.
But because I very well know that
how reasonable soever this way of
procedure is in it self, yet that the
concerned Gentlemen will find more
than a few difficulties in it; I shall
therefore enquire a little into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Member of the fore-mentioned
Division, and that is, such a Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as is unlimited.</p>
               <p>And here I do freely confess this,
that all the Pleas which pretend to
shew the reasonableness and usefulness
of Liberty of Conscience do plainly
prove this, if they do prove any thing
at all: And the late Authour <hi>of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Reason</hi> hath been so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nester
than many of the Writers upon
this Argument, that he hath fairly
owned the Conclusion which his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
naturally do tend unto. Now
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98410:44"/>
that which here doth first offer it self
to our Consideration, is this: How it
doth come to pass that in this Part of
the Argument the Presbyterians of
late have observably been very silent?
There was a time when in this Case
their Zeal was as warm as any mans,
and nothing in the whole World was
in their esteem more frightful, more
intolerable than Toleration. In the
year, 1644. This Point of Indulgence
was a matter of high Debate, and the
Dissenters from the Presbyterian way
did desire the same Liberty from their
Impositions which they had both of
them before joyned in des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing from
the National Settlement; their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
were at least equal, they had
the same natural right to Freedom
which any other men had, they had the
same Pleas of Christian Liberty, and
besides all this they had another very
good title upon which they might
expect Indulgence from the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
in Point of Merit; the same
Arguments the Sectaries shewed to be
in common between them both, and
withall had this to add farther, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98410:45"/>
their Arms added that assistance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the Presbyterians could
never have been able to have brought
themselves into a condition, to have
enjoyed that Liberty as to themselves,
which the other Sects by their joynt
concurrence did put them into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to grant, and therefore very
well deserved to have received from
them. But in those dayes, their dear
Brethren, to whom they were much
beholding for their joynt concurrence
in Prayers and Arms; their mutual
Contributions of Blood and Treasure,
and whom at present they smile most
sweetly upon, did receive the harshest
usage which was in their Power to
give them, and it was no small matter
of publick complaint, that they were
not permitted to handle them with
much greater roughness: To omit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others there then came out a Book
entituled, <hi>Wholesome Severity reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Christian Liberty,</hi> Licensed by
<hi>Ia. Cranford,</hi> wherein we are told, that
<hi>Liberty of Heresie and Schism is no
part of the Liberty of Conscience which
Christ hath purchased for us, but that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98410:45"/>
under these fair Colours and handsome
Pretexts Sectaries infuse their Poyson,
their Pernicious, God-provoking; Truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defacing,
Church-ruinating and State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaking
Toleration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which Author I shall only add
the more <hi>Publick Testimony to the Truth
of Iesus Christ, and to our Solemn
League and Covenant, as also against
the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies of
these Times, and the Toleration of them,
subscribed by the Ministers of Christ
within the Province of London, Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
14. 1647. Which I have already
mentioned, but in this part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
shall insist something more
largely upon; because they were such
a Body of men as were looked upon
as very considerable, and sufficiently
qualified to speak the sence of their
whole Party to great advantage: And
besides that some of them are yet
living and Preachers at this day to
the separated Congregations about
the Town. Now I would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain know
of these Gentlemen, whether they
are of the same Judgment now about
Toleration, as they were then? if
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98410:46"/>
they are, then methinks they should
do very well to declare it, and so
much the rather, because that by their
behaviour one would guess that their
minds were altered; in that they do so
far comply as to joyn Counsels and
Interests with those whom formerly
they bore testimony against: Again,
if they are of the same mind about
Toleration now as they were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
then all the under Sects have
great Cause in time to beware of
them, ought to look upon them as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
false brethren, who want nothing
but opportunity to take away that
Liberty which now indeed is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them with the rest of their
Brethren, but they never intended it
for any but themselves. And on the
other side, if they are not of the
same mind about Toleration now as
they were formerly; then they ought
in all Honesty to declare to the
World how much they were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mistaken, in that they raised such
fearful Outcries against that Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is an innocent and an useful
thing; the giving of which is (as it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98410:46"/>
is now said) the Duty and Interest
of all Government, is indeed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the permitting to us that
Liberty with which Christ made us
free, or rather, which is the Right of
Nature, the Common Birth right of
all Mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Preface to the aforesaid Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
they tell us of</hi> the spreading
Heresies and cursed Blasphemies of those
Times, which had born down the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Scriptures and our Solemn
League and Covenant <hi>(very fitly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:)
And then they add,</hi> But above all

and to conclude, seeing we have just
cause to fear, that if this Toleration be
entertained among us, the Righteous
God of Heaven and Earth will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98410:48"/>

Therefore upon all these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
we the Ministers of Iesus Christ

with all such like, now too rife among us.</p>
               <p>It were endless to transcribe all
which hath been said by the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
against Toleration; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not a little strange, how
much for some years they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
after it: But sure their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
Brethren cannot be so forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of what hath been but so very
lately past, as not to cast a very
watchful Eye over them, to suspect
their kindness, and be hugely jealous
of their present Concurrence with
them; it being not very credible,
that their Moderation is greater than
formerly, and that which makes all
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98410:49"/>
the difference is no other thing than
this, That their Power is not altogether
so great. It hath been no unusual thing
in the World for men to unite in their
Endeavours in order to very differing
Ends; to dissemble for a while their
mutual Resentments, and to have less
kindness for those very Persons they
do cabal with, than for those whom
they do cabal against. A Common
Interest for a while keeps them close
together, and out of that they each
hope for their particular Advantages;
and both sides hug and applaud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
their own Arts and Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in that they see the way chalked
out how they shall be able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
their Friends, as well as ruine
their Enemies. Thus the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
may at present joyn their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
in attaining that Liberty,
which they hope in time to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
not only from those whom
they at present desire to grant it, but
likewise from those who now enjoy
it together with them: The Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
Anabaptists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must needs
remember how the Presbyterians bore
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98410:49"/>
testimony against that Toleration of
them which they could not hinder:
They could no more endure those
who fought on their side to dissent
from them, than they could those who
fought against them. Remember
(Gentlemen) you all fought for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience; and yet your
Fellow-soldiers would not allow you
that which you shed your Blood for,
and for their own obtaining of which,
they were much more beholding to
your Arms than to their own.</p>
               <p>The Pretences of all the differing
sorts of Dissenters are so vastly distant,
as to be utterly inconsistent; and
whatever Correspondence is between
them at present, it ought not to be
looked upon, either by themselves or
any one else, as any Union or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is of late made between
them, but merely as a Combination
against that Settlement which they
are all weary of; and as soon as ever
that is again overthrown, we shall
then see that all their old Quarrels
will return as formerly: The tender
Consciences of divers sizes will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98410:50"/>
fall as foully upon one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
as ever they did: Presbytery
will be stiled the Yoke of Antichrist,
and Independency the Mother of
Confusion; the one will be stiled <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
and the other, <hi>Babel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any Particular Sect among them
doth desire Indulgence, and means
nothing else besides a bare Permission
to serve God in its own way: If there
were nothing else but this in the Case,
its Request then would with all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
be put up single and by it self;
that so an account might be taken
both of the Principles and of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
how innocent the one, and how
peaceable the other; and what Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
either of them are like to have
upon the present Settlement either of
Church or State: And surely it ought
not to be looked upon either as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
or assuming, if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth look upon it self as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have a great regard to it self both
in point of Duty and in point of
Safety. And in such an Enquiry as
this, the Quality, Numbers, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Petitioners for such Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98410:50"/>
are of no small Consideration.
And this way of Procedure, that each
single Sect should speak by and for its
self, and state its own particular Case,
is methinks the fairest Course which
can be taken; and such a one as those
Dissenters, who are conscious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of no ill meaning, should look
upon as highly advisable for their
own sakes: It being very obvious to
the most ordinary Prudence, that it
may be frequently advisable upon
divers particular and material Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
to indulge some kinds of
Liberty to such and such sorts of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,
which is by no means fit to
allow to others; much less to allow
promiscuously to all. But to take that
course which they have always done
since his Majesties Restauration, that
they should all joyn in a common
Cry, as if they had one common Cause,
is very suspicious; especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that they are divided among
themselves in this very point of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Unanimity in calling for it.</p>
               <p>Some Rumours have of late been
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98410:51"/>
spread indeed all over the Town con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
such a kind of Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as should leave no room for Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
how well grounded such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
have been I will not undertake;
it is but in vain to make an uncertain
guess at what kind of Proposals may
possibly be offered by some Persons;
and to fancy at all adventures who
they are or may be who are in any
likelihood to be concluded by them.
But because it is said publickly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
and by no mean Persons, That
the Presbyterians, at least the chief
and leading Men among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are
ready now to enter into the Church,
upon some reasonable Abatements to
be made unto them: And when they
are once gained, the other Sects will
not be considerable enough to expect,
that any Toleration should be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them. If this be the Case,
as it is by some of themselves pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be, then the Case is much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
from what it lately was: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Christianity in its Latitude,</hi>
which came out in 1667. and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it in 1668. are express, not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:98410:51"/>
only for Comprehension but likewise
for Toleration, and besides that for
a Connivence also. And a later Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
entituled, <hi>Indulgence not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused;
Comprehension humbly desired,</hi>
which came out 1672. is express for
Toleration; and against that part of
his Design he makes this Objection:
The Presbyterians in former times
wrote and preached against Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Indulgence, and if they do
now fall in with it, they contradict
themselves. To this he answers, <hi>That
some did, some did not; and there was
a Reason then which ceaseth now:
and besides, many of those who declared
against such a Toleration are dead and
gone, and there are others</hi> postnati <hi>to
those times who now suffer,</hi> p. 11, 12.
So that it seems, these Two Advocates
for the Comprehension were for a
Toleration. If the minds of these men
be changed since that time, it were
not unfit that they should give Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
notice of it, especially for this
Reason: It is well known, that in
the private Discourses and in their
printed Books, the People have
been moved to express much pity
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98410:52"/>
toward the Dissenters, and not
a few exasperated against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by the perpetual noise of
Persecution, Liberty, Conscience,
Moderation, Forbearance, Tenderness,
Compassion, Indulgence; and that this
hath not been the peculiar Phrases of
such or such a particular Sect, but the
common language of all of them. Now
if this device of Comprehension do
take place, then all those Pleas as to all
Parties but one will remain as formerly</p>
               <p>But if the Presbyterians do really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to come into the Church now, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such &amp; such abatements to be made
unto them, and finally and for ever to
shake Hands with their old Brethren; it
were but reasonable to expect that they
should do these two things: First, that
in their present Meeting-Houses they
should use so much of the Common-Prayer
as they can lawfully, and mean
hereafter to use, and observe so many
of the Orders and Ceremonies of the
Church, as they are perswaded of the
Innocency of; and take the first oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of declaring to their Hearers
their Resolutions of Conformity,
thereby to prepare them to conform
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98410:52"/>
likewise: Secondly, they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
as formerly, against Liberty of
Conscience, as a thing which they do
by no means approve, and are resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
never hereafter to have any thing
to do with. If, I say, these men do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that any publick distinction should
be made between them and other
Dissenters, they themselves should do
well to own such a distinction; if we
go into their Conventicles we cannot
find any such great difference in the
way of Worship between the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
and others, as thence to be
able to distinguish them. If we go
into their Company their Complaints
are much of the same strain, and not
seldom in the same Syllables.</p>
               <p>If there are any among them (as
it is to be hoped there are) who are
sincere, modest, and peaceable, who
mean better than their Neighbours;
The Law cannot help it if they suffer
for being taken in bad Company: It
is not unlikely that they might have
fared much better themselves if they
had not had such Partakers; their
own Case might have been looked
upon as pitiable, if they had not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98410:53"/>
with such dangerous Adherents.
If this Course (I say) were taken, that
each Sect did urge its own Plea single,
by and for it self, there were then
some ground for Charity, and we
might possibly have some hope, that
their aims looked no higher than an
Indulgence: And by so inoffensive a
way of asking favour, Authority
would have some ground whereupon
to be perswaded, that they would use
any favour which they could obtain
with the very same Modesty with
which they do desire it: But when
they shall all unite with a joynt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in one and the same Clamour for
that very Demand, about which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
neither ever did, nor ever can
agree; and within which Pretence
no one name is wide enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them, besides that of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity,
<hi>viz.</hi> Dissenters from the
present Constitution: Of which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it is more than possible to alledge,
not only divers, but contrary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and doth only tell us what it is
they would not have, but not at all
what they would have. It is but too
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98410:53"/>
evident, that Indulgence is not the
only thing aimed at, but is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in order to something else; and
the plausible name of Conscience may
upon these terms be suspected to be
only a handsome Artifice whereby
to disguise that Combination, which
no other word is solemn enough to
authorize, or of compass large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be a sufficient shelter for;
and by which they hope to become a
Match for some common Enemy: And
accordingly as their success doth
chance to happen in that, each Sect
doth flatter it self with the particular
Advantages to be reaped from it.
And in this I am the more confirmed,
because that the late Act of Parliament
against Conventicles, which hath been
the matter of so much Lamentation
and Complaint, hath been so tender,
even of the needless Scruples of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as to allow these men their
own Fancies in their way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in their own Families, and four of
their Neighbours to joyn with them:
But these Good men are persecuted,
if they are only tolerated; they lose
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98410:54"/>
their ends unless they make Proselytes,
and have opportunities to form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into Parties.</p>
               <p>But if this Plea of Conscience be
so very Omnipotent, as that it must
bear all things down before it, and
no other Consideration whatever must
in the least presume to stand in its
way: Suppose the Case should so
happen, as that this Plea should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so utterly inconsistent with it
self, as that it is impossible but that
in one respect or other, it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
be over-ruled; and this is a
Case which may occurr very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
As for Example, suppose that my
Conscience tells me, that I ought to be
of this or that Opinion, and not only
so, but that I am obliged not only to
entertain it my self, but withall to
vent and propagate it to others; and
on the contrary, the Magistrates Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
tells him, that he is appointed
by God to be a Keeper of both the
Tables, and that it is his Duty to take
care not only of Peace, but Truth;
and the Doctrines which I am so very
fond of are not only erroneous, but
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98410:54"/>
likewise of very ill consequence, both
as to the Souls of men and to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace; and that to so high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as that he is firmly perswaded,
and as he really believes and thinks
himself able to give a very good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
upon weighty grounds, that he
should be much wanting, both to the
Duty which he oweth to God, and the
Care which he ought to take of his
People, both as to their Temporal and
Eternal Welfare, if he doth not make
use of his Authority in the restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me from venting any such perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Doctrines within his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>What now is to be done in this
case? My Conscience tells me, that
I am obliged to preach such and such
Doctrines, as being precious and soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saving
ones, the Truths of God and
Gospel-discoveries; the King's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
tells him, that they are the
Doctrines of Devils (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did
upon occasion declare some Doctrines
to be) and that he ought not to give
me Liberty to preach any such in his
Kingdom: What now is to be done
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98410:55"/>
in this Case? Here is Conscience on
both sides; the King is as firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
as I am, and thinks himself as
well informed as I either am or can
be; If the King restrains me from
preaching after my own way, then I
cry out that he is a Persecutor: He
replies, that I am a Seducer, nay, a
Blasphemer, and he neither will nor
ought to suffer any such in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
either his Conscience or mine
must over-rule; Both cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
one or other must necessarily
either yield or alter; or else I must
Preach, and he must Punish, and the
Almighty must at his own time be
Judge between us; and in the mean
time as to all the purposes of this
World, the King's Conscience hath
reason to expect to be more Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
than mine, and withall he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to take care both of himself
and all other men, to Judge both as to
his own particular, and likewise as to
the Concerns of His whole Nation.</p>
               <p>If it be replied in this Case, that
the King's Conscience ought to yield,
because it is an Errour in Him to think
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98410:55"/>
that He is at all concerned in Points of
this Nature; that Religion is no part
of His Care, His business is only to
look after the Civil Government, and
the Publick Peace (a Pretence fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
insisted on:) The Answer to
this is very plain, and might easily be
enlarged upon, as to many Particulars,
I shall only mention these two Things;
First, that Religion hath a very great
influence upon Civil Government,
and the Publick Peace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if so be, that the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the Publick Peace be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
His Care; then Religion ought by
no means to be excluded from it, as
having so great an influence upon it.
In the next place, as to the Pretence
that the Magistrate is in an Errour, if
he looks upon himself as concerned
in this Particular; it is more than
possible, that that very Pretence will
upon Examination appear to be the
greater Errour: And in general the
Subject is no more free from Errour
than the Soveraign. And this need
not seem News to us of this Age and
Nation; and to speak the Truth, it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98410:56"/>
is no easie matter to find out any Age
or Nation, where it hath not been
sadly evidenced, that Seducers will
quickly be found in great abundance,
where Liberty hath been given for
the People to be seduced by them:
And after all this, it will be no impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Task to make out, that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
are obliged not only in Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
but likewise in point of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to have a great Care of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and to use that Authority which
they received from God, so far to
the honour of him who gave it, as
by no means to suffer his Truths to lie
all openly exposed to all the Lusts,
Designs, and Mistakes of Men; to all
the Knavery and all the Folly of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one who is either willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
or liable to be deceived. And
of this I shall now endeavour to give
a brief account both from Reason and
Scripture, the Necessity of the thing,
and the Authority both of the Old and
New Testament.</p>

in the year 1644. <hi>It is the Will
and Command of God, that (since the
coming of his Son Iesus) a Permission
of the most Paganish, Iewish, Turkish, or
Antichristian Consciences and Worships
be granted to All men in all Nations and
Countries.</hi> But whatever the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Author is either in it self,
or in its Consequence, I shall briefly
enquire into the Arguments he brings
for it. Pag. 25. <hi>That the Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Power are things perfectly in
themselves distinct, and ought in their
Excercise to be kept so,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>The
Magistrate hath ways, such as Christ
thought sufficient, to promote the Good
of Religion, and propagating the Growth
of the Gospel, without drawing the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Sword, which will make no more
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98410:57"/>
Impression in spiritual Concerns, than it
will do upon a Ghost which hath no real
Body,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>p. 28. To use force in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is wholly unlawful in any hand what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
because it is by no means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Christ to bring about any Gospel-End:
For the Magistrate to enforce the
Laws of the Gospel by Temporal Power, or
to compel Men into the Gospel by such a
Power, is to act without the least Precept
or Precedent; to induce an Engine to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Gospel contrary to the nature of
Christs Kingdom (which is not of this
World) and contrary to the nature of
all Gospel-institutions. Doth not</hi> Paul
<hi>positively deliver this, That the weapons
of the Gospel are not carnal but spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and mighty thorough God: The
Sword of the Spirit is the Weapon by
which Christ doth all; yea, by which he
will destroy Antichrist, the greatest Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-enemy
the World hath produced.</hi>
The Sum of which is briefly this:
1. That Force is a very incompetent
Method to be used in matters of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and Perswasion: 2. That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
1. Because Christ hath no
where commanded it, we have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98410:57"/>
Precept nor Precedent for it:
2. Because St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath plainly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
it, where he says that <hi>the weapons
of our warfare are not carnal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, as to these Suggestions
which do frequently recurr in this
Question, I shall at present only brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touch upon them, premising this,
That our Author, like to all the rest
who have dealt in this Cause, is as
much concern'd to answer these and
all the rest of his Arguments against
using the Secular Interposition in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Belief, as any of those he writes
against; because he himself doth very
much approve and commend such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition
where he likes the Cause
in behalf of which it is made use of.
Now, though this may seem strange,
because it is directly contrary to his
whole Book, yet it is very plain;
and I shall not expect to be believed
upon my bare word, but desire the
Author himself, or any one besides
who makes a doubt of it, to consider
these words which we have <hi>pag.</hi> 24.
Constantine <hi>and the Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
after him, till the Church of</hi> Rome
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98410:58"/>
                  <hi>had cheated them into subjection, took
upon them the care and oversight of all
Religious things: among our selves we
reap the advantage of our Kings and
Princes care and Concern in that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
we have of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
Now this Assertion of that
learned Gentleman is evidently true;
but then it happens here as it useth
in the other Discourses for Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
When the Evidence of Truth
hath forced from them one reasonable
Concession, that one Concession doth
plainly give away from them nothing
less than their whole Cause: For,
pray tell me, <hi>Constantine</hi> and the
Christian Emperours are here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for their care and oversight
in Religious things; and so our own
Kings for securing to us the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion: Now was not all this
done by Laws and Penalties, and the
Civil Sword, and was there any possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of having it done any other way?</p>
               <p>This being premised, as to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
themselves, I briefly say this;
If no force is to be used in matters of
Religion, because it is an incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98410:58"/>
Method, as being able to reach
only to the Body and Estate, but is
by much too weak to reach unto
the Mind; this is a Difficulty not at
all peculiar to the Gospel, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to that with all other Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations.
The Mind of a Man was as
much a Spirit under the Law as it can
be now; and the Sword was made
of as meer Matter in those days, as it
can be in these: and therefore thus
far the Case is one and the same. As
to the Second Exception, That all
Force is now unlawful, because Christ
hath not commanded it, they have
been told, and have had it proved
to them too in many parts of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan
Controversie, that many things
are lawful which there is no particular
Command for; that a thing becomes
unlawful, not by being not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but by being forbidden: And
this leads me directly to the Third
Exception, That all Force is plainly
forbidden by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he says,
2 <hi>Cor. 10. v.</hi> 4. that <hi>The weapons of our
warfare are not carnal.</hi> Now this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Apostle is so far from being a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98410:59"/>
hibition of all Coercion in the Affairs
of Religion, that it doth plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to a very great Coercion, which
himself did in these very words threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for to use, <hi>viz.</hi> the Censures of the
Church in such a manner as to carry
temporal Penalties along with them,
in manner miraculous, visible and
extraordinary: And therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in the next words, that those
Weapons which in themselves might
be supposed weak, yet if they were
better looked into would be
found to have a strength from
God, which they had not from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for they were not <hi>meerly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
but mighty through God for the
bringing down strong holds:</hi> And to
render it clear that these words have
a penal meaning in them, it follows,
that these Weapons <hi>are able to cast
down imaginations, and every high
thought that exalteth it self against the
knowledge of God, and bringing into
captivity every thought to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Christ:</hi> And to put it out of
all doubt, that those Weapons had a
coercive power in them, the Apostle
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98410:59"/>
adds, in a stile much beyond exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and advice, nay, much beyond
a bare reproof, that in the strength
of them <hi>he would revenge all disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
And as for the last most press<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and convincing Consideration,
That if Force was to be used in any
affair of Religion at all, it was of all
others the most to be justified in order
to the pulling down of Antichrist, the
greatest of all other Gospel-enemies:
But even in that Case it ought not to
be used, and therefore most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not in any other; <hi>The Sword of the
Spirit being the only Weapon by which
Christ will destroy Antichrist, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Gospel-enemy which the World hath
produced.</hi> I shall not here take an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
which I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
that <hi>the Sword of the Spirit</hi>
doth in Scripture signifie something
which carries Coercion along with it;
but shall be contented that that word
be understood in the common mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it: And upon that Supposition
I believe that this Assertion of this
learned Gentleman will scarce pass for
true Doctrine in the Separated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98410:60"/>
I am sure that there was a
time when it would not have done
so, and I never yet heard that in this
Point their Minds were altered: How
unlawful soever it may be for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
to make use of the Civil Sword
in a Cause of Religion; I am sure that
it hath been often preached as a great
Gospel Duty, though in a Rebellion,
to make use of the Military one.
We have not forgot how often the
Zeal of the Common People was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
against the King, by telling
them that the Cause then fought for
was the Cause of God, that their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Estates were all too little to
be sacrificed in this Concern of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the question really was,
whether Christ or Anti-Christ should
be King? And so I return to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
               <p>Amongst all the Arguments which are
brought to prove the Compulsory Power
of the Magistrate under the Gospel, the
greatest weight is laid upon the practice
of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> and
what they did under the Law in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
men to the Worship of God then
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98410:60"/>
established. In the due Consideration
whereof we shall find the truth in hand
no wayes invalidated, and that what
was then done by the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and
<hi>Judah,</hi> cannot reasonably be now made
a Rule to Magistrates under the Gospel:
And that the Analogy will no way hold,
may be made appear both from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
station and posture those Kings were
in from all Magistrates now, and also
from the different Condition of the
Church then and now, and many Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
peculiarly relating to both.
First, the Worship and Policy of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> being in it self Typical, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
of what was to come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
their Government was likewise so,
and in their Kings very eminently.
Secondly, God was pleased in those Times
upon all eminent Occasions of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his Worship and Proceedings of
that Nature to send Prophets to declare
his positive Mind, and to put an end to
all Doubts, that could be about such
things: Nay, some of the Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were Prophets immediately inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and did not only take care of the
Worship established by <hi>Moses,</hi> but did
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98410:61"/>
themselves by Divine Authority bring in
things of a new Institution into the
Worship of God. Thus <hi>David</hi> did, and
<hi>Solomon</hi> in bringing Musick into the
Temple, and setling the Courses of the
Priests, and were divinely inspired to
write part of the holy Scriptures: No
Magistrate now can pretend to any such
power in themselves, nor have they any
such extraordinary direction to guide
them; but are punctually obliged to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Christ hath revealed in the Gospel:
And therefore in this respect the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
holds no way good.</p>
               <p>The sum of all which is, that no
Argument ought to be drawn from the
Examples of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
whereby to prove the Power of
any present Magistrates over the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Religion; by reason of the
great difference between those Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and ours, especially in these
two respects: First, that they were
Typical: Secondly, that in such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
they had either Prophets sent to
them, or themselves were divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired.</p>
               <p>And in this part of the Argument,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98410:61"/>
if I had a mind to enlarge farther
than I needs must, I believe that I
should find it an easie matter, to find
our Authour to have committed sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
mistakes in assigning the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the State of the
Church, and the Condition of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
as it was under the Law; I
shall not dispute whether the Law,
fulness of the Magistrate's using coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
power under the Law was Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
of this, that such coercive power
should not be lawful under the Times
of the Gospel: But in the second
place I shall venture to say this, that
several of the Constitutions made by
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Kings, were such as stood
in no need either of direction from
Prophets commissioned for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
or any immediate inspiration
given in to them themselves; And in
this Part of the Debate I shall go no
farther than the Instances which our
Author here layes down, of bringing
Musick into the Temple, the setling
of the Priests Courses, Two Things
certainly which without inspiration,
common prudence would abundantly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98410:62"/>
serve to assist any man in: But to
shew how little need there is to insist
upon any thing of this, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an instance of the Magistrates
coercive power in Matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which shall not be liable to any of
all these, however frivolous excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as having in it not any thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the Ordinances of <hi>Moses.</hi>
And I shall fetch it out of the Book of
<hi>Iob chap. 31. v. 26, 27, 28. If I beheld the
Sun when it shined, or the Moon walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in brightness, and my heart hath
been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath
kissed my hand, this also were an iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be punished by the Iudges, &amp;c.</hi>
Here now is an offence purely spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
a Crime meerly against Religion,
not any otherwise at all against the
State, or any particular Member of
it; a sin indeed it was against God,
but such an one as did consist in a
meer mistake about him, and such a
mistake as was in that Age and part
of the World very frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
and yet it is said to <hi>be an Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
to be punished by the Iudges.</hi> So
that it seems in the dayes of <hi>Iob,</hi> the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98410:62"/>
Civil Magistrate was thought to have
in himself a power, and was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to look upon it as a Duty incumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
upon himself, to take care not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the safety of Himself and His
People, but likewise to look after the
Honour of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Now whatever may be pretended
for that Natural Liberty, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is now a-dayes supposed to
have a full right to, to be permitted
the enjoyment of his own way of
Worship, we do find that things of this
Nature were before the Dayes of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and without relation to any of
his Laws, under the Restraint and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Superiours, who were to be
in this as well as in any other Affairs,
not only Guides but Governours. I
suppose that without breach of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
a man may with some Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
affirm, that if it had not been
within the due bounds of that Power
which of right did belong to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
that it would never have been
recorded for his everlasting Honour
by God himself, <hi>That he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Children and Houshold after
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98410:63"/>
him to keep the way of the Lord, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advise or exhort, but Command,</hi> as
we have it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. And <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Family was so large, as that <hi>Gen.</hi>
23. 6. He is stiled <hi>a Mighty Prince.</hi>
And in this place we are to consider
that it is very plain, that every one of
all those Arguments, which do assert
Liberty of Conscience by way of
Right so far as to exempt Religion
from the Authority of the Magistrate,
doe, at least with equal force exempt
it from the Authority of Parents,
Masters, or who ever else besides: For
this must needs be very evident, that
if this Liberty be such a natural inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feasable
right as that no humane power
whatever can take it away from us,
then as the Regal Power cannot take
it away; so for the same reason nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the Paternal or Despotical:
Nay farther, if so be that these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
are in the Right, and that such
a Liberty in Matters of Religion, and
the Profession of that Liberty be one
part of Liberty, with which Christ
hath made us free, and which we are
accordingly called upon to stand fast
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98410:63"/>
in, as being purchased for us by our
Redeemer's Blood, then the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
doth return upon us again at
least with equal, if not with greater
force; for as the King ought not to
deprive us of any degree of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
with which Christ made us free;
so neither ought any Parent or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
presume to do any such thing; and
Liberty of Conscience must upon these
terms receive as little interruption in
Families as in Kingdoms: No impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must upon these terms be endured
in any House, School, or Colledge,
as to Forms or hours of Prayer, no
Words, no nor no Gestures must be
prescribed; every Child or Servant
hath the free Liberty to remonstrate
in behalf of this invaluable and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
insisted on Priviledge, that
no man must dare to determine what
Christ hath left free, for in Christ there
is no difference of any Age or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
high and low in him are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
               <p>The chief, if not only ground of
mistake in this particular is this, that
in the New Testament we have not an
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98410:64"/>
Example of a Civil Magistrate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
his Civil Power in defence of
the Gospel: Now that which renders
this Exception utterly insignificant, is
this, that in the New Testament we
do not read of any Civil Magistrate
who was a Christian. And nothing can
be plainer than this, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
which then were did look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Religion as a thing within their
Cognizance, and accordingly, as they
did not believe the Doctrine of the
Gospel to be true, they did call them
to account who did either profess or
propogate it: And if this had been one
alteration which the Gospel had
brought into the World, that from
henceforth Religion, contrary to the
Sentiments of all former Ages, should
be absolutely exempt from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnizance
of any Magistrate, and that
every man's Conscience was so sacred,
as that God alone was fit to be the
Judge of it; it is not a little to be
wondred at, that in this new <hi>Epocha</hi>
and strange alteration of Affairs, the
Apostles did take no manner of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of this change, and when they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98410:64"/>
had so fair Opportunities and proper
seasons; as when they themselves were
called in Question about Matters of
Religion, did never in the least insert
this in their Apologies, that Religion
was no part of the Civil Magistrates
business: When St. <hi>Paul</hi> was question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about Heresie, he made no such
exception against the Tribunal he
was called before; that Heresie was a
thing which they had nothing to do
to enquire about, but gave them an
Account that the Doctrine which he
preached was not Heresie.</p>
               <p>And that we may root up the very
Foundation of all mistakes in this
matter, it is very evident, that among
all the Precepts, which we meet with in
the New Testament, concerning Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
Condescention, bearing with
one anothers Infirmities, it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that not any one of them hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
manner of Relation to our great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
of Liberty of Conscience; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plainly given to private Persons, &amp;
many times in relation only to their
own passions, and where not so limited
to certain Cases, occasional emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98410:65"/>
and with a clear reference to their
not having as yet time or opportunity
of being sufficiently instructed: But as
for the Governours of the Church they
are sufficiently called upon to watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their respective Flocks, and to take
care that Wolves do not break in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, they are called upon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
the whole power with which
they were intrusted, <hi>viz.</hi> the power
of Excommunication, a thing which
comes so near the Question now in
Debate, that it was not seldom assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with temporal penalties: And
though it is often suggested into his
Argument, that the Outward Sword
can act no more upon the mind of
men than upon a Ghost, yet St. <hi>Paul,
1 Cor.</hi> 5. 5. was of the Opinion, that
the Destruction of the Flesh (a
Phrase well known to signifie Diseases,
and such like inflictions on the Body)
was a very likely method by which
the Spirit might at length come to be
saved. The Soul and the Body though
of a distant Nature have so near an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
such Common Interests, and so
great an influence one upon another,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98410:65"/>
that what doth affect the one, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cannot choose but be so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in, as at the least to consider
it: And this is obvious to the most
ordinary Experience, and hath sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
failed of a great Effect, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it hath been made trial of. And
if it were not so, it would not only
supercede all correction in religious
Affairs, but in Civil ones likewise.</p>
               <p>Now that any such kind of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conscience was brought into
the World by the Revelation of the
Gospel, as that every one should
henceforward without control pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
and propagate what Opinion so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he either did really or would
pretend to believe, I take to be a
thing so far from being according to
to the Rule of the New Testament,
that I must profess my self to be very
much mistaken, if so be that this thing
be not contrary not only to some few
Texts, but to a considerable part of
the whole Design of it. In the 4th
of the <hi>Ephes. v.</hi> 14. we read of several
Orders and Degrees of Men institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and appointed for this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98410:66"/>
that they might take care <hi>of the
perfecting the Saints, the work of the
Ministry, the edifying the Body of Christ;
that we be henceforth no more Children
tossed to and fro and carried about with
every wind of Doctrine, by the slight
of men and cunning crastiness whereby
they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> Now is it
credible that an unbounded Licence
for all manner of Opinions, was ever
intended by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be a thing to
be looked upon, as being according
to the mind of Christ; who tells us
of a whole Order of Men appointed
by Christ, whose Duty it should be
to take care, that men should not be
tossed to and fro, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with every Wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And this Consideration
will be of so much the greater force
both as to the Care which ought to
be taken of Souls, and withal as to
the Ends of Government, and all the
purposes of humane Life: If we do
but keep in mind the Caution which
is here given us by the Apostle, that
every thing is not Gold that glisters;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98410:66"/>
that fair pretences may have very ill
Designs lodged under them: The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tossed to and fro with every wind
of Doctrine is it self certainly a very
great Evil and of very ill consequence.
But the deluded persons themselves
have one good Preservative against
it, when they are by such an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Authority forewarn'd and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that this doth frequently come
to pass <hi>by the slight of men and the
cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
wait to deceive:</hi> Now in this Case I
would appeal to common Sense, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a thing adviseable upon the
scores either of Piety or Prudence,
that such deceivers should have an
unbounded Liberty, to seduce all those
whom at any time they shall be able
to impose upon? It is plain that St.
<hi>Paul</hi> was so far from being of this
mind, that he calls upon the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Officers in this case to make
use of the highest Censures which
they were entrusted with, <hi>I wish they
were cut off that trouble you, Gal.</hi> 5.
12. Now I would fain know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when this which our Apostle
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98410:67"/>
doth advise is done, that according
to the Rules of Scripture, any one
or more are cast out of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church upon the account
of Corruption either in Doctrine or
Manners, it be agreeable to common
Sense, that this Person or Persons,
so cast out of the Church accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rules above supposed,
should in the same Kingdom, nay, in
the same Parish, have a right to set up
another? that being cut off as a rotten
Member from one Church, he may
from thence assume the Privilege to
create himself the Pastour of another,
which he no doubt will be forward
enough to tell us is a much purer
one.</p>
               <p>Now the want of exercising the
Censures of the Church in this very
Case of false Doctrine we find to be
a thing highly blame-worthy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.
14. where it is said to the Angel of
the Church of <hi>Pergamus, I have a few
things against thee, because thou hast
them who hold the Doctrine of Balaam;</hi>
and Ver. 15. <hi>Thou hast them who hold
the Doctrine of the Nicolaitans:</hi> Now
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98410:67"/>
the Governour of this Church is not
charged in the least that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
did hold these false Doctrines,
but that there are those within his
Communion who do hold them; as
again the Complaint is renewed, <hi>v.</hi> 20.
to another Angel, <hi>I have a few things
against thee, because thou sufferest that
woman Iezebel, which calleth her self
a Prophetess, to teach and seduce my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to commit fornication, and to
eat things sacrificed to Idols.</hi> From all
which it is very plain, that this Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or Christian Right of propagating
whatever Opinion men do chance, or
fancy, or pretend to be of, was a
thing which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with, and blames the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Church for suffering
a false Prophetess to teach and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Souls committed to their
Charge.</p>
               <p>And let any reasonable man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
with himself, whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Common people be not
lamentably expos'd to innumerable
and unaccountable Dangers, if so be
that by publick Authority they shall
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98410:68"/>
lie exposed to every one to deceive,
who can and will. St. <hi>Paul, 2 Ti,.</hi> 2.
17. gives us notice of some Hereticks
of his time, <hi>whose words do eat as doth
a canker;</hi> he names the Men and the
Doctrines, <hi>Hymeneus and Philetus, who
say that the Resurrection is past already
&amp; overthrow the Faith of some:</hi> and this
Doctrine of theirs by the benefit of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience hath been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
since their days; and as often soever
as that time shall come which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
doth so much bewail, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 3. That
men will not endure sound Doctrine,
but after their own Lusts heap to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
teachers, having itching ears.</hi>
Authority will be found useful as well
as Instruction, and Government be
needful as well as Exhortation.</p>
               <p>In the Second Epistle of St. <hi>Peter,
c. 2. v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. we read of <hi>false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and false Teachers who shall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly
bring in damnable heresies;</hi> the
consequence of which is there said to
be very dreadful both to themselves
and others, <hi>They shall bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
swift destruction:</hi> But this is not
all, for this kind of infection is not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98410:68"/>
only fatal but contagious; as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<hi>v. 2. Many shall follow their
pernitious ways.</hi> Now if errours are
so pernicious to the Souls of men,
and withal of a very spreading na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is it a thing advisable that there
should be an unbounded Licence for
entertaining and receiving, sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and propagating them? And
this Consideration will appear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to be the more forcible, if we
withal remember, that it is more than
possible, that Doctrines in themselves
false, may be known to be false by
the men who teach them; and with
great art and demureness many may
endeavour to perswade others to
those things of which themselves are
not really perswaded. And let no
man look upon this as any harsh or
uncharitable Censure of mine; for
it is so far from being a suggestion of
mine, that it is in express terms taught
by the Apostle, <hi>v. 3. Thorough cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
shall they with feigned words
make merchandise of you:</hi> So that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
may be a solemn way of setting
up for a Cheat; Separation a very
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98410:69"/>
gainful Trade; the getting a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-house,
a religious Method of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a Shop, where the more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and ignorant his Auditors
(otherwise called his Chapmen) are,
so much the more it is in his power
to put off what Wares he will, and
to set what prices he pleaseth upon
them.</p>
               <p>And thus I think I have made it
somewhat plain, from the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
that that Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which of late hath so often
been called for, is nothing like any
part of that Christian Liberty which
the Writers of that Book did ever
think of; that they themselves did
exercise, and require of others to
exercise the whole Ecclesiastical
Power in points of Doctrine as well
as Manners; and that was the whole
Power they were intrusted with; that
this Power of theirs, though in
it self wholly spiritual, was yet by an
immediate interposition of God at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
upon with Temporal Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and by the Apostles known and
intended so to be. So that in this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98410:69"/>
Case it happened to them in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Authority, as it did in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in the exercise of their Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
they could not give the poor
man who begged at the Gate of the
Temple Money; but they could give
him the use of his Limbs; they
had no Silver nor Gold, but what
was much better they had; they
could say, <hi>Rise up and walk:</hi> So in this
Case they had not in those days the
Sword of the Magistrate; but when
it was seasonable they made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the want of that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
supplied by the Sword of
God.</p>
               <p>Now all this being premised, there
is very little need certainly for men
to require a particular express Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
for the Power of the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
in Matters of Religion; seing
the Authority of the Civil Magistrate
over the affairs which related to the
Worship of God was acknowledg'd
and exercised over all the World;
the Original of which practice we
find to be of as early Date as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy
it self. It is notorious, that the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98410:70"/>
Kingly and the Priestly Office was of
old in one and the same Person; and
when by the appointment of God,
they came to be separated, there is
not the least shew that this Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made out of any favour to
Liberty of Conscience; nor the least
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>uation that holy things should
for all Ages and Dispensations to come
be looked upon as no part of the
Princes care: Nay, this is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing like the Case, that in that
very Nation, wherein that Separation
was made, the Civil Power did all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
retain the Right and did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
use that Right of his in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
authoritatively in Religious
Affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And he did do this both by
the appointment of God, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times without any especial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
but by his original Right
of Magistracy, when there was an
Exig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>y of Affairs which did require
it; Nay, and in Matters of outward
Order, and the more decent Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of Divine Offices, he did not
always tie himself to the express Rule
of the written word, but according
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98410:70"/>
to his own Prudence; and what he did
thus without especial Commission is
in Scripture recorded with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
The Instances are too well
known to stand in need of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on.</p>
               <p>Our forementioned Author tells us,
<hi>p. 13. That a Magistrate, by becoming
a Christian, hath no addition of power
to what he had before,</hi> which is readily
granted him; let him have but so
much, and he will stand in need of
no more. They who exempt all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Religion from the Authority
of the Magistrate must prove that
Christ did take much from his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>viz.</hi> the whole cognizance of
Sacred things, a Power known to have
been used by Jews as well as Gentiles.
And however the Clergy have been
frequently and falsly traduced in this
particular, that in order to Ends of
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> own they have flattered Princes
with a Power, which really did not
belong to them. It is well known
that the Writers of Politicks have
asserted this Prerogative of Princes
as earnestly as the Divines have done:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98410:71"/>
Instances would here be endless<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
shall therefore shew you the thing
granted by a known Scholar, but no
Divine by Profession, and that is the
Excellent <hi>Grotius, Omnes</hi> (saith he)
<hi>qui de Republica aliquid lectu dignum
scripsêre, hoc jus in sacra non partem
summi Imperii, sed etiam potissimam
atque praecipuam vocant,</hi> de Imperio,
C. 1. p. 14.</p>
               <p>Now I must needs confess that our
forementioned Author doth, p. 22,
23. not only assert the Princes Power
in Matters of Religion, but proves it
very well; and at last concludes, that
it is a great weakness to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
But then he adds, <hi>p. 24. That
the Prince must by no means in this case
use the Sword;</hi> and having said this,
he seems a little suspicious, as if that
Limitation had quite spoiled his
whole Concession, as indeed it doth.
But his wonted courage doth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
return again; <hi>Nor need it see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
strange that the Magistrate should have
the care and oversight of that where he
is not to use the Temporal Power,</hi> &amp;c.
Now, I think, it is not easie to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98410:71"/>
what effectual Care the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
can take but that; our Author
tells us indeed of another way, <hi>viz.
He is to see it done by the spiritual
means which Christ hath appointed,</hi> p.
24. But if this be all which he may
do, this may be too little: For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
those spiritual Weapons do meet
with such persons, who do slight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue
and stand in open defiance
of them; doth all that concern and
care, which our Author, but one page
before, asserts the Magistrate to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with, in looking after the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God and the Souls of men,
amount to no more but barely this,
That he is to see the Spiritual Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Church made use of; and
if men have no more Religion than
to despise and laugh at them, he is to
stand still and look on while they are
so doing? This Learned Gentleman
confesseth and contends for it, that
<hi>the Magistrate is in his Station bound
to take care of Gods Honour, p.</hi> 23. and
yet thoroughout his whole Book he
is ever afterward very zealous, that
he must by no means use the Sword
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98410:72"/>
in order to it: Now, how a Magistrate
can <hi>in his station</hi> act, where this is
interdicted him, is a thing not easily
apprehended. When a Magistrate,
as such, declares his pleasure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sense tells us, that the meaning
is, that if we do not bear a fitting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to that his Declaration, it must
be at our own peril; and without this
I do not apprehend how his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
doth appear to be any greater than
that of any other man.</p>
               <p>Again, if the King be to govern
the People, Religion must then be a
very considerable part of his Care,
as being a thing wherein his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will find it self to be very
frequently and very highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
there being nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
nor experienced than this, that
according to the right or wrong mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
which may be taken of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the People may be wrought upon
to do either very much good or very
much evil, even as to the Affairs of
this Life: There are not a few Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
which this Nation is no Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to, which is a Prince hath not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98410:72"/>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to our next Consideration,
the many great inconveniencies which
attend Liberty of Conscience both
in relation to Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Worship of God, and the
Publick Peace.</p>
               <p>But before I enter upon this Part of
the Argument, I must again return so
far back, as to take some notice of
that common rumour about the
Town, of such a Project in hand as
will (if the Success can be supposed
to answer the great hopes which are
conceived of it) make all that Labour
needles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and that is the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Comprehension: In behalf of
which the undertakers are said usually
and openly to alledge this, that if that
be yielded to, there will be then no
need at all of Toleration; for, by that
means the Church will be so strong by
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98410:73"/>
the accession of her new Friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
that she may safely contemn, and by
their help easily overcome all her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Enemies; and withall they are
Persons already so very near us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
there are none but inconsiderable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in debate between us; for they
allow Episcopacy, approve the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
abhor Sacriledge, believe our
Articles, and already can and often
do communicate in our Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>Now as plausible and taking soever
this Plea is, yet methinks that there
is no one part of it which doth not
carry something of wonder in it.
First, it is well known that there was
a time when the Presbyterians did
joyn with, invite, encourage, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
all other Sectaries, that by their
Assista<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce they might be enabled to
ruine the Church; and therefore it
ought to be well considered upon, by
what means it is brought about, that
their Minds come now to be so f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
as that they will now joyn with
the Church in the Suppression of all
the other Sects: Nay, and very lately
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98410:73"/>
the leading Persons of that way did
joyn Interests with the Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were in his esteem, and in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of that Grave and Reverend
Assembly of Ministers there present
with him, so very considerable, that
the chief concerns of the Gospel did
depend upon them; and accordingly
he made use of this pretence as his
chief Art, whereby to wheedle the
City out of their money at that time:
<hi>Let me tell you, if euer (Gentlemen)
you might use this Speech, O happy Penny,
you may use it now, happy Money that
will purchase my Gospel, happy Money
that will purchase Religion, and purchase
a Reformation to my Posterity; O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Money and blessed be God that I have
it to lend:</hi> So that it seems these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
have two measures which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
different occasions they do make
use of: When they have a mind to
Collogue with Authority, then the
differences between them and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Clergy are mere trifles and very
inconsiderable; but when there is a
season offered, wherein it is safe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate
and inflame the People, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the differences are of that moment,
that no Treasure, no Blood is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98410:75"/>
to be laid out in a Debate of that
Concernment, or in the Words of the
forementioned Speech; <hi>If I had as
many lives as I have hairs on my head, I
would be willing to sacrifice all these
lives in this Cause:</hi> Lastly, if the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
between us be so very small,
sure there can be no great cause for
their present obstinate Separation.</p>
               <p>But if these men are really and in
good earnest desirous of coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church. It is very fit that in
order to that they should declare
whether they will leave those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which have hitherto divided
them from it, or whether they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to entertain those Principles
still, or any of them: If they will
leave their Principles the Churches
Arms are open to receive and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
them; but if they mean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Principles, or any of them,
their room may be more desirable than
their Company; for upon those terms
the difference is in no likelihood to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to any more than this, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of remaining in a Schism from
the Church, they will thereby be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98410:75"/>
to make a Schism within it; or
if they are at length brought to be
perswaded to part with any of their
Principles, will they be so Honest as
to declare that they have been so far
mistaken, and desire their Followers
to get out of those Snares which they
in former Dayes did lay for them; and
particularly will they renounce the
Covenant? It was very good Advice
which the Right Reverend Father in
God the Lord Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>
gave His Majesty, in his Epistle before
the Coronation Sermon, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
Him of that wise Resolution
of His Royal Grandfather, <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth, <hi>That he was ready at any time
to make a Peace with any of the Leaguers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but he would never make any Peace with
the League.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if they look upon it as any
hard measure that they should be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon to renounce the Covenant:
Let them not at all wonder, if the
Regular Sons of the Church have
not forgot those rigours with which
it was imposed, the many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
which have been wrought, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98410:76"/>
are something apprehensive of those
mischiefs which may at this day be
wrought by it; if so be that the
Renunciation of it should be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side;
which will certainly be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as at least a tacit Confession, that
that Injuction was unreasonable, and
such a one as a man of a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
could not submit to; and that
is a fair preparation for the Opinion
that the Covenant is really a thing
which doth oblige us. But because
that Moderation is at this time a word
much in fashion; let us compare the
Severities used in behalf of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with this which is so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of as being against it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
by reason of the Clamours by
themselves raised about its obligation,
established by a Law, that none shall
be admitted to Publick Trusts in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,
Schools, or the Church, who
will not renounce its Obligation; but
the Covenanters did not think this a
sufficient security in their Case; Mr.
<hi>Calamy</hi> tells us in his fore-mentioned
Speech, in the name of himself and
the Reverend Ministers with him, with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98410:76"/>
great Joy and Triumph; <hi>That there
was not one Person in the Kingdom of</hi>
Scotland <hi>who is not a Covenanter, and
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e shall not one abide among them
who will not take this Covenant.</hi> Now
this Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> from the beginning of
the Long Parliament till the Day of
his Death, was a Ringleader of that
Party of men who do now plead for
Comprehension, &amp; do earnestly at this
time desire that they may be dispensed
with, for renouncing the Covenant.
And if the Counsel of these Divines
had been of as great Authority in the
Army, as it was with the Two Houses,
that which Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> doth magnifie
in <hi>Scotland</hi> would have been a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
for the same course to be taken
in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But seeing that the Covenant is
more sacred with them than the Oaths
of Alleagiance and Supremacy, will
they, if they should be thus far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended
to, be so grateful to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
as to declare their Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the War raised against His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
will they in lieu of renouncing
the Covenant take an Oath wherein
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98410:77"/>
they will assert, that the War raised
by some Lords and Gentlemen sitting
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> under the Name of the
Lords and Commons Assembled in
Parliament, by a Commission granted
to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> was unlawful,
as being against the known Laws both
of God and of the Nation? If they
refuse this, seeing that we know that
many of these very men for whom
Comprehension is desired did preach
up the War, if they will not declare
against it, it is shrewdly to be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that their mind is the same as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and the only change which is,
is in the posture of Affairs.</p>
               <p>But because it is now said in behalf
of these men, that they allow Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
and approve of a Liturgy, nay
of ours: That we may not be imposed
upon by any ambiguous generality of
Words; it is but requisite that in this
they would declare particularly in
what sence it is that they allow and
approve both these Things; for if by
things past we may guess at things
present; by Episcopacy they may mean
but Presbytery; by the Bishop may
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98410:77"/>
be understood a kind of a Prolocutor.
Every assuming Presbyter may at any
time say as one of them lately did, that
he is as good a Scripture Bishop, as he
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o sate upon the Bench; or perhaps
look upon a Bishop only as a Civil Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
in order to some legal purposes: and
by a Liturgy they may mean only such
a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is (if ever to be) permitted only
to those who are Persons of such small
sufficiency as not to be able to pray
without it, and so instead of being a
Duty is intended meerly as a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement:
Or it may be the Common
Prayer may be allowed as a way of
spending the time till the Company is
got together, and then comes the
Prayer which the Spirit is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Author of, and which alone
hath the promise of any blessing made

               <p>Unless, I say, that these Persons be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to express their Minds very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in these and all other Matters
of Debate between us, we shall be
alway<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a loss, how much of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98410:78"/>
Good Old Cause they resolve to stick
to; and without some satisfaction in
these things we have reason to be
jealous, that they have, after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other disappointments, pitched
upon this Contrivance, as a very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one, whereby the Church may, by
their admission, become divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it self: The Pulpits may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be brought to speak in very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Languages, and the Hearers
strangely distracted between the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
abettors of the very distant
Measures of the old and new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
               <p>They who have kept out of the
Church thus long, rather than they
would not have their Wills in such
and such Matters in debate between
us; it is scarce to be hoped, that when
they are brought into the Church, by
being yielded to in them, that they
will not with the same Art and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
keep up in the Minds of Men a
good opinion of that Cause which
they have so long contended for: At
the least they will take what care
they can, that those of their former
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98410:78"/>
Hearers whom they shall be able to
bring along with them, (if they shall
be able to bring any store of their
Hearers along with them, which is no
small question) shall for ever be kept
under bondage to every one of all
those scruples, by which they have
been able to retain dominion over
them: And they who have all along
been, observably upon all occasions,
admirably expert at interpreting all
things to the utmost possibilities of all
advantage, as to themselves and their
Cause, it is not to be expected from
them, that they will not interpret
this Condescention as a complete Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.
And unless the Modesty
and Gratitude of these men be strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increased of late, beyond what it
hath used to be, our Governours are
not like to receive any other return
than this; That God hath at length
begun to return again, and in some
sort to own his People and his Cause:
He hath now opened the Eyes of the
Parliament, and let them see their
Error in imposing the renouncing the
Covenant; and who knows what
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98410:79"/>
more a gracious God may do for so
gracious a People? And that Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
which hath thus long engaged
them to pretend their Cause of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to be just, can do no less than
continue to engage them to avow its
having been necessary. So that the
Church will by this means be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by having one great Security
taken from her; those Men will be
admitted into her, of whose Affections
and Designs she hath abundant cause
to be highly jealous; and who, by
obtaining their present Demands,
will, according to their old Customs,
be thereby emboldned with the like
restless importunity to make more
demands, and perhaps in a little time
be inabled to take what farther they
please, without so much as asking
it: And by this means the People
will become extremely divided, both
amongst themselves and from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
And when that is done,
there will be so many left out of this
Comprehension, that the noise will
not be much less than it is already:
And whatever accession can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98410:79"/>
to be made to the Church by
the coming in of her new Friends,
will be more than over-ballanced by
the loss she will receive in the stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of her Principles and the Unity
of her Children: She will be the less
able to defend her self against the
Exceptions of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and be at
no small loss for an answer to the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of other Sectaries, who can
pretend as great grievances, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as plausible Reasons why they
should be gratified; so that the Work
of Coalition (as it is called in the
newest word) as often soever as it is
done, will be just as often to begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>As to any other Particulars of that
Comprehension which is now so much
endeavoured, seeing they have not
thought fit to let us know them, I shall
not venture to make a guess at them,
but shall go on to another Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and in the Opinion of many a
more promising one, and that is, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
which is frequently said to
be an Expedient which will gratifie
many more, and more Considerable
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98410:80"/>
Persons than can be hoped to be
brought within the Compass of any
one Comprehension.</p>
               <p>Now it is by no means a thing to
be wondred at, if so be that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of Toleration be in it self at the
first view very plausible, and in the
eyes of very many Persons exceeding
acceptable: It looks like a Privilege
which every man hath an interest in,
which, seing it is enjoyed by all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
no man should take himself to
have any cause to envy it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Now this Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
however it hath obtained to
be the general Darling, yet, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
in the very name there is
something which offers it self to our
Consideration, which is at least worth
our Enquiry; Whether the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
doth not carry in it an Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against it self? How doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that Conscience hath any such
absolute Right to Liberty? Hath it
no Rule which it ought to walk by?
hath it no obligation to follow any
besides its own Light? If this be not
the Case, then Liberty and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98410:80"/>
are two words, which are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
in great variety of Cases to be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together. I shall readily grant, that
to act against our Conscience is always
a sin; but then I shall add this further,
That it is very frequently a grievous
sin to act according to it: Conscience
may in some cases condemn, but there
are very many cases wherein it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justifie. <hi>I know nothing by my
self</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul) yet am I not hereby
justified;</hi> and farther, <hi>I may self thought
verily that I ought to do many things
contrary to the name of Iesus,</hi> &amp;c. The
Scripture tells us of <hi>seared Consciences,
Reprobate Minds,</hi> Men <hi>whose minds
and Consciences are defiled.</hi> From all
which Expressions, it is very clear,
That Conscience is not a safe Rule for
any man to act by in his private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
               <p>And in the next place, as Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is very far from being a safe Rule
for any man to act by in his private
Capacity; so it is by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visable,
that men should be so far
trusted, as to teach according to it
in any Publick Places: St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98410:81"/>
us, that by this permission dangerous
Contentions shall arise, by reason of
the perverseness of men, when in the
nature of the things there was no real
Cause for them, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Tim. 2. 14. They
will strive about words to no purpose, to
the subversion of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>earers.</hi> And,
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

who teach the doctrine of devils:
Tim.</hi> 3. for many Verses together,
he describes a sort of very wicked
men, of whom in the close he gives
this Character, That <hi>they have a form
of godliness, but deny the power thereof;
that they creep into houses and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad
captive silly women laden with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
lusts:</hi> And again we read of
those who <hi>bring in damnable Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sies;</hi>
and again, which directly cometh up
to the point in hand about Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>whose mouths must be stopped.</hi> Thus
far therefore our way is clear; 1. That
according to the Doctrine of the New
Testament, Conscience is not its own
Rule, is not entirely left to it self in its
own way of acting: 2. That those
who are allowed to be publick Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
are not to be intrusted with an
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98410:81"/>
absolute Liberty of propagating what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Opinions themselves either real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are or shall pretend to be of; of
which I have already spoke, and
therefore shall add no more upon that
point besides the laying down some
of the many Inconveniencies which
will unavoidably arise upon the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any such Liberty in these
Two Respects, 1. Of Religion, 2. Of
Government.</p>
               <p>First, as to Religion; and here the
Case is very clear, that such a Liberty
is the most ready way in the World
to make Religion weak and despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by being crumbled into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
and every day encreasing
variety of Sects and Schisms: What
one other Contrivance can possibly
be thought upon, whereby to expose
Religion to the frequent and seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
just scorn of Unbelievers than this?
That it should by publick Authority
be openly exposed to all manner of
ridiculous and incongruous pretences
unto it, to all kinds of dotage and
imposture, to all the folly and all the
falseness which is to be met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98410:82"/>
the sons of men: That every one
who hath but a Freak in his Brain
shall have free Liberty, if he pleaseth,
to Christen it a motion of the Spirit,
and every humour though never so
unheard of and extravagant, shall
have by Law a Priviledge (if it will
but claim it) to recommend its self as
a degree of further Light: Here we
shall see men shaking all day, as if the
Spirit came to them in Convulsions,
and as the humour increaseth we shall
see them run naked about the Streets,
as if with the Old Man, they had put
off all degrees of Modesty: The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
shall be frequently so interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as that no man in his Wits can
possibly understand it, it both hath
and may be allegorized so far as to
leave no manner of Sence or Truth in
any one Word of all the History of
it; its Laws may be so commented
upon, as to carry in them no manner
of Obligation: Among our selves the
Family of Love had gotten a Fancy
that Christ was not any one Person,
but a quality whereof many are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers,
that to be raised is nothing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98410:82"/>
else, but to be regenerated or endued
with the said Quality, and the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from them which have it, and
them which have it not, is Judgment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Now where ever this Liberty is indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Grand and concerning Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our Faith, our Saviours taking
Humane Nature upon him, the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the Dead, and the last
Judgment, are all given away in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for two or three fanciful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.
The History of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

been taught, that Christ shall descend
from Heaven in a Metaphor, and we
be catched up into the Air in a Moral
way; The New Heavens and the New
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98410:83"/>
Earth are nothing else but the World
changed by their Example into their
Opinions: And if this Liberty be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
all Miracles and all Mysteries
will be quickly changed into so many
Whimsies; for what is it which self-conceit
cannot inspire, or madness
prove, or that man admit, who cares
not to know what himself means; or
whether he doth or not, if he be once
got under the plausible shelter of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience himself, what is
it that he may not impose upon vast
multitudes, who though never so well
meaning in themselves, are yet liable
to be overreached by the Arts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men: The dangers of this kind
are not possible to be reckoned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they encrease and vary at their
own pleasure; neither is there any
man living, who can possibly tell us
how many and how gross absurdities
such a Liberty as this may bring into
the Nation in the very next moment.</p>
               <p>This very Devise of Liberty of
Conscience, which many, who look
upon themselves as wise men and no
ill Christians, are fond of, is the very
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98410:83"/>
same, by which one of its shrewdest
Adversaries did hope to drive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
out of the World, and that too
by its own assistance; and to that end
he granted a promiscuous Liberty for
all dissenting Christians to enjoy the
publick exercise of their several ways,
in hopes thereby to engage one of
them against another, and by that
means to make his advantage upon all
of them: For so we read of <hi>Iulian,</hi>
that when his long contrived project
of restoring Heathenism began to be
put in effectual execution, that this
was the Course which he pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as that which was most likely to
bring his Design about, to grant Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience to all dissenting
Christians, as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This wise and subtle Adversary
knew very well that this was a ready
way to destroy Christianity, to give a
free Liberty and a full opportunity
for every one who pleased to divide
it: So that this sage Contrivance of
ours is but the Christianity of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
the taking up the <hi>Moderate
Counsels</hi> of a profest Apostate; and
our Wisdom in preserving Religion
doth express it self in those very
ways, by which as wise men as our
selves have thought the ready way
to overthrow it. Indeed it is hardly
credible, that any Person who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands

how many are its Weaknesses,
and how violent its Passions, who is
a Judge of Consequences, or hath at
all observed the course of Affairs, can
in the least be fond of any such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
as this kind of Liberty, who hath
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98410:84"/>
not within himself a very great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
against the present Religion of
that Kingdom where he doth propose
it. But, alas! that is but a small part
of this evil, even our common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
will be hard put to it, if it
must wrestle with all the difficulties
which Toleration will immediately
bring upon it: That Faith is in no
great likelihood of remaining long
pure and sound, which is exposed to
whosoever pleaseth to corrupt and to
defile it</p>
               <p>There is one Principle well known
amongst us, which where-ever it is
admitted, there is no Doctrine of
Faith whatever, nor Rule of good
Life which can be able to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, and that is the Doctrine of
New Light, or private Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
This is an Evil which cannot be
watched with too much Care, because
it always hath it in its own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to occasion how many and what
kinds of mischief soever it self pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
and withall it is with great ease
pretended to by every one who will;
and there are every day to be met
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98410:85"/>
with too many persons too readily
disposed to be imposed upon by such
pretences. Some Romanists have
with great scorn insulted over the
Reformation, upon the account that
this evil hath made a shift to creep
into it; whereas this is a difficulty
which all Religions are liable to be
abused by; a folly with which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
and to which she is indebted
for some of her chief Orders, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plainly founded in it. The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers

This is an ill Weed which will grow
in all Soils, and spread exceedingly;
and Infallibility it self is but an equal
Plea, and therefore is, upon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
glad to call in to its assistance
its Temporal Advantages. This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Pretence doth scarce leave a man

with this Perswasion, That I
have an immediate suggestion from
the holy Ghost: The Scripture it self
hath but one and the same Original,
and is of an elder Date, and, if I
please, is as imperfect in respect of my
Revelation, as that of <hi>Moses</hi> was in
respect of that of Christ. This Evil
is liable to to be as endless as Thought
or Art can make it, as boundless as
Imagination, and hath as great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of shapes to appear in, as there are
possibilities in the World for any man
to be either willing to deceive or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to be deceived.</p>
               <p>What a fatal Influence the now
contended for Liberty of Conscience
had upon the most considerable Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Religion, within a small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of time, we may learn from the
forementioned Testimony of the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and the Attestation of the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>-Ministers.
I shall set down some
of the Articles against which those
Errors were, but will not defile my
Paper with the Errours themselves.
Against <hi>the Divine Authority of holy
Scriptures;</hi> against <hi>the Nature and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:98410:86"/>
against <hi>the Being of any God;</hi>
against <hi>Christ as Mediator;</hi> against
<hi>the Obligation of the Moral Law;</hi> against
<hi>Ordinances;</hi> against <hi>Lawful Oaths,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>the future State of Mens Souls
after this Life, denying the Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them.</hi> But besides Religion,
such a Liberty will be quickly found
to have a sad Influence upon Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the publick Peace.</p>
               <p>And as this sort of Liberty will
expose Truth to perpetual and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
Dangers, and withal hath
left it no possibility of a sufficient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against them; so it hath a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
tendency towards destroying
the publick Peace: And not only so,
but to the disturbance of all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and even of every private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
Opinions have a great Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon Actions, and engage men
not only upon good, but upon very
bad practices. He who is allowed to
raise a Sect, hath a very fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
put into his hands of making
himself the Head of it, as being such
a Party; and by being permitted to
have their Consciences, will have but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98410:86"/>
too many opportunities of having
their Persons and Purses at his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
likewise. Hence it is, that though
some Princes have been sometimes
forced to suffer Dissenters from the
established Profession (by reason that
they were so numerous, or so subtil,
that they could not go about to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them without discovering how
unable they were to do so;) yet they
always looked upon such Dissenters
as the next door to Enemies; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
had a perpetual Eye and
Guard upon them, as those who of all
other were the most likely to be the
Authors or occasion of the next di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance.
It is a great mistake,
though it be often found amongst the
greatest Persons, That Sects are things
fit only to be despised, because that
men of Parts and Fortune are neither
easily nor usually seduced by them:
but it ought likewise to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Ambition, Revenge, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
Humour and Discontent may
engage those who are not in earnest
themselves seduced, to appear in all
seeming earnest to seduce others. I shall
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98410:87"/>
readily grant, that both the Beginning
and the greatest Growth of Sects are
amongst the meanest people, those
whose Fortunes are as low as their
Understandings; but then they do
not stay altogether among them, but
spread farther; like a Pestilence,
which may begin in an obscure Alley,
but in a little time no part of the
City or Kingdom may be free from it.
Besides, are not the Vulgar People
the hands, the Tools, the Instruments
which the Greatest must always make
use of? And is it not known by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
experience, that a Deception
once got among them, may by a little
Connivence thrive so far, as to be
able to dispute for Superiority, and
instead of demanding an Indulgence,
refuse to give one? And, by how much
the ordinary sorts of people are less
Masters of Reason than others, with
so much the greater ease they may be
wrought upon to engage in those
Courses; which by men who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
better, would be looked upon
as evidently unreasonable. Now this
is an Error which hath been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98410:87"/>
committed by wise men in great
places: They look upon the Errors
and Follies which the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are drawn into, as things very fit
to be indulged, as being only so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occasions for themselves to droll
upon; but by their so doing they
have often found the return, which
<hi>Abner</hi> did of sporting himself with
Lives, as these mighty Sages do with
Lives and Souls, 2 <hi>Sam. 2. 14. Let the
young men arise and play before us;</hi> but
with him they are at last convinced,
that, Ver. 26. it is <hi>bitterness in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The safety of all Government doth
depend upon this, that it is certainly
stronger than each single person, and
in taking care of this, That as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kinds of Union or joyning Forces
together, that there may be no such
things but under the guidance of the
Magistrate, and by his appointment;
&amp; so long as this is taken effectual care
of, though the discontented persons
be never so many, yet because they
have no way of uniting; they are
but so many single persons, scattered,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98410:88"/>
weak and insignificant, having no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of any Common Council,
they can never joyn in any Common
Design. But let them once have but
so much as <hi>any one Phrase</hi> to know one
another by, any <hi>setled place</hi> for their
constant Meetings, and <hi>a set</hi> and <hi>known
company</hi> for them to meet with, and
<hi>any Bond whatever</hi> which doth unite
them, and they presently become a
distinct People, and begin to be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
as having an Interest, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and Body of their own, which the
Government is not manager of, nor
privy to, but shall quickly find it self
highly concerned by all means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
against.</p>
               <p>Let it once be permitted to crafty,
active, talking, lying and designing
men, to instil into the minds of all
sorts of People, the necessity, useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
piety, or rare excellency of any
one thing or Contrivance whatever,
beyond that which the present Laws
and establishment doth provide for;
and is not here a most readily prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
matter for any bold <hi>Boutefeu</hi> to
work upon, who will take upon him to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98410:88"/>
help the Nation immediately to so
fine a thing? Hath not any such Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker
a vast and already formed
Party in all Parts of the Kingdom?
Let him but represent to them, that
the present Government is the only
rub in their way, between them and
their so fancied happiness; and is it
not very likely that this will be the
very next Consequent Resolution;
let us remove that Obstacle, so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
a good is much to be preferred
before any particular Form or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
the welfare of the Nation is the
great End, and Governours themselves
were created but in order to that, and
consequently are to cease as often as
that End can be better attained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them.</p>
               <p>Though the pretence be nothing
but Conscience, yet every discontent
will joyn to make the Cry both loud
and general. Schisms do of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
naturally grow into Parties,
and, besides, are most plausible Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
for any else to joyn unto them;
the gathered Churches are most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Materials to raise new Troops
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98410:89"/>
out of, and when they are thus fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
prepared, they are easily perswaded
to be at the Service of any one who
will attempt to lead them on.</p>
               <p>If all men were wise and honest, if
every one understood well, and would
act accordingly; upon that Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Conscience might have a much
greater trust reposed in it than can
be now adviseable: And if we could
flatter our selves so far as to take that
to be the Case, this would no more
supersede the necessity of the coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
power of Laws in Religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
than it would upon the same
grounds supersede it in Civil ones.
For no Laws which ever were or can
be in the World can possibly provide
in any Degree for those large measures
of Justice, Equity, Mercy, and all
kinds of fair dealing, which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
every where be met with, if
all men did take Care to keep a good
Conscience; Truth, Justice, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are things which every
man's Conscience doth and must needs
tell him that he is obliged to, yet were
it not for fear of the Law, we should
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98410:89"/>
find that Conscience is not alone to be
trusted in these which are her Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and familiar Ojects: And this is a
thing so known and granted on all
hands, that it is not usual with men in
their dealings among one another to
trust purely, in matters of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to one anothers Conscience.
And seeing we acknowledge that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
may so often prevaricate in
these plain and obvious things, where
she is so easily found out; we have
no great cause to trust to her fidelity,
that she will not also dissemble in those
things which are more remote and
obscure, and hidden from the very
best of our discovery. Let those
therefore, who plead for Liberty of
Conscience, consider; that there are
two sorts of men, which ought to be
provided against, to keep this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of theirs from being absolutely
the most senceless and dangerous in
the whole World; and upon their
Grounds it doth not appear to be so
much as possible to provide against
them: First, those who are not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and these may pretend Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98410:90"/>
if they will, and in that Case Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Truth and
Peace are like to be most admirably
secured, when they are authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
permitted to the arbitrary Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of every designing Atheist,
who will but take upon him to be an
Enthusiast: And in the second place,
as all men are not honest, so all men
are not wise, and as the former sort
may pretend Conscience, so the latter
are perpetually liable to be imposed
upon by the innumerable, however
absurd pretences unto it: Those
Laws are not fitted for the Temper
of this World, which are made upon
this supposition, that every one who
looks demurely is presently in good
earnest, that men say nothing but what
they think; let us but consider that
it is very possible for men to personate,
and then we shall not be very eager
to desire a general License for every
one who hath a mind to become a
publick Cheat.</p>
               <p>And then from these diversities of
Judgments, and many times when they
are only different forms of speaking,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98410:90"/>
there will immediately arise great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Affection: <hi>For these Divisions,
of Reuben there will be great thoughts of
heart, sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>zings, censures, jealousies, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
evil speaking, animosities, peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
malice, perverse disputings, &amp; every
evil way:</hi> Each Congregation will have
at least some one little Proposition pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to its self, which all its Proselytes
must be known by, which all their
Thoughts must be perpetually running
upon, &amp; every one else must be called
upon to come up to: the smallest gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Church cannot hold its Members
together, unless it hath some particular
thing to engage them upon, &amp; to have
them known by, for they cannot with
any face separate from all mankind, but
they must have something to say for it,</p>
               <p>This contrivance however it be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and dangerous will notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, have alwayes many who will
be very fond of it; for it is a most
ready way for every forward Fellow
to think himself some body, because
he hath adopted himself into such a
Sect; and then the next thing which
he is to think upon is to try if he can
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98410:91"/>
improve the Notion a little farther;
for if so, he shall be the more taken
notice of: And if he finds that his
addition is but a little taking, he will
then forsake his Masters, to set up for
himself, divide from that Church of
which he hath been long a precious
Member to gather a purer of his own.
And so his New Light will serve most
bravely for himself to shine in.</p>
               <p>But if this had been a new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of Invention, the Contrivers
might then have been allowed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
vast hopes of it; but alas, it
hath been often tryed, and hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
brought Confusion along with
it: And is it to be wondred at, that
in variety of Worships the one doth
look upon the other as erroneous,
and perhaps impious? And then how
lamentably must that City be divided
whose Inhabitants think themselves
bound, as they love God to hate one
another; and it hath been often seen,
that a Common Enemy hath crept in
at these intestine Divisions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
both, while the one, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of different Communions, did not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98410:91"/>
enough care to help the other.</p>
               <p>Be our apprehensions about divine
Matters never so different, I grant
that we ought not for the sake of
them to be wanting in the common
Duties of Humanity to one another,
or in our mutual Endeavours after the
publick Good. I readily grant, that
to be wanting in our assistance in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these Cases, is a great error;
but alas! it is too general an one,
and Law-makers are to consider not
only what men ought, but what they
use to do. Why shall I fight (saith
one) for a Prince who is an Idolater?
and why should I (saith another) take
any care to relieve that City which is
only a Bundle of Schismaticks, the
greatest part whereof are in my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
Blasphemers likewise? <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
understood this very well, he did
not cast off the true God, but only
set up another way of Worship, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
concluding that by perswading
them to be of another Religion, he
should easily keep them to be another
Kingdom; when their Faiths were
once divided, the Nations would
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98410:92"/>
never care to unite again.</p>
               <p>And pray, tell me, what shall a
Prince do in that Case, where are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
ways of Worship allowed and
frequented in the same Nation? Shall
he discountenance the Professors of
any one, by keeping them out of all
Office and Employment? If so, he
disobligeth that whole Profession,
loseth so many hearts; who sure will
think themselves to be very hardly
dealt with, in that they are disrespe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
only out of their zeal for God,
and because they follow the best of
their Light. And what are they like
to think of such a State, which doth
refuse to employ them meerly upon
this account, because they have ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Consciences, and dare not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
where the Gospel is de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iled by a
profane mixture of humane Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Or, Secondly, shall the Prince
carry himself equally and indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
towards all Perswasions, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and prefer them all alike? This
can hardly be, because that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
must be of some one, and that
will think it self not fairly dealt with,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98410:92"/>
if it have not some preeminence: And
when he endeavours to shew himself
indifferent to all Perswasions, there
will enough be immediatly ready to
give it out, that he makes use of
all Religions for his own ends, but
himself is really of none; and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paps
none of them will be really for
him: And thus by endeavouring to
displease neither Party, he shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
displease them both, at least
the Zealots of all sides will represent
him at the best as one lukewarm, and
as such, only fit to be spit out of all
their Mouths.</p>
               <p>Men may talk of their fine projects
as long as they please; but surely
where the Church is already so settl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as that it hath a great depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon the Government, and the
Government hath a standing Influence
upon that, those Politicks must needs
be very strange, which go about to
alter or unsettle or put any check up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such a Constitution: And in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition

to perswade the Multitude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>But this Danger, how great and
plain soever it be, yet in the opinion
of the great Promoters of the desired
Ecclesiastical Confusion, is so far from
being looked upon as any Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
that it is in all likelihood the
true and real and only Reason which
makes them to be so very fond of it,
to desire it with so great earnestness,
and never to be put off by never so
many denials and disappointments.
The Church is one great rub in their
way between them and the Crown;
and therefore because they find that
they cannot directly demand the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
removal of it, they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
themselves of two plausible
Methods whereby to prepare the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98410:93"/>
way for doing it another time: First,
to open the door to let the Churches
old Enemies in upon her, and for all
the care which shall be taken to give
them Liberty, to bring their old En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
along with them; and by that
means the Church will be not only
weakned, by being divided within her
self, but besides there will be a part of
her self always ready to betray her,
and give her up. One sort of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors
desire only thus much, and
that will satisfie them: Another sort
there are, who think it not sufficient
that the Church be only weakned
within, unless there be a free Liberty
for whosoever pleaseth to train up as
many as he can prevail with to come
and learn of them the several ways
by which the Church, when occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
offers it self, may be set upon from
without: And it is well known, that
these Gentlemen are not unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with new Models of Civil as well
as Ecclesiastical Administration.</p>
               <p>And having thus pointed at some
few of the innumerable Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of Toleration, I shall add once
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98410:94"/>
more, that some care ought to be
taken of the present Device of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension;
that if it be thought fit
to be granted, it may be upon this
Condition, That all who receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by it, should be obliged pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
before their Congregations to
declare their Approbation of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
in a Form to be appointed by
Authority for that purpose, and to
renew that Declaration on certain
Days to be likewise appointed, and
to read the Common Prayer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and not to leave it always to
mean Persons, who shall only be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to slubber it over, to spend
the time till the Company is got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and then one of the Precious
Men shall come and put himself in all
the most solemn Postures imaginable,
and in fact say to the People (as Dr.
<hi>Heylin</hi>'s Chamber-fellow was served
after a short Grace) <hi>Dearly Beloved,
let us praise God better:</hi> And withal,
that Security should be taken, That
this Conformity of theirs be not used
merely as an Expedient to keep them
in publick Employment; that so they
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98410:94"/>
may be the more ready, when oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
offers it self, to assist Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in carrying on the great Work
of a thorough Reformation. And this
Advice is by no means to be despised,
as a thing perfectly needless, because
that as great a Conformity as for
ought appears is now intended, hath
been formerly advised and submitted
to upon this very account, to prepare
Matters the better for an intended
Change. This Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> (in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology
against Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> 1646 quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Collection called <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nur
Armatum,</hi> p. 47.) alledgeth for
himself to have been one of his own
old Arts: <hi>As for the Service-book,
let Mr,</hi> Burton <hi>know, that at a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at my House, it was resolved by above
a hundred Ministers, after a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
upon divers weighty Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
That all that could in their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
submit to the reading of some
part of it, should be entreated for a
while to continue so to do. To this our
dissenting Brethren then present did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and one of them made a Speech to
manifest his Concordance. This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98410:95"/>
to give any man satisfaction
for the late laying it down.</hi> And
proportionably to this, it is a thing
well known, that some very well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the Good Old Cause, do for
all that conform to the use of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of the Church, under the
sanctified Excuse of <hi>submitting to them
as Burthens.</hi> Now these, I think, are
competent fore-warnings to Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to take care to secure it self against
any ill use which is possible to be
made of any abatements towards that
sort of People, who in this very Case
do profess themselves to act without
sincerity, and to make use of all the
Arts which they can think of.</p>
               <p>And in the next place their great
earnestness in desiring to be dispensed
with for renouncing the Covenant,
doth in them plainly shew a very
great fondness remaining toward it,
and if yielded to, would in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
appear more than a tacit Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it had hitherto been to blame
in its Zeal against it. Their restleness
in this is not to be wondred at, because
they are sworn <hi>never to be wrought
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98410:95"/>
over to an Indifferency or detestable
Neutrality:</hi> But that Authority should
be wrought over to shew kindness to
such a Combination against it self, or
that any should propose it to the old
Cavaliers to give leave to their old
Persecutors to believe themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Oath of God, <hi>to bring every
one of them to condign punishment,</hi> is
a thing which may justly raise all
mens wonder.</p>
               <p>I confess indeed, that by the last
Bill of Comprehension it was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(and so perhaps it may in this)
That no man should dare to say,
that the Covenant doth oblige un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such a Penalty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is
much to be doubted that such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
may not be sufficient; for let
us consider this one thing: Those
Persons, concerning whom our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Debate is, are such as are to be
entrusted to be Guides of Consciences,
and if this Renunciation be once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, then they have Liberty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to insist upon the Obligation
of the Covenant amongst their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents,
without coming within the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98410:96"/>
danger of the Law. Let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that the Holy League in <hi>France</hi>
was taken by above half the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
before the King did ever so much
as hear of it.</p>
               <p>But, to make this Matter plain, I
shall propose a Case very like it in
our own Kingdom. Suppose that any
man out of the great Tenderness
which he pretends to have for the
Consciences of Men, should propose
that the Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
should be by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
taken away, upon this very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
That Oaths are not to be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
but upon great necessity; that
the Consciences of Men are nice and
tender things, and ought not to be
disquieted by being pried into; and
disputable Points of Government are
not fit matters to be put into an
Oath: Ought not such a Person to be
looked upon with a very jealous Eye,
as being ill affected to his Majesties
Person, his Crown and Dignity? He
himself and all his Favourers will, no
doubt, reply, no; because he doth at
the same time offer a Security in it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98410:96"/>
self as Good and more fit to be taken,
and that is this, That it shall be very
punishable for any man to say, <hi>That
our Soveraign Lord King</hi> Charles <hi>is not
lawful and rightful King of these
Realms,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that the Pope hath
any Power or Authority to depose the
King,</hi> &amp;c. He, I say, who should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this Alteration, ought in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be looked upon as a better
Subject to the Pope than to the King.
And so likewise, and for the same
Reason, those, who with so great Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness
and Importunity have so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
endeavoured the taking away the
Renunciation of the Covenant, ought
to be very much suspected, lest they
have in their Eye something which is
of much higher Consideration with
them, than either the Settlement of
the Church or the safety of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</p>
               <p>It now remains that I consider the
great Objections which are urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all which is already said, which
are these, That Comprehension, say
some, others Toleration, others both,
are fit to be granted; 1. By reason
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98410:97"/>
of the great Numbers who do desire
it: Secondly, in respect of their great
Merit, they being Persons in whom
doth consist a great part of the Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Industry, Frugality and Wisdom of
the Nation, and particularly the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
have deserved well of His
Majesty. Thirdly, it is very advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to grant a Liberty at this time to
these Persons by reason of the great
assistance which they are able to afford
us against Popery; and Fourthly, that
if a Liberty be not given, it will be a
very great Inconvenience to Trade.
Fifthly, Toleration of several Forms
of Religion, is a thing which we may
see a good effect of among our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland:</hi> Lastly,
Civil Penalties are of no use in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but only to make Hypocrites.
To all which pretences I return this.</p>
               <p>First, that the Numbers of these men
are not in any degree so great as they
do pretend; It is indeed one of their
great and old Arts to make all the
shew they can possibly, and to boast
of those Numbers which they cannot
shew; one who is as well acquainted
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98410:97"/>
with the Muster Rolls of these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as any man, doth plead for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
by this very Argument, that
they are not so considerable as that any
danger needed to be feared from
them. <hi>Peace-offering,</hi> p. 8. <hi>What are
we that Publick Disturbance should be
feared from us, nec pondera rerum nec
momenta sumus; by what way or means,
were we never so desirous, could we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
any thing thereunto? What De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
are we capable of? &amp;c.</hi> So that
it seems this is an Argument which
they can either use or lay aside, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
offers it self: They can either
wheedle Authority into pity and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
upon the account that they
are so inconsiderable, as that no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
can possibly be feared from them;
Or otherwise they can Hectour Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as being so considerable, as
that there is no danger so great, but if
they are disobliged, it may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be feared from them.</p>
               <p>In the second Place, is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that these men do appear in some
Numbers, considering how easily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
honest well-meaning Persons may
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98410:98"/>
be seduced by the Zeal and vehemence
of some who are seduced themselves,
and the various Arts of others whose
great design is to seduce as many as
they can possibly: And again, are
there not some Remainders of the Old
Army yet alive, Committee-men, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrators,
Purchasers of Crown
and Church Lands, and otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
in the late Rebellion? besides
vast Multitudes of the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
depending on them, who must
needs be glad of so many Solemn Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of meeting one another, by
which they keep up their Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Correspondence, and put a
very serious face upon their <hi>goad old
Cause,</hi> and find many opportunities to
he mutually serviceable to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their private Affairs, and of
joyning Counsels against the Publick.
And do they not breed up their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and Relations in the very same
Principles with themselves? Now the
greater Numbers there are of such
People so much the greater care there
ought to be taken that they be not
permitted to meet together. The
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98410:98"/>
Meeting-place is very well fitted for
a Religious Rendevouz, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Master of the Camp may not
only deliver out his Orders at the
same time with, but may stamp upon
them the Authority of the Oracles of
God.</p>
               <p>But in the next Place, if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
would please but to own it
self, the Numbers of these men would
presently appear to be very inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
and this hath no oftner been
tryed than it hath been found to have
been accompanied with good effect.
In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Dayes, these mens
Predecessours were very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
made grat noise with their great
Numbers, and the great dangers
which would arise by disobliging
them; and they had some great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
in Court upon some accounts,
which were not very Religious; but
when by reason of their Insolent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
in the Year 1588. When the
Queen was in all her Fears from the
<hi>Spanish Armado,</hi> and in a condition, as
they thought to deny them Nothing;
they so far provoked Her, as to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98410:99"/>
Her Mind for ever from them:
Their boasted of Numbers did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
abate, and the Laws were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
submitted to, as soon as ever
they did perceive that it was but in
vain to think of longer triffling with
them: So likewise it hapned in King
<hi>Iames</hi> His Dayes, their loud Clamours
were presently silenced, as soon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the King declared Himself reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
at the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court:</hi>
Nor would the Act of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
have had any less effect, if it had
not been accompanied with a general
Discourse at the same time of a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to follow immediately upon it.
And I appeal to the Consciences of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of the Preachers in the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Congregations, whether they did
not leave their Livings upon this very
hope, which without it they would
have never done?</p>
               <p>Besides, the Numbers of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
ought by no means to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon, as an Argument for Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by any, because, it is not looked
upon as such by themselves: This very
Point being a thing about which
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98410:99"/>
themselves are highly divided, and
would by no means if they could help
it grant to one another.</p>
               <p>But besides their Numbers, they are
now to be considered in point of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
but this is a part of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in which I do delight so very
little, as that I must gratifie my own
temper so far, as to say very little in
it. The Faults of other men are
things which I by no means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to dwell upon, even when it is
necessary, I take it to be very irksome:
As they are particular Persons, I have
nothing to say to any one of them,
and whatever Degrees any of them
have attained to in Piety and Virtue,
in any kind of Intellectual, Moral,
and Religious Accomplishments, I
pray God that they may every day
increase more and more in them, and
that both here and hereafter they may
receive the comfort and reward of
whatever is truly good in them. But
as they are a Party, I take it to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
clear, that their Merit hath not
been very great, either to the Crown
or Nation, and in this it were easie
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98410:100"/>
to be very large, for one who delights
in that which to me is a very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Employment. In the Histories of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First; there is too much
to be found on this Argument, and
His Majesty which now is, when He
was in the Hands of these men, what
Usage He did receive from them,
though His Royal Clemency hath
been graciously pleased to pardon, yet
His Loyal Subjects have not quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
it.</p>
               <p>As to the next Pretence, that it is
adviseable to grant these men an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
at this time, by reason of
the great assistance which they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to afford us against Popery: This
is such an Objection which the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Sons of the Church will scarce be
able to refrain themselves from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon without some Indignation:
The Writings of the Bishops and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
Divines have hitherto been
had in great Esteem over all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
no men thought to have
had a better Cause to defend; no men
looked upon as better able to defend
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98410:100"/>
it: Not to mention the many Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King
<hi>Iames</hi> His Dayes, whose Names are,
both at home and abroad, had in
great and deserved Honour: I shall
only mention some few who since the
beginning of the present Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
have wrote against the Puritans as
well as Papists, and accordingly have
fell under the Indignation of both
Parties, <hi>viz.</hi> Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> Arch-Bishop
<hi>Bramhal,</hi> Bishop <hi>Taylor,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Hammond,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</hi>
How many Ages will the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists
take to breed up a man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to any one of these? Bishop <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson,</hi>
a Person of known Learning
and Judgment, in a Preface to a Body
of Sermons, Printed some Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
His Majesties Return, takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to declare his Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Controversie between the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as it useth to be handled by the
Non-Conformists; his Words are
these: <hi>That they preach against Popery,
I not at all mislike, only I could wish
that these two Cautions were better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98410:101"/>
served than (as far as I can conjecture
of the Rest by the proportion of what
hath come to my Knowledge) I fear they
usually are by the more zealous of that
Party: First, that they do not through
Ignorance, Prejudice, or Precipitancy,
call that Popery which is not, and then
under that name and notion preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; and then Secondly, that they
would do it with less noyse and more
weight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> Now it is well known,
that Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> was a Person of
great Learning and Judgment, and
withall a Person of very great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Modesty, and who did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little delight in undervaluing the
meanest Person living; and yet he
expresseth his Thoughts concerning
the Writings of the Non-Conformists
against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be
liable to these two not inconsiderable
Defects: First, that they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Question; Secondly,
that they did not know how to pitch
upon such Arguments as were fit to be
made use of. And withall some Pages
afterwards he adds this, <hi>That even in
these times of great Distraction, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98410:101"/>
Consequently thereunto of so great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
for the Factors for</hi> Rome, <hi>none
have stept into the Gap more readily,
nor appeared in the face of the Enemy
more openly, nor maintained the Fight
with more stoutness and gallantry than
the Episcopal Divines have done, as
their late Learned Writings testifie:
yea and some of them such (as beside
their other sufferings) have layen as
deep under the suspicion of being Popish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> any other of their Brethren
whatsoever: That by the Endeavours of
these Episcopal Divines some that were
bred Papists have been gained to our
Church, others that began to waver, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and settled in their Old Religion,
and some that were fallen from us reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and reduced, notwithstanding all
the disadvantages of these confused
Times; and of each of these I am able
to produce some Instances. But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
sincerely, as in the presence of God,
and before the World, that I have not
known (at least I cannot call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance)
so much as one single Example of
any of this done by any of our Anti-Geremonian
Brethren, whether Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98410:102"/>
or Independent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whether our separating Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
have been improved in their
Abilities, or have been more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their successes in their dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
with the Romanists since that
time, it lies upon them to make out;
I am sure that the Writings of the most
eminent Persons now among them
were then extant: Since which time
there hath indeed appeared a Body of
Sermons, being the united Labours of
sundry of them, but of any Miracles
which either have or are likely to be
wrought by them, the World both is,
and it is to be feared will be for ever
silent.</p>
               <p>If therefore we take these men into
the Church, our Church will be so
much the less defensible, as having
admitted into it Persons whose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
are no way justifiable; and
withal with express leave not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the most unjustifiable of all
their Principles. And for their Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
against the Romanists, it doth
not as yet appear, that it will be so
valuable as to countervail the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98410:102"/>
we shall give the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
by taking these into our Church. If
we suffer them to remain in Bodies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the Church, then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists
have an Advantage, if they
please to use it, to take up what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
themselves shall suppose to be
fittest for them. How easie a thing is it
for a Priest to set up for a gifted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!
And what one Opinion is there
imaginable, which may not be brought
in under the pretence of a farther
degree of New Light? Whether all
the stories be true of Friars who
have preached in Meeting-houses, I
have not had an opportunity of being
so well informed, as to venture to say
any thing; but I am sure, if they
will, they have there fair opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
offered: And if it be not as yet
seasonable to set up directly for their
own Church, they may however
prepare the way by pulling down of
ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s.</p>
               <p>And notwithstanding all the Zeal
which the Non-conformists do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
against Popery, it is well known
that they know very well how to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98410:103"/>
joyn both Counsels and Arms toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
The leading Men of both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

of Papists which serve in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Commanders and others; the
great Industry they have used to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the Loyalty and Affection of all our
loving Subjects of that Religion; the
PRIVATE PROMISES and VNDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAKINGS
THAT THEY HAVE MADE
TO THEM, that if they would assist
them against Vs, ALL THE LAWS
MADE IN THEIR PREIVDICE
SHOVLD BE REPEALED, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the next Objection, That
the suppressing of Conventicles will
be a great hindrance to Trade: I must
needs confess that this is a thing which
would have great weight, if it had
any truth in it. That Trade is a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98410:103"/>
thing of great and general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
is so plain and confessed a thing,
as that there is no need of spending
many words whereby to prove it: Our
wisest Kings have always thought
themselves concerned to make Laws
and all manner of provisions whereby
to promote and encourage it; and
there is scarce any man so mean, but
that he doth in one degree or other
receive some benefit by our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with other Nations. Not to
enter into particulars, I shall only
name one, which is indeed the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of all the rest, and that is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
which is not a thing of our own
Growth, but it is a thing without
which those things which are of our
own Growth, cannot without great
difficulty pass from one hand to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Our Ships are our Bulwarks,
nay, they are more than so; for they not
only keep other Nations from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us, but they carry us to them:
They make the Sea to be our Earth,
the whole World to be as it were
our native Soil, by bringing home to
our doors whatsoever groweth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98410:104"/>
Corner of the Universe. It was
Trade which brought <hi>Tyre</hi> to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>The City of Ioy, the crowning City,
whose Merchants were Princes, and
whose Traffickers the honourable of the
earth,</hi> Esay 22. 7, 8. It was by the
benefit of Trade that this City is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
said <hi>to have heaped up silver as
dust, and fine Gold as mire in the streets,
Zech.</hi> 9. 3. It is absolutely necessary
for us, if we will be secure of our own
Land, to keep up a proportionable
strength at Sea. And besides this
necessity in point of Safety, it brings
innumerable advantages in point of
improvement; carrying from us our
own Commodities which we can
spare from our own use, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
bringing us whatsoever the
World doth afford, for Use, Delight,
Strength or Ornament. It is a thing
by which vast multitudes do alone
subsist and altogether depend upon,
which great numbers do thrive and
flourish by; by which his Majesty
hath a brave Addition to his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
and every man besides doth in
his degree find many comforts and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98410:104"/>
conveniencies in his way of Living:
It is the great Employer and Reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of all sorts of Ingenuity and of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry;
by means whereof we every
day see men advanced to Wealth and
Honour, to live comfortably to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and with great benefit to their
Country. It is a thing in it self clear,
that Trade is very highly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
beneficial, and those who are
but ordinarily versed in it are able
to reckon many admirable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which I cannot so much as think
upon. It remains now that I enquire
whether there be any such Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
between Trade and Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in Religion, as is generally
(though without any Ground which
I could ever hear) pretended? These
Two things have in their nature no
manner of Repugnancy, and if there be
any Repugnancy, between them, it
doth not proceed from them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but from something else, which
it is to be hoped may be removed,
and neither of these Two things the
worse for the removal of it; and what
that is I shall now enquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:98410:105"/>It is well known that this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from Trade hath been used in
former days, when there was no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of occasion for it; but however
it served as a pretence, whereby to
amuse the People, and make them
clamour against the Government. I
instance in the Case of my Lord of
<hi>Strafford:</hi> What a noise was raised
all over the Town, that there could
be no Trade in the Kingdom till Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
was done upon him: And
whosoever raiseth any such Cry shall
have always some ready to joyn with
him in it, because there will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
those who will want Trade:
And let him but tell them that the
Court and the Bishops are the only
Causes of this their want, and it is
no wonder if they cry out with the
loudest, Down with them, down
with them to the ground. Indeed if
the Bishops in <hi>England</hi> did pretend to
the same Power with the Presbyteries
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then indeed it might so
happen that the Traders might have
some cause to be jealous of them;
for those Gentlemen did at the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98410:105"/>
at <hi>Glascow,</hi> 1638. pass an Act
concerning Salmon-fishing; another
about Salt-pans, <hi>Roger L' Estrange,
p.</hi> 330. By Act of Assembly at <hi>Dundee</hi>
1592. they prohibited all Trading
with any of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and they put down the
<hi>Munday</hi>-market at <hi>Edinburgh, Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
p.</hi> 393, 394. But in this Case
the Shoo-makers thought fit to assert
their Christian Liberty against the
Impositions of the Presbytery, and
tumultuously gathered together, and
threatned to chase the Ministers out
of Town; upon which the Market
continued: Which, as that grave Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
tells us, did cause much sport
at Court, where it was said, <hi>That
Rascals and Soutars could obtain at the
Ministers hands what the King could
not in Matters more reasonable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Trading hath, ever since the
Restauration of his Majesty, been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high, notwithstanding the many
complaints about it, it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to any man who is never so little
acquainted with the Custom-house;
but that it hath not answered to the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98410:106"/>
height of all mens hopes, is not to be
wondred at, if we consider some things
which have hapned, which the Act
of Uniformity was no way concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in: First, there was a War with
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> by which it was
not to be avoided, but that many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
must needs become very great
Sufferers: Secondly, At the very same
time there was a raging Plague, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>London</hi> but in most of the other
Trading places of the Nation; which
did not only sweep away great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of our Trading People, but may
easily be supposed to have had an
unhappy influence upon Trade it self:
Thirdly, To accompany these Two
great difficulties there came a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Fire, the loss by which is inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable:
And Fourthly, there hath
been a Second Dutch War. Now
there are none of all these things can
happen to a Nation, but Trade must
unavoidably suffer by, and feel it;
and then the wonder will be very
little if we consider that we have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by them all. And these are
things so publickly known, that it is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98410:106"/>
to be admired, that men should have
the confidence to take no notice of
any one of them; but if they hear of
any Difficulties which the Trading
People do wrestle with, presently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook
all these notorious Causes, and
enter into long Harangues about Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer and Ceremonies. I may
add that besides the fore-mentioned
Calamities; If we are out-done in
point of Trade by our Neighbours in
<hi>Holland,</hi> it is not to be wondered at,
if we consider the Nature of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and the Manners of our People.</p>
               <p>Our Country hath in it self a great
plenty of all things necessary for the
life of men, which <hi>Holland</hi> hath not;
they must trade or they cannot live,
which is not our Case: And if neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
makes men expert, and their being
expert brings them to thrive; it is not
to be wondred at: It is this very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
which every day makes vast Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
among them, glad to submit to all
the Labours &amp; Hazards of all the Seas in
the World, &amp; all this purely to support
their Lives with very course fare, and
very small wages; now the goodness of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98410:107"/>
our Country affording to our People
a more comfortable subsistence upon
much easier terms than is to be had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, is one plain cause why our
People are not easily to be brought to
take that pains, run into those dangers
and submit to those severe terms, which
with them is not less than absolutely
necessary: Not to say any thing of the
return of their long Voyages, what
vast advantages do they make by
Fishing upon our own Coasts, which
we alwayes complain of, but will by
no means betake our selves unto. Again
he who hath got a vast sum of money
by trading, hath here in <hi>England</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
conveniency of purchasing Land
with it, and by that means he himself
or his Son doth become a Country
Gentleman, which in <hi>Holland</hi> is not to
be done; by which means Trade is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us given over, when men
come to be Masters of such great sums
of Money as to be best able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it, and to reap the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
advantages by it: In <hi>Holland</hi>
because Trade is the thing which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one is to trust to, their Wives and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98410:107"/>
Children are all instructed in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
and inured to the business of
it, and so the Stock and Experience of
a Family descends from Father to
the Son, and increaseth from Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Generation: Now it is far from
being a Miracle, that their Merchants
should be able to out-do ours, who are
frequently left by their Parents as
large or larger sums of Money to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with, as ours take themselves to
be very well satisfied with and give
over: They go on and improve what
we look upon as more adviseable bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to enjoy, and by that means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
an increase which would have
come easily, and too often waste and
consume what they in a few Years are
by reason of their great Stocks ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
without difficulty to treble.
And besides that different way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
of the plenty of the Rich which
is between them and us: They make
another and greater advantage of the
necessities of the Poor, than we either
do or can do, or it is fit for us to do:
They make their People to work hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
fare harder than any of ours will
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98410:108"/>
do, to take smaller wages, and by that
means they are something helped in
being able to under-sell us: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Masters of Trade do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
live much more frugally than
we do in point of Dyet and Apparel,
and other heights of living, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
avoid many unnecessary ways
of Expence, which we are (perhaps
too apt) to be fond of. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is expended must needs take off
so much from Improvement; which
Consideration prevails with them to
be very sparing till they are very
Rich, and not to pretend to any of
the wayes of Vanity, till they have
brought themselves into a condition
to carry on their material Concerns
with the best advantage. Now is it
any wonder, if there were nothing
more in the Case than this, that in
Trade they should much out-do us?
And there is little doubt to be made
of it, that he who is better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with that People than I am, will
be able to reckon many other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
things wherein they differ from
us in order to this great Design, which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98410:108"/>
have no manner of relation to Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conscience, and which would
have the same effect without it, as
they can possibly have by it.</p>
               <p>As to our selves and our present
Case, there are but three Things
(which I can learn) pretended, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of which it is possible to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that the putting the Act against
Conventicles in Execution can draw
any prejudice upon Trade: First,
that Merchants who are not willing
to conform, will not come over and
settle in <hi>England:</hi> Secondly, that the
most eminent Traders being Non-conformists,
they will either forbear
Trading to the utter undoing of all
such Workmen (as Weavers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
who do depend upon them, or leave
the Kingdom and carry their profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Trades along with them; which
will bring a great decay of Trade
here, and carry away that benefit,
which <hi>England</hi> might have received,
to that, whatever Country they shall
please to settle in.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That Merchants beyond
Sea (as <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) will
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98410:109"/>
not be easily perswaded to trust their
Estates in the hands of those who are
not of their own Religion, and they
who are, being lyable to such Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
as by our Laws they are liable
unto, will be fearful of having any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
in their own hands, and look
upon it as more adviseable to forbear
Trading, rather than to be liable to
so many Difficulties; These are the
three most considerable Objections
which I have hitherto been able to
meet with, and to each of these I have
this to offer by way of return.</p>
               <p>As to the first, that this severity
will discourage Forraign Merchants
from comming over to us: It is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
to think that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is such a Bug bear to the rest
of the Reformation, as that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of that is looked upon as suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Cause to hinder any great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of valuable Persons from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over to dwell in the Nation. It
is by no means clear that any store of
them do at this time desire to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
hither, and if they did, it is
more than possible that some other of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98410:109"/>
our Civil Constitutions may be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
bars in their way, than the Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Conventicles, and particularly
the want of a Register: And that
Person must have more than ordinary
Intelligence, who can be able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us, that there are such Numbers
of considerable Merchants at this
time designing to come over, and are
diverted only by the News of the
Bill against Conventicles going to be
put into Execution; as that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and addition of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and that Trade to the Nation
should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> great, as to overbalance
those many and unavoidable Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
which I have already
shewed, that Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must be exposed to, by the
grant of Liberty of Conscience. It
doth not remain in our Memories that
in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, when there was Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
given to all except Papists and
Prelatists, that any were by that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
encouraged to come over, at
least not any such number as to be
considerable. But suppose it should
so happen, that some Eminent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98410:110"/>
should design to come over; I
could never yet hear, nor am I wise
enough to think upon any reason, why
the Act against Conventicles should
more fright them from <hi>England,</hi> than
the Inquisition doth from other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
as <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> and
yet in those Countries Merchants have
their Factories, and drive their greatest
Trade: Besides strangers Merchants have
as much encouragement in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
as can reasonably be desired;
the <hi>French</hi> have their Church, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> theirs; nay, even the <hi>Iews</hi> have
theirs, and all Aliens of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have even by the very Act of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity
an express provision made
for them, as to the enjoyment of their
own way of Worship at the pleasure
of His Majesty; and if they do meet
and keep to their own Language, they
need fear no more in this Country
than in any other.</p>
               <p>As to the second Thing alledged,
that if the Act against Conventicles
be put in Execution, the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Traders being Non-Conformists,
they will leave off Trading, and by
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98410:110"/>
that means undo all sorts of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who do depend upon them, and
not only so, but leave the Nation,
and carry their Trades away along
with them.</p>
               <p>Now that this is a thing of more
Noise than Weight, will appear if we
examine it with a little Care. That
some eminent Merchants are Non-conformists
is undoubtedly True; but
that the most eminent are so, I am
sure is not true, and could easily make
it appear, if it were fit to mention
the Names of particular Persons: But
so far as it is true, doth any man in
his wits imagine, that the Act against
Conventicles will make them either
quit their profitable. Trades, or fright
them out of the Kingdom? It doth
neither condemn them to be hanged
nor burned, neither doth it so much
as touch their Persons or Estates for
being Non-conformists, but permits
them to be of what Religion they
please, and alloweth them the free
exercise of their Religion in their
Families: It cannot therefore be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
imagined, that People will be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98410:111"/>
so far out of their wits (though I must
confess that Fanaticism will go a
great way toward putting them out of
them) as to leave their settled and
profitable Trades, their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Relations and Friends, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot publickly shew the
exercise of their Mode of Worship;
whereas they may freely enjoy it in
their own Families, and be known to
do so, without the least interruption
in any of the forementioned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies:
Especially considering,
that Merchants of that Eminency,
that their Case deserves to be taken
notice of in a case of this Publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
now under debate, are very well
able to keep Ministers in thier own
Houses, and may do it with far less
charge and prejudice, than either
going into some other Countrey, or
the forbearance of their Trades will
put them to. But I shall for once sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
two Things, whereof the first is
evidently not true; the second not at
all likely, That the most Eminent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
are Non-Conformists, and that
upon that account they will forbear
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98410:111"/>
Trading: But even upon these Terms
it is to be hoped that those they deal
with will not be utterly undone,
whatever may be pretended: For put
the Case that three or four of the most
Eminent Merchants should dy, or
(which I wish did never happen)
break; every dayes experience shews us,
that the Clothiers they deal with, and
consequently the Weavers, and other
Workmen depending upon them, are
not presently ruined, or so much as
out of employment, but do immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
find other Merchants to deal
with; the Trades of those who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give over Trading, or dy, being
alwayes continued by their Sons, or
Partners, or shared amongst those who
have been their Servants, or other
Merchants who deal in the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
and to the same Places.
But suppose that the putting the Laws
in Execution should so far distract any
Numbers, as to make them run out of
the Kingdom: Let it be considered
whither they will run, only into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where they cannot more freely
enjoy the exercise of their Religion in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98410:112"/>
their own Families, nor converse more
freely with one another about it, than
they may do here in <hi>England.</hi> All the
difference is, that here they cannot
meet in great Numbers, and I leave it
even to the Non-Conformists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Judge, whether that one
Conveniency of Meeting in great
Numbers be a sufficient enticement to
any rational man to exchange <hi>England</hi>
for <hi>Holland?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But put the Case, that they do go
into <hi>Holland,</hi> or into some other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
I did never yet meet with any
man who could demonstrate to me
how they could carry away their
Trade of Merchandizing, though they
were never so willing; live in <hi>Holland</hi>
they may, and drive their usual Trades
here in <hi>England</hi> by their Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
in which Case the Nation will
only loose the common profit of their
eating, drinking and wearing: But to
carry away the Trade of the Nation
with them, is not possible, if they leave
any Merchants behind, as I am sure they
will many more, and more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than any who will go away; and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98410:112"/>
by withdrawing themselves into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries, they will but leave
their Trades to be shared amongst
better men and better Subjects; so
that by leaving the Kingdom, instead
of prejudicing, they would occasion
a very great blessing unto it, by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
away with them the Divisions,
but not at all the Trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>When the Act against Conventicles
was first made, this Argument against it
from Trade was much insisted on, and I
remember a Story was raised about
some great Dealers in the <hi>West,</hi> who
had with-drawn their stock, left off all
business, by which means vast Numbers
of poor People, who did depend on
them, were utterly undone: This
Matter seemed so considerable, as that
several of the most Eminent Persons
in the Nation did meet together to
consult about a remedy for so great,
and as it was said, so growing an evil.
But when this Matter came to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into, I could never learn that it
had any thing more than a great deal
of noise in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:98410:113"/>There is an eminent City in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
inferiour perhaps to none except
<hi>London,</hi> wherein this Artifice was made
use of to fright the Magistrates from
suppressing the Conventicles: A great
rumour was spread up and down, that
if they might not have Liberty to
meet as formerly, then they would
all with-draw their Stocks, which
would be a great detriment to His
Majesty, and a vast loss to the City,
and leave the Poor to be provided
for by their respective Parishes. But
the Raisers of all this Clamour did
quickly find that they had to do with
those who were at least as great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Trade as themselves, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
it was undertaken by those
who were very well able to make it
good; that if the Dissenters did think
fit to withdraw their Stocks, there
should immediate care be taken that
the Trade of the City should be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on to the very same height which
it was at, without the least abatement,
or leaving any one Work-man out of
as good an Employment as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
It was so far from being feared,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98410:113"/>
that it was desired that they would
withdraw their Stocks, and that they
may be the better encouraged to the
so doing, provided that they would
give Security that they will not Trade
at all, neither by themselves, or others
for them, nor in other mens Names,
they shall at any time have a good
sum of money given them, if that
may move them to it.</p>
               <p>Let us not be vainly afraid, where
no fear is: Do we know the Non-Conformists
no better than so, that
we should suspect them of being apt
to give over their profitable Trades?
It had been a more rational Jealousie
to have looked upon them as more
intent upon any imaginable way of
getting of Money, than on any Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion, of what sort so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
And perhaps it would be not
only no ill Experiment to destroy this
Argument, but withall as likely a way
to reduce them, as any which can be
thought upon; if there were a Law,
That those who refuse to conform, or
at least who meet at Conventicles,
should not be permitted to Trade:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98410:114"/>
Such a Law indeed would be terrible
to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I hope the bare mention
of it will make them forbear to use
this kind of threatning us with that,
which to themselves alone will be, if
at all, dreadful.</p>
               <p>As to the third Objection, That
Merchants beyond Seas (as <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) will be afraid to
trust their Estates in the hands of those
who are not of their own Religion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is of so little weight as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
but a very few words; it being
evident that all kinds of Merchants
at this day do correspond, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
have corresponded with others
not of their own Religion, Papists
with Protestants, Protestants with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> What other Pretences
there are in this Case, wherein Trade
may seem concerned, I do not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
call to mind, and therefore shall go
on to the next suggestion why a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
of several wayes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may not do as well here as it doth
amongst our Neighbours in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>France,</hi> the different Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98410:114"/>
of Religion there, hath not been
without many sad effects upon both
Parties, and hath so sanctified the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimosities
on each side, that it hath
prevailed upon both, out of Zeal to
God, to let Aliens and Enemies into
the Bowels of their Native Country.
But their Case and ours is vastly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who are there to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,
have those Merits to plead
which our Non Conformists have not;
and besides, they do not divide into
several Communions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
neither would any such thing
be permitted either by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or by the Reformed Church it
self.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Holland,</hi> Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is a thing which they were not
brought to admit of by second
Thoughts, and after mature Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but were necessitated upon by
the Nature of that Cause upon which
they first united among themselves,
and the Constitution of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they fell into. One part of
their Cause was a Deliverance from
the Impositions of the Church of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:98410:115"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> as exercised after the imperious
manner of the Spanish Government:
Now Liberty in matters of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was the most natural Word in
the World in this Case to be made use
of; Freedom from the present Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
was the thing immediately in
their Eye, and many of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
at the same time had the same
Aim: And as they were then only
agreed what they would not have,
but not at all what they would have,
they invited all, that all might come
to their Assistance. But besides this,
one Religion was not easie to be
brought into so many several Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Governments, as go to the
making up of those States. For as
Sr. <hi>William Temple</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.
of their Government, <hi>p. 75. They are
not a Common-wealth, but a Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of seven Soveraign Provinces uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together for their common and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Defence, without any dependance
one upon another,</hi> &amp;c. Nay farther,
<hi>That each of these Provinces is likewise
composed of so many little States and
Cities, which have several Marks of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98410:115"/>
Sovereignty within themselves, &amp; are not
subject to the Sovereignty of the Province;
not being concluded in many things by the
Majority, but only by the universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of Voyces in the Provincial
States.</hi> To this let us add the great
Variety of Persons which by reason of
the Wars and Persecutions of those
times, came into, and embodied with
them, out of <hi>France, Germany, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and is it to be wondred at, if
not knowing how to agree in any one
way they permitted divers?</p>
               <p>Such a kind of Liberty therefore as
is now contended for amongst us,
cannot so properly be said to be given
by these States, as to have grown up
with them; and though it be a part
of their Nature, is one of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies;
and this hath not been
unperceived by them. In the Affair
of <hi>Barnevelt</hi> it was found that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Differences could find a way of
intermingling themselves with State-quarrels,
and the States did then think
fit to make Laws about what they
called erroneous in point of Doctrine.
As to Religion the Effects of Liberty
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98410:116"/>
of Conscience are in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
plainly to be seen in the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
growth of Popery and Socinian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,
and of men altogether indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
as to all kinds of Articles of
Belief; things which by the same
means may be brought into <hi>England,</hi>
and indeed upon the admittance of
which, are not to be kept out of it.
The States of the United Provinces
may indeed keep themselves safe from
all Disturbances which may arise from
Enthusiastick Lunacies, by reason of
their Garrisons and standing Army,
without which no security can be had
against the dangers of Toleration.
And seing that the Case of <hi>England</hi> is
in both these Respects very different
from that of <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp; it is to be hoped
is intended so to continue, an Argument
of this nature taken from them ought
by no means to be looked upon as
what ought to conclude us by it.</p>
               <p>Now that the Argument from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ought by no means to be looked
upon as conclusive to us, either as to
Comprehension or as to Toleration,
doth appear in these Two things:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98410:116"/>
1. In the Constitution of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as being very different from
theirs; 2. in the Condition of those
People amongst us who dissent from
the Government. 1. As to the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of our Government, Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
is with us much more unsafe
than the same thing would be in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
because the Preachers do there
depend altogether upon the States
Pay, and have no other Tenure but
during pleasure; whereas a Beneficed
Man with us hath a Free-hold, and is
not to be turned out but by a legal
Way: By which advantage he may
fence with Authority, and may pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licky
deliver such things which the
people may very well understand,
and yet the Law may not be able to
take any hold of him. And of this,
I doubt, we should have sudden ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
if these men could be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Law into sure and certain Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
upon their own Terms; and
I am the more apt to suspect this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I could never yet hear that this
sort of men was ever wrought upon
by being yielded to: And if their
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98410:117"/>
Gratitude and good Nature should
upon this occasion begin, it will be
so much the more welcome as it is less
expected.</p>
               <p>But as Comprehension among us,
considering the Persons who do desire
it, and their declared Principles, is
much more unsafe than the same thing
would be in <hi>Holland,</hi> by reason of
the Constitution of our Government
in reference to the Clergy; So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for the same reason is Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more unsafe here than it would be
there, if we do consider the Temper
of those People who dissent from us.
<hi>Holland,</hi> as I have already mentioned,
hath a standing Army, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
a one, that the Publick
Peace shall infallibly be secured by it,
whether their Preachers, or whoever
else can be perswaded by them, will
or no. And how confidently soever
the Argument from <hi>Holland</hi> is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
made use of, to induce us to
grant the like Liberty, there was a
time when this very Argument was
looked upon with great scorn: The
Author of <hi>Wholsome Severity,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98410:117"/>
doth censure the States of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces with great sharpness
upon this occasion, <hi>p.</hi> 30. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the Toleration there given to
differing sorts of Dissenters, to the
Toleration given by the Pope <hi>to
Courtizans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And besides, the various sorts of
Perswasions there do not use to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the Lawfulness of Tolerating
one another, as ours have always
done. I have already shewed, that
the Presbyterians would by no means
tolerate the Independents, if they
knew how to help it; and I shall now
in a word shew, how unwilling the
Independents are to tolerate the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
or other Sects which in
their Inclinations they do not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this is no new discovery of
mine, but a thing which did disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it self as early as there was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for it, as we read in teh fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Book called</hi> Wholsome Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
reconciled with Chistian Liberty,
<hi>p.</hi> 19. In New <hi>England</hi> there hath been
Severity enough (to say no worse) used
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98410:118"/>
against Hereticks and Schismaticks.
And here I must appeal to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of those who now plead so much
for Liberty of Conscience and Toleration
in this Kingdom; were they able to root
out the Presbyterians and their way,
and could find Civil Authority incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to put forth the Coercive Power
against it, Whether in that case would
they not say, That the Magistrate may
repress it by strong hand, if it be not
otherwise to be repressed? It is not
without Cause that I put this <hi>Quaere</hi>
to them; for <hi>M. S.</hi> p. 50. doth allow of
the Magistrates fighting against a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which is indeed Superstition, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
or Schism, and only pretendeth to
be from God, when it is indeed from
men. Also that Pamphlet called, <hi>As
you were,</hi> p. 3. tells us, that it was
neither <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s meaning, nor Mr.
Goodwins, That every Way pretending
to be from God must be let alone; but
that only we are to refrain and let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
till we are out of danger of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against God, while we endeavour to
overthrow it. Now I assume that there
are some who plead for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98410:118"/>
who profess that they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and fully assured upon demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
proofs, that the Presbyterial Way
is not from God nor according to the
Mind of Iesus Christ: Therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Principles, they must
allow of the putting forth of the Civil
Coercive Power against the Presbyterial
Way, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sterry</hi> likewise, who was the
great Preacher at <hi>Whitehall</hi> in the
dayes of Mr. <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
preached, <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. 1651. called
England<hi>'s Deliverance from the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Presbytery, compared with its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from the Roman Papacy,</hi> upon
<hi>Ier. 16. 14, 15. It shall no more be said,
The Lord liveth that brought up the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel out of the Land of Egypt;
But the Lord liveth that brought up the
Children of Israel out of the Land of the
North, &amp;c.</hi> Which Sermon was Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Order of those Gentlemen who
pleased to call themselves a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
gives us such an account of the
Presbyterians, as was very grateful to
the Powers then in being (though it
was to the Presbyterians that they
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98410:119"/>
owed their very Being;) I shall lay
down his very words: In his Epistle
he saith thus; <hi>Right honorable, I have
desired in my Preaching, in my Prayers,
to work with God even for the opening
of the eyes of men, to see that the same
Spirit which lay in the polluted Bed of
Papacy may meet them in the perfumed
Bed of Presbytery, &amp;c. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I have in my Sermon represented
the same Spirit which dwells in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
when it enters into the PVRER
FORM OF PRESBYTERY, as FVLLER
OF MYSTERY, so FVLLER OF DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPITE
AND DANGER, &amp;c.</hi> In the
Sermon it self; <hi>Many daughters have
done vertuously, but thou excellest them
all: So may</hi> England <hi>now say to the
Lord, In many Mercies, as especially that
in saving us from this bloody design of
the Egyptian Papacy, thou hast done gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
and wonderfully; but this last
Mercy, by which thou savest us from the
black Plots and bloody Powers of the
NORTHERN PRESBYTERY hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
them all.</hi> And in that Sermon
he doth all along prefer the Papists
before the Presbyterians, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98410:119"/>
of which doth not amount
to Toleration of them: Nay, our
Brethren in <hi>New-England,</hi> though
their Constitution hath as much of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience in it, as any Place
in the World, yet have found it to be
a thing so very troublesom, as that
they are grown quite weary of, and
have put very severe Restraints upon
it: Of which in the Second Part of the
Excellent Friendly Debate, <hi>p.</hi> 227. and
the Third Part, <hi>p.</hi> 224. any man may
be abundantly satisfied; and it is well
known that Quakers were hanged in
<hi>New-England,</hi> which was a severity
they did not meet with, either at <hi>Rome</hi>
or at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in his Answer to the
Apologetical Narration, <hi>p.</hi> 244. draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
an Argument against Toleration
from the Judgment of the Divines
in <hi>New England,</hi> who are against the
Toleration of any Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or way but one. <hi>For the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of Iesus Christ (as we have it in
Church Government and Church Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
discussed (Question 31.) is not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,
that one Church may practise
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98410:120"/>
one Form, and another another Form,
as each one shall please, but is one and
the same for all Churches, and in all the
Essentials and Substantials of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,
and to be kept till the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of Iesus Christ: And if that
Discipline which we here practise be (as
we are perswaded of it) the same which
Christ hath appointed, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable,
we see not how another may be
lawful:</hi> Upon which account they will
not in <hi>New-England</hi> tolerate Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
Anabaptists, Antinomians, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
and so careful they are in this
matter, that they make such enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
into the inward Sentiments of the
Minds even of the Laity, as among us
are not usual; and in such Points too
wherein the Publick Government is
not concerned. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Divine in <hi>New-England,</hi> and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
man, is against Toleration, and
holds that men may be punished for
their Consciences, as appears by his
Letter to Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>
his Answer, both Printed, &amp; his Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the Vials, <hi>Vial. 3. p.</hi> 16, 17. &amp; <hi>Vial.</hi>
4. <hi>p.</hi> 17. Where he Answers this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98410:120"/>
                  <hi>Conscience should not be forced,</hi> and
this is his Answer; <hi>Why do you think
that Hereticks were not as conscionable
in the Old Testament as now? If any
man had a Conscience to turn men from
God, he would have men of as much
Conscience to cut them off:</hi> So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole matter it doth appear
that this loud demand of Toleration
is a very disingenious, nay a dishonest
one; because it is asked by those who
(if the Power were in their hands)
would neither allow it to those they
now ask it of, no nor so much as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to one another. One Instance
of their Barbarity in this kind will
not be tedious; the Presbyterians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
His late Majesty the Attendance
of His own Chaplains in His own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
for the Exercise of His own
Devotion; and as the Presbyterians
denied Him the use of the Common-Prayer
whilst he was alive, the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
would not allow Him to be
buried by it after he was dead. Let
them reflect a little upon their own
demeanour in this Case, and then be
as loud as they please in crying out
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98410:121"/>
for Moderation; Tenderness, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
Condi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cension.</p>
               <p>And so I go on to the last Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,
that Civil Penalties do only make
Hypocrites. This were an Excellent
Argument against all Laws whatsoever
if it were well pursued; but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side I take it to be a very clear
Case, that Toleration makes Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
for it renders it safe for any
man, in order to whatever end, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
some dissatisfactions against the
present Ecclesiastical Constitutions,
when in his own Mind he hath none:
And this effect it hath had from the
first moment of His Majesties Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
unto this time: Many preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
then possessed of Benefices went
away from them, because the Right
Owners returned to them again, and
yet these men pretended Scruples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Common Prayer and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
and so were looked upon as
sufferers for their Conscience, and
have ever since subsisted upon the
strength of such pretensions: Of those
who by the Death of the Right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents
continued in their ill-got
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98410:121"/>
Possessions till the Act of Uniformity:
How many refused to conform more
out of shame than Conscience? They
could not without blushing practise
those things which they formerly
preached against, especially in the
same place where they had done so;
and accordingly some have conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in other Countries than where they
lived before, and more did proffer it,
if they could have obtained to have
been provided for: And of those who
did go out at Saint <hi>Bartholomews</hi> Day,
1662. How many were there who
went out upon the great assurance
which they had from their Agents in
<hi>London</hi> of returning again in a few
Weeks with Honour? And among
the People how many are there who
go to Conventicles meerly to get
Custom, as finding it to be a succesful
way, by becoming Members of such a
Church, to get the Trade of such a
Party.</p>
               <p>I have now considered the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of that Fine Project called
Liberty of Conscience, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pretences by which of late it hath
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98410:122"/>
been recommended to us: How much
soever these imperfect Reasonings of
mine may have fallen below the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Argument, I shall be so just
to my Cause, as to refer the Reader
where he may receive compleat and
abundant satisfaction, <hi>viz.</hi> to those
Excellent Votes of the Honourable
House of Commons, <hi>February</hi> 25. 1662.
where there is a full State of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
drawn up with an equal height of
Piety and Wisdom; the Reasons full
and clear, carrying in them all the
Advantages of Strength and Evidence:
Those Renowned Gentlemen did then
shew that they were able with their
Pens to give an account of that Cause,
for which very many of themselves,
and, Fathers did honourably draw
their Swords, and knew very well
how to assert that Church by all the
Rules of Christian Prudence, as well
as they did formerly set inimitable
Patterns of Christian Courage in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for it. There we may see and
admire how those Glorious Worthies
came up to the greatness of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and of the Argument; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98410:122"/>
they were both worthy of one
another, they to defend, and that to
be defended; and as nothing was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
better penned than those Reasons,
so there was scarce ever a better Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
the best Church in <hi>Europe,</hi>
was then bore witness to by the best
House of Commons which ever sat
in this Nation: Those Votes shall for
ever remain as a lasting Monument as
of the Zeal and Religion, so of the
incomparable Endowments and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of those who drew them up.</p>
               <p>And now I shall presume to offer a
few words to our dissenting Brethren,
that they would seriously bethink
themselves what the Causes of their
Separation are, how few, how slight;
that they would with them compare
the Effects of it, what they have been,
what they are, what they may come
to be: Such things have already been
brought about in Church and State
(by means of those Divisions which
the soberest among you did begin and
foment, and none but they were valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
enough to give Support and
Countenance unto) as they themselves
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98410:123"/>
(we are perswaded) did not intend,
nor would fore-see till they found
it too late for to prevent them: Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are things which the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
are naturally apt to be very fond
of, but it is very seldom, and for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little while, that they are found to
answer the hopes conceived of them:
Indeed if it were once agreed upon
what those things were which would
give a general satisfaction, and put an
absolute end to this long and uhappy
Controversie, such a Proposal were at
least worth a Consideration: But if
there be as great variety of Demands
as Persons, and if it be as earnestly
desired among great Numbers, that
their Neighbours should not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged,
as that themselves should, and
we have for many years found it by
a dear bought Experience, that when
men are once gone beyond the Rule,
they wander every where, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end; why should you not at last
look upon it as adviseable to return
to the Rule again? Especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that those of the greatest Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
among you are not against
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98410:123"/>
the having any Rule at all, neither as
yet have you been able to agree upon
any other.</p>
               <p>If it be to be wished that there
should be any Church at all, that
Church must have Articles, and must
have Canons; there is not the smallest
Society in the World can be kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in order to the meanest end, but
there must be some Rules which all its
Members must submit unto, and be
guided by: If therefore there ought
to be kept up among us any such
thing as the Assembling our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in order to the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Almighty God, then this must
be done at some time, in some place,
and after some manner, in some words,
and by some Person appointed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon the doing it: Now if there
be nothing of all this left to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by humane Wisdom and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but that this whole Thing
with every one of all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of it are already determined
in Holy Writ: The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
would be so far from opposing
any thing of this, that she would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98410:124"/>
conform in all particulars to these
divine Establishments, and would be
hugely thankful to any of our dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Brethren, if they will please to
shew her whereabouts she may read
the Form of publick Worship, and
withal the precise Method of that
Order and Decency which ought to
be used in it: For she hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
so unhappy, as not to know of
any but general Directions, which
she hath endeavoured with all Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to pursue: But after this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
she will take care, that her
Children shall serve God in no other
way than that of his own immediate
appointment, if she can but once learn
Directions where to meet with it.
But if there be no such way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
both for the thing it self and
all its Circumstances, prescribed by
God; then so much of it as is not
done by God, must unavoidably be
done by such men whom God hath
set over us, and who in such Cases
are to be to us instead of God.</p>
               <p>And let us consider, that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
which are retained are very
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98410:124"/>
few, very ancient, and very becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and to prevent all jealousies of
the least manner of Superstition in the
retaining them, the Church hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care to declare against all the
Abuses which they were liable unto in
the times of Popery. You value your
selves upon being Successors to the
old Puritans; but do you imagine
that they would in the least have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
many of those things which
you have been the Authors of, or at
least of which you have been the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
and into which we hope
you were not brought by any formed
Resolutions of your own, but driven
upon by those necessities in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
which your Zeal had unawares
drawn you into? Instead therefore
of being jealous of any concealed
mischiefs in a few decent Rites and
comely Usages, you are highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to remember what have been
the Evils of your own Schism, which
you know your selves to have begun,
and we are willing to believe did not
see to the dismal end of; and which
upon your own Principles you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98410:125"/>
be able to provide against: The
Liberties which you take, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
and defended others in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
such Liberties, as no doubt you
have been often sorry to see your
selves undeniably alledged as Patrons
and Examples of. And unless you
can alledge some more necessary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Separation than you hitherto
have been able, you must be very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Judges in your own Case, if you
do not look upon your selves as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsible
for the Consequences of all
those Separations, which by your Arms
and Authority any else was enabled
to make, first with you and after
from you. Whatever suspicions you
may entertain concerning Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
you will never be able to make
a Bar strong enough to keep out the
dreadful Effects of Non-conformity.
If no Settlement is to be complied
with, but such a one which each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Man doth in his own private
thoughts take to be the most advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in all respects as to Matter
and Circumstance, and no longer
than it doth appear to be so, then
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98410:125"/>
there is never like to be any Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the World, at least not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
long Continuance. I shall in this
Case make use only of the words of
an eminent Non-conformist, in a
Treatise which I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
entituled, <hi>Of the Religion of
England,</hi> asserting, <hi>That the Reformed
Christianity settled in its Latitude is
the stability of the Kingdom,</hi> p. 28. <hi>Such
is the complicated condition of humane
Affairs, That it is exceeding difficult
to devise a Rule or Model that shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for all whom Equity will plead for:
Therefore the prudent and sober will
acquiesee in any Constitution that is in
some sort proportionable to the Ends of
Government.</hi> And again, <hi>p. 38. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
if, when all is said, some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction
doth invincibly possess the
Iudgment, in that Case Christian Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Charity as well as Discretion
adviseth such Persons to acquiesoe in
their private security and freedom, and
not to reach after that Liberty that may
unsettle the publick Order, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
the common Safety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although it be a great, a seasonable
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98410:126"/>
and a concerning Truth, That it is
more glorious to confess an Error than
to continue in one, yet because it
may seem a severe Truth, I shall no
more than barely mention it: If in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
you are at least weary of divisions,
do all which in you lieth on your part
to put an end to them; and this you
cannot pretend to have done, till you
have complied with the Publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as far as you believe you may
lawfully, and where you cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
you may yet be silent. If there
be a Ceremony which any one among
you believes that he ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to, doth it thence follow, that
he is obliged to make Parties against
it, and for the sake of that one to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from all the rest, and to avoid
all those other parts of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Service
and Communion, where the
Rite which he scruples hath no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of place?</p>
               <p>Again, when from the Cause you
fly into great Commendations of your
Party, you should do well to avoid
such expressions as, instead of tending
to bespeak the Favour and Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98410:126"/>
of Authority, do rather tend to
awake its caution and to raise its jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie:
That which doth but look
like a Threatning is by no means fit
for an Inferiour to put into his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.
Not only the Honour, but
the Safety of all Government doth
depend upon this, to demurr at least
upon the granting of that Request,
which he who puts it up doth actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take before he asks, and in the
very form of his asking it, doth more
than insinuate the great danger which
may be in denying him. And this
methinks doth appear to have been
an <hi>Indecorum</hi> in your eminent Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in <hi>His Discourse of the Religion of
England,</hi> p. 23. Sect. 11. <hi>How momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
in the ballance of the Nation those
Protestants are that dissent from the
present Ecclesiastical Policy:</hi> Where he
tells us of their great number, their
great Interest, their great Commerce,
their many Relations, their great
Understandings and Discretion; and
in the close of all he adds, NOR DO
THEY WANT THE RATIONAL
COURAGE OF ENGLISH MEN
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98410:127"/>
The meaning of which Words are
at least very suspicious, as to the
King, and as to the Church: Since the
late Discourses of their Endeavours
after an Union, their former Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do not only continue, but are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
in the same manner as formerly:
On their Parts we do not hear of any
beginnings toward a Complyance:
One man indeed there was who made
a Profession of something of this, but
what reserves he had in his mind,
whereby to render that Profession of
his insignificant, let his after-Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
teach us, and withall give us warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what trust to repose in any general
though never so fair Promises.</p>
               <p>And thus I have briefly and plainly
laid down some of the most obvious
Exceptions against the late much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
of Projects, Comprehension,
Toleration, and a third made up of
both them: Comprehension may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
proceed from an Excess of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in those who are ready to grant
it; but it is not very clear that those
who are the most likely to desire it; will
be most ready to make a good use of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98410:127"/>
it: Indeed as to the thing it self, it is
kept so much in the dark, that it is not,
except by some very few, if by any,
understood, who they are who either
do desire or would accept it, or upon
what terms it would be either given
or taken; and as the nature of this
thing is unknown, so will the Issue be
most uncertain. As to those two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements
which are usually mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the taking away of Assent and
Consent, and dispensing with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of Renouncing the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
they are things which carry
great and apparent dangers in them.
He who desires to be excused from
giving his Assent and Consent, can
hardly be able to give any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that his desire than this:
That he doth not believe the Doctrine
of the Church, or doth not mean to
conform to the orders of it. As to
the other Particular, the Dispensing
with the Renouncing of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
the very Proposal is methinks a
very bold one, if we consider what was
the occasion of the Covenant; who were
the Authors; the Time in which it was
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98410:128"/>
entred into, the ends in order to which,
what are the Contents of it, &amp; how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
&amp; indispensible they have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
declared the Obligation of it to
be, what Effects it hath had already, &amp;
at any time may have upon the King,
the Church, the Nation, and in an
especial manner, upon the Old Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers.
And then as to Toleration, I
have shewed the Inconveniencies to
be innumerable and unavoidable,
which it may at any time bring upon
either of them; there is no Imposture
which at this door standing alwayes
open, may not enter into the Church:
No Danger which by a dexterous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of such an unbounded Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
may not have a very fair &amp; easie
passage made for it into the State. And
as for any mixture of these two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances,
it will be so long before the
Bounds and Limits can be agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be set between them; so many
things are to be considered of, before
these two can with any satisfaction to
either be suited to one another, that
an Enquiry may I suppose be safely
put off until a time of greater Leisure.</p>

            <head>A Postscript to the Reader.</head>
            <p>WHen I had put an End, as I
thought to your Trouble
(Good Reader) and my
own, there came to my hands a new
Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>Certain Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
tending to promote Peace and
good Will amongst Protestants, very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the present times:</hi> The Design
of which is to promote the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Comprehension, which the
Author doth endeavour to put a very
good colour upon by laying down
several Propositions; the Third of
which is this, <hi>That the late Civil Wars
in</hi> England <hi>were not begun for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
of Episcopacy and Liturgy, or
to settle the Presbyterian Government
here, but merely for Civil Rights,</hi> as he
adds afterwards. Now if this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
only means, that the Grandees
of the Party had in their Hearts no
manner of zeal for or against any
Form of Religion, any farther than
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98410:129"/>
as thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> other Ends and Designs were
carried on by it, I shall readily grant
it him; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, I shall say this farther,
That, besides Religion, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Rights of the Nation were but
plausible Colours, by which the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men of that Party did set off their
other Ends; such as Revenge, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
Discontent, Covetousness and
Ambition. And this they were
told publickly by one whom they
knew to be able to make it good, in
the excellent Declaration of <hi>Aug.</hi> 12.
1642. <hi>Themselves know what Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have been made by them, and with
what Importunity for Offices and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
what great Services should
have been done for us, and what other
undertakings were (even to the saving
the Life of the Earl of</hi> Strafford) <hi>if we
would confer, such Offices upon them.</hi>
But that Religion was the thing which
they did make shew of, and by which
they drew abundance of well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but deluded People to their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>,
is so plain, and known so
publickly, that it is no little wonder,
that any should offer to outs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> the

Nation in so no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ious a Case. Did not
every Press and every Pulpit declare
against Episcopacy, Liturgy and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onies?
Did not the Lords and
Commons, by their Votes of <hi>March</hi>
12. 1642. resolve upon the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That an Army be forthwith raised
for the Safety of the Kings Person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and PRESERVING THE TRUE
RELIGION? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Did they not in
<hi>Iuly</hi> following put forth a Delaration
concerning the miserable Distractions
and Grievances this Kingdom now
lieth in, by means of JESUITICAL
and wicked Cousellours now about
his Majesty? wherein they tell us
over and over again of the <hi>Protestant
Religion, a great Change of Religion;
That they should be for ever earnest to
prevent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Civil War and those miserable
Effects which it must needs produce, if
they may be avoided without the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of RELIGION,</hi> &amp;c. And in their
Resolutions to live and die with the
Earl of Essex, they tell us, That their
Army was raised, for the MAINTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANCE
of the TRUE PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANT
RELIGION. The Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98410:130"/>
Wedding-rings, Thimbles and Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins
had never been brought in, if it
had not been that the Cause was so
often called, the Cause of God. Let
any man read the Remonstrances and
Declarations of the Two Houses, and
then see whether Religion was not
one of those things which they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
declared their Zeal for; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
in all the Parliaments Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the poor Surplice, the Organs
and the Common Prayer-book were
the first Objects of all their Fury.
But because this present Design of
Comprehension is particularly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to gratifie some Clergy-men, let
us enquire under what name they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
the War unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
Was it not under the name of
Gods Cause; the setting Christ on his
Throne; fighting the Lords Battels?
There is a Collection of their Sermons
Printed, which will not suffer any
Man to doubt of this; out of which
there is enough gathered to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in, <hi>Evangelium Armatum.</hi> And
This Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath in a late Book
confessed as to himself: <hi>When the Wars
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98410:130"/>
began, though the Cause it self lay i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Controversies between King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet the thoughts that the Church
and Godliness it self was deeply in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
by Persecution and Arminia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> did
much more to byass me to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
side, than the Civil Interest
(which at the heart I little regarded.)</hi>
This Author likewise confesseth, That
whatever was the Cause at the first, it
soon became a War for Religion. And
Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> a Person mentioned by this
Author as one of great Merit, in his
Sermon at the <hi>Vxbridge-</hi> Treaty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of the so long letting alone the
Two Plague-sores of Episcopacy and
Common Prayer-Book.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Proposition is this,
<hi>That the Parliamentarians in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our Troubles declared, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr
and detest all Designs of deposing
and murthering his Late Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.</hi>
That they did declare against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such thing I readily grant, and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other Reasons, for this, laid
down by our Author, <hi>That it had
been else impossible for them to have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the people as they did.</hi> But that there
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:98410:131"/>
were among the chief Contrivers of
the Wars, Those who had a design
upon the Kings Crown and Life, is a
thing where of there is great Evidence.
If it be lawful to fight with a King,
why is it not lawful to kill him?
Swords and Bullets are Things which
are by no means to be used against
that Person which we think we ought
not to destroy: And of the great
danger which his Majesties Person
was in at the Battel at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath informed us in a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on that Subject. And in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance
of <hi>May</hi> 26. 1642. the Lords
and Commons did plainly assume to
themselves a Right to depose the
King, in these words; <hi>If we should
make the highest Precedents of former
Parliaments our Patterns, there would
be no cause to complain of want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and Duty in us, when we have not
so much as suffered those things to enter
into our thoughts, which all the World
knows they put in act.</hi> In which words
there is thus much plainly contained,
That whatever former Parliaments
have done, they take themselves to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98410:131"/>
have a Right to do; Now former Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments
have been over-awed into the
deposing of Kings: Now that they
had their Eyes upon those particular
Proceedings of former Parliaments,
appears by those Words, <hi>All the World
knows what they put in act:</hi> His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
in His Answer to that Declaration
of theirs, tells us of two Gentlemen
who said publickly, unreproved in the
Parliament House, one, <hi>That the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of this Kingdom did not depend
upon Him, or upon any of the Royal
Branches of that Root;</hi> Another, <hi>That
He was not worthy to be King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
And as for the Royal Power it
was plainly demanded from him in the
Nineteen Propositions.</p>
            <p>The Eighth Consideration is this,
<hi>That the Non-conforming Presbyteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
had both their hearts and hands in the
Restauration of His Majesty to His
Royal Throne, for which Mr.</hi> Love, <hi>and
Mr.</hi> Gibbons <hi>lost their Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all things I should least have e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that the Advocates for the
Presbyterians should have insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Merits to His Majesty, or the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98410:132"/>
Royal Family, for which their best
Apology is the Act of Oblivion; and
if they would have insisted, yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
methinks they should of all men
not have made Mr. <hi>Love</hi> the Person
to have insisted on: As for that Party
of the <hi>Scots,</hi> which he corresponded
with; it is no Part of their Wisdom
to remind His Majesty of the Usage
which he found from them. As to
Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> the Learned Author of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aritanism</hi>
hath informed us; <hi>p.</hi> 152.
That at the Execution of Archbishop
La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, he uttered these Words with
great Triumph, <hi>Art thou come Little</hi>
Will? <hi>I am glad to see thee here, and
hope to see the nest of the Bishops here e're
long;</hi> and having dipped his Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
in his blood, he rode with it to
<hi>Vxbridge,</hi> and used these Words;
<hi>Here is the Blood of that Proud Prelate,
I hope for more of their Bloods e're long.</hi>
And this doth against my will lead
me to the consideration of his Sermon
at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> at the time of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Amongst many Scandals cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King, he herein compares Him
to <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth of <hi>France,</hi> who
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98410:132"/>

and, <hi>after the League made with
him he shall work deceitfully:</hi> After
these great Complements toward the
King, he tells us in his Preface;
<hi>'Tis the Sword, not Disputes</hi> or
<hi>Treaties which must end this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
wherefore turn your Plowshares
into Swords, and your Pruning-hooks
into Spears to fight the Lords's Battles,
to avenge the Blood of the Saints which
hath been spilt, it must be avenged either
by us, or upon us: Let me but quote the
Words of the Prophet</hi> Jeremiah, Chap.
48. vers. 10. <hi>Cursed be he that doth the
Work of the Lord negligently: Cursed
be he that keepeth his Sword from Blood,
&amp;c.</hi> And I will be bold to say this,
that the most malicious suggestions
which are insisted upon in the Votes
of Non-Address are to be met with
in one Page of that Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 32.
We read <hi>'Twas the Lord who troubled</hi>
Achan, <hi>because he troubled</hi> Israel. <hi>O that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98410:133"/>
in this our State-Physicians would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble

Land who have distempered it. Meli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>He tells us,</hi> pag. 36, 37, <hi>of three
sorts of Persons, with whom Peace is
not to be made: First, Truce-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi>
O what deceitful Work hath our
Parliament met with on the very nick of
Treaties for Peace, &amp;c. Secondly, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
are not meet Persons to have a
Peace with, <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> was checked for
having an Affinity with <hi>Ahab</hi> an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
King, because he loved him that
hated the Lord, therefore wrath was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him from the Lord: But <hi>Asa</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as
commended because he removed <hi>Maa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chah</hi>
from being Queen, because she was
an Idolatress: I may say, what <hi>Jehu</hi> said
to <hi>Joram,</hi> what Peace can there be so
long as the Whoredoms of <hi>Jezebel</hi> THE
QUEEN are so many, we may make
Peace with Papists now, but who will
give us assurance that they will keep
their Covenants: Thirdly, men wholly
under the guilt of much Innocent blood
are not meet Persons to be at peace with,
till all the guilt of blood be expiated
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98410:133"/>
and avenged, either by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Sword of the
Law, or the Law of the Sword, else a
Peace can neither be safe nor just, and
<hi>pag.</hi> 42. Are Peace and Truth the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
which must heal us? O then dote
not too much upon this Treaty of Peace,
which is this day beginning: <hi>And again,</hi>
Will the Blood-thirsty Rebels of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
the Idolatrous Papists of <hi>England,</hi> the
Pompous Prelats, the rest of the corrupt
Clergy, and the profaner sort of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who joyn hand in hand together:
Are these likely to be Patrons of Truth?
Deceive not your selves, there is little
likelihood of Peace with such: What I
said before, I say again, Either they must
grow better, or we must wax worse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we can agree.</p>
            <p>I should willingly have suffered
these Things to sleep, but that our
Author forced me upon it, by insisting
upon the Merits of Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Love</hi> himself in his Speech upon the
Scaffold justifies himself as to all that
he had done in relation to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Differences; <hi>I bless my God, I am
free from the Blood of all men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I
do declare that I dy with my Iudgment

name and thing, I still retain AS VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HEMENT
A DETESTATION of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Interest AS EVER I DID:</hi>
And again, <hi>I dy cleaving to all those
Oaths, Vows, Covenants, Protestations,
that were imposed by the Two Houses of
Parliament, as owning them, and in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Protestation, the Vow and Covenant, the
Solemn League and Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Author cannot deserve any
way so well of the Party he pleads
for, as not to give us occasion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into past Matters: For whatever
Inconveniencies may be expected
from Comprehension or Toleration,
by the nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they will be found to be very
much ascertained and increased, if we
consider the Persons who do desire
either of them: I suppose we shall
hear no more of the Merits of <hi>Love,</hi>
and if this Gentleman doth think fit
to change him for any other Instance:
I shall advise that he would pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such a Person as hath wrote no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor been in any Publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98410:134"/>
lest otherwise he should
force us upon those Enquiries which
will be, it is to be doubted little for
the credit of him whose name is
brought in Question, and which I shall
take very little delight in.</p>
