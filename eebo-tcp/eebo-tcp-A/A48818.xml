            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER:</head>
            <p>HAVING had the honor to preach before their Majesties on the fift day of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> last, and afterward to be commanded by Them to print my Sermon, which contain'd many things concerning the late Revolution; I humbly crav'd leave to put my thoughts into another form; wherein I might, not only say those things more at large, but also prove what I had said in that Sermon; knowing I could do it by such Authorities as would be sufficient to clear me from that charge of Singularity or Novelty which hath been too liberally thrown upon others that have preach'd or written on that subject.</p>
            <p>I know I am not better then my Brethren that have been thus us'd, and therefore I expect to be treated no better then they have been. But I think I have taken a Course to prevent the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any charge against me on that head. It will appear that I have deliver'd no other Doctrin then that which has been receiv'd and past for current in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ever since the Reformation. And I hope it will be some ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb facs="tcp:61879:4"/>
to that excellent Church, to shew that what some have reported of her Doctrins, hath had no other ground, but the mistakes of some of her Sons; who, tho excellent men, and such as our Church may justly glory of upon other accounts, yet I must needs say have judg'd too hastily of this matter; and seem to be too jealous of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for fear some wordly consideration should strike in with those second thoughts that would make them judge otherwise.</p>
            <p>We are not to answer for the private Opinions of all that are or have been of our Communion. But, God be prais'd, we may safely stand by the Doctrins of our Church, and the most approv'd Writers thereof. They are those that I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to set forth in this following Discourse. While we adhere to them, it will be for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of our Church; that as it hath been always accounted the Bulwark of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and prov'd it self to be so most eminently in the last Reign; so it will appear to be the only unshaken strength of this Monarchy; especially by the encouragment it hath now under their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Government, which I beseech God long to continue, to his Glory, and the peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of these Kingdoms.</p>

               <bibl>Psalm LXXV. <hi>verses</hi> 6, 7.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>For Promotion cometh neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South.</p>
                  <p>But God is the Judge; He putteth down one, and setteth up another.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>§. 1. THIS Psalm was compos'd <note place="margin">The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this Psalm.</note> by <hi>David</hi> (as I take it,) considering the State of Affairs that was immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after <hi>Saul</hi>'s death: <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. LXXV. 3.</note> When (as it is here, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.) <hi>the Land, and the Inhabiters thereof
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61879:6"/>
were dissolv'd,</hi> and even ready to fall; but that <hi>David</hi> bore up the <hi>Pillars</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>§. 2. Then, being in the nearest prospect <note place="margin">The scope of these words</note> of the Kingdom, he called to remembrance what he had formerly said, what warnings he had given, to those Fools and wicked men, that laid about them in <hi>Saul</hi>'s time, as if there would be no end of it. <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. LXXV. 45.</note> 
               <hi>I said to the fools, deal not so foolishly; and to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lift not up your horn.</hi> Do not bear your selves so high, as it seems they did on that unhappy King's Favor. Do not <hi>boast</hi> your selves of the power you have <hi>to do</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. LII. 1.</note> 
               <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;</hi> That's the common use of Power, when it comes in the hands of <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 3. To teach them better, <hi>David</hi> shews <note place="margin">I. That all Power is from God.</note> whence it is that Power comes into Mens hands; and upon what terms they are to hold it. These two things the Psalmist shews in the words of this Text.</p>
            <p>First, for the true Original of Power.</p>
            <p>This in <hi>David</hi>'s time all men took to be from Heaven, but from whom there, many knew not. The Eastern Nations, who were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61879:6"/>
generally given to Astrology, took it to come from their Stars; and especially from the Sun, which was the chief Object of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. The Psalmist tells them, No. <hi>Promotion cometh not</hi> that way: Neither from the Planet's rising, nor setting, nor from its exaltation in mid-Heaven. That's the meaning of the words, <hi>from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the North of the Zodiac, or from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>But the Psalmist might have another Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to himself, why he did not think fit to say, it comes not from the North. For there (as he saith <note n="b" place="margin">Psal.

There in <hi>David</hi>'s time was the Tabernacle, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there was the Temple, in which the Mercy-seat between the Cherubims was the place of the Symbolical Presence of God.

                  <hi>(b)</hi> Psal. LXXXII. 1.</note> Could <hi>David</hi> say <hi>Promotion</hi> comes not from thence? No, he saith the contrary in the following, words; <hi>for God is the Judge:</hi> plainly shewing, that to him Kings owe their Authority. But</p>

            </p>
            <p>This is the plain meaning of the Psalmist's words; which will be of great use in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing discourse. Now for the matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in it.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>David,</hi> as being a Prophet inspir'd, best knew the mind of God, and his ways of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Mankind.

His word therefore is on all accounts a sufficient proof.</p>
            <p>But that what he says may be the better understood, I shall shew, First in General, and then in Sundry particulars, that 'tis the Prerogative of God, by which He acts, both in the disposing, and also in the transferring of Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I shall shew that the work of God in bringing His Majesty into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; was truly God's making use of the latter branch of his Prerogative, in <hi>putting down one, and setting up another.</hi>

            <p>§. 6. First, for the Original of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note place="margin">Of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Of this the less needs to be said, because it is so plainly declar'd, and so often repeated in Scripture. It is declar'd of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general, that it is the <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. XIII. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ordinance of God;</hi> that is, it is a thing of Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. It is not only permitted by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but it is appointed by his Will, that there should be a Government among Men. It is the way he hath provided for the good of human Society. And therefore whosoever is against it, he is an Enemy to human Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</p>
            <p>But because all Mankind cannot be under any one Government, no more than they can all be one People, or one Nation; therefore the Apostle goes farther, to apply this to the

               </note> This <hi>Theocracy,</hi> as we call it, continu'd from their coming up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> till such time as God, at his Peoples desire, gave them <note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. Viii. 5.</note> 
               <hi>a King to judge them like all the Nations.</hi> How was that? In most Nations we read of at that time, and perhaps in some from the Confusion of Tongues, it was the Peoples part to chuse who should rule over them: And that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61879:10"/>
either upon every Vacancy, as in Elective Kingdoms; or at the first, once for all, as in those that were Hereditary. God was pleas'd so far to grant his Peoples Request, that they should be an Hereditary Kingdom: But for the first King of the reigning Line, God would have the chusing of him himself. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, first he chose <hi>Saul,</hi> whose <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. Xiii. 13.</note> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should have been Hereditary, if he had not hindred it by his Disobedience to God. Then God made choice of <hi>David,</hi> a Man <note n="b" place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> 
               <hi>after his own heart;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> having many Sons, among them all God <note n="c" place="margin">1 Chron. Xxviii. 5.</note> chose <hi>Solomon</hi> to continue the Succession in him and his Heirs, as he did till the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity.</p>
            <p>This Account that I have given, runs through half the Age of the World. And so far, I think, it is worth the observing, that there was no other standing Government in that Nation, which God chose to be his peculiar People, but what was administred by single Persons. And those Persons Title to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was either Patriarchical, or by Divine Nomination: Both which ways of coming into Power were so wholly of God, that the People had nothing to do, but to accept the Choice of God, and to submit to it.</p>

§. 11. <note n="II" place="margin">Mediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the People.</note> In other Nations indeed, that did not keep up the Patriarchical Right, there the Peoples Consent was required, except in the Case of Conquest before-mention'd. And this Consent being merely an human Act, it may seem that the Authority it gives, is not, as we are here taught, from God only.</p>
            <p>But to set this Matter right, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <note place="margin">And that,</note> by what Motives it is, that the People are generally led, to chuse any one to rule over them.

Thus es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on Founders of Nations.</note> The first Choise of Kings I conceive to have been made on account of Merit, the People being led to it by a sense of the Benefits they had receiv'd. I judge so from that which having been already shewn I take now for granted, that the Earth was peopl'd at first by great Families. Now when those, by Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of powerful Neighbors, or by Civil Discord among themselves, came to be in great Distress, such as made them see the Necessity of being united in greater Bodies for their own Preservation; those Heroic Men, that shew'd
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61879:11"/>
them the way of it, and that brought them under Government and Laws, these were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the FOUNDERS of the Nations. Such was <hi>Moses</hi> among the People of <hi>Israel.</hi> When he had brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they own'd this as a Title to Government, that he would have had, <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. Xxxii. 1.</note> even without Divine Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such was <hi>Cecrops</hi> among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other first Kings in other Nations; who were so sensible of the Benefits that they receiv'd by them, that they not only believ'd them sent from God, but they made them Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and worship'd them, as the Tutelar Deities of their Nations.</p>
            <p>§. 13. Next to these, and something like <note place="margin">On first Planters.</note> them, were the first Planters of Colonies: Such as <hi>Cadmus</hi> was at <hi>Thebes, AEneas</hi> in <hi>Latium,</hi> and the like. In <hi>England</hi> such were <hi>Hengist,</hi> and the rest that began the Seven Kingdoms of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon</hi> Heptarchy. From one of these, namely, from <hi>Cerdic</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> the Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of our Royal Family is unquestionable.</p>
            <p>§. 14. But the most like to Founders are they whom God raises up to be the Restorers <note place="margin">On Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers.</note> and Deliverers of a People, when they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61879:11"/>
brought low by Tyranny and Oppression, or when they are torn in pieces by Factions among themselves. Thus when the <hi>Jews</hi> were oppress'd by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who had Right indeed to a Tribute from that People, but not content with that, would usurp an absolute Dominion over them; <hi>Mattathias</hi> and his Sons stood up for their Religion and Liberty; and by asserting both, they so won the People to themselves, that with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <note n="a" place="margin">1 Macc. Xiv. 41, 49.</note> the Government was establisht in that Family. And thus when the <hi>Roman</hi> State, being torn by a long Civil War had even bled it self to death, (it had certainly expir'd, if it had been left to it self,) <hi>Augustus</hi> came in, and not only bound up the Wounds, but put, as it were, a new Soul into the Body; He made it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live, but flourish, by his great Care and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Industry; which so oblig'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they even forc'd him to accept of the Empire. These were such Benefits to Mankind, as whosoever was enabl'd to do, it was as if God had put a Glory about his Head; it so markt him out to the People, that they could not go beside him in their Choise; they took him as one already chosen of God.</p>

§. 15. <note n="II" place="margin">On ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor.</note> Where Kings have been chosen on account of less Benefits, there have been grains of Favor thrown in to make up weight. Favor is a Motive, (as I have shewn,) which works as well singly, as when it is join'd with any other Consideration. For it is grounded, not so much upon real Worth, as upon the Opinion they have conceiv'd of any Person. It is Opinion that governs the unthinking sort of Men, which are far the greatest part of the Body of a Nation. And when all these go together, they are like the Atoms of Air, which though taken apart they are too light to be felt, yet being gather'd into a Wind, they are too strong to be withstood. But he that <hi>brings the Winds out of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> he also governs these, and turns them which way he pleases.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61879:12"/>
Nations; and since we are sure the <hi>Psalmist's</hi> words are as true of these, as of any that we read of in Scripture; therefore I conclude, that in these also <hi>Promotion</hi> came from God, by those ways <note n="a" place="margin">King <hi>James</hi>'s Works, <hi>pag.</hi> 612. What God did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly by his Word and Oracle among his own People in the Election of Kings, he did it only by his secret working in the Hearts of other Nations, though themselves knew not whence those Motions came which God by his Finger writ in their Hearts.</note> which his Providence us'd in setting up the first Kings in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

These Kings are indeed so much more the Creatures of God, as they owe less to Men than any others; except only those that came in by Patriarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Right, or by Divine Nomination. There was the Act of Man in that general Consent by which their Ancestors came first into the Government. And by this Consent the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being made Hereditary, there was no need of any other Human Act for the Continuance of it in their Family. There is

And the same way the Providence of God brings in others to succeed them in their Power from time to time.</p>
            <p>It has been prov'd in all sorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that as the Sovereign Power in every Country or Nation is of God, so they that are invested with it, whether one or many, are in the place of God, and have their <hi>Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from him: which was the first Part of the Doctrin of this Text.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 25. For the first of these, that the transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">That this is the Act of God.</note> of power from one to another is the Act God, this adds much to that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Text. It shews that God has such an Interest in the disposing of power, as none can pretend to but himself.</p>
            <p>Men have their part in setting up what they cannot put down again. It is a Woman's Consent makes a Man be her Husband, the Fellows of a Colledge chuse one to be their Head, a Corporation chuse one to be their Mayor: All these do only chuse the person, they do not give him the Authority. It is the Law that gives that, and that Law so binds their hands that they cannot undo what they have done.</p>
            <p>No more can a Nation <hi>(a)</hi> undo its own Act, in chusing Men into Sovereign power. I do not say but they may chuse Men into Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, expresly with that Condition, that they shall be accountable to the people; and then the Government remains in the Body of the Nation, it is that which we properly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61879:14"/>
call a Commonwealth. But for Sovereign Princes and Kings, even where they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the Nation; and much more in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Kingdoms; as they have their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God, so they are only <note n="a" place="margin">This is Protestant Doctrin. See <hi>Sanderson</hi> de Oblig. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient. Vii. 20. <hi>Grot.</hi> de Jure B. &amp; P. l. 3. 8: <hi>Pufendorf.</hi> de Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. Vii. 6. 1. Popish Writers, as <hi>Bellarmin, Becan,</hi> &amp;c. teach otherwise. <hi>Suarez</hi> de Legibus III. 4. 6 mentioning that Doctrin, that a People may depose their King, saith it is <hi>altogether false;</hi> but corrects this afterward, saying, <hi>nisi fortasse in Tyrannidem declinet,</hi> unless he happen to become a Tyrant; of which this Jesuit allows the People to be Judge. He might as well have agreed with his Fellows.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to him. For he is <hi>the only Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords.</hi> He alone both makes Kings by his Sovereign Power, and by the same he can unmake them when he pleases.</p>
            <p>Nay more than so, <hi>He puts down one, and sets up another.</hi> Both the Words imply some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an High Place, and here they are used of Civil Government or Dominion. Of this it is said, that God so deprives one of it, as that he advances another in his stead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 26. This can be understood of nothing else <note place="margin">By giving one a Conquest over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> but the Conquest of one Prince over another. For what one resigns by a Voluntary Act, he is said to lay down, or to give it up to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But <hi>putting down</hi> is the Act of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61879:15"/>
by which one's place is taken from him against his Will. Now God being the Superior that does this by the Act of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, it must be such an Act as gives the Power from <hi>one</hi> against his Will, to <hi>another</hi> whom God is pleased to set up in his stead. Thus in giving <hi>one</hi> Prince a Conquest over <hi>another,</hi> he thereby puts one in Possession of the other's Dominions, he makes the other's Subjects become his Subjects, or his Slaves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as they come in upon Conditions, or at the Will of the Conqueror. In short, he giveth him the whole Right and Power of the other Prince.</p>
            <p>But how can this be? For, if the other had a Right to his Kingdom, it cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him without Injury: and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ordinarily be without a War, and all the Evils contained in it; which are so much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity and Impiety together, that whose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has a true Notion of God, cannot think he would approve of things so contrary to his Justice and Goodness; much less that he would be the Author of them, as he must be according to this Doctrin.</p>

               <hi>S.</hi> 27. Thus some may object. But in Answer <note place="margin">God gives a Conquest Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially.</note> to this, Consider how we judge of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Kings, when they take away the Lives and Estates of Offenders. To do the same things would be Murder and Robbery in private Men. But we know they are Acts of Judgment in them that have the power of the Sword; and they would not be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their Trust if they did not do them. In this Text we are taught to think so of God, that when <hi>he puts down one, and sets up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi> he doth it as a <hi>Judge,</hi> even <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. Lxxxii. I.</note> 
               <hi>Judge among Gods.</hi> He deals with them, as they ought to do with their Subjects. Think of that, and you will not stick at this Objection.</p>
            <p>As a <hi>Judge,</hi> he administreth <hi>Judgment and Justice</hi> both which are said to be <hi>the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Throne.</hi> Particularly, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees a Conquest of any King or Kingdom; it is either as a <hi>Judgment</hi> on them for Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against himself, or it is by way of <hi>Justice</hi> to others whom they have injured. And both these ways he does what is best, for the glory of God, and the good of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 28. First by way of <hi>Judgment,</hi> or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">I. By way of Judgment.</note> for the Sins of a <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> or

both; God ordinarily suffers a Rebellion to arise within the Kingdom, or a Foreign power to break in upon it. And though these Rebels, or this Foreign power, may be such as have receiv'd no provocation, nor mind nothing else but Dominion and Prey: yet God makes use of them in this Case, as he doth of an Inundation at other times; He lets them loose, to over-run, and waste, and spoil the Country; to overthrow the Government, and to make themselves Lords of it; and therein to execute God's Judgment on that wicked Prince or Nation.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Saul</hi>'s Case, on which <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. Lxxv. 8.</note> this <hi>Psalm</hi> seems to have been made. He had driven out <hi>David,</hi> the Terror of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines;</hi> and put the Priests to death for relieving him: for which Injustice and Cruelty, together with his other Sins, God brought in the <hi>Philistines</hi> upon him, and made him feel the want of those brave Men that he had driven away; for in the day of Battel he had none to stand by him, and so he lost both his Kingdom and his Life.</p>

               </note>

Though no Christian ought to allow any Rebellion of People against their Prince, yet doth God never leave Kings unpunisht when they transgress these Limits.</note> And though they are not therefore to be deposed by the people, yet they cannot escape the vengeance of God, who ordinarily punishes them with the natural effects of their Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 30. Thus in the Case of not execution of <note place="margin">For Neglect of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Laws, especially those that are a check upon Irreligion and Immorality, the very neglect of the due administration of Justice, though
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61879:17"/>
it seems to be nothing at present, yet in time it will destroy the Government. It bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the people into a Contempt of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they are not much to be blamed for it, for what are they the better for such a Government? It lets them loose to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Sins, many of which are destructive to Society, and all expose them to the wrath of God. Both these ways they are disposed for Rebellion at home; and so enfeebled withal, that they cannot withstand a Foreign Enemy. In this corrupt and weak Estate of a Government, it is almost impossible that there should not be an Alteration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 31. On the other hand, if a Prince will have <note place="margin">For oppressing the People.</note> no Law but his Will, if he tramples and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth his people, their patience will not hold out always, they will at one time or other shew themselves to be but Men. At least they will have no heart to fight for their Oppressor. So that if a Foreign Enemy breaks in upon him, he is gone without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, unless God interpose. But how can that be, when <hi>God is Judge</hi> himself? Should the Judge hinder the doing of Justice? It is God's Work that Foreigner comes to do,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61879:17"/>
               <hi>Howbeit he</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Esay X. 7.</note> 
               <hi>meaneth not so.</hi> He means nothing perhaps, but the satisfying of his own Lust. But though he knoweth it not, he is sent in God's Message: for which all things being prepared by natural Causes, and God not hindering his own Work, but rather hastening it, no wonder that it succeeds, and that oftentimes very easily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 32. If there seems in all this to be any <note place="margin">This is Just and Necessary.</note> hard measure put upon Kings, it ought to be consider'd how much harder it would be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People, if it were otherwise. When it happens (as it doth sometimes, and that especially for the Sins of a Nation,) that they come to be under weak or wicked Kings; even these they must not <hi>resist,</hi> God hath <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. Xiii. 2.</note> taught them otherwise. What then? Must they be left to the Wills of these Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants? Or of them that govern weak Kings, which is commonly worse? Must they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all the load of Oppression that these will lay upon them? that is, for a few Mens pleasure must a Nation be made miserable? This is far from God's design in the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government. He makes Kings his

               <hi>for the good</hi> of their People. If any will take that Office upon them, they must behave themselves accordingly. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if they take it as given them only for themselves, it is such a breach of Trust, that God cannot but punish them for it. But how should he do this, so as that the punishment may have its effect, in warning others not to transgress in like manner? He cannot do this better, than by making Men his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it. And therefore it is that God, though he has infinite ways, yet commonly chuses to employ Men in this Service. He either finds them at home, that are <hi>not afraid</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. XIII. 3.</note>

The Prince called a Council upon it, where some of his Friends advised him to forbear: telling him the great Evils that this King had done; and adding this in the Conclusion, <hi>All that he hath now to suffer, is but the Rod of God, sent to chastise him, and to give Example to other Christian Kings and Princes of the Earth that they may not do like him.</hi> Froissart Hist. l. 231.</note>

And when he seeth his time, that is, when he finds the Cause ripe for Judgment, if it proceeds so far, then he gives Sentence for him that is injur'd, against him that hath done the Injury. The effect of this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is a just Conquest; and that is the other way in which God, proceeding Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>puts down one, and sets up another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this may be the better understood, there are four things to be consider'd parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61879:19"/>
First, That War is an Appeal to the Justice of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That none can be Parties to this, but they that are in Sovereign Power.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That to make it a just War, there must be a just and sufficient Cause.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That Conquest in such a War is a decisive Judgment of God, and gives <hi>one</hi> a Right to the Dominions that he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd from the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 34. <note n="1" place="margin">War is an Appeal to God.</note> That War is an Appeal to God, this appears in the nature of the thing. For it is the Act of two Parties that differ about their Right. And they put it upon such an issue as none but God can give. For both agree in effect, that the Right shall be adjudg'd to him that has the Victory. And it is God alone that is the Giver of <note n="a" place="margin">1 Chron. Xxix. 11.</note> Victory.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Judgment of God has been solemnly appeal'd to by Nations when they were engaging in War. We see a notable Instance of this in the History of <hi>Jephtha.</hi> When his Country was invaded by the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> he stood up to defend it, with this express Declaration to their King: <hi>I have not sinned against thee;</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Judg. XI. 27.</note> 
               <hi>But thou dost me wrong

to war against me, The Lord the Judge, be Judge this day between the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>and the Children of</hi> Ammon. The like Declarations are frequent in the ancient <hi>Roman History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 35. <note n="2" place="margin">It is proper to Kings.</note> The Parties to this Appeal, are properly such as have no Superior but God. For them that have an earthly Superior, their Appeal lies to him as <hi>God's Minister</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. Xiii. 6.</note> 
               <hi>attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually on this very thing.</hi> So that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects know whither to go on all occasions, whether for the asserting of their Rights, or reparation of Injuries. Their proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is to <hi>the</hi> KING <hi>as Supreme,</hi> or to <hi>those</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Pet. II. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>that are Commissioned by him:</hi> and these are to judge their Cause according to the LAW of the Land, which is the common Standard of Justice among private Men.</p>
            <p>It has been the manner indeed, (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is so still in some Nations,) that where Princes find a Cause too hard for them to decide, they give the Parties leave to end it in a Duel between themselves. But this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Appeal to God, is most strictly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Subjects in all well-order'd Kingdoms. And this very Usage shews that they have no Right to it otherwise, but only by their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces permission.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61879:20"/>
For Sovereign Princes, their Rights and their Injuries are inseparably join'd with those of their Kingdoms and Nations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot pass by Injuries, as private Men may, for Peace sake: they must insist on those Rights with which God has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted them for others more than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: it is not only their Interest, but their Duty so to do.</p>
            <p>But all Princes being equally concern'd in this matter, what if a Question should arise between any two of them? or what if one should invade the unquestionable Rights of the other? There is no ending the difference between them in the way of private Men: for they have no earthly Superior to flie to: they have nothing to do with one another's Laws: there is no adjusting of their Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Costs. Private Justice hath Scales to weigh out these things, <note n="a" place="margin">Bishop <hi>Bramhall's</hi> Works, p. 834. Private Right, and private Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men. Publick Right, and publick Justice is between Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, as in a Foreign War.</note> but publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice has none. Therefore Princes must have some other way to come by their Rights, or else they are in much worse Case than private Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61879:20"/>
But what Way should that be, by which Princes can be oblig'd against their Wills to do Right to one another? It must be by such a LAW as they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to, and by such a JUDGE as is their common Superior. Such a Law is that which we call the Law of Nations; <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendorf.</hi> de Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. II. 3. 21. <hi>Hooker</hi> Eccles. Pol. I. Saith of the Law of Nations, that it can be no more prejudiced by the Laws of any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than these can be by the Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men.</note> being made up of such Customs as are observ'd among Princes, as our Common Law is made up of those that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in this Kingdom. And for that common Superior, it is God alone, who styles himself the <hi>King of Kings</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords.</hi> But as by the Law of Nations, the Way that Princes have for the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those differences among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves which cannot be ended otherwise, is <note n="c" place="margin">See <hi>Grot.</hi> de Jure Belli &amp; Pacis i. 2. 1. ad 5.</note> by War. So this (as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shewn) is an Appeal to God; it is the Way that Princes have to sue one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in his Court.</p>
            <p>And he has therefore given them the Power of the <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> Xiii. 3, 4.</note> Sword; that they may use it, not only in Judging their own
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61879:21"/>
People, but in going to Law with other Princes.</p>
            <p>This confirms that which has been said already, that Subjects have no Right to make War, without the leave of their Princes. For as God has given Princes the Power of the Sword, so he forbids it to Subjects, under a great Penalty, <hi>They</hi>

                  <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvi. 52.</note> 
               <hi>that take the Sword shall perish with the Sword.</hi> And if he has not admitted them to be Parties in his Court, then it is certain that they cannot sue there; or if they do, they can acquire no Right by it. There is an Original Nullity in all their Proceedings. <note place="margin">

make what use of it they please: Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, they must not make War for the satisfying of their Lusts, Ambition, Covetousness, Vain-glory, or the like. He that troubles an earthly Court of Justice upon any litigious or trifling Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ought to be condemned in good Costs. But if it appear he comes thither to defraud or to oppress, and that with a Colour of Justice, he must look for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Severity. How much more ought Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to dread the just Judgment of God, if they presume to Appeal to him for no Cause, or for such as he hates and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors? Nay the righteous God will not hold him guiltless that hath Justice in his Cause, and yet in his Heart hath no such thing. Lawful things must be done lawfully. This Princes must look to, as they will answer it to God.</p>

For no Man hath right to do another the smallest Injury, any more than he hath to do him the greatest. And Princes <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Justini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Instit. l. 2.</note> have no other way than by War to right themselves for the least Injury. But if they are so tame to pass by the smallest Injuries, it will tempt ill-minded Men to go on, and to do greater. These and many other things may be said, to make it seem reasonable that Princes should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon the rigor of Justice.</p>
            <p>But after all this, we must remember we are Christians; and Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us other measures of Justice, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which even Princes ought to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themselves. He hath taught us to soften the rigor of Justice, with a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of Goodness and Equity: And therefore not to run to Extremes, for the righting of any small, any tolerable Injury.</p>

            <p>§ 38. Yet it may be a Question, whether <note place="margin">Q. when Religion suffers in another Kingdom.</note> such Tyrannies being used on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion, give a just Cause of War to other Princes of the same Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. I speak now of Persecution in such Countries where their Religion is not established by Law.</p>
            <p>It is certainly true which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle says, <hi>We are all Members of one and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. Xii. 25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>the same Body; and it is the duty of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to have the same Care of one another; and whether one Member suffer, all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers suffer with it; or one Member be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, all the Members rejoyce with it.</hi> It is true that Christian Princes especially, as they have the charge of that part of Christ's Body that is in their own
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61879:25"/>
Dominions, so they ought to extend their Care and Compassion to their Fellow-Members elsewhere. But whether they ought to concern themselves for them so far as to make War on their account against their Kings by whom they are persecuted, nay whether they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do this, is a doubt that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve some farther Consideration.</p>
            <p>The Christian Emperors seem to have made no doubt of this. For they made War, sometimes for no other Cause but that of Religion, against such Kings as persecuted the Christians in Their own Dominions: Sometimes, when they had other Causes of War, they preferr'd this before all the rest; which certainly they would not have done, if it had not weighed much in their <note place="margin">

to shew their Opinion of this Cause.

We have a notable Instance of this in Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> who was one of the moderatest Papists of his age, and yet writ a Book, wherein he prest it most earnestly upon the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. as his Duty, to give over his War with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and to turn his Arms against King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. for oppressing the Catholicks in his Dominions.

in the destroying of that Religion at home in their own Kingdoms, the same blind Zeal, acted by the same Principles, would bring them hither at last for the finishing of their Work, or as some have worded it since, for <hi>the rooting out of the Northern Heresie.</hi> This was such a danger that if she had suffer'd it to grow upon her, it had been a betraying of her Trust, which she could not have answer'd to God. And yet, there being no way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it but by making War upon them in their own Kingdoms, this ought to be accounted a Defensive War, and that made upon very just Cause, as hath been <note n="a" place="margin">§ 36.</note> already shewn.</p>
            <p>We have Reason to hope that all Popish Princes are not under the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of those Principles. But yet, when any of them persecutes his Subjects that are of another Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the standing Laws of his Kingdom, they cannot expect that other Princes, which are of that Suffering Religion, can be so confident of this, as to stand idle and look on, and not rather
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61879:29"/>
when they see the danger comes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, to defend themselves from it, if they can, by beginning a War in that Prince's Dominions.</p>
            <p>§ 40. There is yet a greater Cause for this, <note place="margin">Especially where it is the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on setled by Law.</note> when the Suffering Religion is that which is establisht by the Laws of that Kingdom; and yet the King that is sworn to those Laws, and therefore bound to support that Religion, is manifestly practising against it, and endeavours to supplant and oppress and extinguish it. What should other Princes or States that profess the same Religion do in this Case? They see that such a King is set upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of their Religion. He hath declar'd a hostile mind towards the Professors of it, in judging them not capable of enjoying their Temporal Rights. If he deals thus with his own People, what are Forreigners to expect at his hands? Can they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves secure because they are at Peace with him? They cannot, unless Treaties are more Sacred then Laws. Or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61879:30"/>
can they rely upon his Oath? But they see he hath broken it. And therefore they have reason to Judge, that either he makes no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of an Oath, or he thinks Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, or he hath a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior that can dispense with him, or that will absolve him from the guilt of Perjury in such Cases where Religion is concern'd. In short, they are sure of his Will to destroy them, and cannot be sure of his Oath to the contrary. Wherein then can they be safe? But in his Want of Power to do them hurt? But he will not want Power, if they let him go on, for he is getting it as fast as he can. He is now strengthning himself by those ways that he takes to be absolute Lord of his own People: And he is now weakning Them, by oppressing all those among his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom he knows to be their Friends and Well-wishers. He doth both these things together: He daily lessens their Party, and makes them as many more Enemies, as he gains Men over to his Religion. And if that be such a Religion as pretends to a Right of destroying Men of other Religions; knowing this, they know what they are to expect.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61879:30"/>
When this pretended Right is armed with Power, it will certainly fall upon them. So that they must begin before he is ready for them, or else it will be too late to do any thing for their own Preservation.</p>
            <p>But as it is necessary for them to do this for themselves, so they ought to do it much the rather for the Sakes of their oppressed Brethren: That, by a timely asserting of their own Right, they may also deliver them from the Evils they suffer at present, and save them from that Destruction which is coming upon them. As it was Just and Necessary on those former Accounts, so this makes it a Pious Cause, and therefore the more Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a true Christian Prince.

and especially at the time of the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. In these times we find that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> having shar'd the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire between them, had pass'd a Decree together at <hi>Milan,</hi> for Christianity to be the establish'd Religion: And when afterward <hi>Licinius,</hi> in his part of the Empire, would have oppress'd it contrary to Law; for that cause <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great made War upon him; and in prosecution of that War, thrust him out of his Empire: For which he was so far from being blamed by any Christian in those times, even by those that had been <hi>Licinius</hi>'s Subjects, as most of those Bishops were that sate in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, that they all gave him the highest Praises and Encomiums, and Blessed God that had sent them that happy Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance by his means. <hi>Eusebius</hi> was <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s Subject, and he afterwards writ the Life of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, in which they that please may read whole Chapters to this purpose. <note place="margin">

§. 41. As that is a Just War which is made <note place="margin">Then it makes a Just Conquest</note> upon Just and sufficient Cause, so the Effect of such a War being a Conquest, is Just, which is the Fourth thing we are to consider.</p>
            <p>Conquest being the way by which a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Dominion is taken from a Sovereign Prince <note n="a" place="margin">See §. 26.</note> against his Will, and by which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince gets it into his Possession; as often as this happens, there arises a Question between the two Princes, whether of them hath a Right to that Kingdom or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>For the deciding of this Question, it must be by such a Law as is common to both the Parties, whose Rights are to be judg'd by it. That cannot be the Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for though the Prince that is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seiz'd
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61879:32"/>
was obliged by that Law while he was in Possession, yet now it seems he is not; and it never was a Law to the Prince that is now in his place. It must therefore be a Superior Law, such as is common to all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes in their Affairs with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that (as hath been <note n="b" place="margin">See §. 35.</note> already shewn) is ordinarily the Law of Nations.</p>
            <p>I say Ordinarily, because there is yet a Superior Law, namely, the Law of God; whether written in our Hearts, which we commonly call the Law of Nature; or whether an express Revelation from God, such as was sometimes given to Men in ancient Times; either of these may derogate from the Law of Nations: For this, being made up of Customs observ'd by Princes and States among themselves, is always subject to the will of him that is Lord of Lords and King of Kings. But whether, or how far, this may alter the case, will be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered afterwards; at present we are only to consider what Judgment can be made of it, according to the Law of Nations.</p>
            <p>§. 42. By this it seems to be plain, that the Right should go along with the compleat Possession: <note place="margin">And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Right.</note>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61879:32"/>
So as that wheresoever this is once settled, whether by length of time, or even sooner by a general Consent of the People, there it ought to be presum'd there is a Right, at least there ought to be no farther Dispute of it. There seems to be the same Reason for this, that there is for the Law of Nations it self; for if that Law was ordain'd for the Peace of Mankind, this quieting of Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session must be a part of it, for there can be no end of Wars otherwise.</p>
            <p>Accordingly we see, in a Dispute between Gods Ancient People the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Nations about them, when they differ'd about a Title to Land, it was agreed, that whatsoever Conquest they had made on either side, they should hold it as being given them by their God. This appears by <hi>Jephtha</hi>'s Speech to the King of <hi>Ammon</hi> that <note place="margin">Judges XI. 24.</note> had <hi>Chemosh</hi> for his God; <hi>Wilt not thou possess that which</hi> Chemosh <hi>thy God giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That's a plain Evidence, so far as it goes. But that is only for part of a Country. But we have as great Proof, that God gives
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61879:33"/>
even Kingdoms in this manner, <hi>Dan.</hi> II. 21. <note place="margin">Dan. II. 21.</note> There <hi>Daniel</hi> having receiv'd a full Account from God, of a Vision which King <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> had seen, and forgot; when he saw what it was, that it contain'd the Fates of Empires that were to grow up successively in the World; he adores the Majesty of God, with an humble Confession of his Prerogative, in these words, <hi>It is He that changes the Times and the Seasons: It is He that removes Kings, and sets up Kings.</hi> Both these ways of Expression signifie one and the same thing. For the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> reckon'd <hi>the Times and the Seasons</hi> by the Years of their Kings Reigns, as we do by the Years of our Kings Reigns at this day. And therefore according to the Change of their Kings, there was also a change of <hi>the Times and the Seasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were the Changes of Four great Empires, which God here considered, not as being the greatest in the World, but as being those to which his People were to be subject. They were subject successively to those Four great Empires, of the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> the <hi>Persians,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Those Four are understood in this

            <p>They shew that it is by way of Conquest that God <hi>puts down one, and sets up another.</hi> For so the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire was put down by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who set up the <hi>Persian</hi> in its stead. The <hi>Persian</hi> Empire was put down in their last King <hi>Darius,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> set up the <hi>Macedon</hi> in its stead, The <hi>Macedon</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was put down in their last King <hi>Perseus,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> was set up in its stead.</p>
            <p>All these Kingdoms were changed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests that they made one upon another. And so it was by those Conquests, that God <hi>removed Kings, and set up Kings.</hi> Which, though we see not yet, that it was any more than by the Permissive Providence of God; yet that was enough to make the People of God become Subjects to those Kings that came in by no other Title.</p>
            <p>I do not say but they would have opposed the making of one of those Conquests, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, because King
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61879:34"/>
               <hi>Darius</hi> was then living. But when they saw they could not Oppose, the Conquest being already made, then Just or Unjust, they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it; and having submitted, they were subject without any more Controversie. <note place="margin">

Therefore also God hath commanded his People to give Obedience to the Kings that came in by Conquest, without any other Title. Nay to such as were capable of no other, for they were <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. XVII. 15.</note> forbidden <hi>to set a Stranger over them, which was not their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And yet they were Subjects to Strangers, such as <hi>Cushan, Eglon,</hi> and <hi>Jabin,</hi> &amp;c. And in <hi>Zedekia</hi>'s time God <note n="b" place="margin">Jer. XXI 8, 9.</note> commanded them upon pain of Death to become the Subjects of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who had made a full Conquest over them, and held their Lawful King <hi>Jeconia</hi> then in Captivity. This is plainly the Doctrine of that <note n="c" place="margin">Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Book. I. 28. &amp;c.</note> Convocation which sate in the beginning of King <hi>James</hi> I. his time; and therefore it cannot but be very Unjust to charge any Man with Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity or Novelty, that goes in the Steps of so many and so great Authors.</p>
            <p>§. 43. Yet it cannot be denied that many others, <note place="margin">Doubted when the Cause is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly unjust</note> and those also Men of great Learning and Judgment, have not gone on so smooth with this Doctrine; they think it gives too much to the Success of a War, without due regard to the Cause on which it was made. But it is the Cause that makes a War either Just
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61879:35"/>
or Unjust: And though the Events of both these may be the same, for either of them may end in a Conquest, by which God <hi>puts down one, and sets up another;</hi> yet whether this be Justly obtained, or Unjustly, it makes a great Difference.</p>
            <p>For whereas the latter happens through the Judgment of God, for the Punishing of a Sinful Prince or Nation, it doth not appear that he that is the Instrument of this, acquires any Right by it; more that those Pirates or Robbers, who are Instrumental likewise, in the Punishing of Inferior Transgressors. And if God gives no Right to him whom he sets up, then it remains still in him whom he has put down: So that he is rightful King still; though he is out of Possession, and the other is but an Usurper that is in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</p>
            <p>In this Case, if the Usurper has no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Right, no Prescription of time, no Consent of the People, but only an unjust Possession; how a Subject ought to behave himself towards him, even this is a <hi>DIFFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CULT</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61879:35"/>
even here, it may be not only Lawful, but a Duty, to obey him that is in Possession; when the Legal King is reduced to that pass, that he can no more do the Office of a King to his People. For (saith he) the Kingdom cannot be without Government, and if the Usurper preserves the Kingdom, a Lover of his Country ought not (as things are) to give any farther cause of trouble by his unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Contumacy. But then put case the Usurper hath Sworn the People to him, and doth the Office of a King, which (it seems) in his Judgment doth not take away the Duty that is owing to that former King; how one can pay his Duty to both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd Legal King, and to such an Usurper. This our Author says is <hi>A MOST DIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICULT SCRUPLE;</hi> and so it seems, both by his, and our most Learned Casuist's <note place="margin">

            <p>But these Difficulties are only in case the Possession is obtained by a War that was certainly unjust; for if the Cause of the War was but doubtful, and a Conquest
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61879:36"/>
follows upon it, there is no place for these Difficulties: Much less where the cause of War was certainly Just, for if a Conquest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon this, it gives a Right, and then there is no Usurpation.</p>

So that if it be suffer'd to run on to a Conquest, this also is Just; and we ought to look upon it as the Execution of a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God, by which, acting as a Judge in the way of Justice, <hi>he puts down one, and sets up another.</hi> And this being follow'd by the <note n="a" place="margin">

is a doubtful Cause of War. If the Effect of such a War be a Conquest, it is evident that the Right of this Conquest ought to be judged of very favourably; for he that hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered is now in Possession. And therefore according to that common Saying, which is most true in this case, He hath Eleven Points of the Law. But beside, if (as it commonly happens) one of the two must be obey'd; either he that is driven out, or he that comes in his stead; the Matter being so doubtful between them; then, as it seems most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that Obedience should be paid to the latter, as having all the Advantage of Law on his side, so it is plainly necessary for the Peace and Tranquility of the Nation, which cannot well be settled otherwise.

The People ought to be satisfied with this.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly judg'd by the Law of Nations, that the Right goes along with the Possession. Of this we see Examples in every Revolution that happens in this or any other Kingdom. When a King is driven out with any colour of Right, the Neighbouring Princes and States make no great Difficulty of applying themselves to him that comes in his stead; wherein though perhaps they too much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their own Interest, yet it cannot be said that what they do is against the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But what should Subjects do in this Case? Of this we have an Example in the People of God, when they pass'd successively under the Yoak of those four great Monarchs that were <note n="b" place="margin">See §. 42.</note> formerly mention'd. It is likely that each of those Kings that got the Power over them, first declar'd the Cause of the War that he made upon their former Lords. In that Case, though they could not judge of the Cause, whether it was Just of Unjust,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61879:38"/>
yet no doubt they did well in adhering to him that was in present Possession. Thus we see they did to <hi>Darius,</hi> till such time as they found themselves in the Power of the Enemy: but then, the same Reason being turn'd on his side, they thought it necessary to preserve themselves and their Country, by yielding to him, who had a Just Cause of War for ought they knew, and so far as they could judge by the Success, it had Gods Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Albericus Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis</hi> de Jure Belli III. f. C. blames <hi>Lucan</hi> for calling <hi>Alexander Orbis Terrarum Praedonem.</hi> For (saith he) <hi>Alexander</hi> declar'd a Just Cause of War; and when he had the Victory, that then he might possess himself of his Enemies Dominions, is <hi>MORE THEN A RECEIVED OPINION; Alexander</hi>'s Reasons are express'd in his Epistle to <hi>Darius,</hi> which is in <hi>Arrian</hi> Exped. <hi>Alex.</hi> II.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To a People that are in such a case, it is no small Comfort, that whatsoever doubt they may have of the Cause of the War, yet there is no doubt at all concerning their Duty. There is nothing more certain than this, that they ought to preserve themselves, if they can do it Lawfully. But it is Lawful for them to forbear Fighting, when they are unsatisfied of the Cause: And if their own Prince is not able to protect them, it is lawful
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61879:38"/>
for them to take protection elsewhere. Therefore, in Case of Invasion for a Cause which is just for ought they know, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to live quietly under the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: nay it is not only Lawful, but their Duty (as hath been <note n="a" place="margin">See § 45.</note> already shewn,) to acquiesce in his Government, when he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to be in Possession.</p>
            <p>§. 47. But when they are certain that a War <note place="margin">But much more with a certain just Cause.</note> is made upon their Prince for just Cause; that is, when they plainly see he hath drawn it upon himself, by making it <note n="b" place="margin">See § 36.</note> not only Lawful, but Necessary for another Prince to invade him for his own Preservation; What are the People to do in this Case? No doubt they ought first to have a care of their Souls, and not to endanger them by being Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of other Men's Sins. They cannot but see, that, by engaging in the War, they abet their own Prince in his injustice; though not in his doing the Injury, yet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing what is done, and in his not giving Reparation. And therefore they are subject to the same Punishment with him. Nay their Condition is worse then his: For he may shift for himself, and leave them and all they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61879:39"/>
have to be a Prey to the Enemy: Who by right of War may do with them and theirs what he pleases. It is therefore certainly their wisest Course to keep themselves free from all Offence, both towards God and towards Man: That having had no part in the Cause of the War, they may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the ill Consequences of it. And this they have reason to expect from a Generous Enemy, that he will not use the Right <note n="a" place="margin">See Grot. de Jure B. &amp; P. III. 13. 4. and 15. 12.</note> of War against them that desire to live peaceably. Much more, if he hath declar'd he would not hurt them that should not resist him, they have Reason to trust a just Prince upon his Declaration. And if he went so far as to declare, that upon their Submission they should enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their own Laws; then, although it should come to a Conquest, they may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably expect to be in no worse condition under the Stranger, then they were under their own Prince: They have his Faith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to them for this.</p>
            <p>But if the Stranger declares he makes War in defence of another King's Subjects, as (we have <note n="b" place="margin">See §. 36.</note> shewn,) he may lawfully do, when he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61879:39"/>
finds himself in danger of suffering by that King's Oppression of his own People; in this Case, they are first to consider, whether it is a meer pretence, or whether there be a reall ground for his Declaration. If they find there is a just and sufficient ground for it, they see in effect, that it is through Them that he is struck at; and therefore the War is not so much His, as their own. It is true according to our <note n="a" place="margin">See §. 25.</note> Doctrine, they are united to their Prince as a Wife to her Husband; so that they can no more right themselves by Arms, then she can sue her Husband while the bond of Mariage conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. Yet as, when her Husband uses her extremely ill, she may complain of him to the Judge, who, if he see's Cause, may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Mariage by his Sentence; and after that she is at liberty to sue him as well as any other Man: So a People may cry to the Lord by Reason of their Oppression, and he <note place="margin">Jud. II. 18. and IV. 3.</note> may raise them up a Deliverer, that shall take the Government into his hands; (a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <note place="margin">Jud. III. 9, 15</note> Prince may lawfully do this, as hath been <note n="b" place="margin">§. 36.</note> already shewn;) and then they are not only free to defend themselves,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61879:40"/>
but are oblig'd to joyn with Him, against their Oppressor.</p>
            <p>For the People's Union with their Prince; though it cannot be dissolv'd but by a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from God; yet by the Prince's own Act it may be so loosend, that it may be next to dissolution. The Laws are the Bond of Union between Prince and People: By these, as the Prince holds his Prerogative, so do the People their just Rights and Liberties. Now suppose a People so Opprest by their Prince, that their Laws being trodden under foot, they are in danger of losing not only their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Rights, but, as much as can be, their Eternal: In this Case, there's no doubt that the Oppressor and the Oppressed become two Parties, being distinguisht by the most diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Interests that can be in the World.</p>
            <p>§. 48. In this Case, if another Prince, having a just Cause of War, is so far Concern'd for <note place="margin">When the Cause is for their Sake, it is to them not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, but a Deliverance.</note> such a People, as to take them into his Care, and to declare that he makes the War for their Deliverance: The Effect of this War, though We may call it a Conquest, because it has Resemblance of it, yet it cannot be properly so in any respect; whether we
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61879:40"/>
consider the Prince on whom it is made, or the People that have their Deliverance by it.</p>
            <p>As to Him, it is properly an <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Law-Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary has this sense of the word <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio; est ejus rei, quam Adversarius legitimo jure acquisierat, per Judicem recuperatio.</hi> In this Sense it seems to have been us'd in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fall of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xentius;</hi> whereof see the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Note.</note> 
               <hi>Eviction</hi> by the just Sentence of God; who thus put's him out of a Trust, that he abus'd to the hurt of them for whose sakes it was given him. And as to the People, it cannot be a Conquest over them, who are so far from having the War made against them, that it was made chiefly for their sakes. If there be any pretence of a Conquest, it is only over them that were their Oppressors. But as for them that were Opprest, it makes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together on their side; So that They are the Conquerors in Effect, for they have the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it: And he that obtain'd this for them hath a much more glorious Title then that of a Conqueror, for he is properly their RESTORER and DELIVERER.</p>
            <p>Thus it has been always judg'd by the People of God, as it were easy to shew in many Instances; but very few may suffice, when there is none to be produc'd on the Contrary.</p>
            <p>For that <note n="b" place="margin">§. 46 47.</note> former Doctrin, We have the Example of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61879:41"/>
Time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. When by his Victory at <hi>Issus,</hi> he had driven <hi>Darius</hi> out of <hi>Syria,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> yielded to him. They had had no part in the War. Even for that Reason, he did not use the Right of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest upon them. He requir'd nothing more at their hands, but that they should pay him the same Duties that they had paid to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and that as many of them as pleas'd should serve him in his Wars: Both which Conditions they accepted, and perform'd, as if they had been his Natural Subjects.</p>
            <p>Much more in that Case of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. When he had taken <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the <hi>Jews</hi> were in a state of Captivity; did he use the Right of Conquest over them? Did he sell them for Slaves, or take away what they had? So far he was from it, that he restor'd them from their Captivity. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving understood from their Prophets, that God had given him those Successes for their sakes; he did not look upon them as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd People, but as them whom God sent Him to deliver: And treated them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, with all Possible kindness and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:61879:41"/>
But there are no Examples more to be observ'd by us <hi>Christians,</hi> then those that happen'd in the Time of <hi>Constantin</hi> the Great; both because he was the first <hi>Christian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and because the first General Council was held in his Reign. Now in those times of the purest Christianity, we find not that in any of those Countries which he had gain'd by the Sword, any <hi>Christian</hi> had the least scruple concerning his Right to the Government: nay they welcom'd him to it with all Demonstrations of Joy. And though he had acquir'd a Title to it by the Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those Princes that had been their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors, and so might have taken it upon him as a Conqueror, which Title he seem'd to <note n="a" place="margin">See §. 42. Note <hi>a.</hi>
               </note> affect upon other Occasions; yet where he had declar'd his Cause of War to be for a Peoples Deliverance, this being so just and so honorable a Title, he us'd it, and would have no other, in all his Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <note place="margin">In memory of his Victory over <hi>Maxentius,</hi> the day on which it happen'd being the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> was styl'd in the <hi>Christian Roman</hi> Calendar <hi>Evictio Tyranni,</hi> what that means See in the former Note.
