            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the most Excellent and most Illustrious
Princess ANNE, Dutchess of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
Countess of Bucclugh, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it please your Grace,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE favour which Heroick Plays have lately
found upon our Theaters has been wholly
deriv'd to them, from the countenance and
approbation they have receiv'd at Court. The
most eminent persons for Wit and Honour in the Royal Circle
having so far own'd them, that they have judg'd no way so
fit as Verse to entertain a Noble Audience, or to express a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
passion. And amongst the rest which have been written
in this kind, they have been so indulgent to this Poem, as to
allow it no inconsiderable place. Since, therefore, to the Court
I owe its fortune on the Stage, so, being now more publickly
expos'd in Print, I humbly recommend it to your Graces Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
who by all knowing persons are esteem'd a Principal
Ornament of the Court. But though the rank which you
hold in the Royal Family, might direct the Eyes of a Poet
to you, yet your beauty and goodness detain and fix them:
High Objects, 'tis true, attract the sight; but it looks up
with pain on Craggy Rocks and Barren Mountains, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
not intent on any object, which is wanting in shades
and greens to entertain it. Beauty, in Courts, is so necessary
to the young, that those who are without it, seem to be there
no other purpose then to wait upon the triumphs of the fair;
to attend their motions in obscurity, as the Moon and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ars
do the Sun by day, or at best to be the refuge of those hearts
<pb facs="tcp:48954:3"/>
which others have despis'd; and, by the unworthiness of
both, to give and take a miserable comfort. But as needful
as beauty is, Virtue, and Honour are yet more: the reign of
it without their support is unsafe and short like that of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.
Every Sun which looks on Beauty wasts it; and,
when once it is decaying, the repairs of Art are of as short
continuance, as the after Spring, when the Sun is going
farther off. This, <hi>Madam,</hi> is its ordinary Fate; but
yours which is accompanied by Virtue, is not subject to that
common destiny. Your Grace has not only a long time of
Youth to flourish in, but you have likewise found the
way by an untainted preservation of your Honour, to make
that perishable good more lasting. And if Beauty like
Wines could be preserv'd, by being mix'd and embodied with
others of their own natures, then your Graces would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
since no part of <hi>Europe</hi> can afford a parallel to your
Noble Lord, in masculine Beauty, and in goodliness of
shape. To receive the blessings and prayers of mankind, you
need only be seen together; we are ready to conclude that
you are a pair of Angels sent below to make Virtue amiable
in your persons, or to sit to Poets when they would pleasantly
instruct the Age, by drawing goodness in the most perfect
and alluring shape of Nature. But though Beauty be the
Theme, on which Poets love to dwell, I must be forc'd to
quit it as a private praise, since you have deserv'd those
which are more publick. For Goodness and Humanity,
which shine in you, are Virtues which concern Mankind,
and by a certain kind of interest all people agree in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
because the profit of them may extend to many.
<pb facs="tcp:48954:3"/>
'Tis so much your inclination to do good that you stay not to
be ask'd; which is an approach so nigh the Deity, that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature is not capable of a nearer. 'Tis my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that I can testifie this Virtue of your Graces by my own
experience; since I have so great an aversion from sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Court Favours, that I am raady to look on those as very
bold, who dare grow rich there without desert. But I beg
your Graces pardon for assuming this Virtue of Modesty to
my self, which the sequel of this discourse will no way justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.
For in this address I have already quitted the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a modest Man, by presenting you this Poem as an
acknowledgment, which stands in need of your protection;
and which ought no more to be esteem'd a Present, then it is
accounted bounty in the Poor, when they bestow a Child on
some wealthy Friend, who will better breed it up. Off-springs
of this Nature are like to be so numerous with me,
that I must be forc'd to send some of them abroad; only this
is like to be more fortunate then his Brothers, because I
have landed him on a Hospitable shore. Vnder your Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
<hi>Montezuma</hi> hopes he is more safe than in his Native
Indies: and therefore comes to throw himself at your Graces
feet; paying that homage to your Beauty, which he refus'd
to the violence of his Conquerours. He begs only that
when he shall relate his sufferings, you will consider him as
an <hi>Indian Prince,</hi> and not expect any other Eloquence from
his simplicity, then what his griefs have furnished him
withal. His story is, perhaps the greatest, which was ever
represented in a Poem of this nature; (the action of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the Discovery and Conquest of a New World.) In
<pb facs="tcp:48954:4"/>
it I have neither wholly follow'd the truth of the History, nor
altogether left it: but have taken all the liberty of a Poet, to
adde, alter, or diminish, as I thought might best conduce to
the beautifying of my work. It being not the business of a
Poet to represent truth, but probability. But I am not to
make the justification of this Poem, which I wholly leave to
your Graces mercy. 'Tis an irregular piece if compar'd with
many of <hi>Corneilles,</hi> and, if I may make a judgement of it,
written with more Flame then Art; in which it represents the
mind and intentions of the Author, who is with much more
Zeal and Integrity, then Design and Artifice,</p>

            <head>Connexion of the Indian Emperour, to the Indian Queen.</head>
            <p>THE Conclusion of the <hi>Indian Queen,</hi> (part of which Poem was writ by
me) left little matter for another Story to be built on, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but two of the considerable Characters alive, <hi>(viz.) Montezuma,</hi>
and <hi>Orazia;</hi> thereupon the Author of this, thought it necessary to produce new
persons from the old ones; and considering the late <hi>Indian Queen,</hi> before she
lov'd <hi>Montezuma,</hi> liv'd in clandestine Marriage with her General <hi>Traxalla;</hi>
from those two, he has rais'd a Son and two Daughters, supposed to be left
young Orphans at their Death: On the other side, he has given to <hi>Montezuma</hi>
and <hi>Orazia,</hi> two Sons and a Daughter; all now supposed to be grown up to Mens
and Womens Estate; and their Mother <hi>Orazia</hi> (for whom there was no further
use in the story) lately dead.</p>
            <p>So that you are to imagine about Twenty years elapsed since the Coronation
of <hi>Montezuma;</hi> who, in the Truth of the History, was a great and glorious
Prince; and in whose time happened the Discovery and Invasion of <hi>Mexico</hi> by
the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Hernando Cortez,</hi> who, joyning with the
<hi>Taxallan-Indians,</hi> the inveterate Enemies of <hi>Montezuma,</hi> wholly Subverted that
flourishing Empire; the Conquest of which, is the Subject of this <hi>Dramatique</hi>
Poem.</p>
            <p>I have neither wholly followed the story nor varied from it; and, as near as
I could, have traced the Native simplicity and ignorance of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to <hi>Europaean</hi> Customes: The Shipping, Armour, Horses, Swords, and
Guns of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being as new to them as their Habits, and their Language.</p>
            <p>The difference of their Religion from ours, I have taken from the Story it
self; and that which you find of it in the first and fifth Acts, touching the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
and constancy of <hi>Montezuma</hi> in his Opinions, I have only illustrated, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

BY A
Mercury.</head>
            <l>TO all and singular in this full meeting,</l>
            <l>Ladies and Gallants, <hi>Phoebus</hi> sends me greeting.</l>
            <l>To all his Sons by what e're Title known,</l>
            <l>Whether of Court, of Coffee-house, or Town;</l>
            <l>From his most mighty Sons, whose confidence</l>
            <l>Is plac'd in lofty sound, and humble sence,</l>
            <l>Ev'n to his little Infants of the Time</l>
            <l>That Write new Songs, and trust in Tune and Rhyme.</l>
            <l>Be't known that <hi>Phoebus</hi> (being daily griev'd</l>
            <l>To see good Plays condemn'd, and bad receiv'd,)</l>
            <l>Ordains your judgement upon every Cause,</l>
            <l>Henceforth be limited by wholesome Laws.</l>
            <l>He first thinks fit no Sonnettier advance</l>
            <l>His censure, farther then the Song or Dance.</l>
            <l>Your Wit Burlesque may one step higher climb,</l>
            <l>And in his sphere may judge all Doggrel Rhyme:</l>
            <l>All proves, and moves, and Loves, and Honours too:</l>
            <l>All that appears high sence, and scarce is low.</l>
            <l>As for the Coffee-wits he says not much,</l>
            <l>Their proper bus'ness is to Damn the Dutch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:48954:40"/>For the great <hi>Dons</hi> of Wit—</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Phoebus</hi> gives them full priviledge alone</l>
            <l>To Damn all others, and cry up their own.</l>
            <l>Last, for the Ladies, 'tis <hi>Apollo</hi>'s will,</l>
            <l>They should have pow'r to save, but not to kill:</l>
            <l>For Love and He long since have thought it fit,</l>
            <l>Wit live by Beauty, Beauty raign by Wit.</l>
