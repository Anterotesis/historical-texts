            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>Nor can wee in the first place, but extoll, applaud, and most highly commend thee our deare Sonne for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62413:3"/>
the extraordinary care in the advancement of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>And as next in place the extraordinary diligent and vigilant care of all our beloved children the Lordly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in the advancement of our Regall power to the great enlargement of our infernall dominions, by their rare and subtill plots, and stratagems.</p>
            <p>And in a more speciall manner wee are pleased through our infernall grace and favour to extoll them for this their present and excellent invention, in sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discord amongst the English hereticks, as also in provoking the Scots hereticks to an apparant oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against their King, yea so farre as to an invasion of the Territories of England; all which services are most deare and acceptable unto us.</p>
            <p>In respect of which services, as also for their fidelity to us and our Kingdome, we have caused our principall Secretary of estate, <hi>Don Antonio Furioso Diabolo,</hi> to make an especiall Inroulement of their names in our Calend, amongst those our deare servants the plotters of the <hi>Gun-powder-treason;</hi> and the most renowned the complotters of the former Invasion of England, in the year of grace 1588. and since the creation of the world 5609. both which services although their events were no wayes answerable according to our Royall expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet those instruments that so freely adventured themselves in them, shall be ever renowned in our court infernall, and most acceptable to our person.</p>
            <p>And for the better incouragement of these our trusty and wel-beloved servants, in the speedier advancement of this worke, now intended for the utter extirpation of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62413:3"/>
all hereticks, and increase of our regall power, we are pleased by this our Royall manuell to give unto them assurance of our aide and best assistance in the most effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious manner that our Princely power can extend unto. And because our former stratagems put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by our beloved Cozen and Counsellor the King of Spaine, were by him no wayes effected according to our Princely expectation: Wee have now therefore imposed our Princely command upon our beloved ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant the King of France, at the humble sute made unto us, by our children the Lordly Bishops, and by some of our servants of greatest quality in the Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as also by our servants the Jesuites and Romane Catholicks of England, to have a puissant armie in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse for the Invasion of England at such a time, as those our children and servants shall conceive it most convenient and efficacious.</p>
            <p>And further our will and pleasure is, that you our deare Son, shall still persist to stir up and incourage our children the Arch-bishops, as also the disciples and our loyall subjects and servants the Jesuites, Priests, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, to this worke, that they with all their might, together with our powerfull policies granted unto them, may strive to effect this worke with all celerity; that we may once more see our Kingdome of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion re-established in the Monarchie of Great Brittain and Ireland.</p>
            <p>The motives to be pressed, inducing them to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious effecting of the same is principally, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our Kingly honour, next their own increase of greatnes, for we promise &amp; assure them by the word of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62413:4"/>
a King infernall, That every of them shall raigne as Princes under us, not onely over the bodies and estates of men, but also over their soules, by and through the many infernall graces by us most freely and benignely conferred on them: and hereby, to make them the more sensible of these our severall graces conferred on them, we are pleased therefore here at present to expresse but some few of them in particular, (as namely) pride, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, hypocrisie, selfe-love of themselves; and of this present world, love of will worship, and advancement of Idolatry; Together with that speciall gift of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, the onely pillar to all the rest of our infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall graces conferred on them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in respect of the cleare passage by us made for them, by setting the hereticks for this long time at variance amongst themselves, by our trusty servants the Lawyers, and advancement of Idolatry amongst them: The onely meanes in our Princely wisdome conceived to be to the breaking of the bond of unity and peace, thereby to provoke the great God of heaven to leave them to themselves, and to our powerfull stratagems. We are likewise pleased to take speciall notice of that service done by our children the Lordly Bishops, in working the dissolution of the assembly of Parliament in <hi>May</hi> last past, 1640. by which meanes nothing was effected for the good of hereticks, either concerning their Church or Common-wealth, so as the successe of this designe of ours was thereby no wayes hindered: you are likewise to let them know from us, that the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of England be disheartered, the Gentry daunted, <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> divided, the number of our servants, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62413:4"/>
Roman Catholicks infinitely increased, and the Realme in generall greatly oppressed, not onely by the sundry Monopolies, but also by the invincible oppressing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our children the Lordly Bishops, the multitude of our servants the corrupt Judges, base minded Lawyers, seditious Atturnies, and woodden-headed Doctors of our civill lawes, Proctors, Prothonotaries, Registers, Advocates, Solicitors, and Apparators, whom wee have caused to swarme, like to the Egyptian Locusts, over all the land, for the sowing of discord, and blowing the coales of contention amongst all the Inhabitants of the same, they having all of them long since received instructions by some of our infernall spirits, sent forth from us to that effect.</p>
            <p>You are likewise to let them know, that out of our Princely respect to them, &amp; their damnable actions for our honour: We are pleased to take speciall notice of that service, which they most willingly endeavoured to effect for the confusion of all the hereticks, inhabiting England, Scotland, Ireland, and the Netherlands, by the late (conceived) Invincible Armado, procured from Spain in the yeare of our raigne 5660. Which through the providence of the celestiall powers then over them, and the disturbance of <hi>Martin Harper Trump,</hi> here below, failed of that successe, which wee together with them expected and hoped for, to our no lesse sorrow then theirs.</p>
            <p>Nor can we but applaud the diligent care taken by our children and servants of greatest quality in that Kingdome, in preventing the discovery of that Invasive plott by the hereticks, and their small well-meaning
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62413:5"/>
State, through their speedy flight to Dover Rode, and private conference there with <hi>Don Oquindo,</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralissimo of Spaine to that effect; All which was most exquisitely performed, especially by our hispaniolized lack-latine Lord, our dearely beloved servant.</p>
            <p>And lastly our hope is, that this present plot set on foot by these our trusty and well-beloved children, and servants afore-named, and by their earnest endeavours and our assistance once effected, will crowne all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to our unspeakable terrestriall glory, and their eternall favours by us to bee conferred on them in our Royall Pallace of perdition, where we have already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed our Royal command upon our trusty and wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved cozen and counsellour, Peter Tretyacove Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, Evane Becklemeesheve our Knight Marshall, Richardo Slowe Treasurer, and Don Serborus grand Porter of our said Pallace, to give them free admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into our Royall Presence.</p>
            <p>Thus no wayes doubting of your singular care and diligence in fulfilling this our Royall will and pleasure hereby expressed; we doe further impose our Royall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Princely respect to be by you presented unto our trusty and wel-beloved cozen and counsellour your present Nuntio in the Court of England, as also unto our beloved children and servants, the Bishops, Jesuites, Priests, and Seminaries, our faithfull agents in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible plot; and also to all our faithfull subjects and servants the Roman Catholicks of England.</p>

            <p>Most gracious Soveraigne,</p>
            <p>The sense of that duty we owe to Gods sacred Majesty, and our nearest affection to the good and welfare of this your Realm of England, have moved us in all humility, to beseech your Royall Majesty, to give us leave to offer to your Princely wisdom, the apprehension which we &amp; others your faithful subjects have conceived, of the great distemper and danger now threatning this Church and State, &amp; your Royall person, and of the fittest means to remove and prevent the same. The evils and dangers whereof your Majesty may be pleased to take notice of, are these.</p>
            <p>That your Majesties sacred person is exposed to hazard &amp; danger, in this present expedition against the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Army, and that by occasion of this warre, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties revenues are much wasted, your subjects burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with cote and conduct mony, billiting of souldiers, and other military charges, and divers rapines &amp; disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (committed,) in severall parts of this your Realm, by the souldiers raised for that service, and the whole Realme full of feares and discontentments.</p>
            <p>The sundry innovations in matters of Religion, the oath of Canons lately imposed upon the Clergy, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62413:6"/>
others of your Majesties subjects, the great increase of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and imploying of Popish Recusants, and others ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected unto Religion, are established in places of power &amp; trust; especially in commanding of men &amp; armes, both in the field, &amp; in sundry other Counties of this your Realm, which by the lawes, they are not permitted to have any armes in their owne houses, The great mischiefe that may fall upon this Kingdom, if the intention which hath beene credibly reported of the bringing in of Irish and forraigne forces, should take effect; The heavy charge of Merchants, to the great discouragement of trade; The multitude of Monopolies and other Patents, whereby the commodities and manufactures of this Kingdome are much burthened, to the great and universall grievances of your people, the great griefe of your subjects, with the long intermission of Parliaments, and the late and former dissolving of such as have beene called, without the happy effects, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they might have produced; for remedy whereof, and prevention of the danger that may ensue to your Royall person, &amp; the whole state, They do in all humility &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse beseech your Majesty, that you will be pleased to summon a Parliament in some short and convenient time, whereby the causes of these and other great grievances, which your people suffer under, may be taken away, &amp; the Authors &amp; Counsellors of them may be brought to such legall tryal, &amp; condigne punishment, as the nature of their offences shall require, and that the present warre may be composed by your Majesties wisdom without bloudshed, in such a manner as may conduce to the honour of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties person &amp; safety, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of your people, &amp; uniting of both the Realmes against the common enemies of the reformed religion, &amp; your Majesties petitioners shall &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62413:11"/>
20. yea, 30. pounds, especially when he finds his Clyent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined to the conditions of an asse.

               <p>May it please your Holinesse, this dish containes a certain number of base muck-worms, stiled Doctors of our Civill Law, Chancellors and Officials, this dish is also seasoned with the unjust spice of extortion, oppression, fraud and deceit, and garnished about with a most damnable crue of Proctors, Notaries, Registers, Deligates, Advocates, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and petty Apparaters, these have for many yeares proved notable instruments of strife and vexation, unto the Inhabitants of England, and through their deceiveable wayes, have mightily oppressed the people, being not much inferiour unto the precedent Golden Charger.</p>
               <p>But to this dish may it please your Holinesse, there hath happened this year a very great mischance in the cooking, for when we thought it should have bin most Laudably boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up to its greatest height of Catholick operation there happened a Spider to fall into it, through a sudden blast of reformation which hath made it somewhat dangerous now for your holinesse to taste of, for, the Lamb that was most richly seasoned in it, is now through this sudden &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected misfortune putrified, and the Duck being awatry
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62413:12"/>
foule, is quite dissolved, and this dish by his majesties spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall order, is to be left now to your holinesse disposall.</p>

               <p>Good my Lord Cardinal, I pray you let me taste of this messe, the operation whereof by your relation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be admirable, I wish from my heart that I might also grow capeable of that vertue of extracting Gold out of the English nation, as some of my predecessors have don before me, (I confesse) the study of this Art was begun by my Phisition most laudadly, but alasse and woe is me, it was marred by a robustuous storme of winde out of the <hi>North,</hi> and quite spoyled a vehement shower of puritanicall raine, and what is the next messe my Lord?</p>
