            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS confess'd that there are already ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Books publisht on the present Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
two or three of which are in our own
Tongue, and those, we doubt not, will by some
men be thought enow. But since this can be
the Opinion but of a few and those unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
people, we chose rather to regard the
Advice of many grave persons of known skill
in the Art of Teaching, who tell us that
<hi>Godwin</hi> in his Antiquities has done very
well indeed in the whole, but that in this
point he is too short; that <hi>Ross</hi> also deserves
commendation for his Mythology, but is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and as much too large; and that <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truchius,</hi>
as <hi>D'Assigny</hi> has translated and
dish'd him out to us, is so confused and art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in its Method, as well as unfortunate in
its Correction, that 'tis not so useful as may
be desir'd: And hereupon this Work was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to be translated, being first well
approv'd by learned Gentlemen, as is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,
<pb facs="tcp:103325:4"/>
for its easie Method and for its
agreeable Plainness. Besides it having been
written by so learned a person, and so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
receiv'd in our Neighbour Nation as
to have sold several Impressions in a short
time, we can hardly doubt of its being very
well accepted here. As for the Citations out
of the Latin Poets, we consider'd a while whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they need be translated, or not, but 'twas
thought fit at last to print them in <hi>English</hi>
either from those who had already rendred
'em, or to render 'em our selves, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the young Scholar.</p>

he appointed it to be a common San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary

with variety of Sacrifices, in the two

And from thence as from a pestilential Head
the Sacrilegious Plague of Idols, passed by a

<hi>Three</hi> Jupiters, (says <hi>Tully de Nat.

                     <hi>Cadmus</hi> was in truth King of

and so it came to pass, that the Wife
of <hi>Cadmus</hi> had the Name of <hi>Harmonia,</hi> or
<hi>Hermione,</hi> from the same Mountain. And
why is it said that <hi>Cadmus</hi>'s Companions were
converted into Serpents, but because the Word

                  <p>Concerning the Mythologists, or the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters

the by. There is in these kind of things such
a vast diversity of Opinions among them;
and, which yet is worse, the Accounts that
many of them give are so witless and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
so incongruous to the very Fables
which they pretend to explain, that I think

it better to write nothing from them, than

called <hi>Sol,</hi> in Earth where he is named <hi>Liber
Pater,</hi> and in Hell where he is stiled <hi>Apollo;</hi>
he is usually painted with these three things,
a Harp, a Shield, and Arrows. The Harp
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103325:24"/>
shews that he bears Rule in Heaven where
all things are full of Harmony; the Shield
describes his Office in Earth where he gives
Health and Safety to terrestrial Creatures;
his Arrows shew his Authority in Hell, for
whomsoever he strikes with them, he sends
them into Hell.</p>

her desire by the Assistance of <hi>Daedalus,</hi>
who for that purpose enclos'd her in a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Cow: she brought forth a <hi>Minotaur,</hi> a
Monster one part of which was like a Man,
the other like a Bull. Now the occasion,
they say,<note place="margin">Serv. ap. Boccat. l. 4</note> of the Fable was this. <hi>Pasiphae</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Man whose Name was <hi>Taurus,</hi> and had
two Twins by him in <hi>Daedalus's</hi> House; one
of which was very like her Husband <hi>Minos,</hi>
and the other like the Father. But however
that is, the <hi>Minotaur</hi> was shut up in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth,

King <hi>Minos</hi> This Labyrinth was a place di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versified
with abundance of windings and
turnings and cross paths running into one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
How this <hi>Minotaur</hi> was kild, and by
whom, I shall shew particularly in its place in
the account of <hi>Theseus. Daedalus</hi> was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

Masts and Yards for Ships: besides he
carved Statues so admirably, that they not

he made Wings for himself and his Son, with

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103325:38"/>
that ever were or will be; for he is the
very Prince and God of Thieves. On that

some Cattel from King <hi>Admetus's</hi> Herd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
<hi>Apollo</hi> was Keeper of them; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
much of the Theft, and bent his Bow
against him: but in the mean time <hi>Mercury</hi>
stole even his Arrows from him. Whilst he
was yet an Infant, and entertain'd by <hi>Vulcan,</hi>
he stole his Tools from him. He took away
by stealth <hi>Venus's</hi> Girdler, whilst she embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him; and <hi>Iupiter's</hi> Scepter: he design'd
to steal the Thunder too, but he was afraid
lest it should burn him. 4. He was mighty
skilful in making Peace; and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was sometimes painted with Chains of
Gold flowing from his mouth, with which
he link'd together the Minds of those that
heard him. And he not only pacifi'd Mortal
men, but also the immortal Gods of Heaven

a Nymph lived in the Woods in which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

gave him a delicate Cow. <hi>Battus</hi> promised;
<hi>Mercury,</hi> that he might try his fidelity, came
in another shape to him, and asked him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Cows; whether he saw them, or
knew the place where the Thief carried them.
<hi>Battus</hi> denied it, but the God prest him hard,
and promised that he would give him both a
Bull and a Cow, if he would discover. With
the Promise he was overcome; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

And indeed what could not <hi>Bacchus</hi> himself

such Miracles without the least Labour. And

repenting his Bargain, he desired <hi>Bacchus</hi> to
take his Gift to himself again. <hi>Bacchus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,

Mariners found him asleep and carried
him into a Ship: wherefore he first stupified
them, stopping the Ship in such a manner,
that it was unmoveable; afterwards he caused
Vines to spring up in the Ship on a sudden,
and Ivy twining about the Oars; and when
the Seamen were almost dead with the fright
he threw them headlong into the Sea and

leap upon them with one foot, so that they
would sometimes fall down; however they
thought they did a great Honour to <hi>Bacchus</hi>
hereby; because they trampled upon the Skin
of the Goat, who is the greatest Enemy to
the Vines. But amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> Rewards
were distributed to those, who by artificially
leaping upon these Leathern Bottles overcame
the rest. And then all of them together calling
aloud upon <hi>Bacchus</hi> confusedly, and in Verses
unpolished, they carried his Statue about their
Vineyards in Masquerade, dawbing their Faces
with Barks of Trees and the Dregs of Wine.
So returning to his Altar again, from whence
they came, they presented their Oblations in
Basons to him, and burnt them. And in the

little wooden or earthen Images of <hi>Bacchus,</hi>
which they called <hi>Oscilla;</hi> from the smalness

For some say that <hi>Bacchus</hi> is the same with
<hi>Nimrod:</hi> the reasons of which Opinion are,
1. The similitude of the Words <hi>Bacchus</hi> and
<hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>chus;</hi> which signifies the <hi>Son of Chus,</hi> that
is <hi>Nimrod.</hi> 2. They think the Name of <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
may allude to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur;</hi>
or the <hi>Chaldee,</hi>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Namer,</hi> a <hi>Tyger.</hi>
And accordingly the Charriot of <hi>Bacchus</hi> was
drawn by Tygres,<note place="margin">Anthol. 1. c. 38. ep. 1.</note> and himself cloathed with
the Skin of a Tygre. 3. <hi>Bacchus</hi> is sometimes
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103325:49"/>
called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is the very same with
<hi>Nimrodus. 4. Moses</hi> stiles <hi>Nimrod</hi> a great
Hunter, and we find that <hi>Bacchus</hi> is styled
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i. e. great Hunter.</hi> (this Name of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
is not mentioned above, for I design not

5. Nor is it absurd to say, that <hi>Nimrod</hi> presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
over the Vines, since he was the first
King of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ex Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeo.</note> where was the most excellent
Wines, as the Antients often say.</p>
                  <p>Others think that <hi>Bacchus</hi> is <hi>Moses;</hi> because
many things in the Fable of the one,<note place="margin">Vossius a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chart. in suo Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> seem
derived from the History of the other. For

and presently shut up in an Ark, and thrown
upon the Waters as <hi>Moses</hi> was. 2. The Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name

                  <p>The Vine is so beneficial to this Life, that
<hi>in vite vitam hominis esse diceres;</hi> and therefore
many say, that the Happiness of one consists
in the Enjoyment of the other. But do not
consider, that if Wine be the Cradle of Life,
yet it is the <hi>Grave of the Reason:</hi> for if Men
do constantly sail <hi>in the Red Sea of Claret,</hi>
their <hi>Souls</hi> are oftimes drowned therein. It
blinds them, and leaves them under Darkness,
especially when it begins to draw the <hi>Sparkles</hi>
and <hi>little Stars</hi> from their Eyes. Then the
Body being drowned in Drink, the Mind
floats, or else is stranded: thus too great love
of the Vine is pernicious to Life; for from
it come more Faults than Grapes, and it breeds
more Mischiefs than Clusters. Would you
see an instance of the truth of what you read,
observe a drunken Man: O Beast! See how
his Head totters, his Hams sink, his Feet
fail, his Hands tremble, his Mouth froths, his
Cheeks are flabby, his Eyes sparkle and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

laughing very much, she was reconciled to
her Husband: and from the King <hi>Cithaeron,</hi>

in the Castle of the City of <hi>Troy;</hi> for
while the Castle and Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> was
building, they say this Image fell from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into the Temple, before it was covered
with a Roof. This stirred up every bodies Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;
and when <hi>Apollo</hi> was consulted, he
answered, That the City should be safe so long
as that Image remained within the City.
Therefore when the <hi>Grecians</hi> besieged <hi>Troy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ovid. 5. Fast.</note>
they found that it was impossible to take the
City, unless the <hi>Palladium</hi> was taken out of
it. The business was left to <hi>Ulysses</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi>
who undertook to creep into the City
through the Common-Shores, and bring away
this fatal Image.<note place="margin">Herodian. I. 1. Plut. in Paral.</note> When they had performed
this, <hi>Troy</hi> was taken without any difficulty.
Some say,<note place="margin">Serv. in 2 Aen.</note> it was not lawful for any Person to
remove the <hi>Palladium,</hi> or even to look upon it,
Others add,<note place="margin">Clem. in Protrep.</note> that it was made of Wood, so
that it was a wonder how it could move the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103325:69"/>
Eyes, and shake the Spear. Others on the
contrary, report, that it was made of the Bones
of <hi>Pelops,</hi> and sold to the <hi>Trojans</hi> by the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians:</hi>
That <hi>Aeneas</hi> recovered it, after it had
been taken by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from <hi>Diomedes,</hi> and
carried it with him into <hi>Italy,</hi> where it was
laid up in the Temple of <hi>Vesta,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Nyss. de Virg. init. c. 4. &amp; 5.</note> as all the <hi>Muses</hi> are;
and accordingly the sight of God is promised
to pure and undefiled Eyes;<note place="margin">Serv. in 2. Aen.</note> for even the
Heathens thought that chast Eyes could see
God; and Wisdom and Modesty has often
appear'd in the Visions of Holy Men, in the
form and habit of Virgins.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Minerva</hi> has a stern Look, and a frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Countenance; because, a wise and modest
Mind gains not its Reputation and Esteem
from outward Beauty and Finery, but from
inward Honour and Virtue; for Wisdom and
plain Modesty, though clothed with Rags,
yet sends forth a glorious shining Lustre; she
has as much Beauty in tattered Garments, as
when she is clothed with Purple; and has as
much Majesty when she sits on a Dunghil, as
when she is placed on a Throne; she is as
beautiful and charming when joyned to the
Infirmities and Decays of old Age, as when
she is united to the Vigour and Comeliness of
Youth.</p>
                  <p>5. She invented and exercised the Art of
Spinning. From hence other Virgins may learn,
if they would preserve their Chastity, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themselves continually in some Work,
and never to indulge Idleness; after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> a noble <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, who
was found late at Night spinning amongst the
Maids, working, and sitting in the middle of
the House, when the young Gentlemen came
thither from the King. <hi>Livy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. As the <hi>Spindle</hi> and the <hi>Distaff</hi> were the
Invention of <hi>Minerva,</hi> so they are the Arms
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103325:72"/>
of every virtuous Woman. Provided with these
she will despise the Enemy of her Honour,
and drive away <hi>Cupid</hi> from her with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
ease: For which Reason, those Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were formerly carryed before the Bride,<note place="margin">Bellof. l. ult c. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when she was brought to her Husbands House.
And somewhere it is a Custom, at the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
of Women, to throw the Distaff and Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
into the Grave with them.</p>
                  <p>7. As soon as <hi>Tiresias</hi> had seen <hi>Minerva</hi> naked,
he lost his sight; was it for a punishment, or
for a reward? Surely he never saw things so
acutely before; for then he became a Prophet,
knew future things, long before they were
acted. Which is an excellent Precept to us,
That he, who hath once beheld the Beauty
of true Wisdom clearly, may without repining,
lose his bodily sight, and want the view of
corporal things, since he beholds the things
that are to come, and enjoys the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of eternal heavenly things, which are not
visible to the Eye.</p>
                  <p>8. An <hi>Owl,</hi> a Bird seeing in the dark, was
sacred to <hi>Minerva,</hi> and painted upon her I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
which is a representation of a wise
Man; who scattering and dispelling the Clouds
of Ignorance and Error, is clear-sighted where
others are stark blind.</p>
                  <p>9. What can the <hi>Palladium</hi> mean, an Image
which gave Security to those Cities, in which
it was placed, unless that those Kingdoms
flourish and prosper where <hi>Wisdom</hi> Counsels.
It is supposed to have fallen down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that we may understand, (what we find
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103325:73"/>
confirmed by the Scripture) <hi>That every the best

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe</hi> were both Inhabitants
of the City of <hi>Babylon;</hi> equals in Beauty, Age,
Conditions and Fortune. They begin to love
from their Cradles. Their Houses were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103325:79"/>
so that their love proceeded from their
Neighbourhood, encreased by their mutual
Play, and was perfected by their singular
Beauty. This love encreased with their years,
and when they were Marriageable they beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their Parents consent; which was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
because of some former Quarrels between
the two Families. And that the Children
might not attempt any thing against their
Parents will, they were not permitted to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this? There was a Partition VVall between
both Houses, in which VVall was a small

Their Sighs went through; but Kisses could
not pass: which, when they parted, they
printed on the VVall.

But what a fatal rupture in their Hearts did
this small breach in the VVall produce? For
their Love was too great to be confined to
such narrow bounds: the next night there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103325:80"/>
they resolved to enjoy that Liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
which they could not receive at home,
by escaping into a neighbouring VVood;
where they intended to meet under the shade
of a large Mulberry-Tree, which stood close
to a Fountain. They agree, and Night comes,
<hi>Thisbe</hi> deceives her Keepers, and escapes the
first, and flies into the VVood; for Love ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
wings to her. VVhen she came to the
appointed place, a Lioness came fresh from
the slaughter of some Cattel, to drink at the
Fountain,
<q>Depositura sitim vicini fontis in unda.</q>
                     <hi>Thisbe</hi> was so frighted that she ran into a Den,
and in her flight her Veil fell from her head;
the Lioness returning from the Fountain,
found the Veil, and tore it with his Jaws,
smeered with the Cattels blood. Afterward
comes <hi>Pyramus,</hi> and sees the Prints of a wild
Beast's Foot in the Gravel, and by and by
finds the Veil of <hi>Thisbe</hi> bloody and torn. He
immediately concluded that she was kild and
devoured by the Beast; he presently grew
distracted, and hastned to the appointed Tree,
and when he could not find <hi>Thisbe,</hi> he threw
himself upon his Sword and died. <hi>Thisbe</hi> in
the mean time recovered from her Fright,
and came to the Mulberry-Tree; where she
sees when she came near a dead Body lie.

                     </q>
And now <hi>Thisbe</hi> was almost dead with Grief.
She tore her Cheeks, and beat her Breast,
and rent her Hair, and shed a deluge of
Tears upon his cold Face; nor ceased to
mourn, till she perceived her Veil bloody and
torn, in <hi>Pyramus</hi>'s Hand. She then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the occasion of his Death: and with
all her Strength, she draws the Sword out of
the Body of her Lover, and strikes it deep
into her own; and falling accidentally on
him, gave him a cold Kiss, and breathed her
last Breath into his Bosom. The Tree was
warmed with the blood of the slain, so that
it became sensible of their Misfortune and
mourn'd. Its Berries, which were before
white, became red with Grief, and blushed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103325:81"/>
for the Death of <hi>Pyramus:</hi> when <hi>Thisbe</hi> also
died, the Berries became black and dark, as
if they had put on Mourning.</p>
                  <p>In the next place hear the Story of <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanta</hi>
and <hi>Hippomenes.</hi> She was the Daughter
of King <hi>Schoeneus,</hi> or <hi>Coeneus.</hi> It was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
whether her Beauty or Swiftness in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
were greatest. When she consulted the
Oracle, whether she should Marry or no, she
received this Answer, that Marriage would
be fatal to her. Hereupon the Virgin hid
her self in the Woods, and liv'd in places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the Conversation of Men. But,
the more she avoided them, they courted her
the more eagerly. Her Disdain inflam'd their
Desires, and her Pride rais'd their Adoration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
At last, when she saw she could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
deliver her self from the Importunity of
her Lovers, she made this Agreement with
them. <q>You court me in vain, says she, he
who beats me at Running shall be my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
but they who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

shall suffer death: I will be the Victors Prise
but the Vanquisheds Punishment. If these
Conditions please, come, go with me into
the Field.</q> They went.
<q>
                        <l>Venit ad hanc legem temeraria turba procorum.</l>
                        <l>All her mad Wooers take the Terms propos'd.</l>
                     </q>
They all strive, and were all beaten, and put
to death according to the Agreement; suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the fault of their Feet, the loss of
their Heads. Yet the Example of these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
did not deter <hi>Hippomenes</hi> from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the Race, He entertain'd Hopes of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103325:81"/>
winning the Victory, because <hi>Venus</hi> had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
him three golden Apples, gathered in the
Gardens of the <hi>Hesperides;</hi> and did advise him
what he should do. <hi>Hippomenes</hi> briskly set
out and began the Race; and when he saw
that <hi>Atalanta</hi> overtook him, he threw down
a golden Apple: the beauty of it enticed her,
so that,
<q>
                        <l>Declinat cursus, aurumque volubile tollit.</l>
                        <l>She greedy of the shining Fruit steps back</l>
                        <l>To catch the rolling Gold.—</l>
                     </q>
Afterwards he threw down another, and she
stopp'd again to reach it, and again a third;
so that while <hi>Atalanta</hi> was busied in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up <hi>Hippomenes</hi> reach'd the Goal,
and took the Lady as the Price of his Victory.</p>
                  <p>But how inconstant is <hi>Venus?</hi> and how base
Ingratitude? <hi>Hippomenes</hi> being drunk with
Love, gave not due thanks to <hi>Venus,</hi> but was
forgetful of her Kindness. The Goddess re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it, and inflam'd them with such strong
impatient Desires, that in their Journey they
dared to satisfie their Passion in a Temple:
for which Sacrilege they were immediately
punished, for they were turned into Lyons.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, let <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Helena</hi> now come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage. <hi>Paris</hi> was the Son of <hi>Priamus,</hi>
King of <hi>Troy,</hi> by <hi>Hecuba:</hi> his Mother, when
she was big-belly'd, dreamt that she brought
forth a <hi>burning Torch:</hi> and asking the Oracles
the Interpretation of it, they answer'd, that
it did portend the Burning of <hi>Troy,</hi> and that
the Fire should be kindled by that Boy that
she had in her Belly. Therefore, as soon as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103325:82"/>
the Child was born, by the Command o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Priamus,</hi> he was expos'd upon the Mountain
<hi>Ida;</hi> where the Shepherds brought him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
up, and nourished him, and call'd him
<hi>Paris.</hi> When he became a Man, many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Endowments and good Qualities shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in him; and particularly he gave such
great Tokens of singular Prudence and Equity
in deciding Controversies, that when a great
difference arose amongst the Goddesses, they
referr'd it to his Judgment to be determin'd.
The Goddess <hi>Discordia</hi> was the occasion of
this Contention: for,<note place="margin">Dio. Chrys. or. 20.</note> because all the Gods
and Goddesses were invited,<note place="margin">Philostr. in Icon.</note> except her self
to the Marriage of <hi>Peleus,</hi> she was angry, and
resolv'd to revenge the Disgrace: wherefore
when they all met and sat down at the Table,
she came in privately, and threw down upon
the Table an <hi>Apple of Gold,</hi> on which was
this Inscription, <hi>Pulchrior accipiat,</hi> or (which
is the same) <hi>Detur pulchriori; Let the Fairest
take it.</hi> Hereupon arose a Quarrel amongst
the Goddesses; for every one thought her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the handsomest. But at last all the other
Goddesses yielded to the three superior God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses,
<hi>Iuno, Pallas</hi> and <hi>Venus:</hi> who disputed
so eagerly, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself was not able
to bring them to Agreement. He resolved
therefore to leave the final determination of
it to the Judgment of <hi>Paris;</hi> so that she
should have the Apple, to whom <hi>Paris</hi> should
appoint it. The Goddesses consent, and call
for <hi>Paris,</hi> who did then feed Sheep upon a
Mountain. They tell him the Business; they
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103325:82"/>
every one court his Favour with great Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
<hi>Iuno</hi> promised to reward him with <hi>Power;
Pallas</hi> with <hi>Wisdom;</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> promis'd him
the <hi>most Beautiful Woman in the World.</hi> In
short, he observ'd them all very curiously:
but Nature guided him to pronounce <hi>Venus</hi>
the Fairest, and to assign to her the Apple of
Gold. Nor did <hi>Venus</hi> break her Promise to
<hi>Paris:</hi> for in a little time <hi>Paris</hi> was own'd to
be King <hi>Priam</hi>'s Son; and sail'd into <hi>Greece</hi>
with a great Fleet, under colour of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy,
to fetch away <hi>Helena,</hi> the most Beautiful
Virgin in the World; who was betroth'd to
<hi>Menelaus,</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and liv'd in his
House. When he came <hi>Menelaus</hi> was absent
from home; and in his absense <hi>Paris</hi> carried
<hi>Helena</hi> to <hi>Troy: Menelaus</hi> demanded her, but
<hi>Paris</hi> refus'd to send her back; whereupon
that fatal War between the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans</hi>
brake out, in which <hi>Troy,</hi> the Metropolis
of all <hi>Asia,</hi> was taken and miserably burnt, in
the Year of the World, 2871. There were
kild 886000 of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> amongst whom
<hi>Achilles</hi> their General lost his life by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
of <hi>Paris</hi> himself. There were slain
676000 of the <hi>Trojans;</hi> from the beginning
of the War, to the Betraying the City. (for
it was thought that <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Antenor</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
it) amongst whom <hi>Paris</hi> himself was
kild by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> or <hi>Philoctetes;</hi> and his Brother
<hi>Hector, Patriae Columen, the Pillar of his Country,</hi>
was kild by <hi>Achilles.</hi> And when the City was
taken and burnt, King <hi>Priamus,</hi> the Father
of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Hector,</hi> at once lost all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103325:83"/>
                     <hi>Hecuba</hi> his Queen, his Kingdom, and
his Life. <hi>Helena,</hi> after <hi>Paris</hi> was kild, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Brother <hi>Deiphobus.</hi> Yet she at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
the Castle to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Menelaus</hi> into her Chamber to kill <hi>Deipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus;</hi>
whereby, it is said, she was reconciled
to the Favour of <hi>Menelaus</hi> again. But these
things belong rather to History than to Fable,
to which let us return.</p>

mouth, and when her Beauty pleaded her
Cause, every body acquitted her.</p>
                  <p>2. Beauteous <hi>Venus</hi> rides in a Chariot, as it
were to triumph over her subdued Enemies,
whom Love, rather than Force has conquered.
She has her Ambushes, but they are composed
of Pleasure and Enjoyment; she Skirmishes
with Delights, and not with Fire and Bullets;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ights thus, it is no wonder if she makes the
Enemy fly to her rather than from her.</p>
                  <p>3. She wears a Crown because she is always
Victorious. Beauty never wants success: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she fights leasurely and Conquers in
time of Peace, and Triumphs with her Eyes:
Thunder is contained in her Silence, and
Lightning in her Looks. She seizes the Breast,
storms the Mind, and takes it captive with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103325:87"/>
one Assault, nay with one Look. Beauty
speaks without a Voice, forces us without
Violence; tyes us down without Fetters, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
us without Witchcraft, and in her to see is to
Overcome, and to be seen is to Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
<hi>Augustus</hi> refused to see her in <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
lest himself should be taken, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
of the World submit to a Woman.
When therefore she pleaded and made her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
he opened his Ears but shut his Eyes.</p>
                  <p>4. She carries a Looking glass, that the brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
of the Glass may remind her of the
frailty of her Beauty. She is crowned with
flowery Garlands, because nothing is
more fading than Beauty, which like a Flower is
blasted by the least breath, and broken by the
least accident, and dies in the smallest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>5. She is born from the Sea, because more
Storms and Tempests afflict the Lover, than
disturb the Sea: Nothing but bitterness is his
portion, so that we may say that <hi>amare to
Love,</hi> is derived from <hi>amarus bitter.</hi> This is
certainly true, that the bitterness of the Sea
is sweet, if compared with the bitterness of
Love. But suppose Love has some sweetness,
yet like the Sea from whence <hi>Venus</hi> sprung,
it is full of tempestuous desires and stormy
disappointments; how many Vessels have
beed shipwreck'd there, how many Goods lost?
What destructions not only of Mens Estates,
but of the Understandings also, have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here? Instances of which, every body who
is not blind has observed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:103325:87"/>6. Consider the Adulteries, Rapes, Incests,
of which <hi>Venus</hi> is accused, and you will find
whitherward her Beauty tends. Those are
the Precipices, into which that <hi>Ignis fatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her Eyes betrays its Admirers. Tho her Face
appears pure, and cool as the Ice, it creates a
Passion both impure, and hot as Fire. From
that stream of sparkling Fire which comes
from her Eyes, are engendred Clouds of dark
and hellish Impurity, and black mists of Lust.
Thus by a strange contradiction, many are
blinded by others Eyes, and find Tumults rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in their breasts from the calm serenity of
anothers looks, grow pale at the redness in
their Cheeks; loose their own Beauty in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
the Beauty of others, and grow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest
by loving their Modesty.</p>

such a Drought upon her, that she almost
fainted for Thirst. At last she discovered a
Spring in the Bottom of the Valley, she ran to

The neighbouring Country-men seeing her,
forbade her, tho she begged of them leave to;

that it should be opened when the <hi>Romans</hi>

says <hi>Tully, (de Senect.) in praeteritorum memoriâ
&amp; providentiâ futurorum: In the remembrance
of things past, and a foresight of things to come.</hi>
The prudent Man ought therefore <hi>to have, as
it were, two Faces:</hi> that according to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
sagacity of Mind, and ripeness of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
observing both things past and things
future, he may be able to discern the Causes
and the Beginnings, the Progress, and as it
were the forerunning Accidents of all things;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103325:104"/>
that he may be able to draw Likenesses, to
make Comparisons, to observe Consequences,
and perceive Futurities, and by a wise connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Causes and Events, be able to joyn
things present with things to come, and things
future with things past.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prudent Person hath the Key of all things:</hi>
Nothing is so obscure, that his understanding
cannot comprehend, nothing is so secret and
private, that his consideration and care can't
detect and lay open; nothing is so hard and
intricate, that his quickness and dexterity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
explain and unfold. With this Key he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines
all the ways of Business, and finds which
are the most proper; he sees the Disposition
of Times, and the Exigences of Occasions:
he removes the Difficulties, and the Barrs that
lie in his way; he publishes as much as is useful:
and conceals closely whatsoever will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> hurtful
to him. With this Key he lays open for himself
a passage into the Friendship of others: he
insinuates himself into the inward Recesses of
their Breasts; he learns their most secret
Counsels, their most reserved Thoughts: he
solves Mysteries, and penetrates things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
and seeks and finds and views Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
the most remote from the common sense
of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ianus</hi> first instituted Altars, Temples, and
Sacrifices. Thus it is a sign of the highest
Prudence and Understanding, to pay due Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

He was so called from the smallness <hi>of his

<hi>Caeculus</hi> unhurt in the midst of the fire, as

                     </hi>
and <hi>Caeculus.</hi> This Monster drew Four of
<hi>Ulysse</hi>'s Companions into his Den, in <hi>Sicily;</hi>
and devoured them. He thought too that
he was certain of the rest. But <hi>Ulysses</hi> made
him drunk with Wine, and then with a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand
quite put out his sight. <hi>Virgil Aen.</hi> 3.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ser. 8. Aen.</note>) And therefore
he is painted with a blew Hat,<note place="margin">Euseb. de praep. Evang.</note> which is a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
of the <hi>Celestial</hi> or <hi>Elementary</hi> Fire, which
is by Nature clear, and immix'd; whereas
the <hi>Common Fire,</hi> that is used in Earth is weak,
and wants continual fuel to support it, and
therefore <hi>Vulcan</hi> is said to be lame. He is
said to have been cast down from Heaven;
because the <hi>Lightning</hi> comes from the Clouds;
and to have fallen into <hi>Lemnos,</hi> because Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
oft falls in that Island.<note place="margin">Serv. ib.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us a little consider the flames of Love,
for <hi>Vulcan</hi> married <hi>Venus.</hi> If you admire,
wherefore so fair, so delicate, so beautiful a
<hi>Goddess</hi> should be a Wife to so deformed and
black a God, you must suppose, that <hi>Vulcan</hi>
is the Fire, and <hi>Venus</hi> the Flame: and is not
the union between Fire and Flame very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?
But this Fire is kindled in Hell and
blowed by <hi>Cyclops.</hi> And those who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to Venery are set on fire with these
flames: For when a flame kindled by the Eyes
of a beauteous Woman sets the Breast on fire,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103325:108"/>
how violent is the Combustion, how great
the Havock, how certain the Destruction?
Hence comes the Lovers Anguish, Deadness
and Faintness overspread his Face, his Eyes are
dull and heavy, his Cheeks meager and wan,
his Countenance puts on the paleness of
Ashes; which are fatal Arguments of a spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fire within, that consumes and preys upon
the interior parts. But when Impudence has
blown the Coals, so that Modesty can put no
farther stop to the Rage and Violence of this
Flame: When this hellish Offspring breaks
forth, and by degrees gathers strength: good
God! How does it spread, rage, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease?
With what fury and violence does it
bear down and destroy every thing? By this
Flame <hi>Semele</hi> was consumed. <hi>Hercule</hi>'s strength
was an easie pray to it; and hereby the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Towers, and stateliest Palaces of <hi>Troy</hi> were
consumed and reduced to Ashes.</p>
                  <p>Have you given your self up to <hi>Venus?</hi> She
will make you a <hi>Vulcan:</hi> she will make you
filthy, nasty, and black as Hell, she will
darken your Understanding, though you are
in the midst of Fire. For the fire of <hi>Venus</hi>
gives no light, but brings the greatest dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
it freezes and stupifies the Soul, while
the Body is thawed and melted in pleasures.
How sad is the fate of an effeminate Man?
His toil and labour is like the work of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can;</hi>
for he who desperately loves a Woman,
takes a burning Iron into his Breast, his House
is a Forge, he labours and toils to soften her
Temper, more than <hi>Vulcan</hi> sweats to fashion
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103325:109"/>
the hardest Steel; he neglects the care of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to make her fine and handsome: Again
how many Estates are melted in lust's Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace?
How many Possessions reduced to
Ashes? Till nothing but Dross is left, and
the Nobility and Honour of their Families
disappear and vanish in smoak.</p>
                  <p>No Fuel can satisfie this Fire; the heat of
it never decreases, it never cools: for <hi>Venus</hi>
blows it with Sighs, kindles it with Tears, and
foments it with proud Disdain and Coldness.
Her Kindness is Cruelty, her Pride is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snaring.
What wonder is it then, that so
many <hi>Vulcans,</hi> not only in <hi>Lemnos</hi> but every
where, make Thunder at this Forge, which
will fall on their own Heads; by which they
are cast headlong from Heaven to Earth, that
is from the highest degree of Happiness to the
lowest vale of Misery: from which fall comes
a lameness never to be cured. These are the
effects of the love of <hi>Venus.</hi> If you will not

She sits,<note place="margin">Varr. ap. Aug 7. de Civ. Cic. de somn.</note> because the Earth is immoveable,

<hi>Vesta</hi> has a Drum, because the <hi>Earth</hi> contains

                        <hi>Vesta</hi>'s

                     <p>I wish that you would resolve one Doubt
which I still have concerning this Goddess.
How can <hi>Vesta</hi> be the same with <hi>Terra,</hi> when
nothing is more frequent amongst Mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists,
than to signifie <hi>Fire</hi> by <hi>Vesta.</hi>

                     <p>I perceive that I do not deal with a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:</hi>
I will satisfie your doubt. There was
two <hi>Vesta's,</hi> the elder and the younger. The
first, of whom I have spoken, was the Wife of
<hi>Coelum</hi> and the Mother of <hi>Saturn.</hi> The second
was the Daughter of <hi>Saturn</hi> by his Wife <hi>Rhea.</hi>
And as the first is the same with <hi>Terra,</hi> as I
have already described, so the other is the
same with <hi>Ignis. Hujus enim,</hi> says <hi>Tully (de
Natur. Deor. lib.</hi> 2.) <hi>vis omnis ad aras &amp;

Remember what the Poet says (<hi>Ovid

                        <q>
                           <l>Prima Ceres unco glebam dimovit aratro,</l>

Whereas before the Earth lay rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannred,

Plants; when there were no Proprietors
of Land, they neglected it; No body had any

painted but half of him; because he is an
<hi>unhandsome</hi> and <hi>obscene</hi> Deity. His Name is
<hi>Priapus.</hi> I am ashamed to tell the Story of
him, he is so very filthy. And therefore I
shall say only, that he was the Son of <hi>Venus</hi> and
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> born at <hi>Lampsacus;</hi> where his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
hating his deformity, and the dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Members, rejected him. Yet he
pleased the Women of <hi>Lampsacus,</hi> insomuch
that their Husbands banished him from the
City, till by the Oracles command he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
and made <hi>God of the Gardens,</hi> and
crowned with Garden Herbs. He carries a
Sickle in his Hand, to cut off from the Trees
all superfluous Boughs, and to drive away
Thieves and Beasts, and mischievous Birds;
from whence he is called <hi>Avistupor.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Image is usually placed in Gardens, as
<hi>Tibullus</hi> intimates in these Verses.

This loss was exceedingly deplored by

was told by an Oracle, that he ought by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices

sacrificed to her four Bulls and four Heifers;

Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ap. Lil. Gyr.</note> According to the Opinion of some,
she is called <hi>Triformis,</hi> because the <hi>Moon</hi> hath
three <hi>several Faces,</hi> or Shapes. The <hi>New Moon</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:103325:139"/>
casts a Circle of Light like an Arch. The
<hi>Half Moon</hi> fills a Semicircle with Light, and
the <hi>Full Moon</hi> fills a whole Circle or Orb with
its Light. But let us examine these Names
more nicely.</p>
               <p>Luna <hi>is derived</hi> à lucendo, shining; <hi>either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
una sit, quae noctu lucet; she alone shines
so gloriously in the Night; vel quòd luce alienâ
splendeat, <hi>or</hi> because she shines by the light of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In <hi>Greek</hi> her Name is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<hi>novum lumen;</hi> because she shines always with
New Light. Her Chariot is drawn with a
white and a black Horse, or with two Oxen,
because she has got two Horns, sometimes a
Mule is added, says <hi>Festus,</hi> because she is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and shines by the Light of the Sun. Some
say that a <hi>Luna</hi> of both Sexes hath been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
especially among the <hi>AEgyptians:</hi> and
indeed they give this property to all the other
Gods. Thus both <hi>Lunus</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.
But with this difference, that those
who worshipped <hi>Luna,</hi> were thought subject to
the Women, and those who worshipped <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
were superiour to them. We must also
observe, that the Men sacrificed to <hi>Venus,</hi>

them <hi>Meleager</hi> accompanied with many

to kill this Boar, or to drive him out of the
Country. The Virgin <hi>Atalanta</hi> was among
the Hunters, and gave the Boar the first
wound; and soon after <hi>Meleager</hi> killed him.
He esteemed <hi>Atalanta</hi> more who first wounded

therefore offered her the Boars skin.

The Relations of <hi>Meleager</hi> were enraged that
the Hide was given to a Stranger, and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took it from her: whereupon <hi>Meleager</hi>
killed them. As soon as his Mother <hi>Althaea,</hi>
understood that <hi>Meleager</hi> had killed his own
Brothers, she sought revenge like a mad Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
In <hi>Althaea</hi>'s Chamber was a Billet;

which, when <hi>Meleager</hi> was born, the Fates
took and threw into the Fire; saying

                     <l>His Mother snatcht it with an hasty hand</l>
                     <l>Out of the fire; and quencht the flagrant brand.</l>
                     <l>This in an inward Closet closely lays:</l>
                     <l>And by preserving it, preserves his days.</l>
                  </q>
She therefore, moved with rage, goes to her
Chamber,
<q>
                     <l>—Dextraque aversa trementi,</l>

the Gardens, and from the observations which
he had made, he began to discourse of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
telling her that it would add to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
even of a God, to have her to Wife.
Observe, says he, the Trees which creep up
this Wall, How do the Apples and Plums
strive which shall excel the other in Beauty

Eye between them all, which they all could
use. When any one of them desired to see
any thing, she fixed the Eye in her Forehead,
in the same manner as you fix a Diamond in

Eye out again that her Sisters might have it:
thus they all used it as there was occasion.

her Picture was,<note place="margin">Apoll. 4. Argon.</note> every body says that she was
the Daughter of <hi>Phorcus,</hi> and <hi>Glaucus</hi>'s Mistress;
<hi>Circe</hi> passionately loved <hi>Glaucus,</hi> and could

                     <note place="margin">Myro Prian. l. 3. rer. Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.</note> wherefore she poisoned with
venemous Herbs those Waters, in which
<hi>Scylla</hi> used to wash her self: <hi>Scylla</hi> was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it, and according to her custom, went
into the Fountain, and when she saw that the
lower part of her Body was turned into the
head of a Dog: being extremely grieved that
she had lost her beauty, she cast her self head
long into the Sea, where she was turned into a
Rock, infamous for the many Shipwrecks
which happen there: which Rock is still seen in

<hi>Messina</hi> a City of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Rhegiam</hi> (now
called <hi>Reggio</hi>) in <hi>Calabria.</hi> This Rock is said to
be surrounded with Dogs and Wolves; who
devour the persons who are cast away there.
But by this is meant only, that when the
Waves by a violent Storm are dashed against
this great Rock, the noise a little resembles
the barking of Dogs and the howling of
Wolves.</p>

which, Nature our common Parent, had

them.<note place="margin">Dion. Hist. Lib.</note> They had the Faces of Women, and
also the Necks and Breasts. But below they
were covered with Scales, and they had the

when they came near, these <hi>Lamiae</hi> used to fly

                           <p>Pray, Sir, let me a little interrupt you
now, since I have been silent so long. Pray
satisfie these two Scruples. First, why could
not <hi>Iuno</hi> his Enemy hinder his Birth. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I know that many mention more than
twelve Labours of <hi>Hercules.</hi>

                           <p>What you call an interruption, <hi>Palaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi>
is both seasonable and acceptable to
me; because it recals a thing into my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that I had forgot, and gives me an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mentioning something which ought not
to be omitted. Know therefore, that <hi>Iuno</hi>
design'd to kill him in his Mothers Womb, or
else destroy him immediately after his Birth;
and to perform it laid her Plot: but <hi>Alcmena</hi>'s
Woman <hi>Galanthis</hi> prevented it; for she cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Iuno,</hi> and told her that <hi>Alcmena</hi> had
brought forth a Son. <hi>Iuno</hi> believed her, and
thinking that her Contrivances were ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
she desisted; and then <hi>Alcmena</hi> brought
forth <hi>Hercules</hi> without trouble. But the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of <hi>Galanthis</hi> was punished, for she was
turned into a Weasel (in <hi>Greek</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">

and because <hi>Galanthis</hi> offended by her Mouth
therefore the Weasel brings forth her Young
at her Mouth, with great pain and anguish.</p>
                           <p>As for the <hi>Labours of Hercules,</hi> I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess

plucked one of the Bulls Horns off,

his Horn again, giving <hi>Hercules Amalthaea</hi>'s
Horn. This is the meaning of the Story.
<hi>Achelous</hi> is a River of <hi>Greece,</hi> whose course
turns and winds like a Serpent; its Stream is
so rapid, that it makes Furrows wheresoe'er it
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:103325:193"/>
flows, and the noise of its waters resembles
the roaring of a Bull, (and indeed it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thing among the Poets, to compare a
rapid River to a Bull) This River divided it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self
into two Streams, but <hi>Hercules</hi> with Banks
forced it into one Channel, that is, he broke
off one of the Horns or Streams: The Lands
being thus drained became mighty fertile; so
that <hi>Hercules</hi> is said to have received the Horn
of Plenty.</item>

ravish her: which <hi>Hercules</hi> observing while he
swam, and being enraged at the impudence

killed him: when <hi>Nessus</hi> was dying he gave
<hi>Deianira</hi> his bloody Coat, and told her, that

follow unlawful Amours. The credulous

so many and so great Labours, was at length
broken by the Charms and overcome by the
Pleasures of <hi>Omphale,</hi>

He served her, and changed the Club which

and his Arrows into a Spindle. He fell also
in love with <hi>Iole,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Eurytus</hi>
King of <hi>Oechalia,</hi> to that degree, that he was
miserably ruined. These things made his Wife
<hi>Deianira</hi> mighty uneasie, so that she desiring
to turn him from the love of his <hi>Mistresses,</hi>
sent him <hi>Nessus</hi>'s Coat, which he put on when
he went to Sacrifice: but it drove him into
such a Distraction, that he burnt himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Pile that he had raised, and after his
death was accounted among the number of
the Gods.</p>

when <hi>Theseus</hi> came to <hi>Crete,</hi> he was shut up in
the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> but he slew the <hi>Minotaur</hi> and
escaped out of that inextricable Prison by the
help of <hi>Ariadne.</hi> After this he set Sail for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
in the same mournful Ship, in which he
came to <hi>Crete;</hi> but forgot to change his Sails
according to the instruction which his Father
had given him. So that when his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
from a Watch Tower the Ship returning
with <hi>black</hi> Sails, he imagined that his Son
was dead, and cast himself headlong into the
Sea, which was afterwards called <hi>AEgaeum
Mare,</hi> the <hi>AEgaean Sea,</hi> from his Name and
Destiny.</p>

their Weapons against the Enemy. These

in his Chariot: In his flight he met several

so that they threw him out of the Seat, his Feet

himself <hi>Virbius, quod vir bis fuisset,</hi> because

However he obtained leave to divide his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality

when the <hi>Argonauts</hi> were driven by a violent

more than humane was thought to be lodged
in these Youths. Whensoever these Fires ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
afterwards, they were called <hi>Castor</hi>
and <hi>Pollux:</hi> If but one Fire appeared, they
called it <hi>Helena,</hi> and it was esteemed fatal and

               <p>There was a famous Temple dedicated to

the innocent Stranger to her Husband.
<hi>Praetus</hi> however, would not violate the Laws

but sent him into <hi>Lycia,</hi> to his Father-in-law
<hi>Iobates,</hi> with Letters, which desired him to
punish <hi>Bellerophon</hi> as his crime deserved. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi>
read the Letters, and sent him to fight
against the <hi>Solymi,</hi> that he might be killed
in the battle: But he easily vanquished them,
and in many other Dangers to which he was
exposed, he always came off Conqueror. At
last he was sent to kill the <hi>Chimaera;</hi> which
he honourably undertook and performed,
when he had procured the Horse <hi>Pegasus,</hi> by

him one of his Daughters to Wife, allotting
him also a part of his Kingdom. <hi>Sthenobaea</hi>
killed her self, when she heard this. This

he endeavoured to flie upon <hi>Pegasus</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:

because in that place <hi>Bellerophon</hi> wandred up
and down, blind, to the end of his life. But
<hi>Pegasus</hi> was reposed amongst the Stars. Some
say that this was the occasion of the Fable of
the <hi>Chimaera.</hi> There was a famous Pyrat,
who used to sail in a Ship in whose Prow was

in the body of the Ship a Goat was describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and this Pyrate was killed by <hi>Bellerophon</hi>

                  <p>Since you ask,<note place="margin">Chiron.</note> I will tell you, that he
was a <hi>Centaur,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Saturn</hi> and
<hi>Phillyra;</hi> for when Saturn embraced
that Nymph, he suddenly changed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into a Horse, because his Wife <hi>Ops</hi> came
in. <hi>Phillyra</hi> was with Child by him,<note place="margin">Virg. 3.</note> and
brought forth a Creature,<note place="margin">Georg.</note> in its upper parts
like a Man,<note place="margin">Phyllyra.</note> in his lower parts like a Horse,
and called it <hi>Chiron:</hi> who, when he grew up,
betook himself into the Woods; and there
learning the Virtues of Herbs, he became a
most excellent Physician: For his Skill in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
and for his other Virtues, which were
many; he was appointed Tutor to <hi>Achilles,</hi>
And taught <hi>Aesculapius</hi> Physick. At last
when he was looking upon <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Arrows,
one of them dipped in the poysonous blood of
the <hi>Lernaean Hydra</hi> fell upon his Foot; and
gave him a wound that was incurable, and
pains that were intolerable: insomuch that he
desired to die, but could not: because he was
born of two <hi>immortal</hi> Parents. Therefore
at length the <hi>Gods</hi> translated him into the <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,</hi>
where he now remains the <hi>Sign</hi> of
<hi>Sagittarius</hi> in the <hi>Zodiac.</hi>

                  <hi>Clay:</hi> which he did with such Art and Skill,
that <hi>Minerva</hi> was amazed; and profered to
procure any thing from Heaven, which would
any ways compleat his Works. <hi>Prometheus</hi>
answered, that he did not know what in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
would be useful to him, since he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen Heaven. Therefore <hi>Minerva</hi> carried
him up to Heaven, and shewed him all that
there was to be seen. He observed that the
heat of the Sun would be very useful in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
the Men which he had formed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he lighted the Stick by the Wheel of the
Sun's Chariot, and carried it lighted with him
to the Earth. This Theft displeased <hi>Iupiter</hi> so
much, that he sent <hi>Pandora</hi> into the World to
<hi>Prometheus</hi> with a Box which was filled with
all sorts of Evils. But <hi>Prometheus</hi> fearing and
suspecting the Matter, refused to accept it:
but his brother <hi>Epimetheus</hi> was not cautious:
For he took it, and opened it, and all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
that were in it, flew abroad amongst
Mankind. When he perceived what he had
done, he immediately shut the Box again,
and by good fortune hindred <hi>Hope</hi> from flying
away, which stuck to the bottom of the Box.
You may remember how sweetly <hi>Horace</hi>
speaks of this Theft of <hi>Prometheus.</hi> (<hi>Carm. l.</hi> 1.)

He commanded <hi>Mercury</hi> to bind him to

               <p>To this, <hi>Nicander</hi> adds another Fable,
when Mankind had received the Fire of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus,</hi>
they ungratefully discovered this
Theft to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who gave them the Gift of
<hi>perpetual Youth;</hi> they put this Gift upon an
Asses back, that it might be brought to the
Earth. The Ass in his Journey was a dry,
and came to a Spring to drink, but a Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serpent
would not suffer him, unless the Ass
would give him the Burden which he carried,
the Ass gave it him; and hence it came to
pass, that when the Serpent is old, he casts
his Skin, and seems to grow young again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prometheus</hi> had been serviceable to <hi>Iupiter</hi>
(for he discovered to <hi>Iupiter</hi> his Father <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>'s
Conspiracy, and prevented the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Thetis,</hi> which he foresaw

<hi>Hercules</hi> to shoot the Eagle, and set <hi>Frometheus</hi>

persuaded by the Eloquence of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> and

                  <p>Modesty will hardly let
me tell you. However I will conceal nothing
from you. They say that he was born from
the Urine of <hi>Iupiter, Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi>
For when they travelled together, they were
benighted, and forced to lodge in a poor
Man's Cottage, whose Name was <hi>Hircus.</hi>
He entertained them as handsomely, as the
Meanness of his Condition would suffer: Their
Entertainment pleased them so, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to grant whatever he asked. He said
that he had promised his Wife when she dyed,
never to marry again, and yet that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
desired to have a Son. This pious
Desire pleased the Gods, and they consented
to his Request; and moistned the Hide of
the Ox (with which they were entertained)
with their Urine, commanding him to bury
it; Ten Months after he digged it up, and
found in it a New-born-child, which from
this occasion, he called <hi>Urion</hi> or <hi>Orion.</hi>

                  <hi>Orion,</hi> when young, was a constant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
to <hi>Diana.</hi> But because his Love to
the Goddess exceeded the bounds of Modesty,
or because, as some say, he extolled the strength
of his own Body very undecently, and boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
that he could conquer and take even
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:103325:214"/>
the wildest and fiercest Beasts. This Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
grievously displeased the Earth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she sent a <hi>Scorpion</hi> which killed him. He
was afterwards carried to the Heavens, and
made a <hi>Constellation:</hi> which is thought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict

of this Ox thus: (<hi>l. 8. c.</hi> 40.) An <hi>Ox</hi> (says he)
in <hi>Egypt</hi> is Worshipped as a God. They call
him <hi>Apis.</hi> He is thus marked; there is a
white shining spot upon his right side, Horns like
the Moon in its increase, and a Node under his
Tongue which they call <hi>Cantharus.</hi> His Body
says <hi>Herodotus. l.</hi> 3. was all black: In his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
he had a white square shining Figure:
The Effigies of an Eagle in his Back: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that <hi>Cantharus</hi> in his Palace, he had Hair
of two sorts in his Tale. But <hi>Pliny</hi> goes on:
If he lives beyond an appointed period of time,
they drown him in the Priest's Fountain; then
the Priests shave their Heads, and mourn
and lament, and seek another to substitute in
his room. When they have found one, he is
brought, by the Priests to <hi>Memphis.</hi> He hath
two Chappels, which they call <hi>Chambers,</hi>
which are the <hi>Oracles</hi> of the People. In one
of which he foretells Good, in the other Ill.
He gives answers in private, and takes Meat
from them that consult him. He refused the
Hand of <hi>Germanicus Cesar,</hi> who died not long
after. He acts for the most part in secret. But
when he pleases to appear publickly, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
go before and clear the way; and a flock
of Boys attend him, singing Verses to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
He seems to understand things, and to
expect Worship. Once a Year a Cow is shown
to him; who hath her marks (tho' different
from his;) and this Cow is always both found
and killed the same day. So far <hi>Pliny.</hi> To
