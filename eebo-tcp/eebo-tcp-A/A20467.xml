         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for their Generall the Lieutenant of <hi>Don Ottauio Chezis,</hi>
which is the firſt companie vnder the Popes Nephew: theſe

promiſed newe ſupplies: whereupon on their allegeance,
promiſed to performe what his Maieſtie ſhoulde pleaſe to

halfe a league aboue the ſaide place, and there
he laboured to intrench and barriquade the wayes to

keep it, and lodge ſome troupes in houſes therabout.
But as for the ſaid Lord <hi>de Diguieres</hi> troupes, the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
tooke vp their lodging at <hi>Chelais,</hi> and the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

day about a perfect viewe of the enemies lodging,
wherein alſo hee conſidered of the ſcituation of ſuch

                  <p>The next day being the 18. the enemie ſet himſelf
in battaile array, obſeruing the order that followeth.
His head was turnd toward <hi>Crenoble:</hi> on the left hand
ſtood his footemen in a round vpon alſo all hillocke

the riuer of <hi>Lizere,</hi> and betweene the riuer or the hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke
<pb facs="tcp:17099:8"/>
ſtood his horſemen in three ſquadrons, within
the medows that lie neer the Lord of <hi>Beumons</hi> houſe:
and before the ſaid horſemen ſtood ſome 40. horſe in
a field on a rowe, where they had a valley or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
that debarred our men from comming at them in
battaile aray. This order did the enemies take, becauſe
they had a farre off diſcouered the L. <hi>de Diguieres</hi>
troupes comming toward them: who being come
without two musket ſhotte of the enemy, hee cauſed
them to make a ſtand in a bottome neere the riuer,
where they were ſhadowed with trees, to the ende
they might not be diſcouered. In the meane time the
Lord of <hi>Prabant</hi> with 1500. Harquebuziers followed
the hill on the right hand in two troupes, whereof the
one kept the top, ſo to diſplace thoſe that ſtood on the
ſide, and the other marched on the lower way, ſo to
diſplace the footmen that fauoured the enemies horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
And in the meane time while the Lord of <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi>
eyther fauoured, or made ſhew of anie footemen
in the field, where the enemies gard was ſet, a troupe
of horſe which conteined not aboue twentie, being
led by the lord of <hi>Veraſſe</hi> lieutenant of the Lord of

charged their horſemen, who at the firſt comming, ſet a
reaſonable good face on the matter, and bard out the
