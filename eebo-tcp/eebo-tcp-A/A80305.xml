            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>SIrs, What's the matter? 's all the World grown mad?</l>
               <l>Or is't our Iſle alone, that with this ſad</l>

               <l>Who (Thanks to Heaven) yet does fill the Throne,</l>

               <l>And other Prayers be heard, who daily cry</l>
               <l>For Heavens Bleſſings on His Majeſty;</l>
               <l>For's long and happy Reign, and 'twould become</l>
               <l>Others to do ſo, rather than beat the Drum,</l>
               <l>And noiſe abroad their Fears, diſtract the Rout,</l>
               <l>And kindle Flames they know not to put out;</l>

               <l>Their Wits, their Actions, Pens, their Tongues and Lips,</l>
               <l>The Splendor of our Sovereign to eclipſe,</l>
               <l>By crying up the High-born Prince, his Brother,</l>
               <l>As if the World, nor we had ſuch another,</l>
               <l>When (Thanks to Heaven) we have the <hi>Elder Brother.</hi>

               <l>That take it not, or they muſt drink, or die,</l>

               <l>Our Sun ſhines bright, and's little paſt its Noon;</l>
               <l>We hope to bask ſtill in his warmer Beams,</l>

               <l>To reſt our ſelves under the quiet Shade,</l>
               <l>His happy Government for us has made.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I hate to ſee him joſtled from his Throne,</l>

               <l>That ſeek to eclipſe his Glory, drown his Name,</l>

               <l>Of <hi>James</hi> the Second, a Prince whom I admire;</l>
               <l>But ſtill Great <hi>Charles</hi> his Name muſt ſound the higher.</l>
               <l>It grieves and vexes too, ſometime to a Rage,</l>
               <l>To hear him treated, as going off the Stage,</l>
               <l>As if his Work were o're, his Race were run,</l>
               <l>And only gaz'd at, as the Setting Sun.</l>
               <l>And though he's ſprightly, ſtrong, ſound, brisk and brave,</l>
               <l>Yet they'll needs have it, he's one Foot i'th Grave.</l>
               <l>All to call off the People's Hearts and Eyes,</l>
