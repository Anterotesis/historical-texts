         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF THE

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I judge it no less
of my concernment then of
yours, to be concealed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
in this undertaking; Yet
seeing, that I do not captate
the empty praise of an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
modesty, I am resolved in liew of your <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
to the Reader</hi> and <hi>Friend to the Stationer,</hi> to
give the following Sheets this direct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
adress.</p>
            <p>And to begin with my self, as your Friend
doth with you, really I think I should have had
nothing to say of such a nothing, were it not in
opposition to that Character wherewith he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to honour you. He sayes, <hi>You are a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of extraordinary Moderation and Peaceableness;</hi>
And no doubt these qualities understood in their
due mediocrity and subordination, are of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
value: But <hi>that you can allow any difference
of opinion but such as is incompatible with the peace &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:59845:3"/>
quiet of the Chuch,</hi> is an ampliation so little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to truths preference, &amp; so inconsistent
with these Scripture intimations of Heresies and
divisions through mans corruption inseparably
attending it, that I cannot otherwise esteeme
it to be extraordinary, then as it is excessive.
If truth do allow, nay require a synathletick
zeal, which error doth no wise warrant; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
their contradictions by an easie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie,
is more agreeable to the love of
this World, then the love of God. And verily
your Friends excusing <hi>the tartness of some of your
expressions, from a zeal that he allowes against that
uncharitable Spirit, which can suffer nothing that is
not exactly of its own vvay,</hi> is not more calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
in its insinuation against us, who desire
utterly to disclaime selfe conceit in all thir
matters, then unjustly restrictive of the true
zeal of God, no less enemy to an irreligious
lukewarmness, the apparent measure of your
latitude, and the extreme now so dreadfully
prevalent, then an humorous severity so little
at present to be apprehended. But let all who
desire to be found of a true Christian temper
seek first the Kingdome of God, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and as his peace and the love of the
Brethren cannot be wanting, so the quiet of the
Church is best submitted to his good pleasure.</p>
            <p>For the occasion of my writing, the account
<pb facs="tcp:59845:3"/>
which your Friend gives of the occasion of
yours doth equally justifie it. The <hi>English Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi>
please you, and I assure you, both they
and their answer are displeasing to me. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
not upon the method of <hi>Dialogues;</hi> Nay I
am so far from censuring it, though I relish it
not in thir matters, that I am confident, that
had you and your <hi>English</hi> pattern managed it sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerily,
it had proven the ruine, and not the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of your design. But finding the English
man so insolently scornful, as not to rest satisfied
with an answere, which by taking sanctuary in
the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Indemnity,</hi> &amp; other such fearful &amp; faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shifts, did rather bewray, then vindicat the
commoun cause, and perceiving, by your little
essay, <hi>the humors of the unquiet Spirit in both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
(as you are pleased to speak evill of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse
of such who run not with you to the
same excess of ungodlinesse) <hi>not to be more the
same,</hi> then it is the same strange Spirit of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
and irreligion that at present abounds so
much in these Lands, to the perverting of both
truth and righteousnesse, I was moved by these
considerations to make you this free and round
reply. Your Friend sayes, <hi>you designed not vanity by
your few</hi> sheets, <hi>written almost as hastily as they could
be transcribed:</hi> And the truth is, I am so much
convinced of it, that I am more enclined to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologize
for the seriousnesse that I have used in
<pb facs="tcp:59845:4"/>
confuting such a trifling bable, then to purge
my endeavours of any such suspicion. Only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he saith, <hi>You wish that every one may see the
weakness of these grounds upon which such specious stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
are built, which, when they come to be examined,
prove but painted sepulchers,</hi> I thought it worth my
paines, by clear descriptions, &amp; firme demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
both of the solidity of the foundations, and
beauty of the superstructure of the work of God,
to check the tumor of this insinuat boasting.</p>
            <p>But in the next place, we have your great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
in your small Book, and it is, <hi>To let some
well-meaning People, who have a love, to godlinesse,
see that</hi> Religion <hi>is not at all concerned in things
wherein they do concern themselves very much, and
that in contending for the</hi> shell, <hi>we are like to lose
the</hi> Kernel <hi>of</hi> Religion. Why herein is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
thing, if I may use the blind mans words,
since I think you would almost have me to lose
that sight which he had then lately received,
while the things wherein we did concerne our
selves were sincerily owned and improven, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
flourished, holinesse was in request, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanity
was ashamed, &amp; iniquity stopt its mouth;
and since by you and your partakers, they were
subverted and decried, wickednesse only hath
exalted it selfe, and its blasphemous Impieties
and violences have abounded, to the very hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of every ingenuous man: And yet we must
<pb facs="tcp:59845:4"/>
believe that Religion is not at all concerned in
the change. And your Friend doth attribute to
you the confidence, not only to write, but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
your writing <hi>to well-meaning People, Lovers
of godlinesse.</hi> For this effect, I shall not antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
my performance in the ensuing answer;
only, as I have singly aimed at the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord's faithful remnant in this hour
of great &amp; manifold temptations; so I am hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that eternal life, and the meanes thereof,
the Gospel and its Ordinances, shall never be
so divided in this Land, as to separate the things
that they and I do contend for, from Religions
real and true interest: Your Friend sayes, <hi>They
are but the</hi> shell, <hi>and not the</hi> Kernel <hi>of</hi> Religion.
And if I may presse his lame similitudes, I
would enquire, whither he call's them so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their use for conservation, or their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity
when broken off? And though it be
manifest, that this later sense can only warrand
his undervalue, and is indeed a proper allusion
for such who have not stood to devoure that
which is holy, and after vowes to make enquirie;
Yet I am assured, that unto his second thoughts
its absurdity will appear so palpable, as by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him to the first meaning, it will constrain
him rather to contradict his asserting of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
inconcernment in these matters, being the
special means of its preservation, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely
<pb facs="tcp:59845:5"/>
to despise them as rejectaneous trifles.</p>
            <p>The language and manner of my writing is
such, as I conceived to be most proper for my
purpose; if the prosecution of your particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
specially in an essay, pretended indeed to
be equally managed, but without question un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally
designed, for the parties therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
prove irksome and tedious to others,
as it hath been to my self, I have no Apologie,
but the necessity of a full reply, aswel to deliver
the true Non-Conformist from your disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
imposings, as to refute your Conformist's
Objections. As for other matters, I referr all to
the Reader. There is one thing only I would
intreat, and that is, that if in the perusal of what
I have written, you do find any thing that may
move you again to take up your pen, you would
not imploy it in any further continuation of this
dramatick way of scribling: But seeing truth's
interest is that which both of us ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
let the differences in controversie be fairly
stated, propositions clearly drawn forth, and
by you either defended or impugned, according
to the exigence of your cause, and I promise
you either my assent, or the reasons of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
without passion or partiality. Now as to
your language and manner of writing, your
Friend sayes, <hi>It is accommodated to these meaner
capacities, who are most apt to be abused, by such as
<pb facs="tcp:59845:5"/>
care not, nay, which is very sad, but too true, wish
not</hi> Religion <hi>nor godlinesse to prosper in the hands of
those who differ from them in opinion about external
things, which are not of great moment.</hi> Sir, this
is a charge of too high an import to be let flye at
randome. There are, I confesse, amongst us,
who do apprehend, that both the opinions and
practices of you and your Associats do directly
tend to the debauching of Conscience, by the
false pretences and undue extensions of Civil
Obedience and Allegeance, the perverting and
destroying of Gospel Ordinances, not only of
Church-government and a sent Ministry, but
even of the two Sacraments, by turning their
divine institution into ecclesiastick custome,
and lastly, to the subverting of the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Justification through faith in Jesus Christ,
by the superadding of our own to his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and who therefore justly fearing that your
colouring and covering of these most momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
points, as if different opinions about things
externall were all the controversie, to be only
a turning of things upside down, and a seeking
deep to hide your Counsel from the Lord, do
wish that the Lords people may bewar of such
deceivers, specially, seeing their universal
perjury and intrusion, their common profanity
and ordinary insufficiency, are obvious to all
men: But that there are any of us, who care
<pb facs="tcp:59845:6"/>
not, nay, wish not <hi>Religion</hi> to prosper, even
in the manner here represented, is not more
groundlesse, then it is most certain, that the
prospering of Religion and godlinesse would be
the most effectual mean both to ruine your
course, and establish what me maintain.</p>
            <p>But let us hear how your Friend makes out his
accusation; and he saith, <hi>it may appear from their
perswading poor souls to take for a mark of zeal that
which in all christian</hi> Nations <hi>is lookt on as a very
great mark of impiety, to wit,</hi> not going to Church.
A mighty conviction, and worthy to be write in
greater letters. But where did he learn, that
<hi>not going to Church,</hi> in the meaning only perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to his reflection, <hi>viz,</hi> our not going to the
house appointed indeed for publick divine
worship, but invaded and usurped by perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Intruders, for the most part, as palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
wicked and naughty as their intrusion is
undeniable, is lookt on in all Christian <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
as a great mark of impiety? Or how will
he make it out, that we perswade <hi>not going to
Church,</hi> that is, to the assembling of our selves
together for the more solemn worship and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God, and hearing of our lawful Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
though in corners, as God gives oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
which is most certainly all whereunto
Christianity doth oblidge? Let him prove
either, and then let him boast himself: But
<pb facs="tcp:59845:6"/>
seeing either of these demands must of necessity
sinke him into perpetual silence, how foolishly
doth he second his allegeances? He subjoynes,
<hi>that you mean no prejudice to any person in writing of
it</hi> (viz.) your DIALOGUES, <hi>&amp; that it is only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
to informe sincere people.</hi> Whither it be so
or not, let the work bear witness; As for my
intention in answering, I have already declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, and I hope the answer it selfe will not
contradict, I wish indeed it had been more ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous:
But as I affect not <hi>hasty productions,</hi> so
there are many other reasons, easily supposible
for the delay: If it may give any light for
establishment in this evil time, I know it is
not yet unseasonable: And in this single and
earnest desire, I recommend it to all that love
our righteous Cause, and wait for the Lords
appearance.</p>

that your <hi>modest

to me, to be rather a phantas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
rancountre of
a mocking Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
and a Mock-Non-conformist,
it is not from any
design to preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy,
by so severe
a character; but only to releeve both you and my self,
of the fruitless observation, and tedious prosecution of
the many impertinencies incident to such a practice:
and therefore, as you are not to expect my particular
noticing of the high pretensions, weak replyes, faint
cedings, ridiculous evasions, plain concessions and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
insinuations, whereunto you prompt your Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet-non-conformist,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59845:10"/>
either for your own advantage, or
diversion; so, in the tracing of these things that seeme
to be more serious and important, in your Dialogues,
I promise you all the candor and calmness whereof I
am capable: Yea, though your <hi>double dealing</hi> in this
cause (which not content to impugne as a Conformist,
you go about also as a Non-conformist to betray)
might well warrant a more sharpe and large animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
both upon your end and method; yet, being
only desirous of truths vindication, and in the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of so many temptations justly jealous of my own
infirmitie, I do here francklie cease from, and lay
aside all wrath and bitterness, that I sin not; and shall,
as sincerely &amp; distinctly as I can, review and answere
your reasonings, as they ly.</p>
            <p>Before you fall to your direct accusations, you sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
1. <hi>That the Non-conformists do boast of their way as
the Glory. 2. That, their Ministers tell them only of Christs
death, which is not to preach him. 3. That they study more
to convince them of the need of Christs Righteousness, then
of having an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they may quite the Communion of the Church, if, in their
opinion, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the truth, in every point. 5. That in former
times they repressed some sins, specially of the flesh, but
scarcely in a Gospel way: and as for other sins, were very
gentle to them; Nay were themselves guiltie of them.</hi> Sir,
were I not very loath to irritate you in the entrie, I
would tell you, that to commence your conference,
with such groundless, odious and incoherent hints,
which you dare not positively affirme, is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to a design of prejudice, then to the charitie you
so amply professe. But to particulars, &amp; to the <hi>first,
that the Non-conformists do boast of their way as the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
1. We bless our God our Glory, who hath made
all the manifestations and means of his Grace Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59845:10"/>
these are the overflowings of the excellent Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by the streames whereof all our gloryings and
praises ought to be carried back to, concentred in, and
swallowed up of the Ocean-fountain, whence they
proceed. 2. The Scripture is plain, that Jesus Christ
the Prince of Glorie, in the revelation of his Glorious
Gospel, hath made the ministration thereof so farre to
exceed in Glory, that, even he himself accounteth the
Messengers thereof his Glory. Whether these things
be not sufficient to justifie both the Non-conformists
boasting and regrete, needeth not my assertion. Sure I
am, if a pure Ministrie, not modelled by the policy
and pride of man, but singly squared to our Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
if able Ministers of the New Testament
declaring all the Counsel of God, and imparting the
fulness of the blessing of the Gospel; And lastly, if the
growing and Multiplying of the word of God, and his
peoples desire after, and rejoicing in it, have any lustre
of this Glory, the present sad catastrophe, whereby all
these have been so wickedly and wofully changed to
their contraries, may more justly move every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
&amp; serious soul to a lamentation for the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
glory, then these occasions that first produced that
complaint. If you judge these to be <hi>swelling words of
vanitie,</hi> remember that, as I do speak the true Non-conformist,
so it is your part, by this your conference
more solidly to redargue him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> thing you suggest, is, <hi>that the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Ministers tell us only of Christs death which
is not to preach Christ.</hi> Sir, this allegeance, short as
it is, presents it self with a disgust, that I can scarce
express; Not that I think the Non-conformists are
thereby in the least noted: Nay, on the contrarie, I am
confident that, in whatsoever sense you are able to
render the accusation pertinent, the Non-conformists
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59845:11"/>
are most free to deny it, and that with the universall
evidence of all their unprejudicate hearers, and the
unanimous testimony of all their confessions and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
extant: And whether this be more to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
or your dishonour, I hope you will consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
But that which in my heart I detest, is to hear
the glorious subject of the precious death of Christ so
both slighted, and narrowed within its Scriptural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
by such a <hi>Cold restrictive.</hi> If the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> desired to know nothing but Christ and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
and Gloryed only in <hi>his Cross,</hi> If the death of
Christ doth necessarily suppose; and did certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
his preceeding Testament; nay, if in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
it be often mentioned, as the substance and root
of all, had you no fitter words for your intended ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of N. C. then that they tell us only of Christs
death? I know your meaning <hi>viz. That to tell peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
onely of an interest in Christ, while they are
strangers to his Laws and Gospel, is to deceive them,</hi>
is as sound, as it is untruly charged upon the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists.
Neither would I have taxed an innocent
lapse in the phrase observed; but its too visible tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to the discredite of the doctrine of Justification by
the bloud of Christ, and to the new rationall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of more exalting our righteousness, to an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
with his merit, then pressing it in Conformity
to his life and love, is the cause of my aversion. The
Non-conformists therefore do indeed tell us of the
death of our Lord Jesus, not with your ill appropriat
and restringent <hi>only;</hi> but do preach to us alwayes and
principally this doctrine of his <hi>Cross,</hi> as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
both the great mean of our reconciliation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and
the strongest motive, best pattern, and most certain
assurance of our dying unto sin and living unto God
(wherein our Sanctification consists) are held forth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59845:11"/>3. You say, <hi>that you feare the Non-conformists do
study more to convince us of the need of Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
then of having any of our own.</hi> 'Tis answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
this your suggestion is a great confirmation of
my reflection on your last passage: I have already
shewed, that the fear whereby you usher it in, hath
no reall nor palpable ground, none were more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
sound and powerful, in the pressing of holiness,
then the men you would accuse: Neither do I stand to
appeal to the fruites of their Ministery, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your cavilling at our practice; but I have a
greater fear of your fear, that it prove only proud
reason, spurning at the righteousnes of Jesus Christ,
and aspiring to adde a <hi>Mantissa, an addition of your
own,</hi> to his sole purchase: If I could conceive you a
man to propose feares, both groundless and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
I might be judged uncharitable; but the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the first, by removing the second, too plainly
justifies my apprehension: beside your fear is so soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
for your own righteousnes, that it doth not so
much as allow the righteousness of Jesus Christ to be
more pressed; and yet you know that not only his
righteousnes, as being the price, spring and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of ours, doth therefore acclaime an infinite
preference, but that the conviction of its necessity,
by reason of the untoward reluctancie of the pride of
reason, and blindness of unbeleefe, doth require a
more powerful perswasion. And therefore I must again
tell you that I almost suspect your insinuation of a very
deep tincture of a greater <hi>Sophistrie</hi> then that which
you give warning against; but seing you do profess
to beleeve that <hi>Christ came to lay down his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
for our sins:</hi> and Non-conformists are perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that <hi>without holiness we shall never see the face
of God,</hi> it is certainly the better part for me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59845:12"/>
your good agr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ement: Only that you may be
assured of this necessarie holinesse, and also of its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
see that you hold fast Jesus Christ as the
sole foundation; for he it is who of God is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us Wisdom, and Righteousnes, and Sanctification,
and Redemption. And remember, that although
Non-conformists love not to talk much of their own
righteousnesse, at best both freely bestowed, and, as
in us <hi>Viatores, while we are in the way,</hi> such, as of it
self, can no wayes endure the consuming fire of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
jealousie; yet they not only subscribe to your
necessity of holinesse, but further do beleeve with
joy, that it is impossible for any man to lean truely
and entirely unto Christ, who doth not imbrace him,
and have him both his Red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emer, Lawgiver and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier.</p>
            <p>4. You suggest, <hi>that Non-conformists think, they
may quite the communion of the Church, If, in their
opinion, nor in the truth, in every point:</hi> at least
you will have this to be the case, betwixt you and
your Non-conformist. Really might it not offend
your reverence, I would remit you to <hi>Eph,</hi> 4. 25.
and abide the reproof of the 26. without more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
but, because 'tis like the sottishnesse of the person
you confer with, hath induced you to this mistake,
beleeve me in name of all true Non-conformists, that
as they do not think they may quite the Communion
of the Church, if in their opinion, not in the truth,
unless the difference be both reall, &amp; in profession &amp;
practice; so it is not every reall difference, in profession
or practice, that they hold to be a sufficient cause;
Nor do they judge that, even the cause being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
the separation should be alwayes carried to the
extremity; but the sound and clear rule which they
propose for Christian practice in this matter is, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59845:12"/>
where the controverted difference is such, as would
render a conjunction therein either sinful or conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
then a just and proportionat sepa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
and with all tenderness, Commensurate to the
exigence, is the safer course. As for your conceit,
stating the cause of Separation, upon difference of
<hi>opinion, in a truth of greater importance then the article
of our faith, the Catholick Church, the communion
of Saints;</hi> the examining of it, by what I have said,
plainly discovers both its mistake and ambiguitie.
In the next place let me tell you in behalf of honest
Non-conformists, that the true reason of their present
withdrawing is none other then what you allow:
That they account themselves bound to obey God, in
adhering to their true Pastors, and disowning Intrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-hirelings,
rather then man commanding the
contraire. I will not digress to a more particular inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
since you are pleased to carry your Non confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
by it: but if you had made him give this answer
together with a clear condescendence, I doubt not
but either he or I had made it out: I might here take
notice how smoothly and perswadedly you suppose,
that Non-conformists do separate from the Church,
although they for the most part think your conceiting
your partie to be the Church, no better founded then
the rest of your usurpations, but because this point
will againe occurre I proceed to your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hint, that
<hi>in former times Non-conformists repressed some sins
specially these of the flesh, but fc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rce in a Gospel way,
and for other sins, were very gentle to them, nay, were
themselves guiltie of them.</hi> Sir, your suggestion being
so general and groundless, I only wish that its latter
part were as void of malice, as its former is farre
from truth: I know that all men are sinners, and
heartily desire that all Non-conformists may be serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59845:13"/>
warned, throughly and impartially to search,
and examine their wayes, and unfainedly to repent of
their transgressions. Nay, though the <hi>frequencie and
high import</hi> of your generall accusations render <hi>the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
of your meeknes,</hi> in forbearing particulars, many
wayes suspected; yet I urge it not: Only remember,
that as I disown the Patrocinie, either of mens fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
or infirmities, so I do as little hold the work of
God chargeable with any such extrinsick and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
objections, but <hi>should thy impudence make men hold
their peace, and when thou mockest shall no man make
thee ashamed,</hi> When you offered to reflect upon the
infirmities and failings of former times, might not,
and should not, the present irreligion and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
every were abounding, which are not only
connived at by your Church-men, but do visibly go
forth from them into all the Land (for <hi>they commit
lewdnesse and walk in lies, they strengthen also the hands
of evil doers, that none doth returne from his wickednesse</hi>)
have confounded you unto silence? Certainly this
your procedour cannot but suggest to all sober men,
that too applicable passage of the Gospel, <hi>And why
beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou
hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and
then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, Sir, I am arrived at your plain and set im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnation
of the N. C. courses: And to begin the
matter, you make your N. C. in place of a solid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the truth controverted, rap out an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested
heap of Pompous titles, and, by this perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
blustering, you take the occasion, very kindly
to commend your own personall modestie: whether
this be not more invidious then ingenuous dealing let
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59845:13"/>
others judge; certainly if you had used that candor
which you professe, your N. C. would have told
you, that the work of God we desire to own, is that
inlightning grace, and assisting presence of God,
whereby, after that the Lord had caused his people to
receive the truth in its power, he mightly stirred
them up, and inabled them to resist the growing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and shake off the heavie yoke of wicked
Prelacie; to restore and establish his ordinances, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Ministerie, and Government of his Church,
in puritie; to maintain and defend the same against
the violence of Adversaries; and to direct all these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
and attainments to the advancement of our
Lords Kingdom, over the hearts and consciences of
men, and the prospering of his pleasure in these
Lands, and that by such righteous means and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
as are clearly warranted and approven, by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Reason and many uncontroverted precedents:
This is the truth your Non-conformist ought to have
witnessed, not more confirmed by the publick writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and actings of these times, then indelebly sealed
in the hearts, and by the experiences of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of the seekers of God; but seing I am astricted to
follow you, I returne to your objections.</p>
            <p>And <hi>first,</hi> you say, <hi>Rebellion was the Soul of our whole
work, &amp; our Covenant a Bond to cement us in it,</hi> &amp;, in an
excess of faire dealing, not questioning the particular
merit of the hypothese of our cause, you demand one
place in both the Testaments, warranting Subjects their
fighting for Religion, &amp; say plainly you can bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
against it. Sir, if you had thought it convenient, I
judge it was proper for you, to disprove, from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Subjects their fighting for Religion, &amp; not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
your Non-conformist to prove it, for seing you
know that <hi>quae sunt juris permissivi, such things as law and</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59845:14"/>
right permit, if not prohibited, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be permitted, any N. C. by an undeniable
subsumption may easily evert your argument. If a
miserable Melancholian, falling in disgust with certain
necessary means of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, should affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to use them, because he finds not one place in
either Testaments expresly warranting it, would
you account his reasoning conclusive? I am confident
you would not: wherefore then do you urge us with
his dreams? Now your negative objection a <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monio
negato, from a negative Testimonie,</hi> as they say,
being such a notorious fallacie, I need say nothing to
what you adde of the Scriptures silence, of the Jews &amp;
Israelites their not rising up against their apostat idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Princes, much less can their omitting what they
might and ought to have done be of any import. If
you could bring an example from Scripture of a King
polluting the Sanctuary, and the people offering to
oppose him, restrained either by rational perswasion,
or the Lords plain prohibition, that only were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to your purpose. But you say, <hi>The faithfull
Prophets their not exhorting to popular Reformation,
or resisting Princes, doth evidently show that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of it was no sin.</hi> 'Tis answered, to make
this argument better then your last, it is not enough
to alleage, that the Prophets did not provock to such
courses, unless you adde, that they did industriously
forbear so to do, even in its season. You know so
well the necessity and beautie of tide and season to
every purpose and work, that your inconsideratnesse
in this point is scarcely excusable. The Scripture
tells us most frequently of the perversnesse and bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that peoples heart to Idolatrie and Rebellion
against God; And no doubt in publick defections
they were either the Kings entisers, as <hi>Hos,</hi> 7. 3. or did
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59845:14"/>
willingly walk after the Commandment. <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 11.
What wonder then if the Prophets did forbear to ply
them with any such expresse exhortation, let be,
that you should account their simple <hi>omission,</hi> as you
love to speak, or rather the Scriptures silence in the
thing, of any force: And here I cannot but note the
unequall dealing of the men of your perswasion, who
notwithstanding of their clamorous arguings from
the silence of the Prophets, against Subjects their tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Armes; Yet, when, in the case of the ten Tribes
their falling away from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for Rebellion; by others justified as warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
they are pressed, not with a bare negative si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which is all that you object, but with a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of reproof, circumstantiat with all that could
render it significant, they wave it as of no strength.
But lest you should think me too rigid, in insisting
only against your methods, I proceed to give you,
though not obliged, a positive return to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and to shew you some of the positive war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
that I finde in Sripture, for Subjects their sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for Religion, and although, as doubtful of the
old Testament, you seem to alleviat its testimony by
terming its dispensation more carnall and fierie; yet,
I hope, you are perswaded, that change of dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
doth no wayes alter the truth and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> ground therefore which I take from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is, from the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> where I finde the
keeping of the Lords Covenant not only injoined to
the People of Israel, as one body incorporat, under
the highest perswasives, and strongest Sanctions that
can be conceived, and established to be their supreme
Law; but also its vindication and execution recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them, in such a manner as doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59845:15"/>
evince, that it was the constant dutie of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
amongst them, all other regards set aside, even
by force, to have asserted and maintained it: <hi>If salus
populi, the safety of the people,</hi> under the interpretative
notion and force of <hi>Suprema Lex,</hi> Soveraigne Law,
have in all just exigences, in all ages, amongst all
Nations, licensed and warranted a defensive resistance
and controll against their King and Rulers, can Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
infinitly preferable in it self, and confirmed by
such an expresse Law, be thought destitute of this
prerogative? It is in vain to alleage a disparitie from
the inconsistencie of carnall weapons with the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality
of Religion, this is already obviat by the Lords
own determination <hi>Deut</hi> 13. 12. If Israel was to
animadvert with the sword against any city turning
aside to Idolatrie, can we doubt that it was lawful for
them, in the same manner, to defend the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
Do not recurre and say it was certainly law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in many cases, but not against the Prince? For, if
you allow Religion this weapon, I have already prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
its right and privilege, by a higher title, and
clearer evidence, then any other received cause of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
can pretend to: But if you utterly disallow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
armes against the Powers, you destroy Nature,
deny Reason, contradict Scripture, pervert the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
of Laws, preferre midses to their end, and
repugne to the unanimous consent of all Nations, as you
may elswhere understand.</p>
            <p>The next ground I alleage, is from <hi>Deut. 17. vers</hi>
18. 19. Where you have the Law of the Kingdome
delivered and committed to the people, and in it an
express provision, that the King to be set up, should
keep all the words of this Law; and these statutes to
do them: whence I inferre, that, as the delivering
of the Law to the people doth undeniably import,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59845:15"/>
that they were to be its keepers and exactors; so the
Prince his deportment, in conformity to this part
of it, did in such manner belong to their cognition
and oversight, as he could not, <hi>impunè,</hi> without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of punishment, mal-verse, much less subvert Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and persecute its true Professors without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol.
The only difficulty in this argument is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the tuition and custodie of this Law be, by its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse,
intrusted to the people? I may not stand upon
long elucidations, but if you consider 1. That
there is not an jota of the Law of God in vain. 2. That
this directing of the Law to the people can have no
other signification. And 3. That both the continued
tenor of the words, and the just Analogie of reason,
must make the oversight appertain to them, to whom
the election, and setting up is so expressely given,
your hesitation, if prevalent, can only appeare ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie.</p>
            <p>3. As the frequencie or infrequencie of instances
doth wholly depend upon matter of fact; so one clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found in Scripture, I know, will be to you as a
a thousand: I shall therefore content my self with the
case and practice of <hi>Libnah.</hi> This citie being a citie
of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and also of Priests, <hi>Ios.</hi> 21. 13. in the
reign of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> a wicked and idolatrous Prince,
and one who compelled <hi>Iudah</hi> to the like abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
revolted from under his hand, <hi>because he had
forsaken the Lord God of his fathers.</hi> Say not as the
<hi>Surv.</hi> of N. profanely alleageth, that this was a
citie of Priests seditiously inclined, or that the revolt
was only providentiall, like to that of <hi>Edom,</hi> and
not lawful, by-reason of the Kings apostasie. If you
but read the Text, bearing that <hi>Edoms</hi> revolt was
from under the hand of Judah, without any motive
annexed; And then, in a distinct Period, mentioning
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59845:16"/>
               <hi>Libnahs</hi> to have been from under <hi>Iehoram's</hi> hand, (<hi>not
Iudahs,</hi> intimating plainly their resistance to an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Tyranne, without any Apostasie from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
which <hi>Edom</hi> did make) and because he
had forsaken the Lord, you will discover both his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere
handling of Scripture, and the clear evidence
of this passage, specially if you remember, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
under better Kings, we find <hi>Libnah</hi> returned to
her subjection, and affoorded a wife to good <hi>Iosiah.</hi>
If it were needfull to superadde more examples, I
might adde another Scripture, 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 25. 27. Where
you may read how after that <hi>Amaziah did turne away
from following the Lord,</hi> they made a conspiracie against
him in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and he fled to <hi>Lachish:</hi> but they
sent to <hi>Lachish</hi> after him, and treated him more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
then I love to mention: and really were not
this storie too tragicall for me to dip in, the justice of
the cause, the generality of the concurrence, and the
impunitie of the actors, specially adverting to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of this case from that of the Fathers <hi>exit,</hi> may
be so evidently held out from Scripture, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of my assertion, that any reply, which you
could make from the application of a dubious word,
<hi>Conspiracie,</hi> would prove a poor reliefe. With these
might also be remembred King <hi>Vzziah's</hi> elevation in a
pretended Supremacie, and his invasive attempt of the
Priests office, with the noble resistance made by <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi>
and the <hi>fourscore valiant Priests, who went in after
and withstood him.</hi> 'Tis true it broke out into force
upon a second occasion, which I think I cannot so fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
urge, yet if you consider their number, character,
and peremptorie manner of speech, so particularly not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Spirit of God, I doubt not but you will
grant that the same force was very agreeable to, if not

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59845:16"/>4. Though I have already told you, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
their not provoking unto popular Reformations
is no argument for you, unless you could represent
their om<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>on in an opportune season, as well as a
clear exigent, yet now I further adde, that the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
exhortations made by the Prophets to both
King and People, as, in the first place, they have a
respect to every ones proper station, so, by reason of
their principal intendment of the great end, to which
all Politick degrees and their order are subordinate
and do referre, in the deficiencie or perversion of
the more immediate midses, they must of necessity
lay a subsidiary obligation upon the people, as succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous,
in that exigence. If the nature of this discourse
did allow me to inlarge, I could confirme this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
1. From Nature, which, in the perturbation
of its established harmonic, forcing things, for the
good of the whole, contraire to their proper tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
exhibite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a clear emblem of these vicarious assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances.
2. From things rationall, wherein the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valencie
of the end, and its obligation, doth alwayes
overrule the order and regard of the midses, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
subserviencie. 3. From the received acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of a twofold calling, appertaining to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, one Generall, flowing immediatly from the
end, and exerting it self in extraordinarie emergents:
another Particular, aranging to a certain fixed sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the regular course of ordinarie events.
4. From the approven instances of many extraordinarie
stretches, in the case either of our own, or others
their unforeseen, and imminent dangers, specially
from that most apposite example of the noble effort
of <hi>Sauls</hi> Souldiers in rescueing <hi>Ionathan</hi> from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
unreasonable violence, without the least impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a transgression. 5. From this plain supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59845:17"/>
A certain King commands a bodie of Souldiers
to chose their own Generall and other Officers, and
march against one of his Provinces apostatized to
Idolatrie, severely injoining unto both Generall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and souldiers the execution of his pleasure,
under pain of death: In the expedition, the General
chosen and others with him, forgetting dutie, fall
away and joyne with the Idolaters, whereupon the
remaining part of the Armie, although in a sufficient
capacitie to have effectuat their Prince his Command,
yet deserte and returne, making no other pretense
then that they were not free to exceed their private
vacations, whereunto they held themselves abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
confined: Would this be sustained for a good
defence, and not rather looked upon as a cowardly,
and lasie shift, taking refuge in the words, contraire
to the certain meaning of the orders? Let any man
judge and apply. But leaving all these grounds to
your better improvement, the plain and obvious read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Scripture is my entire satisfaction: And
really when with these warnings generally made, I
also take a view of the commensurat threatnings
wherewith they are enforced, and the suiteable execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ordinarily ensuing, I almost marveile that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
connexion, adequating the guilt and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
doth not discover unto all this secondarie
obligation incumbent to the people, in its punished
and therefore sinfull, omission. I know the Soveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the most high, &amp; the nothingnesse, &amp; noughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of all flesh in his sight, will be alleaged sometime
to justify the extent, not only of his judgements, but
also of his threatnings, beyond the desert of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
expresse provocation, whereby they are occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
without the least shadow of unrighteousnesse.
But (that I may forbear lanching forth unto that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59845:17"/>
deepth) to recurre to these Mysteries, when
both the strain, and reason of the exhortation do lye
so faire for the obliga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and dread of the Lords Commandments.
Do not alledge, that to persuade this Subsidiarie call
and engagement to Popular Reformations, is not only
to put tender Consciences upon the rack, of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
scrutinie into publick affaires; but to draw them
altogether out from the inward and most important
duties of Christianitie, unto an over-curious search,
and consequently a sinistrous jealousie, of the actions
of their Rulers, of all practices the most pernicious,
both to Religion and Peace: for as at best, these are
only the pretensions of men, upon the other extreme
sunke into themselves, and wholly devoted unto their
own ease, so, the very consideration of Mans Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
as well as private capacitie, with the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted
precepts and directio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I
have already told you, that these exhortations do, in
the first place, oblige every man to procure the trust
of his own proper assignement, and you cannot be
more desirous then I am consentient, that private men
abstract from officious medling, forbear presuming
censures, and render unto their Rulers, with their
due obedience, all the honour, esteem, submission,
charitie and tendernesse, that both their high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
insuperable infirmities, and manifold tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
call for, But as these duties have their proper
limites, in matters secular, known and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all, so, I am confident, that to hold them
illimited in matters of Religion, no less privileged
and defined, by most certain and evident rules, is a
most manifest inconsequence, either of Ignorance or
Malice. Then indeed is a Kingdom truely happy;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59845:18"/>
when all, in their several Orbes, do observe their
proper motions about the same common Centre of,
the glory of God, and good of the Publick, without
any other communication then that of benigne influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and due assistances, and this though without
the reach of hope, ought not the lesse to be our wish,
and the patern of our endeavours: and therefore in
these inevitable jarrings, whereunto we are subject,
the next remedie is certainly in the applications of
Charitie, <hi>first,</hi> covering as much as is possible, then
by its gentle means of Intreatie and Counsel, curing
these disorders, that cannot be hid; but if the evil
proceed to the endangering of the whole, and all the
more moderate courses become desperate; As it were
vain, in that case, to alleage mens visible and felt
discoveries, to be curiosities and jealousies; so the
extraordinary and resolute interpositions of the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
part, is assuredly the only probable safety of the
Common-wealth. To these grounds adduced from
the Old Testament for Subjects their fighting for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Popular Reformation, I take leave to adde
one more from the Apocrypha: and that is the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Historie of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi> I need not nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the matter of fact, how the King polluted the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie,
and persecuted the poor People of the Jews
unto a conformitie with his abominations; and how
<hi>Mattathias,</hi> first resisted, then killed the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner,
with the whole sequel of these warres, all
is evident upon record. That it exactly quadrates to
the case of our Controversie, is apparent from the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
proposal. If you deny it, it is your part, and I
am sure, will prove your singular wit, to shew a
disparitie. These ordinarily objected by the men of
your opinion, are either that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was not the
Jews Lawfull King, or that the opposition was made
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59845:18"/>
in the Spirit, and under the dispensation of the Old
Testament, and is not approveable by the New. As
to the first, <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks the contraire so clear, from
the plain phrase of the Books of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Antiochus</hi> is frequently termed the King, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no further confirmation: If this do not satisfie
it may be considered that <hi>Antiochus</hi> his title to Jurie, is
not obnoxious to any particular exception, which
doth not equally implead his right to all his other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions:
for seeing the Land of Judah was first by the
Lords gift, <hi>Ier. 27. 6. 12. 16. 29. 2. Zedekiahs</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> ratified and confirmed
by the Lord, whereby the Kingdome became base,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. vers. 12. to 22. 3. By right of Conquest
upon the revolt, <hi>Ier.</hi> 39. and 4. by <hi>Cyrus</hi> his resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
restoring the jews to their own Land, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Laws, but only with a provinciat liberty,
as <hi>Ezek:</hi> had prophesied, and is most apparent from
the Books of <hi>Ezrah</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> unquestionably
an annexed part of the Babylonish Monarchie, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioc
hus</hi> his clame to it and his whole Realme, is evident
by the same; Nay though you could prove him an
Usurper of the principal Monarchie, as you cannot,
the violence of the first Conquest, being by long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
and a faire succession wholly purged; yet
you must remember, that, that would not al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er the
condition of the dependent Provinces, nor render the
Usurpers right, as it respecteth them, in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betable.
Let not the Law of the Kingdom, delivered
by <hi>Moses,</hi> demurre your persuasion: it excludes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a Forrainer from the Peoples free Election, but
doth no way limite the disposition of Divine Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity.
As to the second objection made, <hi>that the
resistance of the Maccabees was Old Testamentaire,
and now antiquate,</hi> seeing it hath no contingence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59845:19"/>
with the nature, or reason of the things innovate
by that change, you cannot alledge it, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
warrant, which notwithstanding <hi>Grotius</hi> his
attempt, is yet undiscovered. What your invention
will further adde against this passage, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.
I know you think it marvellous dealing in
your N. C. to tell you of the Law of Nature, aud
possibly may call it <hi>Monstruous</hi> for me to use the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha:
But not to trifle, either with your quiblings,
or the respect that your Prelatick Church beareth to
these Books, when I consider, that the Historie of
these worthies, is not only honourably pointed at
by the Prophesie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> cap. 11. 32. 33. But also
appeares to be with applause commemorat by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to the <hi>Heb.</hi> chap. 11. 33, 34. I look upon it as an
Argument, not more strongly founded in Reason, then
firmly established by the unite Testimony of both Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments.
Here I might take notice of what you say
of the New Testament, viz. <hi>that its whole strain runs
upon suffering:</hi> but seeing your insinuation is General
and inconcludent, and that afterward, you do more
particularly object from it, I proceed.</p>
            <p>Having thus at some length supplied your N. C.
omission, in the next place I come to the Argument
where with you furnish him, viz. <hi>That the law of Nature
teacheth us to defend our selves, &amp; therefore there is no need
of expresse Scripture for it:</hi> In Answere to this, having
broke your j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ast, You begin very Magisterially with
your N. C. &amp; tell him, that he is a <hi>stranger to the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
of Religion, which is to mortifie Nature; that it is a
thing Super natural, that the Scriptures are strangely contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
ever telling us of suffering, without the exception of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
if in a capacitie; you appeal to Conscience if either
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighting, which a carnal man may do, or suffering,
which he cannot do, be the likelier way to advance Religion?</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59845:19"/>
whence you conclude; <hi>That it is not to be defended or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
by rules borrowed from Nature, but from Grace.</hi> Fye
upon you M. Conformist, where is ingenuitie? Your
N. C. sayes that Nature teaches us, <hi>To defend against
injuries,</hi> though inflicted for Religion, &amp; you tell him
that <hi>Religions desig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> is to mortifie Nature,</hi> &amp; that <hi>it is
not to be defended or advanced by natures rules.</hi> Is not
this <hi>strangely contrived</hi> reasoning? The N. C. is as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
as you are, that <hi>the Grace of God bringing
Salvation, hath appeared unto all, teaching us to
deny ungodlinesse and wordly lusts,</hi> and so to mortifie
corrupt Nature; but doth it therefore contradict pure
Natures light; or warrant us to destroy our selves?
If any private Person should injuriously impose upon
and invade another for Religions sake, were it not
lawful for the Person thus injured to defend himself?
Or were this contraire to the designe and nature of
Religion? you cannot say it.</p>
            <p>I know the Magistrat invested with authority, is
no private Person: but remember, that you now
argue from the <hi>Supernatural</hi> quality of Religion, and
not from the character of the Magistrats power: and
therefore as upon this subject I would tell you, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Magistrat, by reason of his place,
may deserve a greater (though no illimited) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
yet he hath as litle warrant for, and greater
sin in persecuting then a privat person; so in the case
in hand, it is evident, that if the mortifying designe
of Religion reject all Natures assistances, in must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
do so as well against a privat as a publick person.
And verily if this be your understanding of the <hi>designe
of Religion,</hi> you are too forward to teach others: but
what you lacke in skill, you endeavour to make out by
cunning. The N. C. asserts Natures warrant only for
defence which you perceiving Religion not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59845:20"/>
draw out a faire conclusion, not against <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
but against <hi>Defending and Advancing of Religion
by Natures rules.</hi> Sir you know so well the difference of
these two, <hi>Defending and Advancing;</hi> and that Non-conformists
are no Turks, that I wish my charitie
could hide your calumnie. Setting aside therefore this
your foisted in, <hi>Advancing,</hi> which all Non-conformists
do disown, let us hear what you adde against <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?</hi>
You say <hi>The Scriptures do ever tell us of suffering
without the exception of resistance when in a capacitie,</hi> I
grant the Scriptures do speak of many and great suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
according to the holy Counsel of God, and
frequent lot of his Saints; <hi>that all that will live godly,
must suffer persecution.</hi> They contain also many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and excellent encouragements to Patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Suffering: but that they do hold out any direct
Command to men simply to Suffer, abstracting, from
patient suffering, or the least insinuation, that,
though in a full capacitie, they should not at all resist,
which in effect doth little differ, the many passages
adduced by me in the contraire, with the advice of
Flight often given, show to be as remote from Truth,
as requisite to your inference. As for your appeal to
Conscience, <hi>Whether fighting or suffering be the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
way to advance Religion?</hi> I appeal to common
Sense, if it be pertinent to contest for that, which your
Adversarie doth not deny. The glorious power of the
grace of God, in propagating Religion by the weaknes
and sufferings of his Servants, is the great miracle of
the Gospel, and the praise of all Saints: and yet if
at any time, the Lord in pitie to his afflicted, did <hi>raise
them up a Saviour,</hi> or <hi>give them a banner for Truth,</hi> was
this blessing therefore despised, or the means of it
condemned<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God forbid. The works of the Lord are
all holy, beautifull and well consistent, and in this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59845:20"/>
the Non-conformists do experimentally joy. As to
your close of this passage, <hi>That a carnall man can fight,</hi>
wee know that spiritual men have done it also, <hi>Heb.</hi>
11. 33. And where you adde, <hi>that he cannot suffer,</hi>
it is no further my concernment, then to bid you be
more advertent, seeing you tell us in the very next
leafe, of some Murtherers <hi>that suffered gallantly,</hi>
and <hi>that the seal of a Martyrs bloud is not alwayes the seal
of God;</hi> and to ponder the native import of 1 <hi>Cor,</hi>
13. 3.</p>
            <p>Now, as if you had demonstrate the unlawfulnesse of
fighting, you still your N. C. regrate, for the neglect
and ruine of the work of God, by the Consideration
of Gods Power and Providence; and tell him, that
<hi>to defend Religion by force, is but the wrath of man;</hi>
that <hi>Religion was first propogate by suffering, whereas
fighting hath been ever fatal to it.</hi> Its answered, as it is
but to tempt and mock God and his Providence, to
neglect the means of preservation allowed by him?
So in the love of his Glory to appear for his interests
against Persecuters and Subverters, with the hasard of
all our worldly concernments, is not the sinfull and
selfish wrath of man, but the very power and zeal of
God. That Religion hath been much propagated by
suffering, is already acknowledged: but that figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
hath been ever fatal to it, is manifestly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
by the establishment of almost all the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
in <hi>Europe.</hi> But you go on and tell your N. C.
<hi>that our Lord did begin the Gospel with Suffering, when
he could have commanded Legions in his defence,</hi> and when
you have made him to mutter out, <hi>That Christ knew
it was his Fathers will,</hi> you proceed to tell, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
for his ignorance, <hi>of Christs injunction to his
Disciples, not to draw for him,</hi> and add his words to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi>
not only as an evident assurance of what you assert,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59845:21"/>
but as a manifest conviction of the coldnes of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.
Sir, such is the hight &amp; severity of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitednesse
in this place, that if the aversion I have for
all things like it, did not restrain; I should hardly
forbear to give you a humbling retaliation: But all I
desire is, that by descending a little from it, you may
be in case to receive a sober answere. That our Lord,
did not only begin, but found the Gospel upon his
most Voluntarie, free and desired, as well as comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
suffering, is a Truth so high and precious, and
justly accounted inimitable in substance, that I strange
you should debase it, by making it a part of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
when you know that Christ came into the
world, that he might freely give himself a ransome;
and that therefore he neither would be diverted, nor
use the flight which he had formerly both command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and practised, do you rationally argue, that because
he thus suffered, so ought we to do: or because he
refused his Disciples endeavours of rescue, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christians in persecution should neither give nor
admit of assistance. I grant, that if God so order it,
in suffering, we ought to imitate his patience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 21. But what maketh this for you? You insinuate,
as if his not commanding Angels to his defence, had
been a meere effect of his patience; but as this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not countenanced by the description thereof gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the Apostle in the place cited, so, I pray you
hear our Lord himself, <hi>Thinkest thou that I cannot</hi>
(which I am certain soundeth plainly <hi>May not) pray
to my Father, &amp; he shall presently give me &amp;c. but ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> then
shall the Scripture be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</hi> here
then is the reason of our Lords forbearance, presume
not to fancie another. But you say <hi>he forbad his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to draw the sword in his defence, whith a severe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59845:21"/>
sword,</hi> Take you this to be a threatning against the
Disciples? which for their comfort is so plainly spoken
against the traiterous band that came against him, upon
whom also it was most dreadfully accomplished.
Thus <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place, though in the point of
defence he be very inconsequent; if you cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it thus from the context, I desire you onely to
read it in a parallel application, <hi>Rev. 13. 10. He
that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword;
here is the Faith and Patience of the Saints?</hi> are you not
then ashamed to make it <hi>their threatning and fear?</hi>
Next you adde, that <hi>what our Lord said to Peter, my
Kingdome is not of this world, &amp;c. is so Plain language,
that you wonder it doth not convince all.</hi> If I were to
oppose confidence to confidence, I should make no
other reply, then that this is indeed so plain language,
that I wonder what Conviction you mean; but because
this is the ground of your proud and vain boasting
which you are not affrayed to seal with the veracity of
God, let us hear the words at length <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18. where
our Lord being questioned by <hi>Pilat, art thou the King
of the jews ver.</hi> 33. returnes the direct Answere. ver. 16.
thus, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world if my Kingdom
were of this world, then would my servants fight, that
I should not be delivered to the jews: but now is my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
not from hence.</hi> In which words, as he witnesseth
his Kingdom, so, to remove the jews accusation,
and <hi>Pilats</hi> jealousie, he declareth the quality of it viz.
<hi>That it is not of this world,</hi> that is, a worldly Kingdom,
to be exercised as other Kingdoms of the world are
in out ward power and splendour, and therefore can
neither interfeere with, nor diminish Caesars Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
and grandour; and this he confirmeth by a most
plain and convincing argument, <hi>If my Kingdom were
of this world then would my servants fight, that I should
not be delivered to the jews:</hi> that is, if I designed a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59845:22"/>
worldly Kingdom, I would have gathered followers;
or rather (according to the assistance mentioned by
him at his first taking) called Angels my servants, to
fight for my rescue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but since I imploy no reliefe, but
willingly give my self unto the death, <hi>now is it plain
that my Kingdome is not from hence.</hi> Thus I have set
down both the plain language, and I hope the plain
meaning of the place but whence it is that you derive
your advantage, I protest I cannot divine. If the Lord
prove his Kingdom not to be a worldly one, because
he imployed no aid for his rescue from the Jews, doth
it therefore follow, that all persecute Christians should
reject all assistance, and deliver themselves up to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
after the same example? Are you not yet satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that the <hi>manner only,</hi> and not <hi>the act of our Lords
suffering,</hi> is proposed to our imitation. Beleeve me
Sir, I have been often serious to finde out wherefore
this text is so much talked of by the men of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sion;
but unless is be that men who would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that Christs Kingdome <hi>were not in the World,</hi> do
love to hear a phrase so neer it, <hi>that it is not of the
World,</hi> or that the great Devotionaries of ease, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
adverting to the reason, and making an Emphasis
in that which is a clear speciality, would force from
the words, contraire to their plain tenour and scope,
this general Rule, <hi>that his Servants fight not, no not</hi>
(as they would read it) <hi>for his rescue.</hi> I could never
attain to a better conjecture. It comes in my thought
while a writing, that it is possible, that in reading
the words forward, you may understand them back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
As if our Lord in saying, <hi>If my Kingdom
were of this World, then would my Servants fight,</hi> had
reasoned thus; because my Kingdom is not of this
World, therefore my servants do not fight: But
seeing his Argument is evident as the Meridian Sun,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59845:22"/>
My servants do not fight for my rescue, therefore I
pretend to no worldly Kingdom, the force of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is no more clear then it is certain, that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality
of his Kingdome neither is in this place, nor
can be at all used to astrict his followers to his unimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
example, in this his free and voluntaire suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering:
But because I am resolved to constrain you to
an acknowledgement, that the Non-conf. Answeres
to your Scriptures, are neither <hi>irrational nor ridiculous</hi>
as you alledge, I shall enlarge a little more upon this
subject: Some men of your way say, that seeing
Christ doth here declare his Kingdom not to be of this
World for the clearing of <hi>Pilat</hi> and all Powers of the
Jealousies, which such a thing might raise, of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
the inconsistencie and prohibition of fighting (the
great fear of the Princes of the Earth,) must be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported:
It's answered, our Lords answere is no doubt
framed and suited to the Jews accusation, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
question; both in <hi>Pilats</hi> and in their understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was his affecting an outward Kingdom in preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and, as of this he doth unanswerably
purge himself, and, thereby fully satisfy all the just
feares that could be objected, so, to imagine that
his purpose was to remove all the false apprehensions,
and restlesse inquietudes, which only the wickednesse
and violence of Tyrannes do suggest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and thereby to
gratify Tyranny, is, both groundlesse and impious:
But to convince you plainly, that the spirituality of
Christs Kingdom doth not restrain Fighting for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
I ask you in a word, what is the reason that
the Christian world, doth not patiently stretch out
its neck to the Turkish Cruelty? Sure you are not
ignorant that the pretended cause of his invasions, hath
often been to destroy the Christian Faith: if then the
spirituality of Christs Kingdom doth altogether prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59845:23"/>
his Servants fighting, wherefore do not Christian
States and Princes lay down their Carnall defensive
weapons, and rest quietly in this, <hi>that God who governs
the world can maintain his own right, and the wrath of
man doth not work his righteousnesse,</hi> as you are pleased
to Cant to your N. C. I know the only reply you can
make, is, that the case of free Estates and Soveraigne
Princes against foreiners is very different, from that
of Subjects against their Rulers; but doth not this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discover the Sophistrie of your Method, you tell us,
<hi>first,</hi> that <hi>Subjects may not fight for Religion against
their persecuting Prince, because the spirituality of
Christs Kingdom forbids all fighting upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi>
And then when you are urged with the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertible
practice of Christian Kingdomes, you just
recurre &amp; say, that the instance not being of Subjects
against their Prince, doth not quadrat, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that this is the very <hi>quaes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>um,</hi> you make
the vain and emptie assertion of the irresistibilitie of
Princes, without any proofe, both head and tail
of all your reasonings: I may not insist to tell you, that
if the spirituality of Christs Kingdom did cause the
King of Kings, and him, who even on earth owned
himself greater then <hi>Solomon,</hi> to suffer without resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
The Soveraignity of Christian Princes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give them a contrary privilege. I know these of
your way, and many others also, carried away with
their error, forgetting both the Authority which
Christ exercised, and for which he was questioned
by the jewish Rulers, and also his own most expresse
words, <hi>no man taketh my life from me, but I lay it
down of my self. I have power to lay it down, and I
have power to take it again,</hi> stick not to make an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of subjection to the then Tyrannes &amp; Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
an ingredient in his submission: but I am tedious,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59845:23"/>
More consideration of the worth and wonderful love
of our Lord Jesus Christ, would teach you no doubt,
both a better understanding in the Truth of God, and
more reverend and tender vindications then these you
make <hi>of the True and Faithfull Witness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You proceed in the next place, upon occasion of
your. N. C. alledging that <hi>you condemne our first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
carried on by Fighting,</hi> to tell us, that <hi>the ages
immediatly after Christ afford the best examples, in these
the Christians, though suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

word of God.</hi> Sir, to begin where you leave, I
hope I have already fully cleared, that the expresse
word of God is against you, and not for you: neither
will I expatiat upon the undeniable Necessitie, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
Reason and evident blessing of that Force
used in our first Reformation, by which our Religion,
Libertie, yea the Royall line and Crown, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Nay your reprochful like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it <hi>to the devils tares,</hi> is so far from lessening
the evidence of that Spirit, which after having resisted
unto bloud, and wrestled through many great and
strong persecutions, did animate the Lords people to
a very noble defence, countenanced by all the then
Reformed Churches, that it doth not so much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murie
my charitie, that if you your self had been in
these dayes, you had taken part with the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
That which I shall stay a little upon, is the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Primitive Christians, whereby you think
fighting for Religion, to be as much condemned, as
suffering is highly commended. And because this
objection doth lead unto the delightful search and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the works of God, for answere, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59845:24"/>
               <hi>first,</hi> that as in the holy and determinate Counsel
of God, it became the Captain of our Salvation to
be made perfect through suffering, so it pleased him
for the greater manifestation of the power of his Grace
by the Foolishnesse of Preaching, and Weakeness of
Suffering, to render the propagation of his Truth more
glorious, and thus in the first times of the Gospel,
the greater the crueltie, and the more ineluctable that
the necessity of the suffering was, the more inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
was the glory of that presence and the joy of that
consolation, whereby the Church in its deepest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
did most highly triumph. 2. So unspeakeablie
did the power of this assistance prevail, to the dispel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the fear, and removing of the horrour, of all
these torments and afflictions, that many instead of
flying, incontrovertibly lawfull, did directly run to
suffering; and to a great part, the Garland of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
became a most Ambitionat Crown; by the
mistake of the exuberance of which assisting grace, not
only many odd practices in precipitating themselves
unto suffering and death, but Opinions also then held,
such as that of the unlawfulnesse of all resistance for
Christians, even against Robbers and Murtherers, can
only be excused. 3. But if the beautie and splendor
of this grace did in some measure dazle the eyes of its
more immediate witnesses, how much more did it asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
its more remote and after admirers, who receiving
the report with fames increase, and taking their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
more from their own good design, then the exact
simplicitie of truth, by their pious and affectionat Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torications,
stopt not to strain matter of fact, sometimes
beyond probabilitie. If you be a stranger to this truth,
advert how the almost immediate after Age magnifies
their Patience and Sufferings, such as <hi>veflra omnia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us,</hi>
with more then one grain of allowance.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59845:24"/>
4. As this was the dispensation of the first ages of the
Gospel, so, when the Lord advanced the Church to a
certain and visible capacity of defence, peruse Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and you will find plenty of instances of Christians
their fighting for Religion. The <hi>Armenii</hi> very early
even before <hi>Constantine</hi> his Empire, <hi>Libertatem exercen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
Christianismi Armis vindicant, Clade afficiunt Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum</hi>
as the History beares, and how the persecuted
Christians, under the Persian and Arrian, did implore
and receive the aid of the Roman and Orthodox Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
would be superfluous to narrate.</p>
            <p>By these few reflections as I have cut of from your
argument all the necessary suffering and strained capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of the Primitive Christians, so I have given you
such a full and evident account of their not searching
after, or improving sooner, any real measure of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie
for defence, which probably they did but little
minde, that this their omission cannot without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
calumnie, be adduced to disprove, either their
immediate after<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> practises, or the agreeable and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
approven examples of our late reformations. Now
if for proving their more early capacite for, or expresse
dissent from Defensive Armes, you do further urge
particular Authorities, when you have answered all my
just scruples against the former, and satisfied me in all
their other opinions in the matter of Armes, then you
shall have my Answere: but in the mean time pardon
me, if while I do indeed admire and praise the Grace
and Glory of these Primitive sufferings, I be neither
too credulous of the mistakes of men, nor do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<hi>the diversitie of the operations of the same God, which
worketh all in all,</hi> specially seeing that by the same suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
whereby you go about to impugne, he hath so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
confirmed these practises, which I do maintain.</p>
            <p>But to this last you answere, that <hi>you are far from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59845:25"/>
thinking the better of a Cause because some die handsomlie for
it: Neither Atheis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Heresies nor Murthers want their
pretended Martyres.</hi> Sir, I neither approve your too
much magnifying. <hi>pag.</hi> 7. nor your too much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing,
<hi>pag.</hi> 9. of mens sufferings: And therefore as
at best I account them only a confirming and accessory,
and not a principal and leading argument; so I must tell
you that I conceive the force of its inference to flow
from a certain lustre and insinuation of grace, which
your jejune Epithets of <hi>handsomnesse and gallantrie</hi> do
but meanly expresse; whether or not this appeared in
our late Sufferers, I wonder nothing that you deny it:
but sure I am that all the sincere lovers of the Truth,
have to their joy both acknowledged it, &amp; been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by it.</p>
            <p>After this by a transition of your own framing,
making your N. C. faintly and childishly disown and
wave bygones, whereof, to deal plainly, I do as
little fear <hi>the odium,</hi> as I account your A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ologies, taxing
them of Rebellion, to be <hi>most odious,</hi> you come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<hi>wherefore wee keep not the day of thanksgiving for the
Kings restauration?</hi> and seing you are not pleased with
your N. C. answere I will give you mine. Aud first, it
is not because <hi>you make it a holy day;</hi> I know this is as
much above your power, as your act is presumptuous
in ordaining it to be observed, and your practices are
far from keeping it <hi>as a holy day;</hi> Nor do I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the Magistrates power in appointing <hi>pro re nata</hi>
dayes of solemne thanksgiving, wherein it is more
then certain, that the apparent abuse that hath been in
institutions of this kinde, and the end and designe of
the appointment, do give the Church a very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
interest of advice. Nor lastly will I detain you in
the application of the difference of designing a day as a
Circumstance for thanksgiving to be performed on it,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59845:25"/>
and dedicating a day to be kept as Holy in Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration;
a Popish error, expressely by us abjured and
by you revived; he who desires a full clearing in this
matter, with a satisfying answere to all objections,
may find it in the <hi>English popish ceremonies;</hi> but the
great reason wherefore N. C. neither doe nor ought to
keep that day, is because you have assigned for the
cause of it, not only the mercie of the Kings returne,
but also the wicked overturning of the work of God;
and that with such a libeling preface of blasphemies
against God and his cause, and vile reproches upon the
whole Nation, that no true hearted man can read the
Act, without abhorrencie. Now before you reject
this my answere, I only desire you to peruse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Act, and I am almost certain that although
perhaps, you will not come the length of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
I have made of it, yet you will think it strange
that men accessorie to many of these Righteous things,
against which it so foully railes, should have been on
the one hand indulgently indemnifyed without any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and on the other obliged, under the
pain of losing their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ipends, to a thanksgiving, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the highest recantation. Are these wayes
equal? Think not that my indignation against this Act, is
all and only from my disaffection to your establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that is indeed one cause, sufficient to produce
a just detest; but ingenuously I have so much of true
Loyaltie to my Prince and affection to my Countrey,
that the disservice done to the King, in rendering the
celebration of that day (which in its righteous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
use might have been an acceptable &amp; kindly warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Subjects affection) a very odious provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to aversion and alienation, is to me not a more
just then powerfull incentive: but such were the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59845:26"/>
of these violent Physitians, and such have been
and will be the effects.</p>
            <p>Again, making a stepping stone of both your N. C.
and his cause, after you have made him confess disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie,
because you are not able to prove it, you hold
out his way to be evil, <hi>because of its crueltie and rigor in
forcing men to take the Covenant, and punishing such as
refused.</hi> and your N. C. granting this <hi>to be a fault also,</hi>
you charge it home very odiously against our <hi>Leaders.
as Men unacquainted with the meek spirit, and obstinat in
those severities.</hi> Its answered, whether these things
be objected or not in a meek spirit is more your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
then mine, who regard not your bitternesse
in any dresse? That which you call cruelty, if counter-ballanced
with the guilt of the recusancie, will quickly
be alleviat to moderation: If the Covenants (for I
shall touch both) pressed, had been new Oaths arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarely
imposed; there were some ground for your
challenge: but as to the first, was it not the same,
wherein the Nation stood engaged from the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
almost of the Reformation; and if after a
great and visible defection it was, upon our returning,
renewed, and with a more expresse application against
these corruptions, whereunto we had backslidden,
required to be taken by all, who could not decline
without a manifest declaration of both their unsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and insinceritie in the Oath of God? call you this
Rigor? And as to the second, the <hi>League,</hi> if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, and that sympathie wee ought to
have with all Christs sufferings Members, did persuade
it as a dutie, and if your then ejected Prelats, did by
their restlesse instigations, and the breaches of Faith,
and Hostile invasion from <hi>England</hi> thereby procured,
render it convincingly a most necessary meane, for the
preserving and prosequuting the ends of the first, was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59845:26"/>
it not both rational and righteous that they, who stood
thus obliged, by vertue of the first Covenant, to take
the Second, upon their recusance, should be proceeded
against as Deserters: And the truth is, as they were not
many that were troubled simply, for not taking the
Covenants; so there were but few, if any, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
the second, who either before were not, or
thereafter became not, directly opposite to the First;
Nor did these few refusers subsist in a quiet dissatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but for the most part turned violent and bloudy
Enemies, or at least partakers with such Adversaries,
Notwithstanding of all which perjury and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the procedour against these recusants, or rather
Apostates, was so litle adequate, either to their guilt
or number, that upon a considerate and impartiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
I am assured, all the excess that can be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
will not suffice to purge your objection of <hi>Cruelty</hi>
against the publick courses of these times, of <hi>plain
Calumnie:</hi> I say the <hi>Publick courses;</hi> for as to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
practises of private persons, although the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
inherent to the best, and the many and rapid
Temptations of times of division and wars, do offer
me large matter of Apologie; yet I doe rather wish
that the outbreakings which wee have seen, and felt,
of the Lords holy jealousie, may make both the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of his work to remember their provocations, and
tremble before this holy Lord God, who will be Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed
in them that come nigh him: And also the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of his Name to consider how much more upon
such he will be Glorifyed: But you, not content to
pervert the Righteous wayes of God, go about main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to represent his Ministers <hi>as bloudy men, rejoycing
and obstinate in bloud;</hi> certainly such a grievous and
horrid accusation ought to have been evidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed;
but since it is impossible to imagine the least
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59845:27"/>
shadow of ground for it, unlesse that sometimes his
Servants, either in the more eminent and signall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of Gods vengeance upon his bloudy and
perfidious Adversaries, have joined their praises with
Heavens Alleluiahs, for the manifestation of his
true and righteous judgements, or that when the
Lord called to punish, they have regreted an unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and partial excesse of Lenitie: Are not these
arrows, firebrands and death, which you throw in
your pretended meekness, like to the symptomes of
Madnesse?</p>
            <p>And now Sir, since you will have it so, give me leave
to manage the retortion for your N. C. You accuse
our times of <hi>cruelty,</hi> for forcing men to take the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
though in effect it was only to make them
stand to an Oath, whereby all were antecedently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged;
but have not you and many of you, such as
formerly were very forward to presse it upon others,
Now, without either reason given, or repentance
so much as pretended, been most violent to have all
men to renounce it? I will not mention the exclusion
of all Non-renouncers from Publick Trust, and the
first Arbitrary fining, and remitting or abating, upon
condition of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> Temptations not only
unjust, but no less powerful, and a hundred fold
more extensive, then all the certifications execute
upon simple Noncovenanters: the very instances by
you given shall also serve my turne: Are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
in the present Church-Government, and to
promise submission to Episcopacie, certain reductive
disclamations? And yet you cannot deny, that for
the refusing of these things many hundred, of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
have been thrust out, and in such manner vexed
and tossed with imprisonments, banishments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinements,
and proclamations upon proclamations,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59845:27"/>
that if the Lord had not provided, your mercie in
sparing their Lives, had been only the complement
of your Cruelty: Its true that Ministers are not made
to sweare to Maintain the present Establishment; but
if they be required to break a former lawful and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven
Oath, where is the disparity? As for the
People, you tell us they are desired to do nothing,
but live peaceably, and join in worship: And veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
though this were all, and though your Publick
Peace were not so perverted, as it cannot be subscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto, and your Worship so polluted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned,
as may give too just occasion of scruple, it were
easie to demonstrate, that such hath been the Rigor,
and violence of your Methods, that it is a wonder
that a hundred to one have not been thereby irritate to
more unpeaceablenesse, and greater desertion: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you have brought against us and our leaders, the
odious accusation of Bloud, although I have already
removed it; yet in pursuance of the parallel I must
further tell you, that the Bloud of the former Times,
abstracting from its justice, was in a manner the Bloud
of War i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> War: but in your Times wee have seen;
over and above its injustice, the bloud of War shed in
Peace, and that of such Persons, for such Causes, and
with such Circumstances, as time doth only increase
and not diminish its astonishment: next, the tragedie
of these poor harmlesse persons, who by your insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
insolencies and exactions were provoked to
take Armes, is yet recent. I shal not resume particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
but I am confident, their cause, their number,
their condition and their rout being considered, the
tortures and bloudy executions that ensued, not upon
the chief Actors and instruments, but upon the inferior
yea meanest of these Innocents led out to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
without choise, are hardly to be matched: what
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59845:28"/>
hand your Lords of the Clergie had in these things;
how suift their feet were to shed bloud, and how
<hi>Burnet</hi> the A. P. of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> taught the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to truss him up with a pulley, who for weaknesse
could not be otherwise execute, and the Armie Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
commanded drums to be beaten to drown the
Testimony of the Lords dying witnessess, is well
known. Nay it is more then probable that if the King
had not put a stop to that but cherie, and these op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and barbarities wherewith the <hi>West</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
aflicted, your Prelats had not given over,
until that partie had been utterly cut off, and that
whole Countrey laid desolate for their cause: I might
further tell you of your other severities, and how by
your rigid exceptions and other ensnaring Acts, not
only the intended favour of the Kings Indemnity was
corrupted; but also its very designe and effect frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trat:
But what need of many words, let the fervent

joyes of the 1660. with the many disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
grievances and exactions that ensued, togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with the present Universal coolness, dissatisfaction
and distraction, and unsetled condition of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
be considered, and impartially searched into
their proper cause, and if Prelacie be not found the
only marrer of our joy and quiet, ferment of our
distemper and moth of our Loyalty, then rejoice yee
in the Bishops, and let them also rejoyce in you: but
if thus it be, then &amp;c. Thus you have forced me to reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liat
your provocation, and I am more then wearied
of the subject.</p>
            <p>In the next place you taxe the N. C. of great hight
and insolencie, in assuming <hi>the big Names of the Godly
Partie, and the People of God, and calling their way the
cause and Kingdom of Christ.</hi> Sir if they did indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59845:28"/>
for the Ministery and Ordinances of Christ; And
that for the vindication of his Power and Government
over his Church, and the Prospering of his pleasure,
I think truely they had good right to all these names:
but that they did vainly and arrogantly use them, it
is more then you have proven, or I doe remember:
And really J am in the opinion that upon search, it
will be found, that the Titles <hi>of the People of God,</hi>
and <hi>of the Godlie Partie,</hi> were at first not so much assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the asserters of our cause, as appropriat unto
them by the reproach and mocking of their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
As for after contests (if any were) among their
own subdivisions, they were no doubt the sad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of other evils, wherewith it pleased the Lord
that his own should be tried; but if you think that
for all the competition the Titles, are still vacant, I
wish from my heart that both you and your partie may
be thereby animat to put in, and to shame and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all <hi>lowd Pretenders,</hi> by <hi>reall demerite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this you subjoin another great Article, that <hi>Our
Ministers who complained, of Bishops, their medling in
matters of State, when the scene turned, did therein absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Govern:</hi> And to this challenge you make your
N. C. returne the Popes Answere for his Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
viz: <hi>that all was done in order to Religion,</hi> on
purpose that you may make the reply, <hi>That the Pope
and Presbiterians doe much agree in Politiques.</hi> Sir, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the <hi>immodest</hi> terme of impudence and other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
peccancies against truth, where with you set
forth your <hi>Modest representing of faults,</hi> as yow are
pleased to call it. I returne shortly for answere this
clear and certain position, wherein I am sure we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
disagree viz. that as the direction of Conscience
appertains to the Pastoral charge, so the Ministers of
Gods Word ought both to advise, exhort and warne
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59845:29"/>
thereanent, according as in every occurrent, the
circumstances of the thing which make its season, do
thereto cleare their call and accesse: This truth is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in its own light: whoever owneth Conscience,
the Word of God to be its Rule, and its Ministers to
be our Teachers and Guides, cannot deny it. All the
diffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ltie is in the right performance; the exceeding
goodnesse and rare beautie of a word in season, is no
ordinary attainment; <hi>because to every purpose there is
time and judgement; therefore the miserie of Man is great
upon him.</hi> If I should ascribe the exactnesse of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
to our Ministers, I should forget them to be
Men: but as to the instances, which you alleage of
their warnings given against the Engagement 1648
and all deeds directly relating to it, And of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall
accession to a prudent exclusion, in the year
1649 of such as had proven Unfaithfull: their singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
importance as to the very summe of the work of
God, hath been so signally comprobat by after events,
that if upon the matter, you doe condemne these
practises, you in effect doe adjudge Ministers to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
silence, at least in opposition to State determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
whatever be the concernment of the Cause
of God, or good Conscience: It were superfluous
to mention the difference of Prelatick medlings, or
what are the Popes invasions: the meanest capacitie
may easily distinguish a Ministeriall advice in point of
Conscience, all, either attribute to, or assumed by
Ministers in State, or any other extrinsick affaire,
from these corrupt practises: And with the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
join Prelacie and Papacie in their common pride
and usurpation. You add a particular reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Ministers should not medle <hi>with war and matters
of bloud, because of its contrarietie to the Pastoral dutie,
which obligeth to feed and not to kill.</hi> But as none hath
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59845:29"/>
been more guiltie of this Sanguinary medling then,
these who with most ceremony would appear to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the letter of the Rule; so, considering what I
have lately touched of your Clergie, and who did
principally direct the suppression and executions of the
late Risers in Armes, I am in the opinion you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
this reflection more for your own Lords, then
our Leaders: but it is enough I agree with you fully,
that Pastors ought not to be Criminall Judges, farre
less instigators to war and bloud; yet if in these matters
you allow to Conscience any place, they are no doubt
Subjects proper both for Ministerial warning and
advice.</p>
            <p>For a conclusion of your charge, ye surprise both
your N. C. and me with a challenge of <hi>Superstition,
whereof</hi> you <hi>say wee are in many things guilty: sed quis
tulerit Gracchos de Seditione querentes.</hi> Sir yee are not
so wittie in this anticipation as yee trow; for tho ye
have taken the first word of fliting; yet the successe
is rather a foaming out your own shame, then the
fixing of that reproach upon us, which was the mark
ye yought to hit. What? Sir, did ye dream by this
device to terrifie your N. C. into a forbearance to
charge you with the guilt of Superstition? or did you
think by this artifice to vindicat your partie, and be
avenged at once on these great Worthies, who have so
manifestly laid open unto the World the Superstition
of the men of your Kidney and Gang; that though they
have travelled to <hi>Rome</hi> to fetch water to wash these
spots, and have put their invention upon the rack to
palliat them with all imaginable pretenses; yet the
shame of their Nakednesse was so unfolded by these
searching Seers, that it could never be hid. But Sir,
are ye in good earnest? or have ye been in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
lines so transported with rage in fighting against
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59845:30"/>
Defensive Armes, and wresting the sword of just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
out of the hands of poor Innocent and oppressed
Subjects, that in this paroxysme ye have forgotten to
be honest and rational at once? Did you beleeve that
you spoke truth when you represented us as such? If I
thought ye did, and continued to doe so still, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
I am so litle your enemie that I would pitie you,
as one who walketh in the darknesse of gross delusion,
and knoweth not whether he goeth, because the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath blinded his eyes. But I would gladly know
how ye make out the charge: Ye did wisely only in
one thing, to condescend upon none of these many
things, wherein you say we are guilty of <hi>Superstition,</hi>
when ye make your charge good ye will be admired
for your invention; till then, it will neither be shame
nor reproach to the N. C. to be silent, or laugh at the
audacitie of such a Novice. But to be serious with you,
Sir, if ye would not take it amisse to be Catechized
in the Chair, doe ye understand what <hi>Superstition</hi> is,
that ye call us so? Are we such to you in many things,
because in every thing we owne the Scriptures as the
Rule of Faith and manners, and assert that there is a
sufficiency in these to make wise to Salvation, and
that, without the wild mixture of humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they are able to make the man of God perfect,
thorougly furnished unto every good work? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we own no Office-bearers in the house of God,
save such as are of his own appointment? Is it because
we judge the Episcopal Hierarchie Apocryphal, and
cannot acknowledge the Prelat and his <hi>juncto</hi> for the
Courts and Officers of Jesus Christ? Is it because we
maintain that all things in the house of the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ought to be done according to the will of the God
of Heaven, and because we stand fast in the libertie
where with Christ hath made us free, and will not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59845:30"/>
suffer our selves to be imposed upon or intangled with
a Yoke of bondage? Is it because we maintain that
no power upon Earth can make things Necessary which
God hath made Indifferent, more then they can make
things, indifferent, which he hath made Necessary?
Is it because we know or will acknowledge no Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
or Lord in the house of God, beside our Lord
Jesus Christ, and are bold to put all pretenders to
produce our Masters warrant when they call for our
obedience to their Commands, as not darring to make
the will of a poor frail fallible creature the Law of
our Conscience? In a word is it because we dare not
with you homologat all the impieties of that Partie,
who have burst these holy bonds for Reformation and
Righteousnesse, wherewith together with us they had
so solemnly bound their Souls, and are now returned to
their former vomit? Is our esteem of, and adherence
to, the wayes of righteousnesse, an overrating of
things more then we ought? and are we only guilty of
Superstition because we cannot be Metamorphosed
into a detestable newtrality and Gallio like indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie
in the matters of God? Truely Sir providing
our Zeal for these things were such as our own heart
did not reproach us for a sinful short coming and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in, (as alas it is not) we could bind al your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
for what ye count excess and over-rating,
unto us as a crown, and indulge you a libertie to lay
to our charge things that we know not, and cast ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
upon us, without taking further notice of
what ye have said, then thereby to be stirred up to
pour out our complaint before God, and Pray him
that he would not hold his peace, since the mouth of
the wicked and the mouth of the deceitfull is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against us, and have spoke against us with a lying
tongue. But I know ye follow your old Leaders
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59845:31"/>
               <hi>D. Mortown, D. Burgess</hi> &amp;c. who had the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
to go before you in accusing the Brethren,
who could not be cudgelled into a complyance with,
nor cast in the mould of your Ceremonies, that you
have in following of such, who in this did not follow
the Lord fully, and had not the lamp of the word to
shine in their way: They did plead innocent, asserting
they were not guiltie of Superstition in using and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Ceremonies, but the N. C. were in refuseing.
But Sir, ye should either have had the head to have
made the insuficiencie of these great mens vindication
manifest, or not have had the fore-head to renew the
same challenge, without taking notice of their replyes
which stand unanswerable to this day: your over-rating

               </gap> the Doctors reason, such as it is, couched

why? because, forsooth, the N. C. (say they) place
a special peice of Religion in not using of these Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and teach others to abstain from using them

as the servants of men to the observation of such

bondage to the Doctrines of men about the neck of
the Conscience? 2. If this be good arguing, may not
the prophane multitude have the same plea against all
who abstain from fleshly lusts that war against the Soul?
May not these I say be prompted by your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ogick to
flout at all who run not with them to the same excess
of riot, as superstitious fools, because they place any
thing of Religion in these negatives, and suppose that
conscience is concerned in that abstinence? Hence 3.
we say that we look upon our abstaining from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with the Commands and Doctrines of men,
from foolish and vaine Ceremonies, from whatsoever
is obtruded upon us in the matters of God without
his warrant, as acts of common obedience, and as
service to our Lord and Master; but we no more fansie
this abstinence to be an act of immediat and formal
worship (as you would make the world beleeve we
do, to the end that beleeving us they may beleeve ye
speak truth and reason) then we do a keeping of our
selves unspotted from these pollutions and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
which come not within the compass of worship;
so that we may be aswel said to over-rate things Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiously,
because we do not drink, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who desire to hold fast their integrity, while <hi>broken
in the place of dragons and covered with the shadow

with abjured and wicked Prelacie, Lording it over
Gods inheritance, and recuiring obedience to their
vain inventions. I must tell you moreover that I do
not admire your definition of Superstition, ye had it,
I grant, from your friend Doctor <hi>Hamond,</hi> and to
make it your own, you have supplyed the Doctors
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59845:32"/>
               <hi>Nimiety</hi> with your <hi>over-rating:</hi> But if you think it not
an honour to erre, and be put to a disadvantage with
the Doctor, you should have guarded your self and
your partie from the rebound of your own blow. Sir,
what your over-ratings of foolish Traditions and vain
Ceremonies are, hath been at a very dear rate experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced,
by the bleeding and weeping People of God,
in whose bloud, exile, bonds, spoilings, persecutions
and afliction, you have made your minde and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
esteem of these things legible: Your most bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
and fond Conformist must grant, that the things
ye plead for, Patronize and press, are not necessary
in themselves, and have no connexion with the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Soul, by way of midse, or by virtue of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
precept; and that all the degrees of necessity they
can pretend to, is only from the will of the imposer.
Now Sir, may a man ask you without putting you

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o a chaffe, what an over-rating of these things is it,
for you to debarre, eject, vex and smite faithfull Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
scatter the Flocks, turne such Labourers out of
the Vine-yard who have a seal of their being the sent
Embassadours of Jesus Christ upon the Souls of many,
and a Testimony of faithful servants in the Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of some of their grand Opposites, as hath been
found when their Conscience began to speak, and
they saw themselves ready to be sisted before the
righteous Tribunal of God, and that for no other
cause, but because they durst not do as you would
have them, in adoreing your Dagon; and upon
the other hand, to compleat your wickedness,
thrusting in Men upon these Flocks, who were bereft
of such as did stand and feed in the strength of the
Lord, without any thing else to commend or qualifie
them, save that ye knew them to be of such mettal
and complexion, as they would not decline nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59845:32"/>
your impositions, which is certain as to matter
of fact, that I might here appeal to your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
&amp; to the Conscience of the chiefe men who are
chiefe in the transgression, persecuting them who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to their Covenant, keep the Commands of God,
and have the Testimony of Jesus Christ, because they
will not ackowledge and submit to such obtruded
Intruders as the sent &amp; called Ministers of Jesus Christ,
if they would committ the keeping of their dogs, the
careing for their swine, or the feeding of their horses
to persons who had so little skill to do, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to performe it, as most of these have, to whom,
the flock of God purchased with his own Blood is
committed. Sir, this is an over-rating with a witness,
and such as, if ye will rate right and reflect upon it,
may, and certainly will, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll your Soul, with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
if the wrath of God be come upon them to the
uttermost, who forbid his Sent Servants to speak unto
his people these words, by which they must be saved,
it only argues a judicial blindness of minde &amp; benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedness
of Conscience, in the chiefe of your partie
and promoters of that interest, that their lyableness
to the wrath of God Almighty, for the desolations
made in his Sanctuary by them, doth not make them
roar by reason of the disquietness of their heart, and
cry out as persons against whom the terrors of God
have sett themselves in array. I might tell you of an
over-rating also, of which ye (as we have in part heard
already) and your companions glory, wherein the
very fundation of our Salvation is struck at, <hi>viz</hi> such
an over-rating of works and our pitiful performances,
as advances them to the altitude of being the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the justification of a sinner before God, and is
utterly inconsistent with the teno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Covenant of

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59845:33"/>
hath led you and your companions into this ditch also,
and ye glory in this shame; but I shall forbear the
discovery of your dangerous folly and false-hood,
about this great foundation of Salvation by you put
out of course, till I come to examine your sixt Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.
It was only fit here to give the Reader an hint,
and let him see what over-raters ye are. But Sir, why
are ye so shye as to shun the true known, and common
definition of Superstition given by Godly and Learned
Men: ye know that that excellent definition, given
by <hi>Zanchy,</hi> and followed by other great men, makes
<hi>Superstition</hi> to consist in the addition of Ceremonies in
the worship of God not instituted by Christ, as well
as in the addition of more substantial matters; but,
easiely foreseing that this would not serve your evil
designe of loading the Servants of Christ with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and calumnie, and that the bulk of your bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome
Ceremonies must be rejected as reprobate
mettal, if nothing pass for current as a part of worship
in the Church, but what hath the Seal and impress
of God upon it, ye substitute in its place one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ye are at present better pleased, but with what
advantage to your cause I leave it to be judged. But
sir, since you do not ingage further upon the head of
Superstition, then first to cast it into such a mould as
may sute your designe, and having done so, then to
cast the iniquitie of it upon us, I shall at present satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
my self with what is said, and for your further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
I will give you all the assurrances you can
require, both in my own name, and in the name of all
the N, C. that when ever you are able to instruct
your challenge, we will thank you for your charitie;
And if your evidence as to proof answere your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the charge, yee shall find us so far from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious
obstinacie, that we will abandon with a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59845:33"/>
blush, whatsoever of Superstition we might through
ignorance have indulged in our way, and in the mean
time rest confident that, as, in demonstration of my
reality in what I undertake, I shall endeavour hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
to affect my own heart more and more into a
deep abhorrence at, and detestation of, all your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
usurpations, Antiscriptural methods, and Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
impositions, in the matters of God, and, so far
as I am able, shall interpose with all the People of
God to do the same; Yet Sir, there is one thing more
before we part; I must tell you that when I consider
your straine thorow the whole, by the superstitious
over-rateing of things, imputed unto us in your first,
and our being charged with our overprizing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
in the next, with the neglect (as you say) of
your Moralitie, and your stretch of charity for Papists,
with your insinuat censures of all who have stood up
in the defence of the absoluteness and immutabilitie
of the Decrees of God, the efficacie of his Grace &amp;c.
against <hi>Arminians,</hi> which is to your moderation and
latitude but a digladiation about niceties and curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
I say Sir, when I consider these things, and
grant you the common Privilege acclaimed by every
man, to be <hi>optimus interpres suorum verborum, the best
expounder of his own words,</hi> I must take this to be your
meaning, that we are superstitious over-raters of things
in standing at so great a distance from <hi>Papists,</hi> and in

of your perfection, as pitifull Puntes of the lowest

Sir, I only regrate we are so litle worthy of your indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and that the truths of God are not more deare
to us, and that the Zeal of his house doth not more
eat us up. And while you contemne these things as
not to be contended for, to make the world beleeve
your holy fire is not extinguished, though nothing of
its flame appear, about the conservation of these,
(to us precious things though to you despicable,) ye
would make all these stirrings for them, and striveings
about them, to be the sparkles of a superstitious wild
fire, and not a flame of God. I cannot remember
how <hi>Plinie,</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Trajan,</hi> does paint the
tender and conscientious Practice of the Primitive
Christians with the same vermilion of Superstition;
but I am apt to think, it is still the same Spirit of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Puritie of Ordinances, power and
practice of Godliness, which prompts men to these
unjust representations of such, as dare not run the
same course with them, or who are constrained by
the love of Christ to hold fast that, which is below
their Luke-warme temper to contend for. But I need
not be further solicitious in this vindication; being,
confident that you are not able to proselyte into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of this reproach any sober or rational men, nor
will I envie you the advantage you are like to reap as a
just retribution from every unprejudiced Reader; and
that is, not to be beleeved afterward when ye speak
the truth, having with so much calumnious confidence
solicited them into the beliefe of what they know to
be a falsehood. But Sir, to shut up this Dialogue
with you, though <hi>raro vidi Clericum penitentem I have
seldome seen a Clergy man a repenter</hi> hath been mostly
verified in the men, who have perverted the right
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59845:34"/>
               <hi>ways of the Lord;</hi> yet the Calumnie is so gross and
groundless, that I would willingly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>latter my self into
a hope, that when ye think on what ye have said, ye
will smite upon your thigh, and be brought to an
acknowledgement of the sin of unjust accuseing the
brethren: And I assure you Sir, our joy would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
equal with your advantage, to see you weep
over the falshoods, and calumnies, and evil designe,
of this first borne of your strength.</p>

            <head>The Second
DIALOGUE
Answered.</head>
            <p>YOu begin with a question, <hi>What
great goodnesse it was which so commended
our Partie?</hi> and having made your N.
C. make a pitifull simple vaunt, that
you may out-vaunt him, you proceed to
accuse and censure, as you list. Sir if we dared to make
our selves of the number, or compare our selves with
them that commend themselves, we want not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wherein we might indulge a little to the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of boasting; but seeing that he whom the Lord
commendeth, and not he who commendeth himself
is approved, we will not boast of things appertaining
to our selves; but endeavour that all our Glorying
may be in the Lord. I have already told you, how
God blessed us with his Ministery, and that Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59845:35"/>
with Power and Presence: It was he <hi>who gave
the word,</hi> and <hi>great was the company of these that
Published it;</hi> it was he who clothed his Priests with
Salvation, and made his people to shout for joy: It
was he who in the more special times and shinings of
his love, made the Graces of his People to flow, and
Souls were ravished with these discoveries: And if
not only in the Publick Assemblies Gods fear was
Great, but Families also did seek him apart; If the
<hi>vulgar</hi> whom you undervaluingly so name, did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delight in the Law of the Lord, and the Sabbath
was called a delight, the holy of the Lord honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
we cannot but account these great matters, and
the very paths and Methods which do most assuredly
lead to the great hights of Christianity; Yea surely
these Gospel Ordinances do lead unto the living
God, and to Jesus the Mediatour of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and unto Communion with him, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of all Graces.</p>
            <p>I know there is a shorter way, which too many take,
who forming unto themselves faire <hi>Ideas,</hi> and words
of <hi>Self-denyal, resignation, abstraction of minde,</hi> and
the like, do entirely and pleasantly rest in the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and talk of these things, and as much of a specious
outward converse as may in some sort salve their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
from these many forfeitures, which by
the sinfull accommodations of their love of ease, they
manifestly incurre: and these men commonly in their
self-elevation, do not only slight the true Ordinances,
and from the infirmities of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raile men intrusted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
do take advantage to mock; but license them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto an absolute compliance with every mode
and dress, in Church-Government and worship,
which humane policie, or Sathans Malice please to
invent, nothing regarding how much thereby they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59845:35"/>
may make themselves partakers of the Perjury, Bloud
and Violence, which promove, and the Profanity,
that followeth the courses that they approve; but as
they prudently provide for their own advantage and
credite, by the abused pretext of an illimited respect
to Authoritie, so they easily quiet all the reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of their inward Light, with any verball, slender,
and inoffensive dissent. This is the New convenient
contrivance of Religion, which indeed desires to be
admired, for its pretended Mortifications, high at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
and peaceful enjoyments; but in effect,
doth only recommend it self, by a luke-warme and
quiet indifferencie in the Matters of God, a flattering
and safe deference to Authority, and a sinfull and
sweet veneration of outward peace, Whether your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and practice do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour or not of this way, I
do not judge: I hope the serious seekers of God will
still see and ask for the <hi>Old Paths,</hi> and do know that
it is the <hi>Good way,</hi> wherein neither by a Pharisaick
show of external devotion, not yet by vain and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
pretendings, but by humble and sincere wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon God, in the means of his own appointment,
they have really attained to these graces in the names
whereof you boast, and so do finde rest to their Souls:
And certainly if to such the present sad alteration
(which, for the former light, power and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
observed in the Assemblies of the Lords People,
hath covered his house with darkeness, death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation)
doth minister suitable reflections, it can be
no matter of wonder: When <hi>David</hi> remembred these
things, and did consider the like changes, he poured
out his soul in him, because he <hi>had gone with the
multitude, and went with them to the house of God,
with the voice of joy and praise:</hi> for this <hi>Ieremiahs</hi>
heart di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d faint, for these things were his eyes dimme
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59845:36"/>
because of the Mountain of Zion which was desolate,
the foxes walking upon it: O what want had they of
you for a comforter, who could have carried them
farre above <hi>these external shaddows,</hi> and taught them
<hi>Resignations and abstractions,</hi> in such a hight, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the corruption, nor the removing of Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
should have overclouded their <hi>Easefull
Serenety?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you insinuat, that N. C. do <hi>overprize Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and undervalue Moralitie.</hi> I have already told
you, that this is but a calumny, and that an holy
and pure conversation, is the greatest and best part
of Religion, is not by us in the lest questioned; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the endeavour of holinesse; the other parts may
possibly in Hypocrisie be pretended, but cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have any reality, only remember that Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
who is our all, is also our Sanctification, and let
your Morality be indeed Christianity.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you fall upon Particulars and
alleage, <hi>That our Discipline was wholly different from
the rules of the Gospell, and far short of that of the
Ancient Bishops;</hi> This you instance in our Kirk Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which you say were <hi>like Birlaw Courts.</hi> I will
not examine your expressions, but your reasons. You
tell us <hi>first</hi> that <hi>the Church should only Medle with Sins
as they are scandals, and not as they are injuries; whereas
our Sessions cognosced upon wrongs which belonged to the
Magistrat.</hi> But pray Sir, May not the same Offence
be both as a wrong cognoscible by the Magistrat, for
the reparation of the Plaintiffe, and punishment of
the Delinquent, and as a scandal appertain to Church
censure, for the reproofe and amendment of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
reconciling of the offended, and instruction
of all? Certainly it cannot be denied: Now seeing
our Sessions did only medle with Sinnes, under the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59845:36"/>
second formality, what doth your challenge amount
to? This matter is to me so plain, that I incline to
think, that the too Narrow acceptation of Scandal,
for the offence of one Brother against another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any external injury, must be the only ground of
your scruple; but as all injurie is attended with a very
sensible Scandal, and every open sin hath also a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
harding Scandal in it, for which it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
before all, that others also may fear, so its
necessarily previous traill, cannot in reason be separat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from its commanded rebuke. But your <hi>next</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
carping at the dilations made to these Courts,
because not preceeded by private Admonition made
by the partie offended, shews more plainly your
mistake, in as much as the Gospel order of Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can only have place in private offences, in the
which case it was also by us observed. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the like Method in Publick offences, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
to exempt from their censure all open sins, which
being equally offensive unto all, render this proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
wholly improper. 3. You object <hi>That our
Church Sessions did exact Fines:</hi> but if you consider,
that these Fines which you mention are particularly
imposed and determined by Statute, and thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be applyed to pious uses: And therefore
the demanding and uplifting thereof only, aswell for
the more summare and effectual restraint of sin, as
for the end whereto they are d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stined, in use to be
exercised by Kirk Sessions, or rather by their Officers
and Bedels in deficiency of the Magistrate, who
should have been appointed in every Paroche for that
effect, this your scruple must quickly cease: but if
you still think that notwithstanding both the manner
and conveniencie of this practise, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>amine is unsuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to a Church Iudicatorie, do ye not strain at a

               </gap>at, and swallow a Camel: nay a monstruous one
<hi>Viz</hi> your Spiritual Lords in the highest temporall
Courts where both civil and capital punishments are
irrogated and inflicted. 4. You say that <hi>we forced
people to stoup to our Discipline by threatning them with
the Temporall sword.</hi> Sir, this is a great untruth, we
never owned nor exercised High Commissions, And
if obstinat transgressours were then, and still be, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable
by the Laws of the Land, wherefore seek
you to make this our burthen? 5. You say that <hi>the
the time of our pennance was short; the ancient Bishops
did separat offenders as many years, as we did weeks.</hi>
Just now you accused us of rigour, and here you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plean
of our lenity, And not remembring that the
Ancient Bishops, did not more exceed us in strictness
of Discipline, then we do exceed the Modern, You
are not ashamed to make your own sloth the Charge
of our Mediocrity. However, the lawfull, though
various, regulations of Prudence (whereof according
to the diversity of times and circumstances, things
undetermined by Scripture are acknowledged to be
capable) may sufficiently reconcile any apparent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepancie
in our practise, from that of the Ancients,
6. You say, <hi>we used Discipline to put a temporal shame
upon Offenders.</hi> Again we are too Rigid: but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may not Discipline be used to shame Offenders,
as well as the disobedient are commanded to be not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and separated from, that they may be asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 14. And the Incestuous person is
ordained to be delivered <hi>to Sathan for the destruction
of the flesh, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 5. As for your Phansie, that
Penitents are <hi>more Gazed at,</hi> as you phrase it, upon
the high place you mention, then at the Church doore,
we are not of your Opinion, and the Church doore
was ever thought a place of more obvious observance,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59845:37"/>
and severe pennance, 7 You say <hi>we wretchedly abused
Discipline by subjecting people to Censure for trifling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and that Ministers were more Zealous against oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to their courses, then against opposition to the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Gospel.</hi> But Sir as these <hi>trifling matters,</hi> which
I suspect you hint at, were no lesse then the whole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the present differences; so, whether the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
you make so light of, hath not in the event
proven a most pernicious opposition to the Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gospel let any serious Soul judge?</p>
            <p>This vindication, whereunto ye have engaged me
for our Kirk sessions, obliges me to add in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
that although these Courts be very low, and
plain in themselves; yet hath their excellent use, for
the suppressing of all ungodlinesse, been alwayes very
observable. I need not go back to former times, nor
adduce, as I may, even, <hi>K. Iames</hi> his expresse Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie;
to represent the notable and effectual influence
of their right exercise; the present increase of Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
through the ceasing of this remedy, and the most
ordinary jeer of dissolute Persons, taxing one another
for their exorbitancies, with this sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing regrate, <hi>Oh
for a strick Kirk!</hi> are too obvious confirmations:
And truely, as, I have o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ten marveiled to see a thing
so mean in appearance, so much the eye sore and scorne
of Proud licentious Persons; So I doubt not but this
consideration alone; by pointing out the reason, may
abundantly satisfy all serious scruplers.</p>
            <p>From your dissatisfaction with our Kirk Sessions you
go to taxe our <hi>Ministers</hi> their <hi>Libertie</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of
reproving sin. And as to the first, you do so invidiously
exaggerat their dealing in order to the late King, and
him who now Reigneth, that I cannot dissemble my
surprizal, at your so excessive and abusive Railing on
the Ministers of Christ, and some whereof you your
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59845:38"/>
self say, within two leaves, are very good men, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, but all are here reproached without distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as <hi>Unnatural Hams, Incendiaries, open Lyars,
inhumane, unchristian and malitious Persecutors of the
memory of a pious dead Prince</hi> and that <hi>with the hight of
insolencie and barbaritie:</hi> Deliver my Soul o Lord from
lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. Sir I pretend
not to your Privilege <hi>to scold in a meeke spirit, and to
lie walking in the Spirit and falshood?</hi> But as I cannot
but commend your wisdome, in tristing the vent of
your rage and malice against the Lords Ministers, to
such a subject, not more advantageous against a retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
then apt to point the keen arrows of your spite,
with a most mortal <hi>odium;</hi> so were it not for the reall
and high respect, that I bear to the Person, and many
excellent qualities of our deceased Prince; and the
dutie I owe the now King, nothing else could refuge
you from the full returnes of a just resentment. Passing
therefore the many horrid Blasphemies, Lies and
Reproaches, wherewith your Clergie during these
unhappie wars did not cease continually to proscind
the Cause and People of God, more precious to him
then all the Monarchs on Earth, and did most instantly
labour to render both detestably hateful unto the
Prince, until they brought all to ruine: I shall in a
few sober words, vindicat the Lords servants from
all these umbrages<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and appearances, whereby you
endeavour to set off your reproach. That the late King
by evil Counsel, specially that of unconscionable and
ungrate Prelats, wickedly abusing, for their own
ends, a Conscientious Prince unto a fatal obstinacie,
was precipitat into many grosse errours of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
such as an excessive indulgence to Papists, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll
and violent exactions, many unusuall and high at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
against fundamental Laws and Liberties, a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59845:38"/>
strange connivance at the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion, and at length,
a bloudy and pertinacious war against his Parliaments,
his greatest and best friends and Counsellours; it was
not the invention of evil affected men or Ministers,
as you alleage, but the sad evidence of plain deeds, and
the unanimous verdict of these most capable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to discern. Now if in this state of things, the
Lords Ministers, favouring his righteous Cause, did
endeavour, by a true representation, both to avert
the People from, and animat them against evil cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
destructive to Religion and Right; wherein are
they to be reprehended? You say they charged the
King with all; But know you not that as whatever
passed upon the Kings side, did beare the impresse of
his Name and Authority, so they did continually
charge the guilt and wickednesse of all, mostly upon
bad Counsel, praying the Lord uncessantly, with
much tendernesse to the Kings Person, that the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
might be removed from about the Throne, that
so it might have been established. And as to what you
alleage, <hi>That contraire to Humanity and Christianity
they did Persecute the memory of that Prince after his death
and that with the hight of insolencie and barbaritie, in the
presence of his Son, who now reigneth.</hi> It is a calumnie,
which you are not able to justify: Its true they wished
and moved the King to repent, of his accession to,
and mourne for the opposition to the work of God,
violence and bloud, wherein his Father was unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaged, and from which the Throne, except by
serious Repentance, will never be purged. If this be
the Inhumane, Insolent and Barbarous <hi>raking into
his ashes</hi> which you lay to their charge, you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
little, and fear lesse, the jealousie of God, who
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>isiteth the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children to the
third and fourth Generation:</hi> Neither doe you consider,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59845:39"/>
that the stain of Bloud is such, specially upon a Throne,
that the unfeigned teares, even of the Author, do
not wash it away. <hi>Ezrah</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> mourned and
repented for the Provocation of Kings and Princes,
many Ages past, without the least reflection upon their
memories. Seeing therefore, that the practises where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
you found these high accusations, were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
consonant to the Word of God, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
then acknowledged both by King and People,
and to which in Conscience, we do, and must still
adhere, doth not your apparent bearing with us in
the main, and yet so virulently inveighing against
a clear dependencie, manifestly discover more then an
inveterate malice?</p>
            <p>As to our Ministers their manner of reproving sin,
you say <hi>they reproved not in secret, but triumphed in the
Pulpit without controll, and against absents, and that
either out of Malice, or ostentation.</hi> Thus the tumor
raised by the poison of your last calumnie doth still
swell, and you forget that you your self are vainly
triumphing in Print against a Mock-adversarie: But
as you cannot verifie, that ordinarely, or allowedly,
secret reproof was omitted, where there appeared rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and accesse for it; so, I am confident, your
allegeance hath no better ground, then, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
for the strengthning of the Lords people, did
freely hold out the Apostacie and wickednesse of his
declared Enemies for whom such a reproofe had been
but in vain intended.</p>
            <p>In the next place you tell us, that <hi>the Sermons of our
Ministers, were no Extraordinary things.</hi> Sir I will
not compare, I am no lover of Extraordinary things;
but I heartily wish that such Preaching were now
more Ordinary: to believe, and therefore to speak,
though with speach contemptible, is certainly infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59845:39"/>
more gracefull, then to speak, even Seraphickly,
and in practise to counter-act. There is a Foolishnesse
of Preaching commended by <hi>Paul,</hi> above the wisdom
of man: Whether you would value it as an Ordinary
or Extraordinary thing I know not? But this Epithet
of <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> which you seeme to desiderat, is

were not medled with, but in a clear exigence, and
if some did exceed, others were defective; and these
were the infirmities of both; but you tell us, <hi>That
these things concerne not Souls.</hi> This is a touch of your
<hi>Convenient Religion.</hi> Pray Sir, are Publick Maters
transacted without private mens accession? or in this
accession, hath Conscience no concernment? Nay
are not the solid practises of Christianity, such, as
the contempt of the World, for the most part, most
necessaire and conspicuous in Wrestling with, and
overcoming the great and frequent temptation of a
publick sinful course? But O the rare temper of this
New device, that both inwardly elevats to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Spiritual abstractions, and outwardly smooths to

            <p>You say further, that <hi>the solid Practises of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

you make so little Conscience of truth? Your often
touching upon this string, with the presumption of
Common ingenuity, which I have and desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59845:40"/>
for all men, have made me apply to all conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to find out your ground for this allegance; but
in the end I see it is a plain forgerie. The Lord knows
that I am far from boasting of former Practises, but
that in this so visible a change, attending the present
Establishment, from the Generall restraint and aw
of Sin, that before did oblige even the most profligat,
unto a seeming conformity, unto these confessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundings

               </gap> that <hi>vertue was by us little Preached and far lesse
Practised,</hi> is that, which, I am sure, these of your
own way do laugh at, and which, if ever ye returne
to the right way ye will weep at.</p>
            <p>And yet you proceed, to oppone to us our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Sermons, Particularly that upon the mount:</hi> I
will not contend with your Mockeries. I wish that
both yours and ours may reflect on short-comings,
and endeavour amendment according to that pattern.
Next you say, <hi>That the true hights of Spirituality were
as little preached as the living in abstraction, silence, soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and the still contemplations of God, the becoming
dead to all things, and being much in Secret fastings.</hi> Sir
you are so much upon <hi>your hights,</hi> that you see nothing
about you. Pray descend a little and consider that your
own Ministers are as great strangers to these fine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of yours, and you and they to the things sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
to say no worse, as ours are, and much more:
And in effect seeing that you only measure your self
by your self, you are not wise; and this affected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltie
of words doth argue litle sincerity. But if <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, fellowship with the Father and with
his Son Iesus Christ, a heart and conversation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Christ our Life, dying dayly, victorie over the World,</hi>
and the like, may relish with you, in this, if Courser,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59845:40"/>
yet Scriptural style, our Ministers, I am sure, were
not unfrequent in pressing of them, and secret prayers
and fastings also, and, I am confident, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie
hath a seal yet abiding, which may witness that
it hath not been unfruitfull.</p>
            <p>I cannot follow you in your again repeated accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if our Ministers had only preached <hi>a Pharisaick
observance of Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>a bare relyance on Christ
without obedience to his Gospel.</hi> These are only your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeances
destitute of truth. Your next charge is that
<hi>our Ministers handled nice subtilties, which they called
Cases of Conscience.</hi> But Sir, as you grant that some
devout people may be under doubtings, and fears; so
in reason, you must allow, not only a privat appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
for their remedy, but also Publick Doctrine,
both necessaire for prevention, and conducible for
cure: that in this there was an excesse, I believe few
would have imagined, unless you had said it; Yet
when I call to minde, what men of Conscience the
generalitie of your Partie are, and how in effect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with, nay declared Enemies to, all tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof, if you had termed <hi>Conscience</hi> it self, &amp;
<hi>Melancholy Imagination,</hi> as well as <hi>Cases of Conscience,
nice subtilities,</hi> it had added but little to my wonder.
As for what you adde <hi>That it is unsufferable to hear peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who led but common lives talke of such things:</hi> It is a
truth which I have often heard our Ministers assert, as
also, that the best way of silencing all doubts, is, as
you speak, to act Faith, renew Repentance, study
Holinesse, Humility, and the other great practises of
Christianity: Why then are you so Divisive, as to
object things to us, wherein we do not differ? But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
the reason is too evident; the designe to render us
Odious must be observed, and pursued by all Arts;
And therefore, when you cannot contradict the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59845:41"/>
Power, that appeared in, and the fruit of Conversion
and Edification, which accompanyed our Ministers
preaching, Yet your eye being evil, by carping hints
at <hi>Methods,</hi> and by unnecessary cautions, you suggest
the things, which you have not the confidence to
object: Thus you bid your N. C. <hi>See that by Power,
he do not mean a Tone in the voice, A Grimace in the
face &amp;c. and by Conversion a change in Opinion, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
behaviour, influenced by Interest;</hi> But Sir, as both
in Power and the fruit of Conversion, our Ministers
have been througly made manifest amongst us; so I
must add for their Voice and Gesture, that although
some of them might have been rude in speach, yet not
in knowledge: And if your better breeding, and
sight of the Scene, have modelled your Tone and
action, above the rate, as you phansie, of both yours
and ours, you but the more marre its ridiculous grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
by undervaluing others. And as for the
Conversions attending our preachings, many of them
are tryed and cannot be blasted by your mocking. I
Grant some were proselyted, in whom the Evil Spirit
having by Apostacie re-entered with seven more, they
are become more the Children of the Devil then they
were before; but seeing they are now yours, make
them not our reproach.</p>
            <p>Your next challenge, is, that <hi>wee termed our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
the word of God,</hi> and you tell us that <hi>to call
them so, and yet to confesse that Ministers may be mistaken
in them, is a Contradiction;</hi> But why do you not rather
accuse us plainly, for terming our Ministers the
Ministers and Embassadours of Christ? If their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
be not his message, no doubt they are not his
Embassadours: and if they be his Embassadours, how
can you deny their preachings in his Name, to be his
Message? These things have such an evident, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59845:41"/>
convertible coherence, that I am in a suspence whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to impute this passage, to your mistake, or not
rather to a designe to subvert the Ministerie: And as
many of your way would have it, to turne all Christs
Preaches unto Royal Orators. As for your Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
it doth no more impugne Preachings then
Preachers: for to call Preachers the Lords Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.
And their Embassie the Word of God, have
the same appearance of inconsistencie, with the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Mistaking, wherein you phansie your repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie
to lye; the truth is then <hi>first,</hi> that Ministers
are the Lords Messengers; Next that their Preachings
in his Name, and conforme to the Warrant of his
Word, have not only that derived Authority, which
the Scripture equally imparts to all Rational and sound
deductions made from it, but also, a particular su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded
obligation from the Lords Commission,
wherewith the Preacher is Ministerially cloathed,
whence it clearly follows, that, as all true Ministers,
their Preachings are in his Name, and ought to be
agreeable to his Truth, so, the Preachers their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
mistakes, are of no more force, either to deprive
Preaching of the name, or these things therein, that
are sound and true, of the special Authority of the
Word of God, then the accidental miscariage of an
Embassadour, to make void his mission, in other
things consonant to his instructions. How unsound
then is your insinuation that <hi>The text indeed is the Word
of God, but Ministers Glosses,</hi> (by which terme you
mockingly understand all Preaching or Expounding)
<hi>the words only of fallible men,</hi> as if a Ministers sound
interpretation and application did pertake of Nothing
speciall from the Character which he sustains, whereas
you know that not only his Mission, doth impresse
his words, with his Masters Authority; but hath
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59845:42"/>
also many and great Promises of a suitable assistance:
Having thus cleared the Common Cause of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie,
and that their Preachings when sound, are
from a special ground the Word of God: That which
you subjoin of Ministers their usurping this name to
their Preachings by <hi>Way of Artifice,</hi> that thereby they
might procure the credite of the <hi>Infallible</hi> and <hi>Inspired
Prophets,</hi> is as far from truth, as their diligence in
searching of, and their care of confirming all their
Doctrine by the Scriptures, with their frequent and
continual intimations, that the People ought to build
all their Faith upon that sure foundation, are notourly
known.</p>
            <p>But you have not yet done with our Ministers, you
tell us again, that <hi>our great Men were medling Men,
and most of them were very little spiritual in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and Seldom in the Commendation of God and
Religion to the People.</hi> Sir, omitting your insinuate
distinction of <hi>Greater</hi> and <hi>Lesser</hi> Ministers amongst
us, which you know we acdnowledge, no further,
or otherwayes, then the Lords free Grace &amp; gifts do
make it: and passing your accusation of <hi>Medling,</hi>
which I have already answered: As to Spirituality
of converse, it is indeed a thing so excellent, and
beautiful, that it can never be enough studied, never
enough practised, and never enough pressed; but the
manner and designe of your reflection considered, it
is so void of truth and charitie toward Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,
whereof so many have been burning and shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lights, and so sadly applicable to your Clergie,
the very scume of Men, let be of Christians, that I
can only marvel at, and regret the excesse and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of your Malice. Pardon me, if the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of your procedour force me to such expressions:
I protest sincerely, your Methods are so perverse,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59845:42"/>
that I have no greater difficultie then how to find civil
termes, sufficient to detect them: Thus after you have
delivered a groundless and calumnious challenge of
our Leaders, their want of Spirituality, in ordinary
discourse, you hold out its singular usefulnesse: And
falling to question us, as wholly strangers to these
great things of Devotion, and holinesse, which you
enumerate, you falsely conclude, <hi>truely these things are
as little among you, as any partie I know:</hi> Well Sir, as I
wish heartily that they were more, and that they may
still encrease, even to your conviction, which, I
am certain, requires a degree equall to, if not beyond
perfection; so, my prayer is, that God who both
knows all the darring and open wickednesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse
of these of your way, and sees your heart,
and weighs your words, may discover unto you the
sin of <hi>speaking wickedly,</hi> and <hi>talking deceitfully</hi> against
him and his servants.</p>
            <p>In the next place, telling us, that we <hi>seeme very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to be noticed in our Religion,</hi> You charge our
Communions <hi>as tumultuary, disorderly, and talkative.</hi>
It's Answered, that sometime they were numerous, is
not denied; but if you consure <hi>Great multitudes their
following of Christ as tumultuary, and disorderly,</hi> it is
more then the jews ever did: That our <hi>running many
miles to them shews us to be Idolizers of Men,</hi> your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
opporrunity of <hi>the Sacrament nearer hand,</hi> does
not prove it: for as we were far from neglecting nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
occasions, or undervaluing any of the Lords sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Servants; so, to acknowledge also and improve
the difference of Gifts, which the Lord hath dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
savours nothing of Idolizing, and cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
palpable envy, be dissallowed: If in other things
I were satisfied, and in the libertie of a free election,
I am confident, that without slighting the call of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59845:43"/>
neerer invitations, I might chuse rather to go ten
miles to your Communion, then five to anothers,
and yet you cannot say that I Idolize you. As to what
you object <hi>That at our Communions, all our businesse,
both in preparation and Participation, was to hear and
talk.</hi> it is but your mis-information or mistake, I am
su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e previous self-examination (whether by the names
or <hi>Inward stilnesse and recollection</hi> I do not indeed well
remember) was alwayes most seriously pressed, and
also much practised, and in the action it self, a short
convenient silence, was the more general custome.
As for your other alledged inconveniences of <hi>Croud</hi>
and <hi>Distraction,</hi> these are but the peculiar aversions
of your particular Genius, other more strong and lesse
delicate and nice Spirits did easily overcome these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties.</p>
            <p>You further say, that <hi>You cannot think them very
devout, who love rather to hear one talk, then to retire
inwardly and commune with their own hearts;</hi> but what
esteem have you for him, who disliking the hearing
of others, and pretending to inward retirements, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the talk of these things all his work? And why
do ye without ground accuse us of a preference, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we are not guilty? As we hold both Hearing and
Meditation to be duties, and beautiful in their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
so, we endeavoured to practise, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Partiality which you object, or its contrary
which you incurre, O but you adde that <hi>some of us
will be many hours in Publick worship, and perhaps not
a quarter of an hour in secret.</hi> That there may be such
amongst us, and worse, I nothing doubt; but if you
intend this for an accusation, either against our way,
or the Generality that own it, it is an allegeance,
for which our <hi>Father who seeth in secret</hi> will in due time
rebuke you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59845:43"/>Another fault which you find about our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
is <hi>their i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>requencie as being brought by us from the
dayly practice of the Apostles, and the after frequent
custome of the whole Church, to once a year.</hi> Sir,
you know so well the Churches power, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
observations that have been in use, as to this
circumstance of time, that I think although your
disatisfaction had been founded on better grounds;
Yet you should have been tender to make of it an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
That the Primitive Church did soon f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll
from the first dayly celebration, your own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
grants: what was the after practice, and is at
present your custome, I need not mention: it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that neither the one, nor the other, do agree to
your rule of <hi>Weekly Communions.</hi> Suppose then our
Church had by a suitable regulation of this matter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
the greater solemnity of Gods Ordinance, had
this been a <hi>licentious admixing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> four own devices,</hi> as
you are pleased to terme it: but the plain account of
the thing, is, that there was no positive Prescription,
as to the times of this observance, known amongst us.
Only, as the Churches of old did Ordain that all Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
should Communicate, at least once a Year; so
our Church did appoint that at least once, if not tuice,
in the year this Sacrament should be administrate:
Now if we liking better a joint then a separate partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the people of the same Parish, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the particular exigences and desires, possibly
incident to private Christians, might be easily supplied
in other places, none being tyed to any fixed time,
did therefore not so often celebrate, and for the most
part but once a Year, truely I think that the variation
from the former frequencie, was visibly compensed
with a greater advantage of Solemnity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> As for your
demands <hi>why the Communion was not keept every Lords

day?</hi> It's answered, as there is no command for it, so
you have already heard, that we wanted not reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
considerations, which did persuade the contrarie.
For the hint you give of the strict notice should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of receivers, I have often heard our Church char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the excesse, but never before with the defect
in this particular.</p>
            <p>You fall next to censure <hi>the posture of sitting in time
of Publick prayer, as very irreverent.</hi> Sir, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
you I am not far from your opinion: For my own
part, and I have many of our way assenting, I dislike
sitting in prayer, (if infirmity and other great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
do not hinder it) and for proof of it, I adde
to your answere made to the instance of <hi>Davids</hi> sitting
before the Lord. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 16. That he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth
the occasion of <hi>David's</hi> address, even the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and high exalting message that the Prophet had
delivered to him, with the tenour of his words, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
rather an astonishing Meditation of wonders,
not able to forme it self at first into either direct pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or praise, then any thing els, will find no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to acknowledge that the decent enough proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yea almost the necessity of sitting in such an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
amazement, cannot rationally be drawn in
consequence: but as in this we agree, so I cannot but
disagree from you in your overprising and exacting
the postures that you plead for: for though I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that there is an indecencie, and other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
in sitting, for which I wish, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may be, it were wholly disused; Yet I am
far from offending at, let be imposing upon, these
who of no intended irreverence, but for the most part
from a just disgust of the too great weight hath been
laid upon such circumstances, do innocently practise
It. I confesse that kneeling and standing in prayer, are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59845:44"/>
in the Scriptures very frequently mentioned: but as
thereby the thing is only circumstantially noted, and
no where, no not in these invitations, <hi>O come let us
worship and bow down</hi> (where the Gesture is only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as the more Ordinary, and the substance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted

record, such clear instances of an undetermined liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

doth approach, to what our Lord sayeth, in almost
the like case, <hi>This people honoureth me with their Lips,

            <p>Your next reflection is upon the <hi>Family-Worship</hi>
that was so frequent in former times, and here you
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59845:45"/>
taxe Masters of Families, <hi>For Expounding Scripture,
and wish that we do not overvalue other lawfull exercises.</hi>
Sir, as to what yow make your N. C. say of Expounding
Scripture, I look upon it as a meere suggestion of your
own, that yow may finde somthing to reprehend even
in our best performances: You know all that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in the directions for Familie-Worship, was,
that Masters with their Families should read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
with understanding, and by mutuall conference
Edifie one another, neither are you against Expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by Masters, who are <hi>very intelligent:</hi> And for
the practice, it was in effect so rare, and imperfect,
that I am con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ident your accusation of excesse to most
N. C. will only prove a check for their deficiencie.
As for your <hi>Wish</hi> I verily think <hi>it good,</hi> but <hi>no good
wish.</hi> When the calling upon the Name of the Lord in
Families is now so universally and irreligiously flight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by many openly mocked at, think you it a
season for such over-cautelous advices? Nay Sir, in the
so sad and Lamentable decline of this dutie to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
of neglect and contempt, groundlesly to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the other, of an over-value, is but to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the wicked, who forget God, and weaken
the hands of such as seeke his face in sinceritie.</p>
            <p>From this point, in the eagernesse of your pursute of
the people of God, you passe to <hi>private meetings.</hi> And
with you I can grant, that they have had both their use
and abuse, I can grant also that, in the setled plentie of
pure Ordinances, to bring Church-exercises to Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
or private conference to a publick confluence, is
(in my opinion) superfluous and affected; Not that
I would have Religion wholly astricted in its exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
to Churches, Families, or to Mens Closets: but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s I acknowledge a communication and speech alway

               </gap>alt of Christians their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59845:45"/>
&amp; would judge nothing more becoming then to
see Religion so seriously &amp; constantly minded, that
men were pursuing &amp; observing its occasions more then
these, either of bussiness or recreation; so I think to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
&amp; keep particular meetings with a visible affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of singularity were a thing justly to be avoided;
&amp; thus in our better times, it was commonly both held
&amp; followed. But Sir, ye must suffer me withal to tell
you, that as Satan had a speciall envy at these, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how much, when in singleness and sincerity gone
about, and performed with just caution, they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the grouth, comfort, and mutuall edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Saints; and therefore to make the thing
it self odious, he abused the well-meaning honesty of
some, and used the sinister designes of others to a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of these out of their proper channels, that so
they might miss of their just ends: though I must tell
you, that to talk so much of these justly reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
escapes, without incouraging to the dutie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
so many have reaped advantage, seems to be a
fault no less challengeable in a Minister of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
one part of whose work it is, if he be a worker
together with God, to exhort his hearers to comfort
themselves together, and edifie one another, then
any of these abuses amongst private Persons in such
meetings, against which you with so much eagerness
exclaime: it would no question much better become
one careing naturally for ye flock of Christ, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
as a faithfull Feeder, to be assiduous in pressing
the dutie, carefull in directing, and deeply affected
with any advantage that Sathan got over the Saints, in
the use of such a mean, then to publish to the world
his victories, that the thing it self might pass for a
vice. As for the practice of Private Meetings in evil
times, all your supposed and accidental inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to which even the best of things are obnoxious,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59845:46"/>
are far from making me condemn that, which to the

seeing you cannot truely charge them with
any of these evils which you mention, and since your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
doth clearly depend upon your different judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as to the main. I must take liberty to dissent
from you, with the same confidence wherewith you
assert it, and withall tell yow that I wish their frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
did keep a proportion with the deep distress of the
People of God, in this penury of pure publick
preaching; and then, I am sure, we should have ten
for one, and if so, there were ground of hope that
they might, in these Private Meetings, pray your
Intruders out of their publick capacities, that so these,
who now dare not be over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

these Assemblies, out of which they are thrust and
keept, and might once more, as of old, be made glad
in his house of Prayer.</p>
            <p>For a close to this Dialogue, you make your N. C.
boast of <hi>the glory of our Unitie,</hi> to the effect that you
may the more foully set out the <hi>divisions</hi> that fell out
amongst us, and to do it with the greater advantage,
you endeavour prudently to remove by a preface, the
suspicion of what you are resolved to practise; and
therefore you tell us, <hi>You love not the Spirit of detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
but whether you be acted by it or not, let
these Epithets you give us, of <hi>Unchristian, Malitious,
Brethren in Cruelty, and Implacable,</hi> bear witness:
for my part, though I do so much detest divisions,
that I am content to let your representation passe,
with all its excesse, on purpose, that to all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59845:46"/>
they may appear more odious, and that if it be the
Lords will, even your reproachful tongue, may smite
the guiltie into Repentance; yet for the vindication
of the truth, I must say, that such hath been its bad
fate, and worse reception in the Earth, that I should
sooner judge Division; then Unitie, to be the signe
of Orthodoxie, to be found among a partie; Perfect
unity in truth, is a blessing so great, that it is reserved
for Glory: If you think that our Lord came to send
peace on Earth, remember his own words; <hi>I came
not to send peace but a sword, and to set a man at variance
against his Father, &amp;c.</hi> Schismes must be, nay were
the very first temptations and trial of the Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which all the Light and Power of the Apostles
could not guard it. As therefore Sir, you do falsely
make us to glory in our Unity, so, take head lest by
making division our charge, yow do not far more
calumniously reproach the Christian Faith. Do not
imagine that I do hereby patronize divisions; Nay I
know and am persuaded, that because there is nothing
more repugnant to the Genius, and hurtfull to the
progresse of Truth, then Contentions, therefore it
is, that the Devil hath even laboured most to infest
it: with these temptations; but I would have you to
understand, that seeing these strifes, whereof you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
us, did certainly proceed from the remaining
dreg, and adventitious mixture of ane Evil Spirit,
relaxing former Engagements, remitting the first
Zeal, and not a little bending to your way, and from
mens corruptions on all hands, although that you
could say that our course did take away Peace, and in
place thereof being War; yet it would no more inferre
the Spirit that moved therein to be contentious,
then you can justly object against the blessed Gospel of
Peace, these Schismes, hatred, and tumults, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

had reserved as much ingenuity to your self in your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
as you make, and acknowledge him to speak

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls of your Way, and the sad and

Church, you subti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly labour to evade, by telling,
<hi>That you are not so engaged, as blindly to desend any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest:
you are so far Episcopal, as to love the Order,
and submit to it, but you have not sworn fealtie to any
Sect: your prayer</hi> is, <hi>that all distinguishing names were
buried: you do not patronize, but mourn in Secret, for
the sins, that are amongst you, adding That Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
are guiltier of the present loos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>sse then perhaps
they think.</hi> And thus, after that in your second Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
you have not only riped up, mis-construed,
and exaggerated to the hight, the infirmities of the
Men o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our side; but imployed all the invention of
calumny, to render them odious, and then charged
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59845:48"/>
all these things directly upon our Way; when you see
a retortion appear, you instantly decline it, by insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
the evils to be the faults of men, and no way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
chargeable upon your cause. I will not complain of
this unequall measure, neither shall I take notice, that,
when you apprehend a stress, for all your inveighing
against the one, and love to the other, you can for
a shift alleviate both Prelacie and Presbytrie to <hi>Emptie
names,</hi> &amp; shreud your self in the Sanctuary of ease the
convenience of your <hi>new divised latitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I must remember you, that as the thing we
contend for is an Ordinance of Jesus Christ, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
for, and greatly commended by the effectual
propagation of the Gospel, and conspicuous advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of holinesse; so the ignorance and licentiousness,
which (as the shadow doth the body) do attend
the prevailing of your Order, are not more the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of men, then the bitter and corrupt fruits, that
undeniably demonstrate the corruptnes of that plant
of Prelacie, not planted by God, whereby they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
<hi>ye shal know them by their fruits</hi> is a Test for Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as well as Persones, and that a <hi>good tree bringeth
forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit,</hi>
is no lesse applicable to, and clearly verified in, the
one then in the other. The pure ordinances of a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Ministrie, and Church-Government, according
to our Lords appointment; as they have his warrant
and promise; so they may expect his blessing; but
Lordly Prelacie the unwarrantable invention of man,
accomodate to a politique or worse designe, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

the reducing of the just liberty of preaching, and due
respect to Conscience, unto a subserviencie to mens

with the evil effects of ignorance, profanitie,
and irreligion; then it hath a peculiar influence,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59845:48"/>
directly productive thereof: and therefore Sir, as
you say that you are <hi>so far Episcopal as to love the order</hi>
(I suppose because it is <hi>Ordered</hi>) <hi>and submit to it,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>you see that rest is good;</hi> so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not, but the sad and woful consequences of that aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Sin, and Profanenesse, which from your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are gone forth into all the land, will render you
so far <hi>Christian</hi> as to know by such fruits, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptnes
of your <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> that hath brought them

               </gap>
but a serious supplicant, that the accursed cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may be removed,</p>
            <p>But you say that <hi>Non-conformists are guiltie of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
loosnesse who. 1. By making Religion a cloak to so
many State-designes, make too many suspect Religion to be
but a designe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it self. 2. by driving people to an outward
compliance in formes, cause them to nauseat at all Religion:
but. 3. and mostly, by their waxing cold in love, to
which our Saviour plainly knits the abounding of iniquitie.</hi>
Sir, as to your two first reasons, If I should as lightly
deny them, as you do affirme them, you should be
fully answered; but this your accustomed confidence
of objecting to Non-conformists these things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
their Adversaries are mostly, if not only, guilty,
obliges me to a further reflection: That Religion may
be made a cloak to State-designes, nay, to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
villanies, is certainly one of the most grievous of
these offences, because of which a wo is pronounced
to the world; but that this hath not been so much the
accidentall practice of any Person of our way, as the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59845:49"/>
very substance of your whole course, is obvious to the
meanest Consideration. How austerly our first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
were denied to all Worldly advantages, and how
faithfull to the Crown, and then infant King, I leave
it to the candid and impartiall consideration of all sober
Men, not preferring the vain pretenses, made for
perverted, yea profaned Authority in <hi>Odium</hi> of Truth,
to the most convincing evidences, of all impotencie
and wickednesse, that can be instanced from any His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory:
The next passage that occurres of these who on
our part in a most stedfast simplicity, did assert, and
establish Presbytrie, untill the year 1596. &amp; of others,
who on your part, by Fraud, Perjury and Violence,
did, in compliance with King <hi>Iames,</hi> his design of
Complementing the English Clergie, on the one
hand, and attaining to a greater freedom, of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and gratifying the Popish partie, on the other
(both supposed necessaire for assuring, the then much
courted Succession) endeavour, the overthrow of
Presbytrie, as being too straight for such crooked
courses, is an instance against your first reason, which
I am bound in Charity to think, you did not call to
minde: sure I am, that which you object, of our
aiming <hi>at State-designes,</hi> change but <hi>State,</hi> into <hi>Court,</hi>
and you will finde it was so far from being our guilt,
that it was King <hi>Iames</hi> his regret, on our behalf, that
honest Men would not be thereby tempted. But it is
like, the times you hint at, are these of our late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
Wherein, though I acknowledge, that the
feigned concurse, and corrupt designes of some, did
in their occasion discover themselves; Yet, it cannot
be denied, that such was, and is, the truth of the
work of God, and stedfastnesse of its faithfull Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
that even unto this day, through all the various
temptations of Malignancie, on the one hand, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59845:49"/>
Sectarianisme on the other, both it, and they, do
retain their integrity. Really Sir, when I consider, that
neither the tempting terrour of the prevailing Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
interest in the Years 1645. and 48. nor the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
victory, usurpation and very plausible and
insinuating offers of the Sectarians, with all these
strange revolutions that have since happened, have
moved the Lords faithfull remnant in the Land, from
that well tempered, and justly ballanced fear of God,
and honour to the King, which from the beginning
they professed, and do hold forth in the Covenant,
and all their Publick actings, Your accusation of the
work of God, as <hi>a State design,</hi> appears to me a
very palpable inconsistencie, and ridiculous calumny;
to design State changes or advantages, and yet, to
omit and slight all the probable, yea and possible op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
of compassing them, are things, which
Malice it self cannot affirme to be compatible. As
for these, who not being upright, nor stable in the
Lords Covenant, have, according to the impulse
of their own worldly designes, turned and figured
themselves, unto every sort of compliance, they are
now so unexpectedly, and wholly almost, become
of your way, that there needs no other evidence, of
the eàsie accommodation, that all self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>seekers, and
time-servers do finde in it: but wherefore do I seek
to retort? Can there be any thing more certain, then
that as corrupt Court designes, have only imposed
this heavy Yoke of Prelacie, upon the Lords Church,
and People amongst us; so such have been, and are
the wicked and ungodly practices of its <hi>Lords,</hi> and
their dependents, &amp; the vast dissonancie of their lives,
even from their own Canons and profession; that I do
not so much wonder at your impudence, in objecting
against our course; <hi>The tempting of many to suspect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59845:50"/>
to be but a design of it self,</hi> as that the monstrous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of your Hierarchy hath not scandalized the whole
world to account <hi>all Religion but a cheat.</hi> 2. You say
<hi>by driving of people to an outward compliance in forms,
we have caused them to Nauseat at all Religion.</hi> Who
would think that this were the accusation of Non-conformists,
who from the very beginning of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
have been continually vexed, by your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
and not rather conceive, the objection to be
made by them, against your violent pressing of Crosse,
Surplice, Service-book, Book of Canons, and other
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rash, wherewith the Lords people have been unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
urged, as the main, yea only things of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
But I cannot stand upon every one of your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
the Lord deliver you from this perverse spirit:
Only if by the <hi>driving</hi> objected, you do understand our
causing the people of the Land to stand stedfast, and
adhere to the Lords Covenant, whereby they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
obliged, it is already fully answered.</p>
            <p>But, that which you say is of greatest weight, is,
that <hi>we are guilty of the waxing cold in Love, to which
our Saviour knits the abounding of Iniquity:</hi> And this
challenge you qualify, by <hi>our judging you in Matters
which are doubtful disputations, spreading tattles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of
you,</hi> as you call them, <hi>carrying sowrly toward you,
and casting odious aspersions upon you, as Apostates and
the like, with petulant railings,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> you adde,
<hi>is a greater persecution, then any little suffering of
ours in the World.</hi> Sir, though I cannot sooth you
as you do your felf, by the mouth of your N. C.
(whose tongue you teach to speak lyes) in your smooth
words of deceit, by telling you, that <hi>too much of
what you speak is true;</hi> Yet I heartily wish, there
were more Charity on all sides; but where you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
us, <hi>of waxing cold in Love,</hi> and thence would
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59845:50"/>
inferre our accession, to the present abounding ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
I would <hi>first</hi> have you to read the text aright,
which runeth thus, <hi>And because iniquity shall abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd,
the love of many shall wax cold,</hi> which is a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of your causality. 2. Admitting your ground
to be good, I seriously wish, without vanity, that
the <hi>waxing cold in love,</hi> both toward God and your
Neighbour, were not more your sin, then ours; then
had we not been scorched into a blacknesse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
almost into ashes, by these fiery trials, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
blown and kept into a flame, by the Grandees
of your way (pourtrey them as you please) whose
heat speaks them to be set on fire, against the Work,
People, and Interests of God. 3. To call the causes
of our Differences <hi>matters which are doubtfull Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
when both by Scripture, Reason, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Engagements, and many sad experiences, they
are so fully determined, is indeed, to <hi>put false glosses
upon things;</hi> and <hi>to pretend to be a good Christian, and
to acclaime the charity and kindnesse of others,</hi> in
an avoued persistence, in open Perjury, Opposition
to the Cause of God, and persecution of his People,
is it not to wipe your mouth, and say you have done
no wickednesse?</p>
            <p>But you say <hi>it is from the spirit of the Devil to
fasten the brand of Apostasie upon the leaving of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and that to grow wiser is not to play the changling,
nor is a consciencious obedience to standing Laws time-serving.</hi>
Sir, as I love neither to irritate, nor preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
by hard words; so I approve not either your or
your N. C. tattles; but if to leave God, and not
a Partie, be <hi>Apostasie?</hi> if to forsake the way, and
Truth of God, <hi>be to play the changling?</hi> and if to
obey, and conforme to mischief, framed by a Law,
be <hi>time-serving?</hi> I am sadly apprehensive, that, what
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59845:51"/>
you account to be, but the <hi>Malice of the spirit of the
Devil,</hi> shall one day be found, the <hi>Verdict of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God;</hi> Whether it be thus or not, in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
differences, let the things themselves, and
the issue of our discourse declare? What you tell us
of the primitive application, of the word <hi>Apostasie,</hi>
is no restriction of its proper acceptation: And for
your other petty conceits, in this place, with your
mock-complaint, of the persecution of <hi>a just, but
disdained censure,</hi> they are not of that moment, to
stop my procedour, to that part of your conference,
which concerns Episcopacie.</p>
            <p>This head you say <hi>falls asunder in two, the one a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
consideration of that Government, the other, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it were amisse, how far it ought to be separated
from:</hi> And for the Government, in place of all these
weighty and unanswerable objections, viz. the want
of our Lords Warrant. 2. Repugnancie to his, and
his Apostles Precepts and practice of restless labour,
simplicity, equality, humility and contempt of the
world, &amp;c. 3. Disconformity to the first, and purer
times of the Primitive Church. 4. The pride, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
usurpation, and cruelty, to which, it naturally
tends, and hath been depraved: And lastly, these
evil and bitter fruits, of profanity, ignorance, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
that it hath ever in its prevalencie produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which have been charged upon, and made out
against it, by many of the Lords faithfull Witnesses;
you make your N. C. faintly and poorly to aledge, I
<hi>cannot think that Church-men should be called Lords, and
be great Persons;</hi> that this is a desingenuous prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
is obviously manifest. Yet such is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of your cause, that the meanest argument, you
could put in your N. C. mouth, is stronger then your
answere, wherein you tell us, <hi>That this belongs not to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59845:51"/>
the thing it self; but is an addition of the Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat.</hi>
But I must remember you <hi>first,</hi> that Church-men
and Ministers, are not capable of every addition:
Civil offices, and administrations, are very lawfully
bestowed by the Magistrat, upon fit Recipients: but
as for Ministers, they are not only an intolerable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
many degrees above that charitable imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which the Apostles could not bear, but so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the nature, manner, and end of their
Ministrie, that, even our Lord, while in this capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
doth bruskly decline, to be so much as an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
trister: And therefore to justify Bishops titles,
from this ground, that they <hi>are extrinsick additions,</hi>
or from their civil place, and voice in Parliament, is
no wayes concludent. 2. Though this were not;
yet, I am confident, that who ever considers, the
received use, and import of this title of <hi>Lord</hi> amongst
us, will find it an addition, as full of fastuous vanity,
for Ministers, as the title of <hi>Rabbi,</hi> (even admitting
that its excess did lye another way) therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
against, and prohibited by our Lord, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
for the Apostles: but 3. This title is not an
addition flowing from the Christian Magistrat, as you
pretend; but the very product, of that pride, and
usurpation, that at first exalted Prelacie, which, as
as first, it was assumed by the connivence of, if not,
rather forced from the Civil Magistrat; so now, by
the Bishops, it is only derived from him, in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of that Supremacie, which both falsly against
our Lord Jesus Christ, and traiterously to the <hi>Pope,</hi>
in this respect their proper head, they have, for their
own conveniencie, transferred upon him.</p>
            <p>But you add, that <hi>we consider not that, Sir, and
Lord, Gentleman and Nobleman, differ but in degree:
since therefore, a Minister by Office, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hes the temporall

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onour of a Gentleman, why may not the temporall honour
of a Lord, be as well put upon a Bishop?</hi> Sir, if you
were as innocent of the vanity, as you seem to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the Nature of these titles, Our controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
were at an end: a Faithfull Minister, truely mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his work, values not himself upon points of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauldri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;
to acquit himself as becometh an Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
for the Glory of Christ, is all his ambition,
and truly honourable, beyond the accession of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
dignity, If it were not so, I could further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you, that a Gentleman and Nobleman, do not
only gradually differ, but are <hi>prorsus disparata wholly
different.</hi> The King, wee say, can make the one, but
cannot make the other. I grant the privileges of a
Gentleman, are commonly supposed to belong to
Ministers, and decent civility may respect them, as
of that ranck, but really, there appears to me such
a disparity, betwixt these things, and a Bishops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
let be the usurping, of the temporall, and
more eminent honour or <hi>Lord</hi> specially as above his
Brethren, that if a Minister as such, should but te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciously
lay claime to the title of a Gentleman, I
would think it not only very misbecoming his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
but a plain forfeiture of the pretended pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege.</p>
            <p>But, your N. C. urges to better purpose, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
should not <hi>Lord it over Gods heritage:</hi> And you
for Answere, tell us, <hi>That by Lording, is meant a
tyrannicall domination, and not a tittle.</hi> Next, <hi>That
Gods Heritage, applyed by us to the Clergie, is not in the
Text, bearing only not Lording over their Lots or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
to which you adde <hi>That Whatever argument we
use to put down Bishops from being as Noble-men, will
also prove Ministers not born such, not to be Gentlemen.</hi>
Sir, to put this foolish trifling about titles, first by
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59845:52"/>
hand, Bishops neither are <hi>Noblemen,</hi> nor ought to be
esteemed <hi>quasi Noblemen:</hi> because 1. The thing is
altogether incompetent, and the title without the
thing is a vanity. 2. Either title or thing, as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts
them above their Brethren, is sinful, and the very
reverse of our Lords Command: <hi>Whosoever will be
chief among you let him be your Servant</hi> not <hi>your Lord.
He that is chief,</hi> let him be <hi>as he that Serveth</hi> not <hi>as a
Nobleman:</hi> How then can ye acclaime either thing or
title? 3. The title of <hi>Lord</hi> in its Ecclesiastick usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
hath been, and is so grossly abused by Church-men,
above all that our Lord reprehends, in the
pride of the Pharisees, not only to the pretending to
the uppermost roomes at feasts, and the chiefe seats
in the Synagogues; but the chief places in States, and
the first banches in Parliaments, not only to Greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the Merca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Rabbi,</hi> but to ride next to the <hi>Honours,</hi> and be called
<hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> that, seriously I marveil how you
or any Christian, regarding our Lords express
words, can justify it? That these reasons do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate
against the civil, and ordinary respect common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
payed to all Ministers, and men of any fashion,
without either a vain usurpation in the receivers, or
any other thing, then that courteous mutua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
commended by the Apostle in the givers,
&amp; which without falling into the ravings of the Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
their austerity, you cannot from our Lords
words redargue, I think it needlesse to resume. Now
you say that by Lording, prohibite to Church-men, a
<hi>Tyrannical domination is only meant,</hi> why do you thus
offer to impose, contraire both to the import of the
word, and tenour of the Scripture? the word used
by <hi>Peter is</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the very same used by our
Lord <hi>Math.</hi> 20. Whence <hi>Peter</hi> himself learned the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59845:53"/>
Prohibition, that it signifies not to Tyrannize, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
simply <hi>authoritative Dominari, to rule with Authoritie,</hi>
all <hi>Lexica</hi> attest; Neither doth the proposition <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
joyned to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> import more of force, then what
doth more expressively denote, and distinguish the
dominion of Empire and Authority, from that of
propriety: As for the tenour of Scripture, that it
repugnes to your exposition is manifest 1. Because
that where <hi>Math.</hi> in this passage useth the compound
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Luke</hi> doth indifferently use the simple
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as of the same import to the present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
by which your gloss, of a tyrannicall domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is deprived of all shadow of ground. 2. Because
our Lord by both words, doth only prohibite such a
domination, and authority amongst his Disciples, as
was exercised amongst the Gentiles by their Princes,
and which they who were called their Benefactors
did use over them, but certain it is, that neither was
the dominion of the Princes of the Gentiles, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
or commonly tyrannick; nor is it our Lords
purpose in this place, to brand them with such a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
3. The positive Command plainly set down,
and enforced by our Lords own example, is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
to leave any man hesitant, as to the Prohibition:
<hi>But it shall not be so among you, but whosoever will be
great among you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </hi> truely great in virtue and reward, <hi>let
him be your Minister:</hi> Let him exercise the Ministery
committed to him, by way of humble and painfull
service, denyed to all worldly advantages, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affect, nor assume the Grandour, and Authority
of Civil Governours. <hi>Even as the Son of Man came not to
be ministered unto, but to Ministere, and to give his life, &amp;c.
and made himself of no reputation</hi> (contemning his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility,
and not valuing his Nobilitie) <hi>but took upon
him the form of a Servant:</hi> Sir, do we indeed beleeve
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59845:53"/>
that this is commanded, and proposed for a pattern to
Gospel Ministers? And yet it is not only most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
so, but also undeniable, that if there were in
Ministers and Church-men, that same Spirit of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God, and love to Souls, which was in him,
who accounted it his meat and drink to do the will of
him that sent him, and to finish his work, and if they
had the same eye, and regard, to the joy set before
them, which he had, who is the Author and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inisher
of our Faith, it could not be other wayes. For my
part, I think a serious reflection on these things, is not
only enough to confound for ever, the ease, vanity,
and pomp of aspiring Prelats, but to make the best
of Ministers ashamed, to appear so much above their
Master, even in their indulged honesties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies.
But 4. Because the place that you touch
is taken from <hi>Peter,</hi> see how it also agrees with that
of <hi>Math. Feed the flock of God &amp;c. Not as being
Lords</hi> or Lording, <hi>over Gods heritage, but as being
Ensamples:</hi> where it is evident, that the adversative,
doth not only reject your Gloss, of a <hi>tyrannick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;</hi>
But by commanding rather to lead and
instruct by example, then to rule by Authority, hold
furth the same humble and simple Ministerie, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
here, which by our Lord was before recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
The next thing you answere, is, that <hi>Gods
heritage applied by us to the Clergie, is not in the Text,</hi>
Pray you Sir, how came this in your head, that we
apply the title of Gods heritage to the Clergie, or
own them under this name? Know you not, that the
usurping of this prerogative, both by your, and the
Popish Church-men, hath been alwayes esteemed
by us, an high arrogance? As for your pretending
to correct our Translation, Pray Sir, be sober, and
remember the respect which you bear to the Authors.

Tyranny, in Lording over the Consciences of

provided for, by the general rules revealed, and the
things themselves, and their use, such as ingenuous
persons cannot probably mistake, the want of express
warrants, in all or any such particulars, cannot be
justly cavilled at as a defect: 2. That it had better
become the sobriety, that you require of your N. C.
for you to have answered, what many worthy Men
have written, for the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Presbyterie,
then to have passed all with the empty censure of your
own airy character of <hi>big talking, and minding it as
little, as any could,</hi> to the effect, you may amuse
your poor N. C. with a fear of your conceited quibl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
but leaving these things with as confident an
estimation, as your undervaluing is vain, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
to the impartial perusal of judicious Readers,
I do only here premise, that, whoever abstractly
and seriously considers, the clear light, and obvious
project of the Gospel, will of necessity finde. 1.
That our Lord Jesus by vertue of that Kingdom,
and All Power given to him, in Heaven and in Earth,
did, for the carrying on, and prospering of his pleasure,
the Salvation of sinners, appoint, in the Persons of his
Apostles, a perpetual Ministrie in his Church, the
summe of whose charge, is both severally &amp; jointly, to
take heed, to oversee, and feed the Church of God,
and the chief part and dutie of which office, is, to
Preach and Teach, and consequently to reprove,
rebuke, exhort, remit and retain, bind and loose &amp;c.
in which things, the heads of Doctrine, and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
with their immediate power, and warrant from
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59845:55"/>
Jesus Christ, and their connex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, and dependence
betuixt themselves, do certainly consist, and are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
held out. 2: As the Apostles were all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
(waving the matter of the Seventie, whose missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and imployment was only locall, and preparatorie,
unto every Citie, and place, whether he himself
would come, and to say <hi>the Kingdom of God is come
nigh unto you,</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> ended at their returne, <hi>Luk</hi>
10. 1. 9. &amp; 17.) appointed by Christ, and in them,
the order, office, and full pattern of the Gospel
Ministrie established, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> even
unto the end of the world, so they are by our Lord ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with such equall power, so expresly prohibited the
aspiring to, or usurping these degrees, lawfull and
allowed in secular dignities, and so enixely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the lowliest humility and submission conceivable,
not only in their personall conversation, but in their
Ministrie, that to introduce an imparity, either of
Power, Dignity, or stated Preheminence, amongst
Gospel Ministers, is plainly to reject, and deny our
Lords institution, and ordinance. 3. That although
the Apostles were singular above their successors, in
many respects, such as an infallible assistance in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their Ministrie, eminencie of Gifts, an
unconfined exercise, an universall oversight, and
the privilege, not only of our Lords peculiar and chos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Witnesses, but of being the spirituall Fathers, and
Authors of conversion, to almost the whole Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Church; yet were these prerogatives only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
and necessarily requisite, and suited to, or
depending upon the particular exigence of the Gospels
first propagation, and so far from changing, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novating
that equality, parity and lowlinesse of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
most manifest from our Lords command and
appointment, that on the contraire, these other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59845:55"/>
hindered not the Apostles, to respect and
acknowledge the Pastors of particular Churches, as
partakers with them of the same Ministeriall power,
their fellow-labourers, Brethren (not in the bare
name, as your Prelats scorne their Curates, and the
<hi>Pope</hi> in his pretended <hi>sevus servorum Dei,</hi> the whole
Roman Church) Compresbyters, and in the Pastoral
charge, altogether their equals. 4. As the power
of Government, consisting in the Authoritative decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Controversies, according to the word of God,
the due application of Ecclesiastick Discipline, and
Censures, and the right regulation of all other things,
pertaining to the Ministeriall function, is clearly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in the Command of Feeding, and Over-seeing,
beside its naturall inseparability from the conduct of
every rational, let be Christian, institution and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and consequently only assistent, and secondarie
to the other offices of the Ministerie; so, the Lords
command of that most lowly submission, and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
incapable of the very notion of imparity,
which he opposeth even to that lawfull Authority,
and dignity allowed in civils, doth in such a peculiar
manner, regard the exercise of this Governing Power,
that whether it be more absurd, to introduce a stated
degree of Superiority and Dignity among Ministers,
in the point of Government, or to separate and exalt
Government, from and above the office of Preaching,
to which it is subservient, and to appropriate it to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Ministri-prelati,</hi> above others, can hardly be
determined, I need not here caution concerning ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Elders, seeing the more full description of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
Government, is here given, in order to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
in which these Elders being only partiall sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
it is not more agreeable to their warrant, then
suitable to this position, 5. As the grounds of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59845:56"/>
and parity of Ministers by us asserted, are by
these truths plainly held out; so that superiority of
Power, though still Ministerial, competent to the
meetings of the Brethren, as well over the severall
constituent members, as over the Church according
to their warrant hereafter declared, is thereto very
consistent, and thereby mostly established: whether
these things, all evident in the Doctrine, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of Christ and his Apostles, do not fairely exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,
the principles and platform of a Presbyterian
Ministerie and its Ministerial parity, Let men judge.</p>
            <p>Really Sir, when I consider Preaching, to be the
main office, even our Lords own commission, &amp; great
erand into the world, Discipline to be dependent
upon it, and wholly referable to its end, and a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Ministerial Government, only allowed for the
regulation and advancement of both, and when I do
remember, that neither the glorious excellencie of the
Lord Jesus, hindered him to be amongst his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>as he who served;</hi> nor did the many advantages
of the Apostles, and others extraordinarily gifted,
and accordingly imployed and sent out, as their
assistents, requisite in the Churches infancie, make
them assume to themselves, or endeavour to settle in the
Church, any superior Order, above the degree of
preaching Elders, and Overseers, whom they all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
respected as their equals, in the work of the
Gospel: And <hi>thirdly</hi> when I call to minde, that
wherever a Church came to be gathered, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
did either by themselves, as at <hi>Lystra, Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi>
and <hi>Antioch,</hi> or by their fellow labourers (as
<hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete;</hi> there left and

of the Church of God, without appointing any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
Prelat over them: And lastly when I reflect how
that in the beginnings of the Gospel at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> all
things almost were acted by Common counsel: that
where, and when, the Christian name did first take
place, there and at the same time, we finde a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie
of Prophets and teachers assembled, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
jointly, and by the Command of the Holy Ghost,
sending out even the greatest of the Apostles, as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to them, that <hi>Paul</hi> imposeth hands with the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie,
&amp; termeth it their deed, &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

the Ministrie &amp; Government of the Church in the
way of Presbyterie, to be as much <hi>Iuris Divini,</hi> as it
is opposite to, and removed from your <hi>Hierarchie.</hi>
Having thus discovered the foundation, and traced
the undeniable lineaments of Presbyterie in the Word
of God, I may not insi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Prelacie were not attended, with many and great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and in its exaltation (mark it lest you think
me injurious to good men) had not been alwayes ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

Order of Church-men, usurping from the Pastors
of the flock of God, the Ministerial Power of Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and the only right of Ordination, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
to themselves the sole management of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as their proper work, with dignity and

nor vestige in the Scripture of the New Testament:
but is so palpably the invention of man, that, it is

not a greater wonder, that the Devil should have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

how the world should have been thereby imposed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
and have endured, all its rapine, sacrilege and
usurpation, under the pretext of Religion, to which it
is so repugnant.</p>
            <p>I come now to try how you impugne the <hi>jus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
which we assert for <hi>Lay elders,</hi> and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

by me not touched: You say <hi>Lay-Elders are founded
on no Scripture, as the most judicious amongst us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge;
And you wonder, that when we urge from the
Apostles giving rules only for Bishops, and Deacons, that
Diocesans must be shu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

that ruling Elders, are not there.</hi> Who these <hi>most ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious</hi>
amongst us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> may be, who deny
Lay or rather Ruling Elders, to have any Scripture
warrant, seeing your own N. C. is none of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
I cannot apprehend; but for your wonder, I think
it may be easily satisfied, if you will but consider,
that it is not from the simple omission of Diocesans, in
this Text, that we exclude them from the Church:
but since it is manifest from the Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and
<hi>Titus</hi> that the true Apostolick Bishop was no other,
either in name or office, then a Presbyter: Nay, that
by the rules to him set down, your Diocesans is plainly
cast, and rejected, like as both in <hi>Acts</hi> Chap. 20.
and <hi>Titus</hi> the names of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously
used, is it not clearly concludent, that
your Diocesan hath no Scripture warrant, whereas
the ruling Elder, as he is not in these places confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and made the same with the preaching Elder,
but may justly enough share both in the general names
of Elder, and Over-seer, and also in their rules without
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59845:57"/>
any incosistence; so his liquid warrant, as a distinct
officer, is elswhere obviously extant.</p>
            <p>In the next place you add, that <hi>the Brethren in the

are judges o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dity doth
not follow, and our argument is nothing convelled:
But you say, <hi>it is absurd to think, that, that was a Church
judicature:</hi> Pray Sir, not so fast, you would say, that,
that meeting was not a General Synod; for that it was
a Church judicature its decree doth evince: As to the
Arguments taken for ruling Elders from the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to rule with diligence, and the enumeration of
<hi>Helps,</hi> and <hi>Governments,</hi> amongst other Gifts bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Church, seeing they are not adduced as
by themselves, so convincingly concludent, but as
accessory to these other places, whereby the distinct
office being proved, the promise and gift agreeable,
cannot but add a considerable light: Your terming
them <hi>Sandie foundations</hi> is as foolish, as your calling

            <p>But both your N. C. and I inquire what you say to
that Scripture <hi>let the Elders that rule well, be counted
worthy of double honour, Especially they who labour in
the word and doctrine,</hi> That here both the Preaching
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59845:58"/>
and ruling Elder are included, in the word Elder, as
I hinted before, and that a distinction is made, of
him who both Preaches, and Rules, from him that
only Rules, is manifest, from the words; and you
are so far thereby convinced, that you acknowledge
the office controverted to be spoken of, but you say
<hi>the Text supposeth its bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g, but doth not bear its institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
this is truely exact and strict; it seems you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
not, that although all that was ever pleaded
in behalf of your Bishops, and <hi>the faire likelikood</hi> for
them, which you would draw from the Angels of
the Churches, proceeds only upon a supposition, of
the thing in being; Yet none of our side, do redargue
your arguing, from that place only, for want of an
express institution: Consider therefore Sir, that, if
the being of our Elders office, be in this Scripture
supponed, and commended, its institution is also
thereby supponed, and commended, and this nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of yours, is no evasion; but adding that <hi>there are
five or six glosses put on these words,</hi> which <hi>you protest</hi>
(without any reason) <hi>to be better then ours,</hi> you give us
your own, thus: [<hi>Let such among you, as are fixed
to rule particular charges, be doubly honoured; but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
these Evangelists, who medle not in rule, but labour
in word and doctrine.</hi>] Sir, I am sorry that having
plenty, you have made choise of one, so many wayes
peccant, as importing, <hi>first,</hi> that at the time of the
writing of this Epistle, there were Elders fixed to
particular charges or Parishes within <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the contraire is most commonly and probably held,
2. That either there were at the same time, beside
your fixed Elders unfixed Evangelists, belonging pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to <hi>Ephesus;</hi> or that the Apostle speaks here of
these Catholick Evangelists, who belonged not to
<hi>Timothie's</hi> inspection, but which is worst of all, your
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59845:58"/>
Gloss plainly destroyes the Text, for whereas <hi>Paul</hi>
doth first deliver a General, that all <hi>well-ruling Elders</hi>
be doubly honoured, and addes a speciall ampliation,
<hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Natura regulae of the Nature of a Rule,</hi> in favours of
these, who also Preach, you expresly say, that these
Preachers <hi>medled not with rule,</hi> and flatly deny them to
be of the number of these <hi>well-ruling Elders,</hi> which are
to be honoured: Next, where the Text makes labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the word, an additament to well ruling, and
therefore deserving a special allowance, you preferre
the sole merit of Preaching to the double deserving,
of both Preaching and well-ruling: but I pursue your
raveries too far, the words are plain, well-ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Preachers or not Preachers, are to be doubly
honoured; but such who do both Preach and rule
well, have the preheminence: Now whether or not
you have shown, our Elders to be <hi>ill grounded</hi> I leave it
to your second thoughts.</p>
            <p>But you proceed to surprize your N. C. with a
<hi>how want you Deacons?</hi> and then you tell him, That <hi>we
had indeed somewhat called Deacons, but they were not
Scripture-deacons; for such were not Lay-persons but Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick,
separate by imposition of hands, for the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and so were to continow, whereas we yearly altered
our Elders, and Deacons.</hi> Sir, though in this point
you represent our Leaders as <hi>Deceivers,</hi> Yet really, I
should be sorry, that you were aswell known to be a
<hi>calumniator,</hi> as the Deacons used in our Churches, are
<hi>clearly found in our Bibles:</hi> Their institution <hi>Acts</hi> 6. is
plain, specially <hi>vers 3. Wherefore Brethren, look ye
out among you seven men of honest report, full of the holy
Ghost and Wisdom,</hi> whom we may appoint over this
businesse viz. the dayly ministration, and serving of
tables: From which Scripture, our Practice of chos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
honest, approved men, for the Ministration of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59845:59"/>
Charity, there meant, and the serving of tables, is so
exactly copyed out, that I cannot but admire your
confidence: But you say, that <hi>Scripture Deacons
were not Lay-persons, but separate by imposition of hands:</hi>
If by separation you mean the solemn appointment
and designation of Deacons, and hold the same suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make them Ecclesiastick, our Deacons as
well as these in the Text, are indeed Ecclesiastick; but
if by separation you understand a totall and perpetual
sequestration, from secular medling, as you cannot
be ignorant, that it was and is the wish of many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
amongst us, that the Church could have been

the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have overtured a way how
the Church Patrimony (whereby these Officers of the
Church might have lived) may be recovered from
the Harpyes who devoure it now without remorse:
neither hath the after abuse of Deacons, unto a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
order, used in the Roman Church, any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
warrant, as is clear from the Text, and the rules
therein expressed: I grant we finde in Scripture <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
chosen a Deacon in the 6. <hi>chap,</hi> and Preaching <hi>chap
8. vers 5. Acts,</hi> and that it is probable, that this and
the like practices, were there after made the occasion,
and colour, of the formentioned abuse, but if you
suppose that the first Deacons did Preach by vertue of
their institution, you have no just ground for it in the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59845:59"/>
word: And <hi>Philips</hi> Preaching, is so plainly annexed
to an extraordinary dispensation, or tacite mission to

            <p>Next you add, <hi>that Scripture Deacons, were separate by
imposition of hands, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

probability, the mistaking of this forme hath not been

viz. that because of the want of a competent maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

               </gap> in
that of Deacons, will you therefore conclude that we
disown the thing it self? But you tell us, <hi>That Scripture
Deacons were to continow, whereas we alter ours every year:</hi>
You said first, that <hi>we took away from them their Church-office,
without a fault;</hi> but remembring that our
annual change, is not a deposing from the office,
only used by us in the case of demerit, but a relieving
from the exercise, you did well to phrase your charge
better, in the terme of <hi>altering:</hi> In answere where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
I deny that the Scripture doth repugne to our
custome, nor can yow show any Text in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire:
Nay I question not, but he vvho considers
the end, for which Deacons were first institute, vvill
easily grant, that vvhen <hi>Philip</hi> became an Evangelist,
he ceased from the exercise of his Diaconat, and that
though the then particular condition, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Goods, in use amongst the first Believers at
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> did not require this reliefe to be expresly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59845:60"/>
provided for; yet the after state of things, both there
and in other Churches, not permitting their constant
attendance, nor providing for them any stipend,
might have induced it.</p>
            <p>Having thus weakly objected against our Deacons
you ask in the next place, <hi>Why want you Diaconesses,
whose Order, Qualifications, Age and Imployment, are
particularly set down in Scripture?</hi> To which you cause
your N. C. very poorly answere, that <hi>he hath heard
many of our Ministers say, the want of them was a fault:</hi>
But seing I am not of his opinion, I make this reply to
your demand, that we want Diaconesses 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the appointment of the office hath no clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Testimony; its true, that passage. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 9. is
commonly understood of your Diaconesse, and by
these better seen in Antiquity of these feminine <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <hi>quae faeminarum mores formabant, who did teach the
women good manners</hi> and differed as much from the
Diaconesse, whose office it was, <hi>faeminas pauperes,
aut aegrotas pecuniâ aut operâ sublevare, to help the poor, or
sick women with money or service.</hi> as our Elders do from
our Deacons; yet if a man should interprete that whole
Text, to be meant of such, who were to be received
unto a more special manner of the Churches charity,
seeing their by-past deservings only, and not their
future imployment, appear there to be noted, and
the command subjoined <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. to believers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
their own widows, doth insinuat no less, I
could not accuse him of any straining: and as for that
other Scripture, <hi>Rom. 16. ver.</hi> 1. where we finde

Church,</hi> it may be so properly, and easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

her an officer, that it signifies nothing in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire.
But 2. admitting that the primitive Church
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59845:60"/>
among the Grecians, whose women did live under
a more severe rule, and were not so accessible, as
among the Jews, as Interpreters doth note, had
therefore both <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Diaconissas,</hi> aswel as
<hi>Presbyteros</hi> and <hi>Diaconos,</hi> whereas the Jews did only
use the latter, it may possibly inferre that women
in case of an urgent necessity, are not incapable of
these offices; but doth no wayes conclude either
distinct offices institute in the Primitive Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and
unknown among us, or that we who enjoy and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
a more free converse, like unto that of the
Jews, ought to imitate the practice of the Grecian
austerity, and weaknes: and therefore since our
Deacons are sufficient to perform the duties apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the office, and are not by our customes
excluded from a due and decent Administration to
both sexes, your objection of our want of <hi>Diaconis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
is but an emptie inadvertent cavil: I could
further tell you, that a form or constitution, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
all things that are of divine Precept, though
using other things of no necessary nature, only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their exigence, may neverthelesse be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and of divine right, but the former answeres do
fully cleare the matter.</p>
            <p>The third defect you challenge is, <hi>why wanted

ever is the natural, and rational right and privilege
of a Society, must also appertain to it, by vertue of
the same right, whereon its constitution subsists; the
reason is, because, in every concession, the things
natural and proper to that which is conceded, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
understood, to be imported: Now that union
in Counsel, and Power in the whole, over the parts,
and the subordination of the parts unto the whole, in

then and power of meetings being undeniable to the

to the parts, the Subordination whereof to the

               </gap> the Apostles, had

Church, but now a dayes, have their distinct charges
over Parochial Churches, <hi>are subject to the Prophets,</hi>
gathered in one assembly, may not the Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

seing I can hardly suppose you so Anti-episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
as to be Independant, and still to doubt, after
the many irrefragable demonstrations given by the
Presbyterians, whether this Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a
Presbyterial, and not a meer Congregational or Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Church. As for what else may be in your return
I confesse I reach it not, seeing that at the time of the
Apostles writing, we finde no divided Parishes, and
to fancie that the subjection spoken of, wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the

many Prophets, having the charge <hi>pro indiviso jointly,</hi>
over the whole company of the Beleevers, in that
Citie, in which many parishes were virtually includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is groundless and absurd. To the first instance you
say, <hi>It is ridiculous to urge it, seing they of</hi> Antioch <hi>sent
not up to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>either as to a Church superior, or as
to an Oecumenick Councel, but to men there who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
inspired.</hi> That they sent not up <hi>as to an Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menick
Councel,</hi> I cannot dissent from you, seing I
finde in the Text no suitable concurse for, or vestige of
such an Assembly; but that they sent not up as
to a Church superior is by you ill asserted and
worse proved, seing 1. The phrases in the letter
sent from that meeting, <hi>that certain which went out
from us, and it seemed good &amp;c. to lay upon you,</hi> and
that the same letter is termed a <hi>Decree,</hi> do clearly prove
a superior Authority in the writers. 2. Because the
example which ye adduce from the jews their high
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59845:62"/>
Priest for confirming your Gloss, doth plainly redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
you, in as much as the Jews consulted not the
high Priest, his <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> without regard
to his Authority; but consulted him as the high Priest,
and the Person to whom God had therefore commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. v. 10. 11. &amp; 12. putting them in
the breast-plate termed of <hi>judgement,</hi> and not of <hi>Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponses:</hi>
But you may say, supposing the matter was
thus carried, what makes it for your Assemblies? I
Answere, yes very much: for it sheweth 1. That,
if the Apostles, who all of them severally were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
inspired, and so might have determined this
controversie, did notwithstanding join with other
ordinary Elders or Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>officers, and by common
counsel give out their Decrees, that common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
&amp; their authority in the Church, are <hi>juris Divini.</hi>
2. That as the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in which the
Apostle <hi>Paul, Barnabas,</hi> and several other Prophets
were<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and the other Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> received and
submitted to the decrees, so, it evidently intimats a
subordination of these, making as it were one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Church, to that great Assembly of the Apostles
&amp; Elders conveened at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You subjoin in this place, <hi>That if that meeting at</hi>
Jerusalem <hi>was a Councel, then all Councels may speak in
their stile, it seems good to the Holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi> It's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
1. The connexion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> your proposition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
an obvious <hi>non sequitur,</hi> in as much, as it is
not from their being a Councel, but from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of these Scripture evidences whereupon their
determination proceeds, that their prefacing of the
minde and sentenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the holy Ghost doth flow. 2.
That, that meeting was a Councel of the Apostles,
and Elders at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a conveened in one to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulte,
Reason and exercise Authority, which severally
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59845:63"/>

               </gap>e assistance, is plain
from the Text, &amp; especially <hi>Pauls</hi> deference to them.
3. If you imagine that Ecclesiastick Councels cannot
be of <hi>Divine right</hi> unlesse they have the Spirits abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and infallible assistance, you erre as grossly, as he
who for want of this infallibility, should deny to the
Church a standing Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>strie, by Divine institution.
4. Though the infallible guidance of the Holy Ghost
given to the Apostles, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d being to them in stead of
the rule, was indeed singular and extraordinary; Yet
as the Lord to all his Ordinances, hath annexed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of an agreeable presence, which doth not fail the
sincere and faithfull improvers, so, Church Assemblies
in matters of Faith to them committed, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rule thereto prescribed are also thereby
countenanced, and in sound beleeving and upright
walking, may both attain to, and profess their assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Holy Ghosts assistance. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Seing that all
Councel-acts and Canons, anent matters of Faith,
ought to be guided by the Spirit, and conform to the
word of God, and enacted and emitted in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion,
these Meetings that truly keeping the rule,
and sincerely laying hold on the promise, do proceed
in their determinations, may therein warrantably use
the Apostles words; and such as do otherwayes, are
only culpable in the presumptuous usurpation, because
they have not rightly followed, and in effect attained
unto the rule of the Word, and the conduct of the
Spirit, which ought indeed to be their warrant. 6.
Having on these clear grounds declared the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Ecclesiastick Meetings in Matters of Faith, I
freely grant that in other things, which may be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to their cognition, and are not of Faith nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
in Scripture, they have neither the like warrant,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59845:63"/>
nor may they use the like expressions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as in this case, they cannot found upon the Lords
Commandments, so they are only to be respected as
such, <hi>who are intrusted to give their judgement,</hi> and <hi>have
obtained mercie of the Lord to be faithfull.</hi> 7. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
which you alledge it is for fallible men to
say, <hi>it seems good to the Holy Ghost,</hi> is abundantly salv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both by the infallible rule of the word, to which
they are astricted, and by the never-failing promise of
him who is the Truth, and will be with his own to
the end of the world: And your lapse in this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is but the same with your former against Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
their calling their Preaching the Word of God,
which I have already fully confuted: And thus I hope
all impartial Men may see that the <hi>jus divinum,</hi> being
in this matter our rule, the <hi>Independants have not the
better of us,</hi> as you groundlesly give out.</p>
            <p>Next you proceed to challenge our <hi>Discipline,</hi> and
what warrant we have for it? but, seing as to the
substance you are satisfyed by your N. C. Answere,
from the Excommunicating the Incestuous Person,
and the noteing these that walk disorderly, togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with his <hi>&amp; caetera</hi> (which you may finde very
clearly amplifyed by many able Men) and do only
fall a nibling at the circumstances of publick Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>Why so many dayes?</hi> (which might be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
of any number) <hi>And why in a place of repentance?</hi>
And <hi>Why sometimes the use of Sack-cloath?</hi> all well
enough answered by your N. C. his telling you <hi>of
the power of order in external Circumstances,</hi> given to
the Church for Edification, I come to weigh, the
stollen advantage, that you flatter your self to have
gained, over your poor Adversarie, which you
carry on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with the like questions: As 1. <hi>Why may the
Church impose such days of penitence, and not as well
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59845:64"/>
order to all, for the sins of the year, the penitence, of Lent.</hi>
2. <hi>Why is a part separate for Penitents, and not for
communicating?</hi> and thirdly <hi>Why may not a Church-man
officiat in a Surplice as-well as a penitent put on Sack-cloth?</hi>
and that the simple may fancie a pungencie in
these empty conceits, you make your N. C. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
a <hi>surprisall,</hi> and refuge himself in a childish im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
belief <hi>of his Ministers ability above his own:</hi>
whereupon you so vainly triumphe, that I am asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to represent such a mean piece of pageantrie, but
to the matter, dayes are assigned to Penitents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
time being a necessary requisite, and its length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
or shortening, very conducible for the end
of publick Penitence, the edification of the Church
the deterring of others, and the through convincing
and gaining of the person, according to either the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the offence, or condition of the Offender,
its prudent regulation, as of a matter therefore left
undefined, can no more be denyed to the Church,
then the exacting of Penitence it self; but as for your
expiatory <hi>quarantam</hi> of Lent, as it bears no parity to
the reason by me adduced, so, it imports such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
of repentance, hardening in sin, encrease of
Superstition, and relaxing again to Licentiousness,
that it is hard to say, whether its appointment be
more groundless, or its effects pernicious? If you,
object its first rise, and occasion, from the wel-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
observance of pious Men, I will not tell you, that
the samine flowed from their mistake, of our Lords
total and Miraculous abstinence by the space of
40 dayes, neither by himself repeated, nor by
his Apostles imitated: Nor what a superstructure of
vanity, may be built on such foundations: but when
you consider its great depravation, and bad fruits,
I hope you will easily incline to say <hi>What is the chaff
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59845:64"/>
to the wheat?</hi> The invention of Man, to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God? 2. A place is separate for
Penitents that they may be Noted, Rebuked and
Ashamed, that others may fear; but to separate a
place for Communicating, more then is done by us,
in the time of the Administration, what shadow of
reason can be adduced for it? Specially after the
Idolatrous superstition, whereunto it hath been abus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and from which unto this day, mens mindes are
not throughly purged: Witnes these Superstitious
Bowings, Cringins, and Kneelings, which your
English Prelatick-Church doth still retain. As to
the third point, I will not say, that where the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice</hi>
in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ken of Innocencie is most used, the Sack-cloth
of Penitence would be more agreeable: Nor may I
stand to shew you the Usurpation, and evils of Mens
imposing Significant Ceremonies, others have done
this already unanswerably, but the Disparity which
I finde in your inference, is that Sack-cloth in Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for Grosser sins, was by us appointed (though
not universally and constantly practised) not as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Significant, either of the Penitents guilt, or
remorse, seeing it hath to neither any suitable report;
but as that, which being at first the squallid neglect
flowing from, and thence becoming the customable
effect of deep and bitter mourning, might be both a
humbli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng badge to the delinquent, and a mean of
fear to others; whereas your Surplice, is arbitrarily
institute, and imposed to signify Innocencie, without
either reall foundation, or sufficient warrant, wherein,
whether you do more usurp against God's Prerogative,
to appoint Sacred and mysterious Signes, and that
simplicitie, in which he hath set forth his Gospel, or
be more grosly mistaken in the event, and fruit of your
application, is a great question? I grant, that Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity

a liberty to the Church, of appointing Ceremonies,
having for reason of their signification, the will of the

high Priest, that the example adduced doth rather
redargue, then confirme your continuance of this,
now idle Rite: I might further tell you, that the
use of Sack cloth among us was not offended at; and
if it had, would probably have been forborne; And
also adde to these clear disparities, your rigid impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and exacting of these your Doctrines, more then
the Commandments of God, both in prejudice of
Christian Liberty, and to the slighting of true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but whether the disparities above mentioned be
<hi>subtile shifts</hi> as you are pleased to judge, before you
hear, or solid differences, these who are less prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
will easily discerne.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you returne, to show us our
difformity, with the Scripture-pattern, in demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Why we do not observe the decree of the first Councel at
Ierusalem?</hi> to which I answere; that we observe it,
except in so far as it was designed to be temporarie, and
framed to bury the Synagogue with honour <hi>viz.</hi> in the
matters of Bloud and things strangled: And as for
meats offered to Idols, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
declare that point, so that in these particulars, the
Decree doth not reach us: This answere as to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
differeth nothing from your Non-conformists.
And therefore I proceed, and really Sir, I finde in
your return such pitiful inadvertencies, as to the Text
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59845:66"/>
of Scripture, that I cannot but premise my wish, that
in the study of it you may become more serious. 1.
You say that <hi>to alledge that the exceptions in the decree
were made to please the jews, is a divised phansie against
expresse Scripture,</hi> and yet the Text beareth, <hi>Iames</hi>
first propounding the thing, and plainly adding, this
reason <hi>Act. 15. 21. For Moses in old time hath in every
City them that Preach him, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon it follows,
<hi>then pleased it the Apostles,</hi> pray Sir, consider the
Text, and what this <hi>then</hi> can els <hi>import?</hi> 2. You <hi>say
St Paul wrote his Epistle before he went to</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and
yet</hi> James <hi>tells him these things were still observed there;</hi>
whence you infer that <hi>commands in externals may be
both local and temporarie:</hi> What indistinctnesse, and
bad logick have we here? If you mean that <hi>Paul</hi>
wrote his Epistle, that I mean anent meats offered to
Idols, before he went up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> from the
Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to that Councel of the Apostles,
and Elders, the Scripture is contraire, showing that
his travels unto <hi>Greece,</hi> and all his dealing with the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> yea and almost all his Epistles, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
but if you mean that he wrote befor his going
up thereafter mentioned Act. 21. it may be so indeed,
as to his Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and some other,
but then the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> only tells him, that the
beleeving Jews were still zealous of the Law, and
that they were offended, that he taught <hi>the Iews</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Gentiles to forsake <hi>Moses,</hi> which is so far
from concerning the Decree under consideration, or the
proving your point, that a thing may be obligatory
in one place, and not in another, that as <hi>Iames</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth
<hi>Paul</hi> to purge himself of that calumny, anent
the Jews, so <hi>v.</hi> 25 he expresly resumeth, and seclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the case of the Gentiles, before determined: As
to your other inference, <hi>that Commands in externals,
are not intended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or any other having a temporary reason, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>durance of these
things, which are absolutely setled, into the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
of the Church, or rather of the Civil Powers
(for it is evident, that, though in all your discourse, you
pretend the Church, yet you take your measures from
the Civil Authority) it is not only groundless, from
the matter of the Apostles th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ir Decree, but of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence, to the shaking loose of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
for proof whereof, see how upon the back of this
discourse, you boldly attempt to make even the very
Sacraments Arbitrarie, by asking <hi>why we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>se not washing
of feet, since there is no Sacrament set down more punctually
in Scripture?</hi> And when your N. C. retorts, that you
are under the same obligation (which retortion may
be pertinently made to most of your objections) you
tell him, that <hi>you have a clear answere, that in these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals,
God intended no perpetual obligation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in them you follow the practice of the Catholick Church:</hi>
O unhappy <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and you other Christians,
who suffered so much, and so grievously, for the
retainning of the Cup, in the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper; If this new Doctor, who with his
New Light, can penetrate unto the secrets of God,
and measure the duration of his intentions, had lived
in your dayes, he could have told you, that the Cup
is <hi>but an externall thing, under no perpetual obligation,</hi>
and by his Doctrine of <hi>Conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>encie,</hi> led you to a safe
and peacefull <hi>Accommodation</hi> to the practice of the
<hi>Catholick</hi> Church: but Sir, they are at rest: As for
this your Laxe acceptation of a professed indifferency
in externals, what part of the Christian Religion or
Worship, may it not corrupt, or subvert? and seing
it doth tolerate and allow, the not practising of <hi>the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59845:67"/>
washing of feet,</hi> to you, <hi>as well founded In Scripture,</hi>
as <hi>either of the Sacraments,</hi> would it not in a just parity
of reason, dispense with, and forego these also? This
is indeed doctrine so damnable, that I hope it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
need an Antidote, and therefore I returne to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
your third or eight Sacrament (I know not
which, for all are but externall) of <hi>washing of feet,</hi>
And you say, <hi>That it hath in Scripture of Element,
Water, the Action, washing the feet, the Institution,
as I have done so do ye, And ye ought to wash one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
feet; and the spiritual use of it, Humility:</hi> Whence
you conclude. <hi>Why do ye not there ore use this rite?</hi>
To which last point, it is, that waving any further
discourse an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt the Nature, and requisites of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
whereof, notwithstanding your parrallel
description of this washing, yet I perceive you are
loath to apply the name, I shall direct my answere
viz. that this washing is not to be used, because,
though our Lord did practise this lowly act of Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendence,
as eminently expressive of that humility,
whereunto he would have his Disciples instructed;
yet, neither is it in it self, of the Nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
signe, whereof all the <hi>significancie</hi> is from the
institution, and <hi>vertue</hi> in the exhibition of the thing
signified, which you cuningly omit to mention;
Nor doth Christ perform it by way of Institution, for
Repetition; but by way of example, for Imitation,
as is manifest from the Text, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 13. 4. &amp;c. where
we finde, that our Lord doth first wash his Disciples
feet, before he told them what he was a doing, and
then having done the act <hi>not simply significant by his
appointment;</hi> but of it self as the effect expressing the
greatest humility as its cause, he teaches them not
a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>emne reiteration, but the <hi>use</hi> in these words, <hi>If
I your Lord and Master have washed your feet, ye also
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59845:67"/>
ought to wash on anothers feet: If I have been among you
as he that serveth, so ought ye to serve one another; for I
have given you an example that ye should do as I have done
to you.</hi> I have not shewed you humility in a figure,
to be repeated for your remembrance, but by a solid
practice taught you, the like performance: so that
to turne this pattern unto a rite, is in effect as far from
our Lords purpose, as the instruction of plai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
is preferable to that of Mystick representations:
which exposition is so true, and sound, that as this
phansie of yours, was never owned by the Church of
Christ, so, it is most certain, that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re it hath
been followed, (I mean by the <hi>Pope</hi>) and this action
hath been used, as a rite, it hath only been made a
colour to the most prodigious, and superlative pride,
that ever the sun beheld: and thus I hope all men may
see that the not using of this washing, never again us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for any thing we read, by way of Sacrament,
or Ceremony, either by our Lord, or his Apostles,
and Churches; is neither a <hi>difformity</hi> in us, from the
Scripture, nor an argument for your irreligious laxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in things you call <hi>externals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for your Demand, <hi>why in your Worship do you not
Kiss one another with a holy Kiss?</hi> seing it is no where
commanded in worship, as you seem boldly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
to suppose, and the Christian manner of the
thing, in customary civility, is only recommended
by the Apostle, as an allay of chastity, and kindnesse
in Civil rencounters, the question is, but a petulant
extravagancie of your vain imagination.</p>
            <p>Next you Enquire <hi>why do you not anoint the sick with

               </gap>ound answere of all
the Churches is, that as the custome of Anointing
might have been occasioned, from an observance then
in use in these parts, where Anointings were much
more ordinary then in our parts of the world; so, it
is mentioned in the Scripture by the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> not
by way of Command, but as the accustomed Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole,
adhibite in the exercise of the Gift of healing,
which being then Ordinary in the Church, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be applyed by the prayer of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the effect is solely re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

formality of Anointing, as being then customary in
the like cases, seing then that the Text runs clearly
thus, <hi>is any sick? let him call the Elders, and let them
pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the
Lord, and the prayer of saith shall save the sick;</hi> And
that the application of the extraordinary Gift of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by prayer, with the then us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is here only enjoyned, how can you make
this Text binding as to the manner and circumstance?
when you cannot but acknowledge, that the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
viz. the power of healing is ceased. But having
made your N. C. say <hi>That the Apostle promises reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
upon the anointing,</hi> you turne to fight with your
own shadow, and tell him <hi>There is no such matter;</hi> that
<hi>the recovery is promised to prayer, and also forgivenesse;
and seing we pray by all for their raising up, and that they
may be forgiven, why do we not aswel anoint?</hi> But, what
Logick can make out this consequence in as much as
Anointing being there only spoken of as the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59845:68"/>
rite used in the application of the Gift of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is manifest that without the existence and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of the Gift it self, it is not now to be repeated;
and therefore though prayer be principally comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Miracles was actuate and made effectuall, and to this
day doth remain as the great one by which all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
either for raising up or remission are drawen out
unto effect; yet thence to inferre that Anointing, a
peculiar solemnity in the Gift of healing, should still
continow, notwitstanding the Gift it self be ceased,
is, very absurd: Now that Anointing was an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
observance in the exercise of the Gift of healing
you may read it clearly in the Disciples practice <hi>Mark</hi>

for the Church-policie, and yet you adde almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly,
that <hi>it needs no divine warrant:</hi> Then what

the subjoined Antithesis of <hi>Common</hi> doth give us to

duely squared, and it is all we contend for: Search
therefore the Scriptures and whatever latitude may be
left therein, as to the regulation of necessary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
circumstances, according to decencie and order,
for Edification; Yet I am confident, that as to the
substance and main of the Officers, Discipline, and

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59845:70"/>
clearly condemned, and we justified: but if by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture, to contain <hi>direct rules,</hi> for the
Church-policie, you understand, that it only hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out <hi>indirect, unstraight and ambiguous rules,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to any forme, as may best sute &amp; serve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,

to your scope; but as far from Scripture, as it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to the truth of God, and Great ends of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
2. What do you understand by the <hi>Church policie?</hi>
its Officers, Discipline and Government are the things
which we contend for, If you think these <hi>half Civil,</hi>
I would gladly learn what a <hi>Church as such</hi> can have
more Ecclesiastick; certainly if a distinct Head,
Jesus Christ; a distinct Authority, flowing from that
<hi>all Power</hi> given to him; a distinck manner, nothing
like but wholly opposite to the way of Civil rule; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
effects and ends, as Holinesse and eternall perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are from external justice, and temporal peace;
and lastly a distinct subsistence of the Church, and its
Policie, not only when disowned, but mortally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
by the Civil Powers, may prove the Policie
Ecclesiastick to differ from the Civil, there can be
nothing more clearly disterminat; but if by <hi>Policie</hi>
you only mean the externall protection, and assistance,
which the Civil Magistrat may, and ought to
give to the Church, it is not only half, but wholly
Civil, as to its rise and cause; and therefore the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
thereof we render, under God,
heartily and entirely, to the Powers, which he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
up: I might further question what you call <hi>half
Civil?</hi> and how you come to deny that <hi>Divine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
which at first you <hi>half grant?</hi> but I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my self, to declare the falshood of your inference,
understood of the Discipline and Government of
Gods house, the subject of our debate, by shewing you
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59845:70"/>
that its plain contradictory is a Scripture truth: viz.
<hi>The Scriptures were designed by God for the Purifying of
the hearts, and conversations of men,</hi> and therefore it was
necessary they should &amp; they do contain direct rules for
the Churches Policie, wholly Ecclesiastick, &amp; appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Jesus Christ: The reason of the consequence
is clear, not only because the Church Policie, viz. its
Officers, Discipline and Government, are expresly and
directly ordained by our Lord, for our Sanctification &amp;
Salvation as I have formerly shewen, &amp; therefore their
necessity such as cannot without the highest presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be called in question: but also, because their use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
in order to these ends, is by diverse Scriptures
undeniably held forth: <hi>And he (who as the Son was
faithful over his own house) gave some Apostles and some
Prophets. &amp;c.</hi> yea and all the Gifts, Power, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and Directions to be found in Scripture,
concerning them, <hi>for the work of the Ministrie, the
Edifying of the body of Christ, and perfecting of the Saints</hi>
Is a truth so evident, that I marvail, how you could
adventure on this Architectonick reasoning, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to lay down the end and project of the Gospel,
and then frame and Modell its institutions, and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
according to your own imagination, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
humbly endeavour, in the recognisance of his
wonderfull love, and fidelity to, and care of his
Church, his own body, with all sobriety, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the knowledge, and practice of what things-so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he hath ordained for its edification? I might
further remember you, that the rebuke, and all the
Censures of discipline are for <hi>Edification,</hi> the <hi>Saving
of the soul, making sound in the faith, and Causing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to fear:</hi> and that we finde the exercise of the
Churches Authority, and Government, in that
Meeting and Decree made at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> attended
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59845:71"/>
with <hi>The consolation and establishment of the Churches,</hi>
But if your own concessions be but a little pressed,
they will easily exhibite the inconsistencie of your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
you say then, <hi>That the common rules are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
1. <hi>That there should be Church Officers,</hi> and are
not their Power, Degrees and Ministerial Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as certainly therein defined. 2 <hi>That these should
be separate for that function,</hi> Ought not then the best
among them, give themselves continually and wholly
to Prayer, and to the Ministerie of the word, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
usurping a stated superior Order of Governing,
as their special work, let be immixing themselves by
privilege in secular Courts and affaires? 3. <hi>That they
should be obeyed:</hi> is this their power for discipline and
Government set down in Scripture, &amp; not also its rules
&amp; limites? Were the Apostles more then Ministers
of Christ, and Stewards of the Mysteries of God?
was not the sure word of Prophecie their great war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant?
When the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is about to set order
in the Church of <hi>Coriath,</hi> hear his Preface <hi>by ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of me even as I also am of Christ:</hi> And as in the
ordinance of the Lords Supper, he only delivers <hi>what he
had received of the Lord,</hi> so, even as to that smallest
of matters, the Length and Fashion of the hair, doth
he use any other Authority, then what he seconds
with rational persuasion? How far was he then from
that dominion over our Faith, which you ascribe to
the Church, not only of appointing significant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
Ceremonies, but of abrogating things as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
ordained, in your opinion, as the true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
4, You say, <hi>That things should be done to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Edification and Peace,</hi> keep within these bounds,
and invert not this Method, and we are agreed; but
if you subsist not in the regulation of the manner, but
wil impose New things, which the Lord requireth not,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59845:71"/>
nay, which he abhorreth even your own inventions,
framed to your own lusts and interests, or produced by
your delusions, &amp; then make peace your Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
ye will not allow it to such, as in Conscience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conforme; the Lord, who hath founded Zion &amp;
Reigns in it, &amp; who hath builded his House &amp; rules o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it, will one day judge: Thus you see how these your
<hi>everlasting obligations,</hi> do fully conclude, all the truths
that we assert: Where you adde that <hi>the other Rules
are now altered with the alterable state of things whereunto
they were accommodate,</hi> if you understand it soundly,
of these things only which are indeed ceased, it is a
very certain and allowable truth; but you remember
not that in the very Page preceeding, you impute this
alteration so grosly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the bare Practice of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, (a very doubtfull terme) and thereby
not only unsetle Scripture foundations, as to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but endeavour to introduce such an arbitrary
authority in the Church, that in place of establishing
true Christian Liberty, which you seem here to assert,
it is evident, that you go about plainly to set up; an
absolute Spiritual tyranny, over the Church of God,
and so to load it with the Ceremonies, and innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
a bondage more severe then the old dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from which we are liberate; but blessed be our
Lord Jesus Christ, who hath delivered us, not only
from that old Law of Ordinances, but hath made us
free, that we should be no more the Servants of
Men, nor liable to be judged <hi>in meat or drink, or
in respect of an holy Day, or of the new Moon, or of the
Sabbath;</hi> and having blotted out the hand writting of
God's Ordinances, that was against us, hath put no
new blank in Mens hands for their own devices,
and superstitions: To conclude then, in your own
words, <hi>these things are so rationall and also so clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:59845:72"/>
from your own concessions, that I see nothing
either to be excepted against our Conformity to the
Scripture pattern and the true Christian liberty, both
in opinion, and practice, which we maintain; or to
be alleaged for your pretended liberty, consisting
in a Licentious absurd imposing on such, whom you
acknowledge to be free.</p>
            <p>But in order to this last point, viz. your attempt
to remove a Scripture rule, easie in it self, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
true Libertie to its observers, and to set up
an unwarrantable Yoke of Church Authority in its
place, I conceive it is, that here you go about, to
represent your N. C. as a vain and clamorous boaster,
of the <hi>Crown, Throne and Kingdome of our Lord,</hi> on
purpose, to prejudicate against our just complaint of
your invasion and Robbery; but waving your Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Methods, I shal only endeavour to speak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urth
the words of truth and sobernesse. I shall not here
discourse of the Kingdom of Christ in all its parts,
whereunto we finde in Scripture both the outward
Protection of the Church, vengeance upon Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and all judgement, even the great and last ascriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but, in order to our present purpose, I affirme
plainly, that our Lord Jesus as the Redeemer, is in
a peculiar manner exalted to be Head and King in and
over his Church, by vertue of which Kingdome, he
sendeth forth, and Authorizeth his Ministers, hath
defined their Order and Power, determined Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and given and declared Laws to be observed in
his house, and that in such a manner, and in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that in all things properly thereto relating,
he hath only left to the Officers by himself appointed,
a Ministerial power of administration; so, that there
is neither place left, nor power given, to diminish
from, or adde to the Officers, Laws, Censures,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59845:72"/>
and Orders, which he hath therein established
that these things are so, cannot be better cleared,
then by remitting you to our larger Catechisme,
where, as you will finde satisfying Scripture proof for
their confirmation, so really I cannot but, by the
way, recommend to you its more serious study, for
the curing of that loosenesse in Principles, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in every thing you discover: My part at present
shall be to consider your strange discourse on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
You say then, <hi>Christ's throne, Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
are inward and spirituall not of the World, nor
as the Kindoms of the World.</hi> Sir, though I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Scripture phrase, in this matter to be
Metaphoricall; Yet I wish you had better observed
it, and forborn the hard and unused expression of an
<hi>Inward Crown:</hi> But to the question, Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is indeed in its power, and effects (the restric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a little above premised being remembred) <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and Spirituall,</hi> but doth it therefore follow, that
its administration is not externall and visible, when
the Lord declared all power to be given unto him,
and by vertue thereof sent forth his Apostles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and gathered Churches, having peculiar Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Laws, and Ordinances; was not this both visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and audible? Are not all the acts of Discipline
and Government, properly thereto referable, of the
same Nature? Our Lords Kingdom is truely <hi>not of
the World, nor as the Kingdomes thereof,</hi> is it therefore
not in the World? What doth this arguing conclude?
You proceed, <hi>a great part of his Kingdom is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
whereto he hath called us,</hi> and I grant, that as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and deliverance from Sin and Satan, are among
its choise benefites, and therefore the exultation of
<hi>Zachariah</hi> his thanksgiving, so our liberation from
the yoke of Jewish Ceremonies, and all such bondage,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59845:73"/>
is that which we readily acknowledge, in opposition
to you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> unwarrantable exactions: but what would
you thence inferre? because Christ hes liberate us from
the former slavery, and Pedagogie, hath he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
left us to the worse Tyranny of mens pretended,
and corrupted power, and deluded imagination? God
forbid; but as the hath set us free for ever, so he hath
only laid on us, his own easie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>oke, and light bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
of Pure and Evangelick ordinances, by which
our Liberty is so far from being intringed, that it is
thereby both preserved and enlarged.</p>
            <p>In the next place you say <hi>Since no Allegorie holds,
it is ridiculous to argue, because offices in a Kingdom are
named by the King, therefor it must be so in the Church.</hi>
It's answered 1. do you then think that our Lords
Kingdom is only Allegorick? Or because the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles
and badges, usuall in Earthly Kingdoms, are, in
a figure, thereto transferred, is it therefore wholly
a figure? but <hi>God hath set his King upon his holy Hill of
Zion, and Know you assuredly that God hath exalted
him to be both Lord and Christ, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Kingdom, in all the parts and privileg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
thereof, by him declared: Next it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that not only Christs Kingdom, in and over
his Church, is reall and certain, and that Officers
truely such, vested with his Authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
depending on Christ as King, are held forth by
the Scripture, and to be really found therein; but
seing he himself hath in the Gospel so expressly foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their mission, upon that <hi>All power,</hi> given unto
him, and <hi>Paul</hi> so plainly referres the giving of Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
&amp;c, unto his Ascension and exaltation, are you
not ashamed to alledge these things, to be only by us
concluded from the vain appearance of an Allegory
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59845:73"/>
And thus to make your self ridiculous, in that scorne
you intended for others? But poor wretch, you adde,
<hi>That we may as wel say, that there must be coin stamped by
Christ, as Officers appointed by him in his Church:</hi> (for
this is the runing of your words) Lord deliver you
from this profane Spirit: thinkest thou, that the
Kingdom of Christ, hath need of money, as it hath
indeed need of Officers? Or, because money is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and symony a frequent practice in your Church,
hes it therefore any place in Christs true Church? Sir,
your profane scoffing at the Kingdome of Christ is one
passage, amongst many, that give me Confidence to
say, <hi>arise O God plead thine own cause, remember how
the foolish man reproacheth thee dayly.</hi> But I professe I
am confounded in my self, when I think of my own
provocations, and on the iniquitie of his Sons and
Daughters; for if the abuse of the Glorious Gospel,
shineing amongst us in so much puritie, had not been
great, he would not have given up the dearly belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his Soul into the hand of such persecuting adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
and such scoffers at him, who justifie these
malicious mockers in <hi>Cajaphas</hi> Hall, with an over-plus
of wickednesse. O if he would returne, he would
quicklie emptie Pulpits, and Chairs in Universities
of such, who bend their tongues for lies, and make
the world see, because they have rejected knowledge,
he hath also rejected them that they shall be no
Priests to him.</p>
            <p>The next thing you subjoin is, <hi>what King will think
his prerogative lessened, by constituting a Corporation, to
whom he shall leave a liberty to cast themselves into what
mould they please, providing they obey the General Laws,
and hold that liberty of him.</hi> Thus you will alwayes
aspire to enter into the Counsel of God: if your vote
had been here asked, it is very like you would have
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59845:74"/>
bestowed large privileges upon that Church, where
you might have been a sharer; But we bless him to
whom the Church is committed, and on whom the
Government is laid, who hath provided better, and
given unto his Church complete Officers, perfect
Ordinances, true Laws, and good Statutes; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his house in all things: and therefore as we are
not to enquire, what the Lord might have done but
humbly and thankfully to acknowledge what he hath
done, so, in these things for men to disown his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and deny his bounty, and usurp to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a power of altering, what he hath established,
and fashioning the worship and Government of Gods
house, according to the device of their own heart,
is no doubt no lawful liberty, but a licentious inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ's prerogative, and a jealousie-provoking
sin of Laese Majestie Divine. That thus it stands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuixt
you and us, the preceeding passages do plainly
witness, and the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, as a
Son over his own house, so expresly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and preferred before the faithfulnesse of <hi>Moses,</hi>
is an argument, which you will never dissolve: You
say <hi>his faithfulnesse consisted in his discharging the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
given him by his Father:</hi> Most certain; but you
ask <hi>who told us that it</hi> (I suppose you mean the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Officers Ordinances and Government of the
house of God) <hi>was in the Fathers Commission?</hi> Herein
is a marvellous thing. You know that Jesus Christ
whrist was sent by the Father, to redeem, gather,
feed, guid and Govern his Church; and you see, that
as the things in question are thereto necessarie, so in
discharge hereof, he sends out Apostles, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
Ordains Officers, vests them with power and
Authority, instructs them to a Ministerial, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
administration and deportment, defines Censures,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59845:74"/>
appoints his Ordinances, and Laws, liberats the
Worship of God from the shadows, and types of the
Jewish Pedagogie, and cleares its true and spiritual
exercise and liberty, and finally acquits himself faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
in all his house: do you then question, if he did
these things, or doubt you that he did them by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission?
it is a hard <hi>Dilemma</hi> which you will never
evade: but you adde <hi>that if we argue from Moses it will
inferre that all particulars must be determined:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
you urge, <hi>that as Moses determines the dayes of
Separation for a legal uncleannesse, why doth not the
Gospel the like for spirituall uncleannesse?</hi> It's answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if you had taken up the Argument aright and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the faithfulnesse of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> not in
order to the same; but with relation to their respective
Commissions, You had not fallen into this mistake;
but the Scripture parallel, is clear, <hi>Moses</hi> as a servant
did faithfully &amp; completely order Gods house, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Our Lord much more as a Son, hath thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Church, his own house: Whence as it
doth no wayes follow, that whatsoever things were
institute by <hi>Moses,</hi> ought to have been in like manner
imitate by our Lord; so this is most concludent, that
as <hi>Moses,</hi> as a Servant, did diligently and exactly
execute his Commission, in order to the Tabernacle,
its service, Ministers, and all its appurtinents, so
Christ, both by reason of a command received and
of his interest and power, hath exceeded the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>Moses,</hi> in the Ordering and appointment of
things appertaining to his Church: But for the better
confirming our Reasoning, and the removing of your
Mistake, I do only recommend to you this obvious
truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Commendation of our Lord
held out by the Apostle in this comparison, institute
betuixt him and <hi>Moses,</hi> regardeth the Manner, but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59845:75"/>
not the subject, of their administrations: Not what
was the Nature of extent of <hi>Moses</hi> his trust, but what
was his diligence, and faithfulnes in the discharge;
is the light and argument of the parallel: suppose two
intrusted in imployments, wholly diverse, and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate,
and the exact fidelity of the one trustie, to
be notourly known, may not the faithfulness of the
other, be thence very properly commended? And
wil not this commendation very evidently inferre,
that as the first was punctually observant of all things
committed, so, the second did equall his exactness,
without giving the least ground to conclude, that
therefore either the second must have done the same
or like things, with the first, or yet that the first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
was as extensive, as that entrusted to the
second: this being duely perpended, and it being
certain, that not the establishing of an universall, and
perpetual order to all and every of the concerns of the
jewish Church, as appeares from the alteration and
addition made thereafter, by <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi>
but only the setting up of the Tabernacle, its Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and service, according to the command, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
to the then state of that People, was
to <hi>Moses</hi> (and that only by peremptory prescript,
as to a servant) enjoined; whereas unto our
Lord, as a Son over his own house was freely
committed the unchangeable establishment of his
Church, in all its requisits unto his coming again:
then if our Lords faithfulnesse be indeed equall to that
of <hi>Moses,</hi> his appointing of Officers, Ordinances,
and Laws, necessare and convenient to his Church,
with all requisite exactnesse, though neither after the
pattern, nor in that particular and peremptory strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
of <hi>Moses</hi> his prescriptions, can neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
nor declined: If you yet cavill, that this sayes
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59845:75"/>
too much <hi>viz.</hi> that all particulars must be now as of
old determined, It's answered, the determining of

of <hi>Moses</hi> his Commission, and therein did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
much of the Pedagogie, and rigour of that shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dispensation, from which God having now
relieved us, and given us the clear light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and these things necessare and convenient to its
holy ends, in simplicity, parity and liberty, it is
evident, that as our Lords faithfulnesse under this
Gospel administration, did oblige him to provide the
Church, in all things necessary and convenient,
and liberate us from all further burthen of Antiquate
rites and Ceremonies, beyond the necessary exigences
of decencie and order, so, he hath fully acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in this his own house, as <hi>Moses</hi> in his house,
and by this his faithfulnes, for ever excluded all your
superinduced humane inventions, whether in
Church-Officers, Government or Worship: in a
word, so ill grounded is the absurdity, wherewith
you would urge us; and the faithfulnesse of Christ,
compared to that of Moses, is so farre from saying
too much, viz. <hi>that all particulars must be in the Gospel
determined,</hi> that it inferres the direct contraire, <hi>viz,</hi>
that seing God having committed to <hi>Moses</hi> a Law,
descending to a most strict prescription of Particulars,
and Ceremonial observances, he was therein faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
therefore our Lord more faithful having a dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
entrusted to him only of Gospel Ordinances,
with a becoming liberty, hath in his fidell discharge,
both fully defined the former, and established the
latter, free from all humane, either General or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
inventions, and impositions: But you go on
and tell us, <hi>That Moses instituted no Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the way we use it, and that Synagogues their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59845:76"/>
&amp; chief Rulers were not appointed by</hi> Moses, <hi>&amp; yet
no unlawful thing, since countenanced by Christ &amp; his Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:</hi>
Whence you conclude, <hi>That either what they did, was
founded on Divine tradition, (which no Christian will
grant) or that a form of Government was devised by
men; and if the Iews had that Libertie, certainly the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Church is more free, as to these externals.</hi> Sir,
not to detain you in a curious enquiry into the special
composition, gradual advance and necessarie altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the jewish Policie, It's answered, 1. I have
just now told you, that Granting <hi>Moses</hi> did not insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
any Church-Government as used by us, because
neither given him in commission, not at that time
needfull, and agreeable to the condition of a wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people, and the dispensation they were then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
Yet the Scripture Argument from our Lords
faithfulnesse, preferred to that of <hi>Moses,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive
of the same, yea of a greater care of all things
necessarie, and requisite for his Church, to the end
of the World, then that which <hi>Moses</hi> did adhibite,
even in the setting up of the Tabernacle, and its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
service; must of necessity inferre, both that
our Lord did <hi>de facto</hi> provide for the Ministerie, and
Government requisite in his own house, and that the
Ministerie and Government, which we finde descriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Scriptures of the New Testament, are of his
appointment, and such as may not be altered. 2.
Not to mention the evident necessity of Synagogues,
up and down the Land, for the end of teaching the
people, a most certain dutie, which could hardly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be performed, the dispersion of <hi>Levi</hi> among
the Tribes, <hi>Moses</hi> blessing, designing him to teach
<hi>Iacob</hi> judgements, and <hi>Israel</hi> Gods Law, <hi>Davids</hi>
appointing 4400. of the <hi>Hebronites, 1 Chron.</hi> 26. 30.
31. 32. thorow all Israel, in all businesse of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59845:76"/>
Lord, and for every matter pertaining to God, as well
as affaires of the King, and <hi>Asaphs</hi> regret, for the
burning up of all the Synagogues of God in the Land
(not to mention the coincidence often hinted at in the
Old Testament, of Judges and Teachers of the Law,
in every City, and their appointment out of the Tribe
of <hi>Levi</hi>) are grounds, more then probable of the
Divine institution of Synagogues, and their Rulers;
and that they were no humane invention, 3. The
evident Testimonies that we have in the Word of
God, not only of the Lords special appointing of
the Tabernacle, its whole service and Ordinances,
framed and suited to the then State and Posture of that
people; but also, how that he Reformation, and
establishment made in <hi>Davids</hi> dayes, together with
the building of the Temple, its Officers and Porters,
were particularly directed by the Spirit of God, in
<hi>Samuel, David,</hi> and the Seers of these times, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in that work, 1 <hi>Chrom.</hi> 9. 22. and 28. 11.
may sufficiently evince to any rational discerner, that
the Synagogues, more material, then many of these
circumstantial things expresly commanded, were
also ordained by the Lord, and likewise instruct
all to a most tender, and precise adherence to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Will of God, in all Matters relating to his
house and Worship: And here, upon the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>David,</hi> I cannot omit to remember, how
that in all the Scripture, we finde not a parallel and
type, more frequent then that of our Lords King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
in and over his Church, to that of <hi>David</hi>
over <hi>Israel:</hi> seeing then, that these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igures have their
certain grounds of resemblance, and there is not a
more conspicuous typifying Character, in the person
of <hi>David;</hi> then, that of his Royall ordering, and
establishing the house, and Church of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59845:77"/>
he was raised up, and particularly inspired, and
commanded, though the faithfulness of Christ, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to that of <hi>Moses,</hi> should not, Yet his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in the Throne of <hi>David</hi> to reigne over the house of
Jacob for ever, doth undeniably conclude both the
Government and complete setlement of the Church,
by us contended for: 4. If you would reflect upon
the Lords singular Providence over his People Israel,
<hi>first,</hi> in that Theocratie, whereby in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he Governed them, unto the dayes of <hi>Saul,</hi> 2. in
their <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and the holy Oracles of
God, which they constantly enjoyed, 3. In the
continuall assistance, which they had almost in all
times, of Prophets immediatly inspired, you cannot
lightly suppose, that either Synagogues, or any other
Lawfull institution, concerning their Law and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
were a meer humane invention; but though
the evidences of their appointment, remaining with
us upon record, were more obscure, these passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
alone, do render it more then probable, that their
Authority and rise was Divine. 5 The comparing of
the Church of Christ, to that of the Old-Testament
is so unfavourable to your cause, and there are such
manifest disparities in that parallel, that it rather mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
against you then for you; for as the Ordinances
of that dispensation, were such, as were to be done
away and abolished; and therefore were appointed
by God (<hi>who in times past spake unto the Fathers by the
Prophets at Sundry times and in divers manners</hi>) in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant
and mutable forme, So, the Lord having in
these last dayes, and now in the end of the World,
spoken unto us by his son, to whom he sayeth, <hi>thy
Throne O God is for ever and ever,</hi> the Anointing of
the most Holy, attended by the sealing up the Vision,
and Prophecie, and the setting up of his everlasting
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59845:77"/>
Dominion, do infallibly conclude, the introducing
of a more excellent Ministerie, and the full and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
establishment of all Ordinances, requisite to
the ingathering, and perfecting of the Saints: Sir, if
these things were considered by you, and that our
Lord hath now at last, by himself, given and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for us, a complete and perfect ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ointment, of
all means necessary in his Church, you should finde
more Soul-satisfaction in walking at true liberty in the
observing of his precepts; then in the Lascivient fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of your own vain Imagination, which not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to rest in the blessed change that our Lord hath
made, of the first Covenant, not faultles, unto this
New one and better ordered, under the specious
aspiring to a liberty, equal to that of the Jewish
Church, doth plainly charge, the Christian Church,
with the imperfections of that, which is decayed,
and vanished. Having thus examined and answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the strain and scope of your discourse, I shall
briefly go over what remains: You say <hi>Our Saviour
and his Apostles countenanced the Synagogues and their
Rulers,</hi> and why not? seing not only their first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
appears to have been such, as I have declared;
but also other occasions, noted in the Gospel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you have no advantage, did clearly thereto invite:
Next you say <hi>That this their practice was either founded
on divine Tradition (which no Christian will grant) or
that a form of Government not unlawful was devised by
Men:</hi> I answere 1. I have exhibited already war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
for their practice, beside tradition. 2. Might
not the positive manner of the institution of Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
have been then more clear, while the thing
was in observance, then now it is, after its abolition,
and the revolution of so many Ages? 3. If I were
concerned in your parenthesis, against Divine Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59845:78"/>
I would ask you, why do you thus without
distinction, make the admitting of it in the Jewish
Church so great an absurdity? That there were Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Traditions before the Word was committed to
writing, and that under the dark, imperfect, and
progressive dispensation of the Old Testament, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
nevertheless by a more immediate presence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
traditions might both have been more usuall,
and were less fallible, may be probabely enough held,
by these who yet, now, after the full and perfect
revelation of the Gospel by our Lord Jesus Christ, do
upon solid grounds, very justly reject unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
in the Christian Church; By which reasons,
you may perceive, that the one member of your
<hi>Dilemma,</hi> labouring so sadly of untruth, both in its
supposition and the absurdity thence inferred, it can
no wayes be cogent to enforce the other, of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Mans devising in the point of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
even in the Jewish Church, let be in the
Christian, so many wayes more excellent: But in
the close you insinuate <hi>That the greater liberty you plead
for to the Christian Church is in externals:</hi> That this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ambiguous objection is only intended for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
retreat, is apparent from all the preceeding
discourse, seeing, if by <hi>Externals,</hi> you understand
things in their own nature extrinsick to the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church, and which in the New Testament
have no further use allowed, then is conducible to
decencie, and order, we willingly grant, that the
Christian Church (being in effect absolutely liberate
from the old burthen of Ceremonies, and not (as
you vainly conceit) endowed with a greater, and
more arbitrarie power of imposing) is indeed herein
more free then the Iewish was: But if by <hi>externals</hi>
you mean, as alas the instances premised do too
plainly speak, all the visible Ordinances of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59845:78"/>
Church, specially that of Government at least, what
ever is in it visible, the liberty that you would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
is not more contraire to the Scripture, both of
the Old and New Testament, as I have shown, then
most licentious and irreligious.</p>
            <p>Your last cavill against the exercise of our Lords
Kingdom, in ordering the visible administration of
his Church, is, <hi>That if this were inferred by his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
over the Church, his being also the head of the World,
should argue the same determination in the order of the
World, as well as in that of the Church.</hi> And having
made your N. C. seemingly and poorly check you
by saying, that <hi>Christs Church is dearer to him then all
the World:</hi> Then you restrict the absurd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y, which
you press, unto the civil Matters of the Church, and
proceed in such a rambling discourse, that I am at a
stand, how to medle with it: But waving the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of your impertinencies, I answere 1. That the
Mediatory Kingdom of Our Lord over his Church,
and his Natural (so to speak) Soveraignity over the
World, are so grosly here by you confounded, that I
can only intreat you to be more serious in reading,
and searching what the Scripture doth very distinctly
hold forth: 1. Of their different rise, the one given,
the other not given. 2. Of their different objects and
ends, the one having &amp; proposing the World &amp; men in
order to a regular and peaceable being in it, the other
the Church and men therein called unto spiritual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and eternal life: And lastly of their different ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations,
the one grounded on the dictats of
reason, and using external Magisterial authority and
power, and sensible rewards and pains, the other
proceeding on divine revelation, and carried on by
no such externals, save a simple Ministerie, and the
power internal and spiritual; and then I doubt not but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59845:79"/>
you will of your self rectify such aberrations, 2. The
parallel of Gods Government over the World, with
the Kingdom of Christ over his Church, is, so far
from concluding, that Arbitrary or Architectonick
power, which you endeavour to set up in Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
equall to that in Civils, that the contraire may
from thence be sufficiently evinced, thus, therefore
God hath not determined the order of Civil matters,
either in the World or in his Church; because an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitectonick
and free disposing Government, limited
with general rules, necessare to its ends, was most
suitable to that almost absolute right and power,
which he hath given unto man, in and over the things
about which it is conversant: but so it is that the
things of the Church, about which our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
his Kingdom is exercised, being wholly Spiritual,
are neither committed to our power, nor left unto
our arbitriment; And plainly such, whereof, the
Lord in all times, hath reserved to himself, the
sole determination: and therefore it was clearly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessare,
that all the Ordinances, Ministerie, and
Government thereto pertaining, should be also by
him alone, ordered, and appointed; which dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
doth not only reject but unanswerably retort
your Argument from this pretense. 3. Your great
error, and greater presumption in this question is,
that apprehending our Argument for the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Ordinances and Government of Gods house, to
be taken from the simple position of his Kingdom,
and the consequences, that by allusion to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the Earth may be thence deduced, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
not that the Scripture not only holds out his
Kingdom, and the nature thereof, very distinctly;
but also doth particularly exhibite, all the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
necessare unto its ends, and appointed to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59845:79"/>
observed; So that our reasoning being wholly
Scriptural, both in its ground and superstructure,
your redargution from imaginary reason, opposed to
the clear and positive Counsel of God, is plainly
irrational: if in the dayes of old, Israel had changed the
Law, and Ordinances given, and therein disowned
Gods particular Kingdom and Government over
them, and notwithstanding thereof pretended to the
liberty of the Nations about, seing this their liberty
was no wayes determined by, but very consistent
with, the Lord's high Soveraignity, under which all
do bow, had this poor reasoning, justifyed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion?
certainly not: how much less then, can it
conclude the exemption of the Church from Christs
Kingdom, in these Ordinances therein by him esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
of which the Lords peculiar Kingdom over
Israel was but a slight adumbration.</p>
            <p>But you say, <hi>Seing justice is a part of Gods Law, as
well as devotion, why doth not the Lord determine how his
Church should be governed, in Civils.</hi> It's answered, Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
is indeed a part of Gods Law, and he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
determined, as particularly as the right, which
God hath given to man in Civils, doth permit; or
the ends thereof do require; but as this your <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical</hi>
equalizing of Mans liberty, in matters of
devotion, to that power he hath in things Civil, doth
sadly discover the woful vanity of an unserious Spirit;
So the <hi>Geometrical</hi> analogie of Gods determining,
anent our Devotion, wholly dependent upon his
prescript, unto his general appointment in matters
of outward justice, accommodate to that power and
liberty he hath therein left us, in place of inferring an
equal power to Man in both, doth, on the contraire,
evidently demonstrate, that the Lords determination,
in matters of Religion, is as much more particular,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59845:80"/>
then his Commandments are in the things of justice, as
our Liberty in the former, is more restricted, then
our Liberty in the latter: if you had but considered,

               </gap> hath given the Earth unto the Children
of Men, and that, the things thereof being put under
his feet, an agreeable power of Government therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
is certainly given unto his hand; whereas our
Lords Church and People are his peculiar people, his
chosen Nation, redeemed and bought with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
bloud, and not their own; let be to have the
things, concerning their Souls redemption, in their
power, how happily had you been delivered from
this strange confounding of things, Sacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane;
And how clearly might you have perceived,
that Gods Dominion over the World, consisting in
General Laws, suited to its object, and swayed
by his Soveraign Providence, in order to his holy ends,
doth bear but little likenesse, to our Lord Jesus his
Rule, and Government in his Church, as a Son over
his own house, and also its Ordinances. But to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
your point you adde, that <hi>you hope we will grant
that the Civil Peace is more necessary to the very being
of the Church, then is Order in Discipline:</hi> Whence
you insinuate <hi>that the former as well as the latter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s particular determination:</hi> Not to Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
you by frustrating your hope; Sir, you know
so well, that a thing though more necessary; Yet if
such only by a mediate and consequential necessity,
may therefore fall under a quite diverse disposition,
from that, which though less necessary, by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
and extrinsick necessity, to the being of the
Church, then the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, do
the former therefore, aswell and in the same manner
with the latter, belong to Christs Kingdom? As to
what you adde, <hi>That it was for this reason that the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59845:80"/>
things of Civil peace were determined in the Old Law:</hi>
This did so certainly flow from Gods peculiar inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in that People, as a Kingdom, as well as a Church,
that I make no answere; That which you subjoin,
for evincing, that either the Lords Kingdom over
the Earth doth extend to the appointing of Civil Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
or els his Kingdom over his Church imports
no such thing; is so manifestly, repugnant to the very
nature of the things, and the Lords declared pleasure
(the best decision) Nay this whole discourse doth
so foolishly, and laxely cast, and weigh things Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and Profane in the same ballance of vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
that I almost repent my noticeing of it so
much; but see the flatterie of delusion, having made
your N. C. childishly to decline all Reason, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and, in the fright forsooth of your strong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
retreat to his Ministers and the Bible, you
ridiculously triumph over him, and think, your self
so much Master of the field of Reason, that insinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your own praise, in the description of Sound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

Devil did? I desire you may explain your self, if not
for our concernment, at least for the Scriptures vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication:
In the mean time, I am heartily willing
that both what you and what I have said be rightly
pondered, and whether the Church in matters of

                  </gap>velation</hi> was
made in a Mystick phrase, that the <hi>Seven starres</hi> who
are the <hi>Angels,</hi> do certainly signifie the many teachers
that were in every one of these Churches, that in the
<hi>Candle-sticks,</hi> as in the <hi>Starres,</hi> we finde the same
oneness, and number, and lastly that though to the
Angel be the inscription for address; yet we finde the
body of all the Epistles written directly to the whole
Churches, these things I say occurring I protest I
could never discerne more reason in this argument,
for subjecting these Churches unto seven superior sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Prelates; then for making the same Prelats really
Angels, or turning every Church into a Candle stick;
Or if I may adduce another instance, not absimilare

            <p>When you have spent your endeavours upon the

you conclude in these words <hi>That how this excrescing

power, should have crept into the whole Church, and
no mention when it came in, no Prince or Universal
Council to introduce, it, in the times of persecution when
the Church usually is purest, and most free of pride,
no Secular consideration to flatter, but the first brunt
of the persecution alwayes against it, and how none op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it, if this was not introduced by Apostles, or
Apostolicall men, passeth my Divination:</hi> And really
Sir, as to its particular Methods, and increase, so
doth it mine: And so much more then it doth yours,
that I am perswaded from clear Scripture, that it was
not only not introduced, but plainly reprobate by our
Lord and his Apostles; Yet am I so little thereby
stumbled, that the more dark and obscure I finde its
rise and progresse, I am the more confirmed, that it
is the very Mysterie of iniquity, and do so much the
more admire the incorruptible and eternall Truth of
the Gospel, which as in the beginning it foretold
the coming, and took very early Notice of the first
motions of this prodigie of wickednesse; So hath it,
through the many ages of its exaltation, preserved it
self against, and now in the latter dayes overcomes
its Malice; But to review your discourse more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
I have already shewed, that the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Government institute by our Lord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and practised by the Apostles, was plainly
Presbyterian; if so, what place for further inquirie?
Is your alledged traditional subsequent humane insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Prelacie of greater moment? 2. That even
in the Primitive times, and for 140. years after our
Saviour, no vestige of Prelacie appears upon record,
is the consentient opinion of the best Searchers, both
on your, and our part. 3. This plea of Antiquity
hath already been so fully handled, and improved
both by yours, and ours, specially <hi>Hamond</hi> on your
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59845:82"/>
part, and <hi>Blondel, Salmasius,</hi> and other Learned ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Christ on ours, that there needs nothing be
added: and where the advantage is, the Ingenuous
may easily discerne: He that desires a solid and short
accompt of the matter, may read the appendix to the
<hi>jus Divinum Ministerii Evangelici:</hi> But you proceed
to give in some poor scrapes of pretended Antiquity,
which not only the most sure, and clear, and farre
more ancient Scriptures of Truth, but even the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
answeres which they have often receaved
might well have made you to forbear: And first you
say That <hi>Ignatius his Epistles are plain language:</hi> And
so they are indeed, but too plain for you to have cited,
as the following passages, compared with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
subjoined may evince: In the Epistle to the
Tralliani, we have [<hi>what is a Bishop, but he, that is
possest of all Principality, and Authority beyond all,
as much as is possible for men? Reverence the Bishop as
ye do'Christ, as the holy Apostles have Commanded,
&amp;c. As the Lord Christ doth nothing without his Father,
so, must ye do nothing without your Bishop, Let nothing
seem right or equall to you, that is contra to his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>]
In the Epistle to the <hi>Philad.</hi> [<hi>Let the Princes
obey the Emperours, the Souldiers the Princes, the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
and the rest of the Clergie, with all the People,
and the Souldiers, and the Princes, and the Emperour,
let them obey the Bishop</hi>] (no doubt the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>)
In the Epistle to the <hi>Smyrnenses; [The Scripture saith
honour God and the King, but I say, honour God as the
Author and Lord of all things, and the Bishop as the
Prince of Priests, resembling the image of God, of God
for his principality, of Christ for his Priesthood, &amp;c.
There is none greater then the Bishop in the Church, who
is consecrated for the Salvation of the whole World, &amp;c.
Let all men follow the Bishop as Christ the Father, &amp;c.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59845:82"/>
It is not Lawfull without the Bishop to baptize, or offer,
&amp;c. He that doth any thing without consulting the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Worshippeth the Devil:</hi> Now on the other hand
let us hear what the Scripture saith to this purpose,
<hi>Who then is</hi> Paul <hi>who</hi> Apollo <hi>but Ministers by whom
ye beleeve? Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of
Christ; for we preach not our selves, but Christ Iesus
the Lord, and our selves your Servants for Iesus sake:
Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of your joy: for by faith ye stand. But so shall it
not be among you, whosoever will be great among you shall
be your Minister, and whosoever of you will be the chiefest,
shall be Servant of all:</hi> to these adde the practices,
and other professions of the Apostles concerning
themselves, and their fellow-Labourers, and really
Sir, when you shall make these things found in <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
consistent even with the strain of pure Religion,
and the truth of the Gospel, let be to the Orthodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xie,
and Piety of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the simplicity of his
times; then shall I cede to the Authority of these
Letters: Only in the mean time let me tell you, that
for all the pains that <hi>Hamond</hi> hath taken, to assert their
Faith, the words above cited, do savour so strongly
of most gross and corrupt interpolation; that not only
I reject their Testimony, as to the matter of Prelacie;
but do esteem even the passages that may be therein
found for Presbyterie, as to the <hi>Trallians, be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Presbyterie, as to the Apostles of Iesus
Christ, The Presbyters are the Council of God, and

or no value. 2. You mention <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, but
hold, I preceive your second Edition mends your
first, and this your practice like to that of your more
innocent friend Mr. <hi>Coluin,</hi> in his verses, of giving
us second Editions, bearing additions, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertissment,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59845:83"/>
had indeed abused me, If by accident I
had not fallen in the review of my papers, to make
use of your second Copie, and in this you tell us, in
the next place of the <hi>Apostolicall Canons, a work of
very venerable Antiquitie, at least the first fiftie of
them, though perhaps none of the Apostles:</hi> But first
why say you <hi>Perhaps,</hi> in a matter beyond all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
2. Not to trouble you with Criticisms,
he who would be resolved anent the Authority of
these Canons, let him only read them: And as I am
confident, he will be farre from thinking either the
first 50, or the rest of them Apostolicall, So I am
certain the mention made in the 3. Can. of <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,

render their venerable Antiquity of no moment, in
our present Controversie: so that neither your 40 but
in effect the 38. Canon, though it were more positive,
and expresse for your Prelatick preheminence, nor
your Synodicall injunction, to the same purpose,
both posterior to the first Primitive purity, are of any
regard: but 3. so wretched is the cause that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,

wherein they complain of the want of one to Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,

upon them:</hi> but pray Sir, If a society consisting of
Members all equal in power, but having a Head or

neither you nor I have given any great <hi>Specimen</hi> of
this knowledge, or said so much, as the half of
what is obviously to be found, in almost any

            <p>Sir, I must tell you further, if I my selfe were alone
concerned in this reflection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I would scarce look upon
it as a reproach worth the wipeing off, to be as great
a stranger to these things as ye take me to be, nor would
I think many cubits were added to my stature to be
as knowing in them as your self; yet it is known
that I tell the world no news, when I say, that
there have been (and to this day are) not a few great
men of our way who have given such proof of their
knowledge in these ancillarie and minutious things,
whereof you represente us as ignorant; as have made
your greatest Rabbies finde, that wherein they gloried
they were not short of them; and if ye know not
this, yet seem to have lost your silly self in the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
of Antiquitie, and by this means are fallen
under the shameful reproach of being <hi>peregrinus Domi:</hi>
and if ye know it, and yet so superciliously assert the
contraire, what Apologie can ye make for speaking so
great an untruth, that will either satisfie the world or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59845:85"/>
your own Conscience. But Sir, ingenously I professe,
I pitie you for your Vanitie and folly; for it seems
ye think this the only expedient to make the world
beleeve the pregnancie of your pate, and Pronounce
you worthie of the Chair: but Sir, it will onely make
the more serious weep to remember who did once fill
it, and should have filled it still, when they consider
how it is become the seat of a scorner; and the lesse
serious will laugh at your prodigious folly. I have only
one overture to propose unto you, that your vanity
may be with some handsomeness hereafter coutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the world may let pass what you say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
quarrelling at it, as a known falshood: And it is
this, in your after comparings and measurings of your
abilities, that you may be taken notice of for a <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>such,</hi>
be so wise as to compare your self with your
Fellow-Curats, if ye hope to bear the bell, but when
ye insinuate a comparison, with so many burning and
shining lights, and then, in your Juvenile pride and
self-conceit, arrogate a preference to these, ye do
only force men to take notice of, and enquire into,
your shame and short-coming: And, if I mistake not,
fall upon the most certain method of making your self

               </gap>ink above ground. Sir, if, in these two or three
lines, I have digressed contrary to my inclination,
the occasion will justifie it, and charity persuades to
it. But, 3. You tell us, that <hi>in the Council of</hi> Nice,
<hi>Speaking of the power of Metropolitans; the Canon sayes,
let the ancient customes be in force:</hi> It's answered 1. We

These customes in this respect, might will
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59845:85"/>
therein be termed Antient, without the least contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
to my assertion. 2. It's evident enough from
many suffrages, that as the primitive Episcopacie,
which succeeded to Presbyterie, the Government
first institute by our Lord and his Apostles, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in the Christian Church, did only import the
humane invention of a <hi>Prostasia,</hi> for Order; So the
custome of Metropolitans, in these times, did differ
nothing from it, as may appear from the 33. Canon
of these called Apostolical already cited, wherein he
is only termed <hi>Primus Gentis Episcopus,</hi> and tyed to
the advice of his <hi>Coëpiscopi:</hi> In the next place, you
tell us, that <hi>nothing can be alledged against your Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
power, but Some few or disjointed places of some
Authors, which at most Prove, that they judged not the
origen of Bishops to be divine, and none save</hi> Aerius, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
an Heretick, did ever speak against the difference,
betuixt Bishops and Presbyters:</hi> Sir, if you did not here
acknowledge, almost all that I desire, I could easily
shew you, that not only the Scriptures of the New
Testament, and the agreeable practice of the Apostl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and their Immediate successors are against your
Prelatick excrescent power; but that even for several
ages thereafter, while both Bishops and Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
did exercise their <hi>Prostasian,</hi> your Diocesan
Prelat, having the sole power of Ordination and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
was unknown, yea expresly reprobate:
but because the <hi>appendix</hi> whereunto I have already
referred, and <hi>Smectymnus,</hi> do plainly make out this
point, I shall not detain you: As for <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rius,</hi> it's
true, he held that a Bishop and a Presbyter do not
differ, and that <hi>Augustin</hi> cals this <hi>proprium ejus dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
his proper Opinion, and Epiphanius, dogma furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osum
et stolidum, a furious and foolish opinion,</hi> and that
both of them do ranck him among Hereticks; but
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59845:86"/>
seing they also accuse him of <hi>Arr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ar truth, <hi>viz. that it is not lawful to pray and offer for
the dead,</hi> their censure is as little to be noticed, as his
Testimony; specially seing many Learned men do
plainly assert, that not only <hi>Hierom,</hi> but even <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
himself, <hi>Chrisostom</hi> and many others of the
Fathers, were of the same opinion with <hi>Aërius</hi> as
to the matter of this difference: but for <hi>Ierom</hi> you
go about to alleviat his Testimonye, <hi>viz. Idem ergo est
Presbyter qui Episcopus. Therefore a Presbyter is one and
the same with a Bishop, &amp; noverint Episcopi se magis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudine
quan dispositionis dominicae veritate Presbyter is
esse majores, &amp;c. And let the Bishops know that they are
above Preebyters more through custome then any divine
warrant. Because he himself was but a Presbyter.</hi> Pray
Sir, who were they whom your men cite so fast for
Bishops, were not they themselves Bishops, and yet
the truth is, there were Bishops also at that time of
his Opinion. 2. You say <hi>that his fervent if not sirie
Spirit drives him along in every things to an excess.</hi> Good
Sir, where is now your veneration for Antiquity and
the holy fathers? For us, seing we do not found on
mans Authority, this your brusk character, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
more of your partiality then of <hi>Ieroms</hi> infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
doth not offend: Only this I must say, that
whatever be his fervor in his other writtings; yet I
am sure that both in his Commentarie upon <hi>Titus</hi> and
in his Epistle ad <hi>Evagrium,</hi> he confirms his assertion
above set down, with Scripture Arguments, most
calmly, solidly and unanswerably. 3. You alledge,
that <hi>Notwithstanding that he make the Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
to differ in degree only, and not in office, and that
by Ecclesiastick and not Divine Authority, yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
that Presbyters did not ordain, and that the origen
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59845:86"/>
of the exercising power was in the dayes of the Apostles
to prevent schismes, &amp;c.</hi> It's answered he saith indeed,
<hi>quid enim facit, exceptâ ordinatione, Episcopus quod
Presbyter non facit;</hi> But as he is there pointing only
at the custome, then in use, so, this doth nothing
derogate from that equality, yea identitie of power,
which he attributeth to both from Scripture: what
you mean by <hi>the origen of the exercising power, &amp;c.</hi> Is
not so clear. It's true he affirmeth that at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>
from <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangelist to <hi>Heraclas,</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi>
Bishops, the Presbyters did always name one,
chosen of themselves, and placed in higher degree,
Bishop; but what says this more then that in all that
time for orders sake, they had successive Presidents
at first, it's like moveable, and thereafter fixed dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life: And we have already both acknowledged,
and regreted the grievous abuse, occasioned by that
latter practice: You adde <hi>that he compares, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Presbyters, and Deacons in the Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to
the high Priest, Priests and Levites in the Temple:</hi>
and since there was at that time, from Ecclesiastick
custome then allowed (which according to his use,
and as he useth to speak promiscuously, writing of
<hi>Lent,</hi> he here indifferently termeth an Apostolick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition)
a ground of resemblance, why might he
not use the similitude, without stretching it either
to evert, what he had said, or countenance your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie?
Lastly you alledge <hi>that he sayes, that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
through the whole World that a Presbyter should be
over the rest, to roote out the seede of difference:</hi> It's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that this <hi>in toto orbe decretum est,</hi> may, and is,
to be understood, not of an express Decree, which
doth no where appeare; but of a General consentient
custome, taking place every where: both the truth
of the thing, and <hi>Hieroms</hi> after <hi>Paulatim ad unum
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59845:87"/>
omnis Solicitudo est delata, by little and little all the care is
devolved upon one,</hi> do abundantly cleare, How ever
this may be warrantably said, that as this custome did
with time universally obtain, and in <hi>Ieroms</hi> dayes,
not having much exceeded the limits of a simple <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasia,</hi>
was by him also approved, as the remedy of
dissention, so, he holding it to be not of Divine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
no doubt if he had these other holy men,
were this day to see the hundred part of these sad, and
fearful effects, that it hath produced, nothing could
be able to breake their astonishment, at the surprizing
sight of such prodigious consequences of this Mystery
of iniquity, but sorrow and Lamentation, together
with deep regrete, that they did not better forsee,
and more timously resist, the first tendencies and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of this evil: Now whether or not Antiquity be
on your side, and if our grounds from Scripture against
your Episcopall Authority, be not much confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both by <hi>Ierom</hi> and the other passages here handl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I willingly submit it to all the lovers of truth:
but lest you think that by the representation I have
made in the beginning of my answere to your alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
from Antiquity, of the early and strange rise
and grouth of Episcopacie, I do thereby derogate
from that light and purity, which with you I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in these Primitive times, I must note, <hi>first,</hi>
That pride as it was the first sin and corrupter of Mans
integrity, from which the felicities of Paradise could
not exempt him; So is it of all sins the most inward,
rooted, and subtile, attending a man in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
finding Matter in all occasions, and immixing
it self even in our fairest and purest actions. 2. That
the Disciples of our Lord, notwithstanding of his
own presence, holy instruction, and humble example
were not free of the motions of this evil, the History
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59845:87"/>
of the Gospel doth plainly testify. 3. I note that the
times of the Apostles, the most pure and powerfull
that ever the Church enjoyed, were many wayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
with this plague, I mention not the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
betuixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which no doubt
sprung from this latent corruption; but he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth
the great number<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and many wicked practic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of false Apostles, Hereticks and Schismaticks, in
these days boasting against, and despising even <hi>Paul</hi>
himself, with the affected Preheminence of <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes,</hi>
and the then begun working of the mystery of
iniquity, toward the exalting of the Son of perdition,
in place of denying, must of necessity marveil, how
this Devil of pride could in so gracious and short a
time, destitute of all Earthly encouragements, so
greatly prevail, and plainly perceive, that this active
Spirit, would not be wanting, to imbrace and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
all occasions and opportunities offered; 4, That
as order did no doubt at first in all meetings require a
President, whom I also easily grant to have been, as
any occasion did require, rather recommended by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
no evil consequence being then apprehended,
then presented by a constant and compleat Rotation;
So it is very probable, and confirmed by <hi>Hieroms</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage,
that contentions did first both fixe the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie
or <hi>prostasia,</hi> and exalt it to any notable emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie;
but whether by way of remedy, or by way
of victory, to the increase of the Maladie, is indeed
the most observable points, and, as I apprehend,
that whereupon we will divide: and therefore I note
5. That although the Authority of able and holy men
at first, advanced to a fixed Presidencie, might then
appeare, as in these dayes of great simplicity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
in it self very innocent, and in the event also
effectuall to concord; Yet without all question at best
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59845:88"/>
it was but an humane invention, copied from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of the manner of the then Civil Government of
the Empire, to which our Lord expresly commanded
his Disciples not to conforme. 6. That seing affected
preheminence and the contentions thence arising, did
clearly occasion the introducing of this <hi>Prostasia,</hi>
though in many, yea most places, the prevailing
number of good men, might thereto advance worthy
and deserving persons, studying more the prospering
of the Gospel, and unity of the Church then adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the bad consequences, that thence might ensue;
Yet it is not only most certain, that this promotion
was that, whereunto these strivings did every where
directly aspire; but also most probable, that even in
the first beginnings, many ambitious pretenders,
wanting a just opposition, did carry their design,
and were preferred. 7. That by plain dealing
I may satisfy all pretenses, I observe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
power and Authority, unite in the <hi>Prostasia</hi> of
one amongst many, may be thereby rendered more
strong, and effectual; Yet seing the benefits of this
union, and advancement, doth only flow from the
accidental worth, and ability of the person that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to be promoted, and that the order or institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it self, destitute of divine warrant, and promise,
and clearly occasioned by evil contention and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into the house of God by humane invention,
could not at first have any thing in it recommendable,
and hath since produced most corrupt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruits; Neither
the existence of Many excellent and great men in this
degree, nor the laudable, yea extraordinary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
that the Church hath received from them in
the concret, can now justify, and maintain the Order
it self in the abstract: If this arguing were good, able
and well qualifyed men vested with such a power, or
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59845:88"/>
placed in such a condition, have proven and may prove
notable instruments of Good: therefore it is reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and expedient, that such a constant order should
be erected, we might not only have Bishops, but
most of the Monastick Orders of the Roman Church:
We finde <hi>Peter</hi> with the singular benefite of the
Church, exercing a power of Life and Death, and
that given him from above, and not assumed; could
therefore an order of Church-men, pretending to the
like Authority, be rationally thence maintained in the
Church? No wayes: Accidental advantages do not
commend unwarranted institutions, much less can
they justle out our Lords express constitution: But it
is he, the perfect orderer of his own house, who
hath positively defined, and blessed its Officers, and
their power, and not left the matter Arbitrarie, to
the probable contrivances of apparent benefite, farre
less to the dissembling pretenses, of mens Lusts, and
corrupt Interest. 8. It is to be noted, that although
the great measure of Grace, given to the Primitive
Church, and the hard and frequent persecutions,
wherewith it was exercised, did for a time hinder
that strange depravation and incredible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruption of
wickedness, whereunto the setting up of the Ancient
<hi>Prostasia,</hi> the rudiment of your Prelacie, did from
its first beginnings, secretly and covertly bend; Yet
this is most evident, that so soon as the Church of
God obtained the countenance, and was favoured
by the more fond in many things (such as excessive
Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ations and Grants of privileges) then prudently
pious benevolence of Secular Princes, this Prelatick
order, which in its depression had been indeed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
with many shining lights and Glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres,
attaining then to its ascendent, did not only
debauch the Lords Ministers, for the most part unto
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59845:89"/>
idleness, avarice and luxurie; but continually climb
up according to its proper Genius of Ambition, until
the Devils design in its rise, and progress, was fully
discovered, and consummate, in the revelation of
the Son of perdition: 9. This being the rise, progress
and product of Prelacie in the first Churches, as may
be clearly gathered from the writtings of these times,
how it was introduced in other Churches, thereafter
gathered and brought in, may be found in their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories:
Only this is certain, that as in almost no
Church it can be shewed, to have been coëvous with
Christianity, and in all the western Churches where
it obtained place, was ever a sprig of <hi>Romes</hi> Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
propagate by her ambition and deceit, and the
like practices; So the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in special,
was in the beginning, and for some centuries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
instructed and guided by Monks, without
Bishops until <hi>palladius</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> did set up Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie
among us, as many Authors witness; Nay, we
may finde it on Record, that even in the 816. year a
Synod in <hi>England</hi> did prohibite the <hi>Scots</hi> any function
in their Church, because they gave no honour to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans
and other Bishops.</p>
            <p>By these observations, having in some sort deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neate
the mysterious and crooked windings, of this
excrescing Power, in its first motions, and setting
forth: and very clearly and naturally traced its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
and thence deduced that most prodigious
production of the Antichristian Papacie, as any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
man may thereby easily perceive, not only
how it might, but how <hi>de facto</hi> it hath crept into the
whole Church, without an <hi>Apostolicall introduction,</hi>
notwithstanding of all your contrarie insinuations, so
I am confident, that what ever other advantages,
these primitive times had above our latter dayes; yet
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59845:89"/>
our discovery, made after so full a revelation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the obscure appearances of this wickedness,
in the first ages of the Church, cannot be thereby
rationally disproved: and your scurrile disparaging of
the latter times of reformation, as the <hi>fagg end o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Prelacie.</p>
            <p>As for the rest of your discourse, wherein you tell
your N. C. <hi>that though the ancient Bishops were better
men, then either Bishops or Presbyters alive; Yet, in
Presbyteries, Specially in the matter of Ordination, they
were</hi> sine quibus non, <hi>and what ever be the present abuse
of the Episcopall power; Yet it is a rational and most
necessary thing, that the more approven and gifted, be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
incharged with the inspection of the Clergie, an
order of men ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ding much to be regulate; and seing all
humane things, and Presbytery also, are liable to be abus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the common maxime remains to be applied, remove
the abuse of Bishops, but retain their use.</hi> In answere
hereto, I need not inlarge, he who knows Church
History best, will easily grant, that as for the first
Centurie and an half, we have no vestige upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
of your Prelatick power; So when <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
had place, their concurrence in Presbyteries, was
only for order, as being the Mod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rators, a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the same exigence and effect, whether they
be fixed, or unfixed, and not from any peculiar
power, proper to them as a superior order; A thing
so certainly disowned by the primitive Church, that,
even after the Bishops thought themselves well stated
in their Prelacie, and were beginning to contend
among themselves, for the Papacie, <hi>Hierom</hi> doth
plainly deny them any such prerogative above Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
and was not therefore contradicted by any:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59845:90"/>
How much more then doth this condemn that sole
power, both of Ordination and Jurisdiction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
your Bishops do pretend. As for your alledged
reason, and necessity of promoting the better gifted
over the <hi>unruly Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rgie,</hi> whatever application it may
have to that naughty Company of your insufficient
and profane Curats, or Conformity to the Court;
yea, the worlds prejudice against our Lord Jesus, his
Ministers, and all his followers; Yet these two things
are most evident. 1. That as that lowely and ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Government, appointed by Christ in his own
house, admitting no superiority or inequality of
power among Ministers, is not subjected to, and
alterable at the arbitriment of humane reason; so, the
advantage of Gifts, whereupon you would found it,
doth so little favour your conclusion, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
contrarie is recommended by our Lord, as its
best evidence and fruit, <hi>he that will be chief among you
let him be your Servant;</hi> and that not only as to the
grace of humility, but in plain opposition to that supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Authority exercised in Secular Rule, whereof the
imitation in this place, is expresty prohibite to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Ministers: but the ground of your mistake is,
that Notwithstanding our Lord hath said of himself
and his Ministers, that one is your Master; and all
you are Brethren and fellow-servants, among whom
an inequality of gifts, may well consist with an
equality of condition; Yet restess and most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Ambition, for grati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ying its evil lust, will, even
in a plain opposition commanded, alleage the affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not the thing it self to be discharged; and
in the low liest state of Service, devise superior and
inferior degrees. The <hi>second</hi> thing is, that though
I be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arre from denying humane infirmities incident
to Ministers, as well as others, and do heartily wish,
that the of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nces by them occasioned, may be alwayes,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59845:90"/>
as the most hurtful to the Gospel, most seriously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautioned
and regreted; Yet I am sure, that, without
regard to our Lords most gracious gifting, and most
wise ordering of his Ministery for the feeding and
ruling of his people, to affirme that neverthelesse
<hi>there is no order of men needs so much to be regulated,</hi>
is a presumptuous and vain imputation, against Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, the Head and King of the Church, and
his Oeconomie: Hath our Lord taken so great paines
to Separate, Instruct, Sanctify, and send forth Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and promised them so special a presence and
assistance, for the oversight and conduct of Believers,
and darre any Christian say, that even the order it
self (for alas I grant the men are but earthen vessels)
needs more then any other, the contrivance of mans
invention for its regulation? But let none that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth
Jesus Christ, or remembreth the former
Beautie, Order and Successe of his Ministrie and
Courts amongst us, be offended; this reflection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the same Spirit, that accused our great
Master, as a Rebell and Usurper, and his Apostles
as the Troublers and Subverters of the World. As
to your conclusion, when you have disproved the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
warrant of Presbytrie, and shewed both its oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
rise, tendencie, and proper fruits to be
only evil, as I have done in the matter of Prelacie,
then you may equiparat them in the point of abuse:
but seing the abuse of Presbytrie is only accidental,
from humane infirmity, and that of Prelacie, its most
native Genius and Product; Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, seing Presbytrie is
indeed the right use of the Churches Government, and
Prelacie its manifest depravation, the maxime which
you adduce, in its just application, doth most clearly
say, remove the abuse of Prelacie, and let the use of
Presbyterie be re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

DIALOGUE
Answered.</head>
            <p>SIR, since you have said nothing that I have
not to my self (and I hope to all rational and
impartial men) satisfyingly answered, and
seing I can say it in Gods sight, that in all the
matters hitherto treated, I finde in my heart
a serious desire to please him in all things; and also to
comply with his Church, and obey the Laws of the
Kingdom, in what I judge agreeable to his will, with
as much distrust of my self, and charity towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as humane frailtie doth permit: In this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
truely, and by your own verdict, conscientious,
without either noticing the pitiful shift of a blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which you make your N C. pretend, or
charging you with that arrogance, whereupon you
make him weakly to exclaime, I shall proceed to
consider the grounds which in this place you lay down,
You say then, <hi>Private persons have nothing to do with
Government; submission and not judging is their part.</hi>
I cannot stand to discusse all the ambiguities that may
be latent in this General; but it is strange. 1. That
the Government of Gods house (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or that is the point
betwixt us) should be instituted by him, for the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and Salvation of private persons, and his
own Glory, as you cannot deny; and yet they to have
nothing to do with it. 2. You say, <hi>Submission i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59845:91"/>
dutie.</hi> And would you have it blind, and not rational,
and conscientious? 3. Our Lord hath defined the
Government of his Church, and did establish the
same among us, engaging us thereinto by a perpetual
Covenant, is it then nothing of our concernment?
But may we breake these sacred tyes, and abandone
our selves to an implicite compliance, with every
humane invention? I grant that private persons are
neither, under a righteous constitution, to usurpe the
part of the Governours; nor yet under a sinful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully
to solicite, and endeavour an alteration: but
as in the former case, both Reason and Religion,
specially where an Oath hath interveened, doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
to maintenance, so in the latter, I am assured that
all active owning and approving (the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we are pressed) beyond a providentiall acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
is utterly sinful: If you require my reasons,
there is none like your own, <hi>viz. first,</hi> because, I
am perswaded that, what ever may be the compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
innocencie of an erring, but well-meaning opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
Yet of every Soul, who hath seen the Glorious
light and work of God in the Lands, and engaged
himself thereto by solemn Covenant, and now of
late, hath broken these bonds, and concurred to
change Christs pure Ordinances, and set up, establish
or countenance <hi>Prelacie,</hi> and its wicked <hi>Hierarchie,</hi>
God will surely either in this life, as we have already
seen, in the convictions of many, or in the last and
great Judgement, openly require it. 2. Because not
only perjury, manifestly ingredient in the active sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and compliance which you exact, hath a
plain and direct tendencie to the <hi>blotting of the Soul;</hi>
but as the Gospel and all its Ordinances, are designed
to purify the heart; So, this of Government, so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therein appointed, and of so necessaire and effectual
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59845:92"/>
influence, for the conserving of truth, edifying of
the body of Christ, and perfecting of the Saints, doth
undeniably contribute to the same end: And by these
two <hi>easie rules</hi> it is whereby I heartily wish, that both
you and I, and all men may examine our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s.</p>
            <p>In the next place you tell your N. C. <hi>That we have
no rationall ground to think you wrong, in Matters of
Religion:</hi> do you then think that obedience to the
Lords Command, against swearing falsely, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to, and owning the Kingdom, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Jesus Christ, are no Matters of Religion? or
have you already answered the full and just account,
that I have given of our differences? But, supposing
there may be error on your side, you adde, <hi>that unless
the error be of greater importance, then the Communion
of Saints is, it ought not to unty the bond of the unity of
the Catholick Church.</hi> This is the rule which you gave
us before, in your <hi>first Dialogue,</hi> and therefore I
shall say little to it, only if your meaning be, that
except the conjunction with the erring partie, be of
greater prejudice, then separation upon that account,
we ought not to unty the unitie of the Church, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
assent: but if there be any other latent sense in
your strange weighing the import of error, with an
article of Faith, things quite opposite, without all
communication of degrees; when you explain your
self, I shall consider it. To this you subjoin many
things of <hi>Pauls</hi> conforming both to Jews and Gentiles,
in matters of greater scruple, then what we contend
about, and thence conclude, <hi>That if</hi> Paul <hi>did so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and out of Charity, then are we much more bound,
from whom the dutie of obedience to Law doth also
exact it:</hi> Now, because in this place, it is, that you
not only abuse <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, but go about to intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59845:92"/>
and destroy, by a new knack of pitiful Court
Sophistry, the privilege of Christian liberty, I shall
therefore endeavour briefly to give you a distinct and
adequat return. And I say that <hi>Paul's</hi> conformity
doth no wayes enforce the compliance required of us;
because that all we finde in the Apostle, is a free and
prudent accommodation of himself, in things whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
externall and indifferent, for the gaining of such,
with whom he conversed; whereas the compliance
demanded of us, is plainly <hi>to owne and approve</hi> unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted,
wicked and accursed Prelacie, and its abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations:
which, both by the Command, and Oath
of God, we are bound to extirpate: If <hi>Paul,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the accomplishment of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Mosaick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
at first institute by the Lord, and not then
expresly antiquat, did neverthelesse continue some
of its observances, that by shewing a respect to, and
not despising of these shadows, though already eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
he might the better convince the Jews, of
the fulfilling of what they prefigured; can any man
thence inferre, that therefore we ought not only to
relinquish the true Ordinances of Christ, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the inventions of men, such as <hi>Prelacie,</hi> and
its vain <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> although the samine be found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire
both to the word of God, and power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and therefore are by us solemnly abjured. As
for <hi>Pauls</hi> freedom of converse toward the Gentiles,
admitting that there appeares a seeming excess in it,
obnoxious to misconstruction: yet, was it not in meat
and drink only? And is not its principall design of
asserting, in these things, such an absolute liberty, as
might warrant the deed in it self, notwithstanding
the possibility of some mens mistakes, wholly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to your purpose? so that, without question, the
outmost advantage you can draw from this matter,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59845:93"/>
is, that we have the liberty to do materially many of
these externall things, by you enjoined, without
homologating your intention in the imposing, which,
whether you would accept of, or account consistent
with sincere dealing, I leave to your self to judge?
But 'tis like your meaning is, that all the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we are pressed, passing from our Covenant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishing
of our sent and sealed Ministers, owning
and active submitting to abjured Prelats, and the like,
are in themselves things wholly externall, insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
and nothing; wherein we may as lawfully
complement Authority, by our obedience, as <hi>Paul,</hi>
by a free exercise of his liberty, in washing, shavings,
circumcising, eating, and drinking did complacent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insinuat upon Jews, and Gentiles: And if in these
there be any parity, let the meanest capacity discerne
2. Although the things required of us, were indeed
in themselves wholly indifferent; Yet we cannot be
urged with <hi>Pauls</hi> conformings, because the reason
and design of <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, being diametrally repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to yours, instead of confirming, plainly subverts
the compliance by you demanded: <hi>Paul's</hi> practice,
did flow from liberty, and the reason and warrant of
that, was, because that <hi>Christ hath made us free,</hi> and
<hi>called us unto liberty, blotting out the hand-writting of
Ordinances that was against us:</hi> dare you then, or
any mortall else, offer to write and fixe another, and
again intangle us with a yoke of bondage, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecte
us to, or judge us concerning Ordinances, after
the Commandments and Doctrines of men? What
reasoning can be more absurd then that of yours? <hi>Paul</hi>
did these things freely, therefore, you are bound to
obedience: Do contraries, that remove, establish
one another? I grant that, if in charity to our equals,
even Aliens, we are bound to a compleasant and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59845:93"/>
acting or forbearance, in things indifferent, and
in our power; much more doth the same charity bind
us, to the like compliance toward our Superiors;
but by what consequence can you extend this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of charity, to a plain surrender of our Liberty;
and turn the praise of a free benevolent exercise, unto
a bondage of obedience, wherefrom our Lord hath
so clearly liberat us, as to all these externals, which
you so much plead for? But as to this point, you tell
your N. C. <hi>That he bewrays great simplicitie; because
forsooth</hi> Paul <hi>did not re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>use compliance by reason that
the things were commanded by Authority: But because
certain false Brethren came to spy out his liberty, to
whom he gave place by subjection, no not for an hour.</hi>
Really, Sir, your N. C. must indeed be very sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he could indure such imposing. You say,
<hi>Paul did not re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>use compliance, by reason that the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
were commanded,</hi> and yet his own words by
you cited, say plainly, that though at other times,
in the free and edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ying exercise of his liberty, he hath
in charity ceded to the weaker; Yet, to <hi>give place by
subjection</hi> (mark it) the correlat and homologa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of command, he would not, <hi>no not for an
hour,</hi> Is not then to repeat only your discourse, to
redargue it? I might tell you further, that by the
context, it is evident, that the Apostle speaks
in this place, of these that would have brought
Gentiles under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the observance
of the Jewish ceremonies, who certainly did pretend
Divine Authority for their Doctrine: And therefore,
and for this only reason, were in the vindication of
Christian liberty opposed by <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> but
let us hear what <hi>Stilling-fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et</hi> hath put in your Mouth
as to this Matter: You say then that, <hi>If an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> require
of us compliance, as if it were necessarie of it self, we
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59845:94"/>
have reason to</hi> stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ
hath made us free. <hi>But it is unsufferable peevishness, if
the Magistrat enjoin a thing, declaring it free in it self,
and only necessary because commanded, upon that score to
refuse obedience.</hi> To this it is answered 1. That it is
unsufferable boldness for you, to alledge a peevishness
in a practice, so exactly parallel to that of the Apostles,
who, as they understood the liberty wherewith Christ
had made them free, to consist in that reall relief and
freedome granted to them from the yoke and burden
of the Jewish ceremonies; so, they do exhort belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to stand fast to it, which certainly imports a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>submission,
and resisting to the imposition, either of
these antiquat Jewish observations, or any other of
Mans invention, seing that these are indeed contrarie,
and not only an astrictedness, in opinion, unto the
liberty purchased: 'Tis true, the false Apostles pressed
their observance from divine Authority; but seing
the Christians then did except, upon the liberty which
Christ hath obtained, and thereby proclaimed to us an
exemption even from the old Divine Law of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
is not the same much more forcible against
Mens usurpation of an unwarranted tyrrany; or think
you, that our Lord hath only freed us from <hi>Moses</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
that we might fall into the hands of more
severe Task-masters, who not only take upon them to
appoint, without Gods warrant into the house and
matters of God, and introduce will-worship, which
he abhorres; but after they have urged our obedience,
as only <hi>Civill,</hi> and out of respect to Authority, and
not from Conscience, do then tell us, that by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and supervenient Law of God, their statutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to reach even the Conscience also? But 2. you
say, <hi>if the Magistrat declare the thing to he free in it self,
and only necessary because commanded, Christian liberty is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59845:94"/>
not thereby lessened.</hi> 'Tis answered, is not Christian
liberty alwayes opposed to the Jewish bondage?
Now, Sir, I demand wherein did this bondage consist,
was it in the Authority only, whereby these ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
were enjoined, and which did indeed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
reach the Conscience, and not rather in the
obligation to that burthensome practice, which thence
did ensue? And certainly, you, and all men, must
grant the latter; seing the speciality of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
is so far from rendering an imposition, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
light, to be burthensome; that without ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as its precepts are the perfect law of liberty;
So the clearnesse of its warrant, is the greatest relief
of Conscience: Nay, this is a truth to certain, and
apposite to our present purpose, that I am sure you are
convinced, that if the Prelats could produce Divine
commands for their injunctions, these would quickly
satisfy all our scruples, and make Non-conformists,
the most conformable of the Nation. Give over then
your empty quibling, in telling us, that you exact
not our compliance, as necessaire in it self by divine
prescript, for though I could shew, how that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
you pretend not to any immediate divine
warrant, for your imposings; you not the less alleage
that Divine Authority, whence Magistracy doth
descend, for astricting our obedience; Yet this is so
far from being our exception, that plainly on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire,
your ceremonies commanded in the Matters
of God, against that liberty purchased unto us, are
not in themselves, or in any other respect, so much a
burthen, as for lack of that very same authority,
whereof you do most inadvertently pretend, that the
want should be our solution. But 3. what can be
more manifest, then that, as the hardship of the Jewish
Pedagogie, did consist in the multitude of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59845:95"/>
and Observances, whereunto they were
tyed in practice, and neither in the obligation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority, whereby they became bound, nor
yet in their opinion of things, which, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their being injoined by the Lord, they knew
to be in themselves free, and were not in the least, by
this liberty of opinion, delivered from the rigour of
that Pedagogie, so the releasement, which our Lord
hath purchased, consists in freeing us from that yoke,
and burthen, which the Jews were not able to bear,
and in liberating us from the Law of Ordinances, and
the rudiments of the world? Pray Sir, is this only to
change the opinion of things, and leave us as much
ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oxious, to be subjected in obedience as ever the
Jews were? who can admit it? If you be still unclear,
answere this demand with your self in sobriety: If
the false Brethren had said to the Christians of old,
we acknowledge with you, that the Jewish dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
is accomplished; but since the Lord hath not
expressly discharged the continuance of its observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and they are but things external, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
free, let us in the recognizance of his Authority,
or for peace sake, still be subject in a conformable
obedience: would not the Apostle have returned the
same answere? It is the Lord who hath made us free,
let us not again be brought unto bondage: the sun of
righteousness is arisen, and hath obscured all the former
shadowing lights, we have no need either of these,
or the more pitiful tapers of mens blind invention:
And here I must tell you by the way, that as I have
drawn out my answere on purpose, to meet with your
significant rites introduced in Gods service; So, as
to the first part of it, anent the liberty purchased to
us by Christ, I further adde, that it is a groundless
conceit, to think that the only reason of abolishing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59845:95"/>
the Jewish ceremonies, was, because they did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure
our Lords coming, seing it is most certain, that
although the whole complexly, was indeed a Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogie
to lead unto him, and make that People to
wait and long for his redemption; Yet a great many
of them did not properly prefigure, such as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of dayes, distinction of meats, and the like,
to which no such relative signification can be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
without a groundless and violent straining: and
therefore, as I grant, that many of these rites, as
being only shadows of the good things to come, did
evanish upon their appearance, and consequently could
not have been kept up, without a tacite hint, that
the things thereby typifyed were still expected; Yet
I am very assured, that as to a great part of these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Ordinances, our Lord did remove them, as a
yoke and burthen, by the gracious concession of that
Liberty, wherewith he made us free, and that to
bring back that servitude, or to introduce the like, is
plainly to bring us back again to the rudiments of the
world, from which we are dead with Christ, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
the liberty which he hath purchased, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
and as plainly as in the former case, to deny
that our deliverer is come. 4. Having shewed
that the liberty of thinking the things to be free in
themselves, the practice nevertheless being strictly
injoined, is not Christian liberty, and that it is irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
to affirme, that an observance commanded by
the Law of God, becomes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this account more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome,
then if mans authority only did make it
binding: And seing on the other hand I easily grant,
that in things in themselves free, and in our power,
no reason of Religion or Righteousness gainstanding,
it were peevishness to decline the request of an Equal,
let be the command of a Superior: I shall here shortly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59845:96"/>
declare wherein it is that Christian liberty stands, and
consequently what the injury is of your invasion: As
then Christian liberty, is neither a licentiousness to sin
against God, nor to rebel against the Powers that are
over us; So I plainly understand it, to be that free<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dome
of serving God in Spirit and in truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
our Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> by releeving us of all outward
observances, either as <hi>media</hi> in our worship, or for
themselves requisite to the acceptation of our service,
other then he himself hath expressly appointed, hath
redeemed, and restored his Church. That the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of time, place &amp;c. and their due regulation
for <hi>Decencie,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> are not here rejected, the
quality, <hi>for themselves,</hi> that is, for some respect, by
special command, peculiarly to them appropriat,
sufficently holds out; it being very certain, that,
under this consideration, the matters of <hi>Decencie,</hi>
whereof both the conveniencie and use flows only
from the common exigence of all humane actions, do
not fall: And that this is the true notion of Christian
liberty, the Scriptures whence I take it, and wherein
it is so clearly distinguished, from the Jewish bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
there also described, <hi>Iohn 4. 21. Gal.</hi> 3. 4
and 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. are so plain, that nothing can be added.
Only I observe, that because by this liberty, we are
delivered from these performances, whereunto the
exercise of Religion, requiring, in every act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
or service toward God, the Faith and Conscience
of a Divine prescript, without which it is impossible
to please him, was formerly by <hi>Moses</hi> Law astricted:
Therefore it is indeed and is rightly termed, liberty
of Conscience, which while you and others do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
to be nothing else then a freedom to think
things to be free in themselves that are not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Lord, you do not only grossly mistake it,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59845:96"/>
as distinguished from the Jewish servitude; but open
a door to humane lust, and invention, to incumber
and deprave the whole body of Religion, and the
worship of God, with whatsomever fopperies they
please to devise: seing that, in your opinion, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that Christian liberty of Conscience, can be
thereby prejudged. Now, to prove that your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
are high impingements upon this freedome, I
need not mention these compliances, which you
crave, and are in effect directly opposite to the will
of God; but even your other ceremonies, all added
as in and by themselves significant, to the worship
and service of God, without the warrant either of his
word, or of the common exigence of all performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and so thereby made Religious in their use, and
object; and therefore certainly belonging to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
needeth no other argument to evi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce it, then
the subsumption of a condescendence. Having thus
in some measure cleared what I proposed, lest you or
any other should account these things, to be matters
of meere <hi>doubtfull disputations,</hi> I must adde, that as
it hath alwayes been observed, that the greatest urgers
of conformity in the externalls of humane invention,
have been very little, if at all, serious, in the life
and substantials of Religion; so the great prejudice
thence ensuing, to the power and practice of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
partly by reason of the imposers evill lusts and
ends, partly by reason of that spirit of delusion, to
which they are given up, and partly by reason of the
vanity of the things imposed, and the Lords abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of them, doth both discover that Mysterie of
Hypocrisie, and Wickedness, which secretly worketh
under these vain formes, and should ever render them
most odious, to all the lovers of truth and holiness.
I might here further adde, that as your impositions
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59845:97"/>
are invasive of Christian liberty, injurious to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and corruptive of the pure and acceptable
worship of God, and consequently such, as no power
on Earth can lawfully command them, or we therein
obey; so, were it but for the offence that may thence
redound, to the stumbling of the weak, and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the imposers, to proceed from small begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
to the grossest mixtures, all conscientious Men
may very justly be therefrom deterred; but to this I
shall speak at greater length. 5. Having shewed
that <hi>Paul's</hi> Christian civility, doth make nothing for
your imposed conformity, and that to turne the free
exercise of a charitable compliance, unto a yoke of
bondage, is a perversion intolerable, I shall summe
up the whole matter with this brief reflection, <hi>viz.</hi>
that admitting the things required of us, were only
such <hi>externals</hi> and <hi>nothings</hi> as you would groundlessly
perswade, and that our forbearance had, in it, more
of weakness then sound reason; yet the free Spirit of
Christianity, which you alleage, and <hi>Paul</hi> describeth
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. is, so farre from urging us to your desired
compliance; that I am very confident to affirme, that
if the severest Non-conformist, had had the rule to
dictate (pardon the supposition, blessed be the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor)
he could not more manifestly and directly have
condemned your rigid exactions in thir matters, then
the Apostle doth in this place: I need not insist upon
particulars, the whole chapter is most expresse, <hi>Let
not him that eateth</hi> (and you think all the points of the
controverted conformity of no greater moment)
<hi>despise him that eateth not.</hi> How do you then vex them
with hard Laws, and grievous pains, more then you
do heynous Malefactors: <hi>Who art thou that judgest
another mans servant?</hi> Is a demand which one day will
concerne Kings and Rulers, more then any of their
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59845:97"/>
Subjects: <hi>Why do they then judge? Why do they set at
nought their brethren? for all shall stand</hi> (and that on
even ground) <hi>before the judgement seat of Christ: Let
us not therefore judge one another, but let us judge this
rather, that no man put a stumbling-block, or an occasion
to fall in his brothers way:</hi> You assure us, and seem <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,</hi>
that the things pressed are of themselves noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but <hi>to him that esteemeth them unlawfull, to him
they are unlawfull, and he that doubteth is damned if he
do, because he doth not of faith;</hi> How then can you
require this conformity? and of how different a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
was the free and charitable Spirit of the Apostle,
who not only indulgeth the weak Non-Conformist;
but becometh such himself to evite his offence? <hi>If thy
brother be grieved with thy meat</hi> (or with any of the
matters now in debate, for you make no difference)
<hi>now walkest thou</hi> (spoken in my opinion to the Prince
as well as Peasant) <hi>not according to charity, destroy not
him with thy meat</hi> (or your acknowledged humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions)
<hi>for whom Christ dyed:</hi> Say not that the things
in controversie being concluded by Law, are no more
free, or in the condition of the things here mentioned;
for, if not only judging and despising the Forbearer be
here forbidden; but even the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raire practice, when
to him offensive, how much more must the designed
framing, and strick executing of Laws, for no other
visible end, then the violenting of scruplers, and rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Consciences, (acknowledged by your self
for <hi>the widest step to Atheism that can be made</hi>) be in
this Scripture condemned? If you urge, that to carry
this indulgence so high, is to frustrate all humane Laws,
seing the person unwilling to obey, may alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
from Conscience, the privilege of forbearance;
And as <hi>de facto</hi> you reason, <hi>Any offender may decline
Discipline, and say that the thing being indifferent, by
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59845:98"/>
command it becomes necessary,</hi> and so a burthen of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
'Tis answered, that as the burthen of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
doth not stand in a necessity, by Divine
precept, of the things imposed, otherwayes the Lords
commandments, that are certainly most easie, should
thence become most grievous; but, in effect, in a
forced obligation to practice, in things wherein
Conscience, requiring the Lords warrant in order to
his acceptation, cannot at all finde it so; the liberty
and privilege here spoken to, is only in order to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Christians ought not to press, or
judge one another in the performance, or forbearance
of things in themselves indifferent, as acceptable and
well-pleasing to God, without his warrant: and
therefore the force and effect of humane Laws, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and commanding things in order to the Politick
ends of Government, and, in so farre, by the Lord
commanded to be obeyed, are not by this Doctrine
in the least demurred: Now that your Ceremonies
and other impositions, being all relative to the service
and worship of God, wherein as every thing is to be
observed, with the faith of the Lords acceptation,
so nothing can be acceptable without his warrant, are
not of the nature of things, as objected to civill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
but plainly such, wherein <hi>Paul</hi> pleads for
liberty, is manifest: Nay, you your self know so
well, that the very things scrupled at by us, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
toward a religious observance, would be readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complied with upon any other reasonable occasion;
and that thousands, who detest the Surplice, would
chearfully engadge in a Camisado, for their Prince's
service, that I add nothing: If you say, that the
things in debate, though commanded for religious
uses, are never the less enjoyned not as acceptable to
God and under this formality; but are only necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59845:98"/>
because commanded; You bewray, not only a
sinful gaudie licentiousness, of doing things for, and
in the house of the God of Heaven, not commanded
by the God of Heaven; wherein even Heathens, let
be Christians, have been tender; but expose the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and simplicity of Religion, to all the corruptions
of mans vain imagination: As to what you adde anent
the pretext, which this liberty may give to offenders,
to <hi>decline Discipline,</hi> it is yet less to the purpose, in
as much as submission to Discipline, doth in effect
flow from the Lords Authority, whereby it becomes
necessary, and Mens part therein is only a naked mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
application. Lastly if you object, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace and Order require your conforming obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
Your opinion and method in this point, is
much different from the Apostles, he makes it his
great argument, not only for not judging and censur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Non-conformists; but also, in the case of offence,
for complying with them in their forbearance, <hi>That
we ought to follow the things which make for peace, and
wherewith one may edisie another:</hi> But you and your
partie, for all the noise you make for publick Peace;
before you tolerat a Non-conforming in the greatest
indifferencies, and howsoever tender and innocuous;
will sooner both deprive your Brethren of Peace, and
for your vain trifles <hi>destroy the work of God:</hi> whereas
though <hi>you had faith in these things, yet you ought to
have it to your selves before God:</hi> But, Sir, it is already
too manifest, that as in practice you know not the way
of Peace, so, in this discourse, by pressing a strict
obedience from the free Spirit of Christian liberty,
which you seem to commend, you palpably <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
your self in that which you appear to allow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus farre, in the pursute of your reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
digressed, in the explanation of true Christian
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59845:99"/>
Liberty; because of its after use, in the perusal of
your remaining purposes, I shall not stick in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
of what you make your N. C. add, <hi>That we
forbear the things pressed, for avoiding the scandal of
others:</hi> I have already told you, that the reasons of
our forbearance have no less then the indispensable
motive of the will and Oath of God: Yea, suppose
the things required were meere externals, and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
as they are not; yet I have so clearly proven
that your abridging of our Christian liberty therein,
by vertue of your commands, is in it self repugnant
to the Apostles Doctrine, and in its effects perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
that your requiring to make the restraint of
Authority, abused to these impositions, the warrant
of Practice to the forcing of Conscience, and the
offending of a Christian Brother, is a Sophisme, no
better, then if the hardie practiser, or proud imposer,
who is expressly commanded in Christian tenderness
to regard his Brothers offence, should by a vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
of his own offence, taken from the others
indulged forbearance, or recusancie, thereby turne
the Argument, and elude the exhortation, to the
very scorne of Scripture: That which I rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
is, that seing that to give Scandal is not ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
by you, to be a <hi>stretching of our liberty to practice,
to the drawing of others to the like</hi> (or grieving or mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them weak) <hi>who have not the same clearness,</hi> why
do you not begin your application at Prelats, Who
having first streatched their practice, to the ens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aring,
do also frame unjust decrees to the forcing of such
who have no clearness to conform? And on the other
hand, ought you not to indulge such, who only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uge their Conscience, in the Sanctuary of
an allowed forbearance? But these are the men, whom
having first sinfully spoiled of liberty, you scornfully
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59845:99"/>
abuse, by telling they may now act, without regard
to Scandal, since you do permit them no liberty to
the contraire: But I hasten to your more closs exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the matter of Conformity.</p>
            <p>And <hi>first</hi> you ask, <hi>why do not our Ministers join with
your Courts for Church-discipline?</hi> It's answered, it were
tedious to examine the follies of you, and your N. C.
in this point; we join not in your Courts, because
they are not the Courts of Jesus Christ; but of the

the proclamation of Councel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
discharging all Presbytries untill Authorized
by the Bishops, and the <hi>Act Par. eod. Sess.</hi> 2. For the
restitution of Bishops, where, as you will finde that
Presbytries were made Precarious; as to their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
(not as to their right, which is indeed Divine)
by the first Act, and then <hi>simpliciter</hi> discharged, and
broken up by the Proclamation; so that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes,
in their place, by the last Act and what ensued,
is not the former Presbyteries, but only the <hi>Exercises
of the Brethren,</hi> having both their regulation and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from the Bishops, who have all their Church-power
and Jurisdiction <hi>in a dependance upon, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
unto the soveraign power of the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream.</hi>
So that the Kings Authority and Prerogative
Royal, is plainly the proper fountain, and last resort
of all the power and jurisdiction to be found, either in
your Church, or its Meetings: Nay further, this

               </gap> so certain, that as his Majesty doth not so much as
pretend a Commission from Jesus Christ, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed
King of his Church, for this effect (which
yet the <hi>Pope,</hi> in his most wicked usurpation, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
Judge necessary) so, if it be Treason, as it is
<hi>dict. sess.</hi> of the same <hi>Parliament, act.</hi> 3. to derogat
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59845:100"/>
from the prerogative of the Imperial Crown of this
Realm, and if absolute supremacie in Ecclesiasticks,
incapable either of superior or conjunct, do thereto
by the late Act of Supremacie appertain, certainly to
make our Lord so much as a sharer with the King, in
this matter, would fall under the compasse of this
crime: However, not to rake into this abysse of
wickedness, that Act of Supremacie, giving to the
King, over all Persons, Meetings, and in all Causes
of the Church, all the power, that Christ as head of
the Church, in these things hath or can acclame, (a
piece of such desperat solly, that I am assured, that as
<hi>he that sitteth in the Heaven doth laugh,</hi> so shall he one
day have all its contrivers, and abettors in dirision)
in this I am very positive, that according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
legall establishment made in these matters, to
derive the power of your Courts from, or connect
the same with, the power and headship of our Lord
Jesus, is utterly impossible. That we then, who as
Ministers of the Gospel, do take upon us, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
no power, save that which is our Lords, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
join and partake with your Meetings, your self
may judge.</p>
            <p>But you say, <hi>That all that is Divine in Discipline, is,
that scandalous persons be noted, and separated from
worship; but how this shall be administred, can be no
matter of Religion, or of the concernment of Souls,
providing it be done:</hi> 'Tis answered, to argue thus, all
that is Divine in Preaching, is that the truth of the
Gospel be declared: but how this shall be performed
can be no matter of Religion, or of the concernment
of Souls, providing it be done, would it not be false
and weak reasoning. 2. As your <hi>Providing it be done viz.</hi>
rightly, is a <hi>salvo,</hi> whereby a man may as pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
argue against all means whatsomever, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59845:100"/>
are nothing useful, providing the end for which
they are appointed be <hi>rightly</hi> done, so this quality hath
such an exigence even of these midses, which you
suppose to be of no import, that it plainly subverts
your Argument: But 3. Your position, <hi>that all that
is Divine in Discipline, is, that scandalous persons be
noted, &amp;c.</hi> Is false, in as much as this is no more
clearly to be found in Scripture, then the Persons and
Officers therewith incharged, are evidently thereby
ordained, yea this matter is so certain, that there is
scarce one place to be seen in Scripture, for the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Discipline, which doth not with the same
evidence, hold out the persons intrusted with its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration:
And <hi>I will give unto thee the keyes of the
Kingdom of heaven: Whose sins soever ye remit they are
remitted unto them: Feed, Over-see, Rule the slock,</hi> are
Commissions so full, ordaining the persons, as well
as designing their work, that I can hardly impute the
laxeness of your reasoning, to your oversight.</p>
            <p>In the next place (for as for your quibling with your
N. C. anent the foolish answere which you put in his
mouth it is altogether frivolous as shall be shewed in
your 7. <hi>Dial.</hi>) you urge, <hi>That, seing that Presbytries

                  </gap>ill meet to worship
God, how ever it be interpret:</hi> 'Tis answered, If the
jurisdiction competent to Presbyteries by Divine right
were in these Courts, your Argument might have
some weight; but seing they are not the former Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries,
but new Courts set up, as I have already
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59845:101"/>
declared, no more deriving power from Jesus Christ,
then your late High-commission, how can you think
in reason, that either the right and power of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
or his Majesties call, should oblige Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to com to the one more then the other: For my
part, as I esteem it a less sin upon the Kings call to
come to a Court of his own erecting, then to abuse
Christs warrant to the establishing of a Court, as his,
which by its institution manifestly disowns him; So,
I should sooner resolve, upon the Kings command
to meet in the High-Commission, then, by coming
from the motive of our Lords warrant, acknowledge
your <hi>Exercises of the Brethren</hi> for his Courts, which
are so palpably setled upon the basis of another Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
As for your Similitude, not to insist upon
such claudicant Arguments, it is like to the legs of
the lame which are not equall, but make it straight,
thus, the King dissolves all Christian Churches, and
erects Mahometan Mosches, charging all to repaire
there to worship, and declaring that he will account
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir so doing, a testimony of their compliance with
the change by him made: Now if one should stand
up, and for the perswading of just recusants, say, that
they may safely go there, and worship God, without
either owning of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or regarding the construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be made of it: Pray, Sir, how would you
understand it? And what ever you, or any reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man think should be the practice or Christians in
this case, I am content the N. C. be thereby judged:
I confesse the termes of the Similitude are hard; But
remember they are of your own choosing, and my
work is only to make them just; to conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it is not Mens interpretation or mis-interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(although in many cases these homologations,
whereby either Enemies may be hardened, or friends
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59845:101"/>
stumbled, require also a very weighty consideration)
that we regard in this matter: but the reall state of
things, whereby as Christ's power is ejected forth of
your Courts; So the Divine jurisdiction of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
cannot possibly therein have place: To this you
subjoin that <hi>suppose Episcopacie were Tyrannie, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
were Tyrannes in the Church; Why ought you not to
submit to them, as well as you did to the late Tyrannes in
the State?</hi> It is answered, if I did think there were
any <hi>Emphasis,</hi> more then the strain of your discourse,
in this your urging <hi>Our</hi> submission to the late Usurpers,
I could tell you that though the cases were parallel, as
they are not, all the submission made by us to <hi>Oliver</hi>
would not make out your inference: And that it is
<hi>Your,</hi> and not <hi>Our</hi> submission which only can serve
your turn; I need not mention that <hi>Mr. Sharp</hi> Now
of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> was the first, if not the only Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that took the <hi>Tender,</hi> and thereby,
deserting his Fellow-prisoners, procured his own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
Nor how the late introductors of Episcopacie,
were most or many of them such as by subscriving the
<hi>Tender,</hi> abjuring the King, and the like compliances,
had wholly deboshed their Consciences unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
re-establishing of your abjured Prelacie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the tenacious honesty of the faithfull of the Land,
was both then, and is now, accounted their bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and folly. But to the purpose. 1. If Bishops had
only been intruded upon Presbytries as they were in
former times, it is not questioned, but Faithfull Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
not Outed of their possession founded on Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
right, might have continued the same with a
due Testimony, and opposition against unlawfull
usurpations, conforme to the old practice of Gods
Servants among us in the like case; but seing in the
late revolution, not only Presbytries were broken,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59845:102"/>
and discontinowed, but the very foundations razed, a
new foundation of the Kings Supremacie laid, and a
new superstructure thereon built, Our compliance
now, as you require it, would not be an act of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
but a plain partaking in this wickedness.
2. The case of mens usurpation in the State is so vastly
different from that of your usurpations in the Church,
that it greatly alters the latitude of these submissions,
which you go about to equiparat, for though, in
Civils, the aspiring and usurpation of wicked men,
be a hainous transgression, before God; Yet, such
is the nature, and condition of the Kingdoms of the
Earth, in themselves mutable, and at the disposal of
the most high, who ruleth therein, and giveth them
to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over them
sometime the basest of men, that the attaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
becometh such a providentiall title, as may suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
warrant, not only necessary submission, and
obedience in things lawfull, but even these other acts
of seeming compliance, that do directly acknowledge
the Usurper to be <hi>in titulo;</hi> providing that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
no further, either to anticipate Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in the establishment, or homologate the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of the usurpation. If of this you have any
doubt, I remit you to Scripture-practice, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
of all Nations, the opinion of most Casuists,
and Reason it self, whereby the taking and exercising
of inferior offices, under undeniable Usurpers, is most
certainly confirmed: And this is plainly the case,
both of State-usurpations, and of the largeness of that
submission, which it admittes. Now as for Church-usurpations,
the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus, not
being mutable and perishing, like unto the Kingdoms
of this world; but his dominion of it self <hi>extra Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercium,</hi>
as Lawyers speak, of things not acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59845:102"/>
and by Divine decree, an everlasting dominion
which shall not pass away, and his Kingdom that
which shall not be destroyed: As it is therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of all acquisition, and his Crown such where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
(however the great ones of the Earth may ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
together and boast themselves against it) neither
violence nor possession, can intitle; So, in case of a
pretended usurpation, though Providence may order
a passive submission; yet most certain it is, that in
this case, where there neither is nor can be any title,
all deeds, so much as of simple recognizance, are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unlawful: And therefore albeit that under the
late Usurpation it was Lawfull to partake, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of inferior Magistracie, of that power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the Usurper had in providence attained; yet, in
the case of our present Church-usurpation, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it in the least, by partaking of a jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
founded in the pretended Supremacie, and not
derived from Christ, to which neither the events of
of Providence, nor immemoriable possession, can
give the least shadow of title, is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
            <p>Thus I have unfolded to you the disparity that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validates
your Argument, and have also granted the
passive submission, which Providence and Christian
patience do alwayes recommend: If the grounds here
insinuate do not so easily engage you assent, when
you shall add thereto these certain truths, 1. That in
Civils, though the manner of purchasing may be in
many cases injurious and unlawful; yet it may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to acquire the dominion. 2. That whereever
the length of time, or prescription may superinduce a
Right, there, even from the beginning, naked pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesion
is <hi>quasi titulus, &amp; qui pro suo possidet potest usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capere.</hi>
3. That although Lawyers speak of certain
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59845:103"/>
               <hi>vitia,</hi> that in private rights hinder definite prescription;
Yet all Polititians grant, that immemorial possession,
or even that of three ages, is sufficient to confirme
over any people the most violent usurpation. And
lastly, that on the other hand, our Lords Throne and
Scepter are everlasting, and such as can never be
moved, I doubt not but all your difficulties will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanish.</p>
            <p>You proceed to say, that <hi>our Ministers are content
to Preach and quite Discipline, a part of their Rights,
why may they not aswell exercise Discipline, though not
with a full liberty?</hi> 'Tis answered, 1. As I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told you, that to sit in your Courts, is not at all to
exercise Christs Discipline, but a pretended power
dependent upon another head; so, you do not truely
accuse our Ministers of quiting Discipline: it is well
known, that, in so farre as is permitted, they do
not separate Doctrine and Discipline, which our Lord
hes conjoined: And if full liberty be not permitted,
and they necessitat to acquiesce to what the Powers
will allow, it is very disingenuous in you, to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construe
this force, which they suffer, unto a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire
quiting. 2. Though by the manner of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the objection, you would have us to believe,
that the cases are parallel, and that in the case urged,
as well as in that instanced, there is only a restraint
laid upon a more full liberty; yet the disparity is most
manifest in this, that in the matter of Preaching, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the exercise of Discipline, we are by force debarred
from doing full dutie, in which case, the doing of a
part permitted, cannot be censured; whereas in the
compliance you require, the very act is sinful, and is
therefore, and not because we are denied a more full
liberty, very justly by us refused: but having vainly
concluded, upon the poor arguments which we have,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59845:103"/>
heard, our Ministers to be <hi>Peevish,</hi> and made your
pitiful N. C. confess himself non-plust by his general
pretence of Conscience; You ask him, <hi>what he can
pretend for the peoples withdrawing from your Churches,
since there is only a small alteration made in point of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
'Tis answered, if all the matter be a small
alteration in point of Government, it had farre better
become that charitable, healing and free spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
you so often pretend, to have reflected thus;
since the change lately made, by its previo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s perjury,
and subsequent deluge of profanity; the desolating
of Churches, and dispersing of Shepherds and flockes;
the disquieting, and vexing of thousands, unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
Godly and Loyal; the fiering and filling all the
corners of the Land with contention and discontent;
the burdening of a Countrey, formerly exhausted and
now expecting relief, with heavie impositions, and
strange exactions; And lastly, the necessary and worst
result of all these evils, the provocking the Lord to
Anger, and rendering his Majesties Government less
comfortable, and desireable, hath occasioned so great
a perturbation, and yet, is in it self, and imports so
small a matter, why do not our King and Nobles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
for what the Land perisheth? Wherefore do not
all men bend their knees and pour out their prayers to
God and the King, that so seen destructive, and easily
remedied a cause, may be removed? but seing for all
your sparingness in passing judgment; yet you cease
not scornfully to censure a poor people, needlessly
and unchristianly, by you ensnared, and thereafter
more cruelly persecute, and oppressed, not repeating
what hath been said by others in their vindication, I
shall briefly run over what you here subjoin.</p>
            <p>You say then <hi>That Separation being a tearing of the
Body of Christ, to forsake the unity of the Church, when
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59845:104"/>
there is scarce a colour of pretence for it,</hi> must be a great
sin, 'Tis answered, I will not stand to descant upon
the nature and several degrees of Separation, and how
that non-conforming to, and compliance with a
prevalent backsliding partie, in effect the worst of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists,
which is our present case, is very different,
from the case of Separation, from a Church formerly
acknowledged, and joined with; nor love I to inquire
how farre a mans entrie into the Ministrie, by open
perjury and violence, and his profane and flagitious
deportment therein, notourly known, may in the
perturbed state of the Church, supply the want of a
declarative sentence, making void his mission; Nor
lastly, will I make use of your own plain laws, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Act anent the restitution of Bishops, and the late
Act of Supremacie, whereby <hi>all Church-power</hi> (mark
it) <hi>is made dependent upon, and subordinat unto the Kings
Supremacie,</hi> to prove your Ministers, to be but <hi>Court
Curats:</hi> But in this I am plain and confident, that if
the Prophets, who, by their lyes and lightness, cause
the people to erre, and speak peace to such as despise
the Lord, and strengthen their hands, who walk in
the imagination of their own heart, be not to be
hearkened unto; if we ought to bewarre and flee
from false Prophets, whose fruits (of ungodliness as
well as heresie, as is clear from the context) do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
them, to be but ravening wolves, destroying
Souls, under the sheeps cloathing of an exterior call,
and hypocritical composure; if such who cause divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and offences, contraire to the received truth,
and who serve not our Lord Jesus, but their own belly,
are to be avoided; and lastly, if these Destroyers, and
Offenders be the only persons guilty of all the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and other inconveniences, which ensue, then
are your <hi>Curates</hi> (as dignoscible by all, or one or other
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59845:104"/>
of these characters, as the night is by darkness) justly,
yea necessarily, to be disowned, fled from and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and only chargeable with that schisme whereof
you endeavour to make us guilty.</p>
            <p>But you add, <hi>That, in a schismatical time-serving
humour, we come sometimes to Church, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vite the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Law; but seldom, that we may retain our interest
with our partie; that we hear some of you but not others;
that some go to Churches in the Countrey, but not in the
City; and finally some join with you in the ordinary Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Prayer and praise, yet will not join in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
which is but solemn praise.</hi> Sir, if you had been
candid in this reflection, in place of imputing this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
to humour, and faction, it would indeed have
moved you to pity the strait of so many good people,
redacted to such a multi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arious perplexity; which yet,
in its outward appearance, is but light, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of these inward inquietudes, wherewith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traire
workings of the fear of God, love of truth,
abhorrencie of wickedness, tenderness toward Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
respect to union and peace, and fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
do continually sollicite them: If I might
presume so farre upon your credite, I could tell you
that, in my certain knowledge, some have been,
against their Consciences, forced by violence and spoill
to hear your Curates, who therefore have mourned
many Moneths thereafter, and certain of them even
unto death; That others whom the generality of
your Curates did either offend, or, according to the
Lords prediction <hi>Ier. 23. v.</hi> 33. after long triall not
profite at all, have searched by a choise to remedy the
evill; (for, that there are better and worse not only
as to private, but also as to Publick transgressions,
you groundlessly deny) and lastly, that some have
prevailed with themselves to hear and join with you
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59845:105"/>
in prayer and praise, who have yet still scrupled in
their Consciences to communicate with you, in that
Sacrament; which, beside the adjunct of solemn
praise, is designedly institute to signify and confirme
our communion in, as well as our union with Christ,
from whom, we have reason to apprehend, that many
of you, according to Scripture-rules, and the grounds
which your conversations hold out, are at great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
If then these things be so, let it satisfy you in
this point, that, as the Generality of the whole land
would account it a great reliefe to be delivered of all
your Tribe, and many of the godly are convinced,
that your Ministery being neither of nor for our Lord
Jesus, is not to be owned; so all these umbrages of
compliance, which you observe, are only the effects
of curiosity, fear, or some other humane frailty,
wherewith by you we can, neither in Charity nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
be urged: But you are so desireous to win
us to this conformity of owning your Curates, that
you are willing to suppose them to be but <hi>Intruders
occupying the places of our faithfull shepherds violently
torn away;</hi> and yet you argue, <hi>that although the high
priest-hood was in our Lords dayes violently invaded by
the Romans, and by them exposed to sale, and those Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacks,
did also usurp th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> is unanswerable and was the doctrine
of our own Teachers?</hi> 'Tis answered, not to insist upon
the particular, and full answere already made by
others, for dissolving the apparent force of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
it is to be considered. 1. That as this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth proceed upon parallel instances, and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59845:105"/>
for the most part lame, and unequal; so the
Jews their particular customes and observances, in
the examples adduced, are to us so hid and unknown,
and the Jewish constitution in General, of a Church
and Nation joined in one special people, unto God, by
virtue of a Divine Law, for matters both Civil and
Religious, committed, even in its Civil part, to
the custody and interpretation of their Religious Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
is so manifestly different from that of the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Church, gathered in one, out of all and every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
only for things Religious, without any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in their Civil State, under Jesus Christ
their Head and King, and the Ministers by him sent
forth, that little light as to our present purpose,
can be thence concluded. 2. That not only in
the point of the Churches Ministerie but also in its
worship and other ordinances, to reason from the
dispensations of Soveraigne Providence, in the decline
of Churches, the lawfull compliance of good men
with these Churches, in owning them in things found,
and bearing with corruptions, which they could not
remedy; and lastly from the Lords assistance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
that never the less hath therein appeared, For
the declaring of what is dutie, or not dutie, in the
exigence of the first innovations, tending and leading
unto the setlement of these abuses, is very deceitfull
and dangerous. If in this ye be doubtfull, my charity,
I hope, shall give you satisfaction: what, before the
Reformation, were the gross corruptions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Church, both in its Ministers Worship and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
is to you well enough known: And yet,
that many pious and devout Souls, and some of them
convinced and mourning for its abominations, did
nevertheless therein sincerely seeke and serve the Lord,
and found the strength and joy of his presence, shall
never be by me denied: If then it should happen, that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59845:106"/>
in your high pretensions for Union &amp; Peace, a Popish
Ministerie, or other abuses should be set up, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
among us, would you think it just to require
our conformity, and to offer to square dutie, in such
a case, to any of these particular precedents to be
found in the times of the former darkness? I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
you would not: If our Lord, when on Earth,
did for a while connive at certain corruptions, in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
drawing to its period, and if at the times of
ignorance God sometime wink, and according to the
obscurer light, and witnessing thereof, do allow the
endeavours of such, who happily may feel after him,
and finde him; for any man thence to conclude, that
the change unto the Gospel administration, made no
alteration in dutie; or that in a greater measure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
whereby we are commanded either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of former, or to resist returning corruptions,
we ought to be stinted to the old rule, and make no
further advance, are wide mistakes: It ought to be
the study of Gods Servants, to discerne times, and
to know, in this their day, the things which belong
unto their dutie, as well as unto their peace: to ty
up practice, that ought to be advertent unto, and
hath a dependence upon every circumstance, unto
generals abstracted and concluded from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
instances of other times, is altogether fallacious.
3. Let me remember you of what I have already hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at, <hi>viz.</hi> That seing Separation is a departing from
an Union once acknowledged, even in these things
which are not in themselves condemned, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is of great importance, and of a very weighty
and various consideration; whereas non-conforming
to, or non-compliance with the introduction of
things that are clearly sinfull and unlawfull, hath a
manifest warrant, and is of no such extent: from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59845:106"/>
of not Separating, to conclude against Non-compliance;
and from denying the <hi>Majus</hi> of Non-separation,
to deny the <hi>Minus</hi> of a tender forbearance,
is bad Logick: nay, so ill doth this parity hold, that
on the contraire, the very aversion that every true
Christian ought to have for Separation, doth mostly
recommend this Non-compliance, which being a
soveraigne and prescribed antidote against these evils,
which, if once received, may go on to greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and necessitat a sadder division, is therefore
to be timeously adhibite. For clearing of this, let me
but ask you this one Question: The allowed Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the reformed Churches from that of <hi>Rome,</hi>
doth it not plainly inferre, that it had been better,
and was the dutie of these informer ages, to have sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
resisted, and not complied with the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of these errors, and evils, which afterward
did procure the rent? And however you may judge,
that the causes of that Separation were no more then
sufficient, and could have laked nothing; yet I am
assured, that you and every rationall man will say,
that a timeous Non-conforming, warrantable upon
lesser motives, might have proven the better course.
I shall not enforce this consideration by suggesting the
evill tendencie of your way; nor do I tell you that
it is a reviving of the same causes, that in processe of
time did produce all <hi>Romes</hi> abominations, and that
these floods of Error, and Superstition, had their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
rise from smaller aberrations; so that, if God
should suffer the course of your defection to prosper,
and weare out the present opposition, the Ages to
come might more justly take up against us the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of our not timeous resisting; then we can regret
the too easie compliance of these, who should have
withstood the beginnings of <hi>Romes</hi> backsliding. On
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59845:107"/>
these things, I say, I do not insist; but, that you
may the more plainly understand the difference that I
conceive to be betwixt Non-compliance, and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
I freely acknowledge, that if God had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
this whole Church, to slide into the present
evils of your Prelacie and corrupt Ministers; and
thereafter had blessed us with a discovery; yet I
would not, in that condition, allow the same neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and expediencie of a Separation, that now I finde,
to plead for a Non-compliance; in as much as our
present Non-compliance, is not only a more certain,
seasonable, and safe dutie; but is also attended with
a faithfull and edifying adherence to our true and sent
Teachers, who though removed to corners, do still
remain the Lords Ministers, and our Pastors: which
things do much difference it, from the case of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
separation, as above descrived, and do not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
justify these more tender practices which you would
disprove.</p>
            <p>Now, though these few things premised do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viously
satisfy the difficulty objected; yet, to render
the application more full and easie, you may further
consider, that your instance from these corrupt High
Priests, set up by the <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns,</hi> doth not help you.
1. Because that the high Priest was ordained by the
Lord, as in order to Sacrifice, so also for Rule and
Judgement, and that not only in matters purely Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious;
but also in all things determinable by Moses
Law: at least as to the Ministerial declaring of the
<hi>Ius,</hi> which, albeit in a great part meerly civill, are
yet, in this respect, termed the matters of God,
and jubjected to the high Priest his judgement, in the
respect mentioned. 2. There is no statute in <hi>Moses</hi>
Law, affixing, as you alleage, the high Priest-hood
to the Eldest Son of <hi>Aaron's</hi> line, who possibly might
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59845:107"/>
have happened to be an Infant, or legally incapable;
but only to his race in generall, so that there was a
necessity that the determination of the choise should
be in the hand of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> thus <hi>Eli, Abiathar</hi>
and <hi>Ahimelech</hi> were all of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> and not of <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> his branch. As for the promise made by the Lord
to <hi>Phineas,</hi> it is neither made to the eldest Son of his
posterity, nor did it give any proper right; but only
an assurance, whereof the accomplishment is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
performed in the return of the Priest-hood
to <hi>Zadock,</hi> and his line, notwithstanding the
preceeding interruption. 3. Not to enter into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
debate anent the form and power of the Jewish
Church, as distinct from the State, and wherein the
differences did consist; this is the received opinion of
the Orthodox, that though at the first institution,
their supreme Church-sanhedrin was, as to causes and
several other particulars, distinguished from their
supreme Civil-sanhedrin; yet through process of time,
and many revolutions of affaires, a confusion of the
two grew more and more, and at length the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Sanhedrin, whereof the High Priest was
President did degenerate into a mixed Court, and
having the advantage of enjoying their Religion under
their civil mutations, and keeping their High Priests
and his Courts, when they lost their King and civil
Courts, for their greatest matters, did exerce by their
Ecclesiastical Sanhedrin all the civil power they could
be permitted to exerce. 4. Particularly it is evident
that, from the dayes of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> the High
Priest-hood was much changed from its primary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
and as more extended to and busied in civil
Rule, then conversant in holy things; so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to frequent invasions at home, and at length,
with the whole Nation, swallowed up by a forraigne
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59845:108"/>
dominion: Which things being d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y perpended, it
clearly appears, that neither the practice of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
founded in the right (though an abuse of the
exercise) of their conquest, nor the symony of the
purchasers, a clandestine crime, did make void their
Priesthood: How much less then do <hi>Cajaphas</hi> his
prophesying, a Providential Dispensation, or our
Lords free answering and confession to his adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether <hi>authoritativè</hi> made by him as a Judge
of the Nation, or otherwise, scarce sufficient to
prove a Non-separation, militat against our Non-compliance,
with your re-introducing of abjured Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie,
and its corrupt Ministery. As for your instanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> our Lords words in this matter
<hi>Math.</hi> 23. 2, 3. are, <hi>the Scribes and the Pharisees sit
in Moses seat; all therefore whatsoever they bid you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that observe &amp; do; but do not ye after their works, &amp;c.</hi>
And that hereby you have no advantage appears,</p>
            <p>1. Because it doth not manifestly appear, that the
Scribes and Pharisees here spoken of were Intruders;
but, on the contraire, it is most probable that they
were Doctors of the Law, lawfully appointed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the use of that people.</p>
            <p>2. The Scribes &amp; Pharisees, sitting in <hi>Moses</hi> chair, did
teach the Law, not as appertaining meerly to the Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
&amp; Religion toward God; but as the Municipal Law of
that Nation containing also the rules of external righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and policie; and therefore are to be regarded
not so much as Ecclesiastick Teachers, but rather as
Doctors of the Law: whereby it is evident, that your
argument from our Lords command, is as farre, in
this respect, from concluding our compliance with
your intruding Preachers, as these National Doctors,
with whom our Lord was not to medle further, then
to vindicat the Law of God from their corrupt glosses
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59845:108"/>
and practices, are different from out Spiritual Pastors,
who being sent by Jesus Christ, cannot by Man be
discharged.</p>
            <p>3. If it be urged that the Scribes and Pharisees
were also the Teachers and Directors of all matters of
Religion; and even in civils did only <hi>respondere de jure</hi>
from the law of God, although this do no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the disparity, immediatly assigned; yet this is
further to be observed, that as our Lord in this regard
did expressly warn his disciples to beware of the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Pharisees, and in many things correct their
vain and perverss doctrines; so his tolerance of them
in <hi>Moses</hi> chair was only temporarie, as of many other
things, until the then approaching end of that dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
which he would not anticipate: during which
time, if our Lord do command a well-cautioned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance,
for the best improvement of that which
was shortly to be abolished, can you rationally thence
inferre, that we ought, at the pleasure of men, both
deserte his sent Ministers, whom he hath not recalled,
and comply with and owne Intruders, so lightly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating,
and abusing his Ordinance?</p>
            <p>But 4. Admit that the Scribes and Pharisees their
entrie to that office, were not in every point justifiable,
and that they truely were very <hi>wretched Teachers;</hi> yet,
their occupying of that charge, seing our Lord did not
send forth and establish his perpetual Gospel Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
until after his resurrection, was not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiat
with, and peccant in the violent exclusion of
others, lawfully setled in that chair, which they
possessed. Sir, this is so casting a difference, that I
nothing doubt, but if you will only pose your self,
what you think our Lord would have determined, in
case that, there being among the <hi>Iews,</hi> an established
order of lawful Teachers, the Pharisees had risen up,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59845:109"/>
and by open perjury and violence ejected them, and
that the business being still recent, and many of the
Teachers remaining on life, and by all acknowledged
for such, whom man could not exauctorate, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had firmly adhered to them. Let your Conscience,
I say, in these suppositions, sincerely resolve the
question, and, I am most assured, the verdict of your
own breast will be, that whatever was our Lords
connivance for a time, at a Non-separation from a
course, whereunto he was shortly to put a period:
yet, in the case here stated, he would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the people to deserte their lawful Guides, and
follow Intruders, and thereby countenance such a
wickedness.</p>
            <p>5. Although I love not to play the Critick, and do
grant, that the observance here enjoined, doth indeed
inferre Hearing not to be prohibite; yet your exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
of the command in these words, not found in
Scripture, <hi>hear them,</hi> for they sit in <hi>Moses</hi> chair, doth
found so like to that heavenly voice, <hi>this is my beloved
Son, &amp;c.</hi> and that Emphatick <hi>hear ye him</hi> there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
whereby, the old letter and typical shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows
of <hi>Moses</hi> Law being antiquat, life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
were brought to light; that I cannot but account
(that, however our Lord permitting the hearing of
the Pharisees so long as that dispensation did stand
not abolished doth here directly aime only at its
right improvement,) the two, <hi>hear ye him,</hi> and <hi>hear
ye them,</hi> in the same signification, to be inconsistent;
and this representation, a Stretch savouring more of
favour to your cause, then tendernesse of Truth and
Scripture-phrase. But I am tedious in a matter, so
obvious, the summe, wher in I would have you and
all to fixe, is this, that whatever may have been or
may be the various dispensations of Providence, in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59845:109"/>
the overcloudings of Churches, and decline and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Ordinances, wherein no doubt the holding
the foundation Jesus Christ, by sound Faith, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
in Gods sight, have gone a great length; yet
as the instancing of such times, cannot, with any
shew of reason, or measure of honesty, be alledged
for a tacite, and toward compliance, with the re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
of the evils of these dark times, in Doctrine
or Worship, contraire to the revelation of a more full
and pure light; so no more can it be made use of, after
the manifest and sealed blessing of a sent and faithful
Ministery, to perswade a voluntaire abandoning, at the
lust and arbitriment of Man, of our true Pastors,
and a willing and tame imbracing, and owning of
manifest and profane Intruders. According to which
Rules, if you will be pleased to re-examine your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
I doubt not but you will find them, neither
to be <hi>unanswerable,</hi> nor that the Doctrine of our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
against causeless Separatists, doth homologate
your inference. As to what you add, <hi>That it is a great
cruelty, if a Minister be put from his place, whether
justly or unjustly, that the people should be starved.</hi> Sir,
I am verily of your opinion; and therefore, as I wish
our outed Ministers, had testified more love, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
hazards for the relief of Souls; so I cannot but
remember you, how dreadful a charge this driving
away of Pastors, and starving of Souls will one day
amount to, against such who have been its direct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors:
However, seing the love and faithfulness of
Christ, the Great Shepherd, hath secured the event,
they that believe need not make haste, for verily they
shall be fed.</p>
            <p>Your N. C. next Argument, is, <hi>That your Curates
are naughtie men, and weak preachers.</hi> Sir, such is the
notoriety of this charge, and so afflicting ought it to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59845:110"/>
be to every one, concerned in the credit of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and honour of its Ministery; that, I am assured,
all sober men will rather impute it to tenderness, then
want of matter, that I incline not either to inlarge
the objection, or insist in the examination of your
answere. You think <hi>it an odd piece of Religion, for us
to reproach our Pastors by the name of</hi> Curats, <hi>a designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not to be ashamed of:</hi> but though the name <hi>Curate,</hi>
ows its invention, only to the vanity of men, by
whom the lowly Scripture-stile of <hi>Minister</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
and be of no proper origination, and in effect
the product of the corruption, both of the Churches
humility, and purity of the Latine Tongue; yet,
seing you account it honourable, and I and many
others do rather use it for distinction, I heartily wish
that you and others, who do appear so sensible of an
apprehended reproach, may be as serious in reflecting
upon that important aggravation, it shall furnish in
the last Judgement, against these who, in stead of
caring for Souls, do visibly destroy them. As for
what you insinuat, <hi>that the Curats are our Pastors, and
over us in the Lord,</hi> pardon me to say, that I cannot
finde the relation, either in their office or exercise, and
that, if Scripture-marks do intitle to Scripture-names,
these Intruders, entering not by the door, are liker
to Theeves, these false Teachers are but revening
Wolves, and these Prophets, who teach lies, are but
the taill: Nay, every one, who rightly considers, how
that in place of minding the Lords Work, whereunto
they pretend, and honouring him before the people,
they have made his offering and Sanctuary to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred,
and his name to be prophaned, in liew of
that honour which you acclaime, may justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that <hi>they that despise the Lord, shall be lightly
esteemed.</hi> Say not <hi>where is Christian Charity?</hi> to call
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59845:110"/>
the manifest lewdness and lies of these pitiful Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants,
whose gross abominations are, almost every
where, the grief of the godly, and the very scorn
of all, nay such, whereof your self <hi>pag.</hi> 30. doth
abhorre the patrociny, and for which, you pretend
to be a bitter mourner in secret, <hi>Slight grounds,</hi> and
to bid men be slow to take thence an impression, is
plain mockery; Charity that beleeveth all things,
resteth and rejoiceth only in the Truth, and rejoiceth
not in iniquity: neither can you alleadge, our grounds
being good, your Church, in our not complaining,
to be neglected; it were strange charity to beleeve, as
the proverb runs, that <hi>Satan will reprove sin.</hi> As for
your alledging, <hi>that to separate upon the personal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ailing,
much more weakness of a Preacher, will open a wide door
to Separation.</hi> Whatever danger may be in your smooth
generality; yet, I am confident, not to owne (for,
as to separation, I have already cleared how the
practice of these you do condemn doth differ from it)
for Ministers, such vitious intruders, and flagitious
livers, as your <hi>Curates</hi> are, is a Soveraign expedient
for preserving both of Truth and Christian Unity:
and that as <hi>to ty the good of Worship to the sincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him that manageth it,</hi> is an error; so, to think
that Gifts and a suitable converse in a Minister, are of
no influence or regard as to the work of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery;
and that because, <hi>not to hear Sermons only, but
the solemn worship of God is the chief end of our meeting</hi>
(wherein you are mistaken, if you think that you and
we do not agree) <hi>which we can do, be the Minister
what he will,</hi> is irreligion unmixed, which your jejune
commending of <hi>the reading of good Scriptures, and
singing of good Psalmes,</hi> doth not palliate. <hi>Be the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
what he will:</hi> What? be he <hi>Socinian, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
notoriously flagitious, an Adulterer, or Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59845:111"/>
Person, a despiser of Discipline, a strengthener
of the hands of the Wicked, and sander of the
hearts of the Godly, a Symoniack, is nothing but
what he may <hi>will,</hi> and many of yours do, <hi>de facto,
will:</hi> nay, be he Popish, Mahumetan, Pagan or
Atheist, all are but what he may <hi>will:</hi> O execrable
latitude! But you conclude this point, that <hi>our croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to hear such weak men, now in Conventicles, who
formerly were of no esteem among us, sayes we are not so
zealous for good Preachings, as we would make the world
beleeve.</hi> Pray, Sir, if a man in plenty, make choise,
and in penury make a shift, will you thence inferre,
he is not desirous of the best, this is too weak: but,
to be ingenuous with you, I question not, but some
<hi>Curats</hi> make constantly more able, and frequently
better Sermons, for the matter, then weaker Non-conformists;
and vet, the just grounds of our excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
do still conclude, that they are neither so good
men, nor acceptable Preachers, as these whom we
preferre. As for what you add, <hi>That the way to make
a man popular among us, is to rail against Church and
State,</hi> It is a malitious calumny, wherewith you
endeavour to slander us unto our Rulers, and which
they, who ought to be as the Angels of God, may
easily discerne and repell.</p>
            <p>Your N. C, in the next place objects to you, the
obligation of the Covenant: wherein the whole
Nation and the posterity are engaged, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
our former Presbyterian Ministery, extirpat
your Prelacie and all depending on that Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
and whatsoever shall be found con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound Doctrine, and the power of Godliness. I
shall not improve this argument, being of such an
obvious evidence, in any further explication; but
briefly review what you answere, on the contraire:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59845:111"/>
And 1. Your evil Conscience foometh forth your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against the Covenant, in your reproachfull
calling it, <hi>our</hi> Goliah, <hi>alwayes brought out by us, to
defy the Armies of the living God, whose strength, like</hi>
Sampsons, <hi>lay in its hair, the Armies that fought for
it, and not in any innate vigour.</hi> But as, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the arrowes of malice, blasphemy, and
rage, that you and your party, have shot at it, it still
abideth in strength, and the Armies of its followers
have been made strong, by the hands of the mighty
God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and, even in their most desperat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
did by the bloud of the Lamb, and the word
of their Testimony, obtain the most signall victory;
So, <hi>the Virgin, the Daughter of Zion, hath despised thee
and laughed thee to scorn; Whom hast thou reproached?
And against whom hast thon exalted thy voice?</hi> even <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

               </gap>sly: He
it is that it regardeth the rage, and tumult of your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and will turne you back: and as the inconsistencie,
of your assimilations to <hi>Sampson,</hi> a Worthy of the Lord
and to <hi>Goliah,</hi> a Champion of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> do
plainly discover the unreasonableness of your spite;
so the Lord who hath already proved the <hi>innate vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi>
of his Covenant, in the bloud and suffering of his
Martyres, can also, in his good time, make its hair
to grow, and strength to returne, to the utter ruine
of your Prelacie, and all its adherents. But 2. You
proceed to tell us, <hi>that it is a ridiculous fancie, to say,
Children can be bound by their Fathers Oath, which is to
make us the Servants of men, and give them Authority
over our Consciences, Gods peculiar power:</hi> Sir; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that whether you rage or laugh there is no rest:
just now we heard you railing, and certainly here you
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59845:112"/>
are rallying: but <hi>first,</hi> I am glad to find your assert so
plainly, the liberty of our Consciences from mans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
and shall only remember you, that if a Father,
in respect of this liberty, may not, at his arbitriment,
bind his Son by an Oath, requiring a conscientious
performance, undoubtedly farre less can Rulers,
whether Civil or Ecclesiastick, perscribe at their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitriment
in matters of Religion, which, without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
do exact a conscientious observance. 2. Though,
the Lords Authority over Conscience do indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
it from mans usurpation; yet, in so farre as it
hath pleased the Lord, to vest any person with this
power over another, all usurpation ceaseth, and the
Lords reserved dominion doth rather establish it: for
example; therefore it is, that the righteous and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
commands of lawfull Rulers, do even in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
bind their Subjects; because in so farre as they
observe the limits of their power, by him appointed,
their authority is understood to be of God, and by
him approved and allowed. 3. It is manifest that
the Lord hath, in many things, given to Fathers,
by virtue of his precept, a Power of Command,
reaching even unto Conscience, without an interveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Oath: <hi>Honour the Father and thy Mother,</hi> is that
which God hath enjoined; and doth certainly require
a sutable obedience; If then this Authority be not
impugned by your alledged reason, <hi>that we are not the
servants of men,</hi> can the interposing of an Oath, or the
Fathers adjuration, in things otherwayes under the
compass of his power, render your objection more
effectuall? But 4. That I may returne you a round
and full Answere: I say, that in many cases, whereof
our present case of the Covenant is of all the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
Children, by virtue of the paternal authority
given and allowed by the Lord, can be, and <hi>de facto</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:59845:112"/>
are bound, by their Fathers Oath: And <hi>first,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Fathers command doth engage to a perpetuall
obedience, there can be no question, but, in that
case, an accessory adjuration doth greatly intend the
obligation: I need not confirme this by the parallel
instance of <hi>Saul's</hi> adjuring the People, while in the
pursuite of his enemies; the reason of this position is
above exception, <hi>viz.</hi> That if a simple command,
flowing from the paternall power which God hath
established, be therefore binding, the solemn invock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the same God to be an avenger of the contempt
of that authority, by himself approven, cannot but
add to the obligation: but if you desire to know in
what things, and how farre the command of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even of it self, without the consent and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Children, (which I grant, when inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
doth alter the case) doth oblige? Take the
instance of the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> who for obedience to their
Father <hi>Ionadab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> command, who lived some Ages
before, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 15. not to drink wine (a thing
free in it self, and not under any Divine precept) they
nor their sons for ever, have therefore the Lords ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
commendation, sealed with a perpetuall blessing:
If then a Father's command in things free, and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
may be confirmed by the accession of an oath,
and, in the case adduced, doth perpetually bind, how
much more, must the sworn engagement of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for himself and his posterity in things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Lord, be everlastingly obliging. 2. In what
case soever, a Father's Bond or Contract is binding to
himself and his posterity, if he confirme the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>amine
by an Oath, the force and vertue thereof doth also
reach all the off-spring, cocerned in the obligement.
For explication of this truth, it is not needful that I
determine particularly, what Contracts are perpetual,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59845:113"/>
and what only personall: If these be perpetual,
whereof the subject matter being either under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of an express perpetual command, or having an
evident and lasting conveniencie, agreeable to the
principles of Truth and Righteousness, the party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracter
doth expressly thereby engage for himself and
his posterity: as it is short of the true and full extent
of perpetuall contracts, which cannot in reason be
restricted within the limits of paternal commands, so
it is more then necessary for my purpose, and more
then proven by the instances subjoined.</p>
            <p>Now that there are such obligations, as perpetual
of their own nature so, carrying along with them the
virtue of that accessory Oath, whereby at first they
were established, is clear, not only from that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and Oath <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10 &amp; 14. whereunto <hi>Moses</hi>
did engage the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> and which he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to be made with them that stood there that day,
and also with him that was not there; to with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
to come, as appears by the sequele of that
Chapter, specially, v. 29. an example whereof the
exceeding evidence can only expose it to exception;
but also from these more controverted instances 1. of
that Promissory oath taken by <hi>Ioseph</hi> of the Children
of <hi>Israel,</hi> for carrying up his bones from <hi>Egypt,
Gen.</hi> 50. 25. which the after-generation in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of its Religion did punctually observe, <hi>Exo. 13.
ver.</hi> 19. 2. From the Oath sworne by the People of
<hi>Israel</hi> to the <hi>Gibeonites, Iosh.</hi> 9. 15. for the breach
whereof, we find, the Lord severall ages thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
severely animadverting against all <hi>Israel,</hi> and
<hi>Sauls</hi> house in particular: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2: 1, 2. For these
you may add, the sworne Leagues, and Agreements
of all Nations among themselves, which do undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
with the same force and quality, descend to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59845:113"/>
their Posterity. But wherefore should I insist in a
matter so evident, and, at least as to the difference
betwixt us, universally acknowledged? If your
meaning, in affirming that Children can not be bound
by their Fathers Oath, were only, that however, a
promissory Oath, may be binding upon the Posterity,
in the nature of a promise, and for performance; yet
the religion of the Oath, is not so transmitted, as to
render the Posterity, in case of a breach, perjured;
there might possibly appeare to be some ground of
debate betwixt us; (of which afterward) but seing
it is apparent both from your proposition, explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
subjoined, and design aimed at, that you deny a
Fathers promissory Oath, even in the substance, <hi>viz.</hi>
so much as a promise, let be in the quality of an
Oath, to be obliging as to his Children, you mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
repugne, not only to the instances given; but
to the common opinion, reason, yea and sense of all
Men, Nations and Ages, whereby it is most constant,
that such is, and hath been alwayes repute, the power
and representation of Fathers <hi>quoad</hi> their Children,
that their pactions and contracts, not only in matters
determined by divine precept; but also in things in
themselves free and indifferent, <hi>viz.</hi> their condition
in order to the Society civil, whereof they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
yea even their state, as free men of slaves, have,
without the least challenge of Usurpation over Cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience,
seing founded in that Authority which God
approves, been holden perpetually binding. But that
I may immoveablie establish the obligation of this
Covenant, which I am perswaded God will require,
for ever: I shall not content my self with these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
concessions. 1. That the sworne Pactions and
Covenants of a Nation or People incorporate in one
Body Politick, do, even in the quality of Oaths,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59845:114"/>
descend to after Generations; because, while the
same civil form of their constitution remains, they
are still understood to be the same People, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the change whether partial or total of the
individual constituents, which doth no more alter
the formal identity of the Nation, then the fluxe and
change of parts in our bodies, waters in a channel, or
boards in a Ship, do change the samness of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
River, or Ship. 2. That the promissory Oaths of
Fathers, in all things, whereunto the sphere of their
Authority doth extend, do at least bind the Children,
as promises, and to the implement: which conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
granted by all, do nevertheless, above all scruple,
confirme the obligation of our Covenants, which
you impugne: yet, seing that I do apprehend, both
the disparity placed betwixt a Nation and a private
person, to be narrow and groundless, and the second
position, to fall short of Truths full extent in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
to remove from you all ground of scruple, I
shall reduce the whole matter to these certain po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
            <p>1. That though assertory Oaths, being only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory
for further security, do indeed intend, but
cannot extend, the force of any Obligation, either as
to its subject matter, or the persons thereby bound,
beyond its rational import; yet such hath alwayes
been the Religion, and Reverence of promissory
Oaths as, (nothing impeding either from the peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the subject, or other circumstances, or from
the declared will of the person engaging) ever to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliat,
and extend the interpretation, and make the
successors, as well as the promiser himself, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be therein comprehended.</p>
            <p>2. That the true ground and measure, both as to
the determination of the subject, and extent of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59845:114"/>
obligation, whereby the force of the Fathers contract,
expressly binding himself and his posterity, may be
known and defined; is, this Paternal power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
it being in it self evident, that, as by reason
hereof the Children follow the state and condition of
the Father, (unless in so farre, as the favour of liberty,
or positive Law hath made an alteration) so, where
the Father by command may oblige to obedience, if
by his obligation he do bind to performance, he is
thereby truly to be understood much more, <hi>de facto,</hi>
to exercise all the power he hath, whereby he may
render his engagement effectual: Now in what things,
and how farre Fathers may both dispose upon and
command their Children, is sufficiently known, and
their undoubted Authority, not only to command
obedience to the Law of God; but also to determine
them in matters free, are, by the examples of Pious
Parents, and that of <hi>Ionadab</hi> upon record, much
more cleared, then is necessary to our <hi>hypothesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Seing it is from the virtue and influence of this
paternal power, that the Contract of Society, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Politick bodies do at first coalesce, doth descend
unto the posterity, and so continue the Society, and
its constitution to after-generations; the reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the other Contracts, either simple or sworne, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
into by these associat people, do bind their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
must of necessity resolve into the same cause;
and to referre it to an imaginary samnesse, having no
other reality then the first intercession, and continuance
of the fundamental Contract of Society, is but an
emptie Notion, importing no real difference: for,
as the perpetual obligation of the original Contract,
constituting the Society, can have no other cause then
what is assigned; and it were irrational to attribute
its continuance, to a samness, which it produceth;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59845:115"/>
so, it is only in the force and power thereof, that all
other after-National-Contracts, are binding upon the
whole, and propagat to the succeeding race.</p>
            <p>4. This third position being certain, it necessarily
follows, that the oath taken by <hi>Ioseph,</hi> of the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
of <hi>Israel,</hi> anent his bones, and that given by them
to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> both, by Scripture declared to be
binding, as Oaths, upon the Posterity, have no
proper and peculiar reason, but do unanswerably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that whereever the Father's obligation, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
binding to his off-spring, is confirmed by an
Oath, it is transmitted to them with the same acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory
force, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ender them guiltie in God's sight, not
only of breach of Promise, but breach of Oath: which
argument is so much the more evident, in the first
case of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were not,
when they sware to him, imbodied in a Politick state;
but did only stand in their natural Relation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity.</p>
            <p>5. Seing we finde in Scripture the Lord Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Fathers, for themselves, and their Posterity;
as in the case of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Fathers engaging to the
Lord in the same manner, as <hi>Ioshua</hi> for himself and
his house; the above-mentioned import, and extent
of <hi>Ionadab's</hi> command, and (not to mention the
Fathers power of devoting their Children, and of
making void their vowes) even the adjuration and
curse of Rulers, taking effect, many Ages thereafter;
as that of <hi>Ioshua</hi> against the Rebuilders of <hi>Iericho:</hi>
with what shew of reason, can we deny (the matter,
or other argument of a contraire intention, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting)
that the sworne obligations of Fathers, are
binding upon their Children, aswell for the Religion
of the Oath, as the Truth of the Promise? I know
that, as to mans tribunal and judgement, it is thought
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59845:115"/>
hard <hi>poenam perjurij illi irrogari, qui ipse Deum testem
ac vindicem non invocaverit, that one should be punished
as perjured, who hath not himself invocated God as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and avenger.</hi> But as we do clearly see, the Lords
judgement in the contraire; doth not the same reason,
which, by making the Father's promise, for himself
and Children, also their promise, and therefore bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by transmitting the Oath in like manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
its righteousness. I need not here precaution,
against the Children their invincible ignorance of the
Fathers Promise, and Oath; their innocencie in this
case, descending from a clearer distinct head, and
purging from breach of Promise, as well as breach
of Oath, doth neither inferre the liberty, which
you plead for; nor impugne the transmission of a
sworne Promise, in its Religion, as well as in its
Obligation</p>
            <p>6. Our Covenant, being in the matter necessary
and righteous; for the manner, made with and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, to be perpetually binding; and for its so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
unanimously sworne, by almost the whole
Nation, and confirmed by all the Authority in it,
hath, such a concurring evidence, of all arguments,
and opinions, for its perpetuity, as an Oath, that
your nibling at it, upon this head, is not a greater
proof of your perfidie, then testimony of your incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
ignorance; but if you be ignorant your self,
you do well to make your N, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> no better: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you make him objecte against your assertion, <hi>that
Children cannot be bound by their Fathers Oath: doth not
the Fathers debt oblige the Son? and why not his Oath?</hi>
But to give you the advantage you designe: I willingly
turne the Argument to make for you, thus: The
Father's debt doth not oblige the Son, unless he be
also his Heir, and in this respect, only as Possessor of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59845:116"/>
his goods: therefore &amp;c. To which I answere, that
as by the tenor of written Bonds for debt, it is clear,
that the Debtor doth only oblige himself, &amp; his Heirs,
and Successors in his Lands and goods, so, both Law
and Reason do interpret, all ordinary promises for
debt, to be of the same nature, <hi>viz.</hi> to bind the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
himself, and to follow and affect his Estate, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the person, who, enjoying, by universal
title, the promiser his estate, is, by the interpretation
of Law, understood to accept of the same, with that
burthen, and no further; so, that, if a Son, as Son,
be not liable, it is evidently from the restriction of
the obligation, according to the meaning of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
which I already told you, that an accessory
Oath doth not exceed; and maketh nothing for a
Son's freedome in Conscience, as to such other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
whereunto both the Father's power,
and intention, do concurre to make him liable.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I confess you do your N. C.
reason, and as just now we have heard, the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
objection you put in his mouth; so, in this place,
to his unanswerable argument, for the Childrens obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
by the Parents Oath, from the dutie of our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance,
descending from our Fathers their swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same; you returne as ridiculous an answer:
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>we are not at all obliged to the King by their
Oath, but because the right of the Crown is in his Person:</hi>
who can forbear to laugh? are you a Doctor in <hi>Israel,</hi>
and also a high pretender for the King, and understands
no better? You say <hi>the right of the Crown is in his person,</hi>
but supposing it came there by the originall consent,
and allegeance sworne to his first Predecessor, (which
I am sure is a title which, in this place, you will not
quarrel) is not the same that is the cause of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
also the reason of our subjection? Or will you
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59845:116"/>
admit it to be the Creating, and not also the Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cause? How do the most common maximes of
reason militat against you? You add, <hi>and we are born
his Subjects:</hi> but, pray, doth our birth as men, or as
men born in such a place, bring us forth with this
character? then should all men, or at least even stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
casually born in the place, be also born Subjects:
whereunto then can it else be ascribed, unless it be,
that we are the off-spring of such, who for themselves
and their posterity, did submit to the King, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
surrender, transmitted upon us, <hi>passivè</hi> with
the same obligation? If these things do not satisfy,
I intreat you to reflect, upon the ordinary strain of all
impeachments: where you will finde, the person ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of Treason, though he never actually swore, or
promised allegeance; yet constantly, and very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruously,
charged, with breach of Faith, Failty,
and Allegeance: nay, I nothing doubt, but if you
were describing to us the crime of Rebellion, you
would at great length prove, it, to be both falshood
and perfidy.</p>
            <p>Your N. C. proceeds to argue thus: <hi>How was
Adam obliged for his Posterity, if Parents cannot binde
their Children?</hi> And in return you say, <hi>This is strange
dealing:</hi> and because you will have the instance an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applicable
mystery, therefore, you recurre to <hi>secret
Divine transactions,</hi> without either warrant, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity:
but, Sir, is not this a strange stupiditie in
you; be it so, that God's Covenanting with <hi>Adam,</hi>
as the common Head of Mankind, so as upon <hi>his</hi>
deed, to make their standing or falling depend, is a
difficulty, which only Gods Soveraignity can expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat:
is this therefore also a mysterie, that <hi>Adam</hi>
might have been, any other father may be obliged,
both for himself and his posterity; so as to ty them to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59845:117"/>
obedience, and upon their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

there be any thing more plain, both in Scripture and
Reason, then that not only the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ds command, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will, should be perpetual to the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity;
but also a Peoples Covenant, made with him
to observe the same, doth oblige both them and after-Generations,
to continuall obedience? as the 29. of
<hi>Deut.</hi> most convincingly holds out. But you go on
still stumbling, thus: <hi>I Parents can binde duties upon
their Children, they may as well binde sins, and this is
to make way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or more Originall sin then</hi> Adams. Who
would not pity such impertinencies? The thing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
is, that a Parent may oblidge for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to dutie: and you subjoin, <hi>he may as well bind sins
upon them:</hi> Certainly, Sir, these are not the words of
sobriety: A Parent may command his Son to dutie,
may he also command him to sin? the <hi>ignis fatuus</hi>
that seduces you, is that you appear to be dazled,
by an imagination of your own, that we go about to
im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ute to Children, not the Parents obligation; but
their deeds, their duties, or failings, which, truly
we as little dream of, as certainly you will finde your
present dream, about Originall sin, when you returne
to your self, wholly extravagant.</p>
            <p>But the next lapse you make, is, in the person of
your N. C. whom you cause in place of adducing an
obligement by a Father, binding himself and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
to bring in the instance of the Baptismal vow,
undertaken by the Father, in Name of the Child,
which seing it meets not our Question, you both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecte,
and answere to no purpose.</p>
            <p>The next demand your N. C. makes, is, <hi>How then
is</hi> Saul <hi>charged, and his Children punished, for killing
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59845:117"/>
the</hi> Gibeonites? And to this you make a very pleasant
return, not unlike your answere made to our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Allegeance, <hi>viz Shat</hi> Saul <hi>is taxed for bloud,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> against that Oath, which the
Princes swore:</hi> Before I consider this answere, let
us first hear the Scripture. 2 <hi>Sam. 21. 2. [Now the
Gibeonites were not of Israel; but of the Amorites, and
the Children of Israel had sworne unto them, and Saul
sought to stay them, &amp;c. Wherefore David said to the
Gibeonites, what shall I do for you?</hi>] do not these
words clearly intimate, that the injury done them,
was contraire to that former Oath, whereby they
were secured? To this you say, <hi>The Oath is only here
mentioned, to reminde the Reader of the former History;
but doth not at all say, that the Oath was still binding:</hi>
But, if the words be set down to reminde the Reader,
certainly, it is in order to some apposite purpose; and
the blind account that you make, is scarce worthy of
your self, let be the Scriptures of Truth. Next, what
can be more evident, then, that the Oath is first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
to shew their right, thence derived; and
<hi>Saul's injury,</hi> being thereto subjoyned, it is manifest,
that for his breach thereby incurred, a reparation for
an attonement is offered: and seing the Scripture
saith enough, if it say not expressly, that the Oath
was still binding, it seems only to be omitted, because
in that Age, there was none who doubted, much less
of your opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to deny it: Now as to your answer,
I must take notice of what you seem to insinuat, that
the <hi>Gibeonites were spared, not by reason of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
made with the Princes; but by the Lords ratisying
of it, whereby they became to be excepted, from the rest of
the devoted Canaanites;</hi> But Pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> do you not
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59845:118"/>
in so supposing con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>adict your Fellow-brother the
<hi>Surveyer</hi> of <hi>Naphtaly</hi> who ranteth (as you use to do)
against his Adve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sary the Author of the <hi>Apologetical
Relation,</hi> who asserted the same which you here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
2. You speak of a ratification of this Oath of
the Princes, by virtue of which, abstracted from
the Oath these <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were spared, which you
would do well to explain and cleare. Seing then you
cannot but grant that the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were spared, and
enjoyed their lives, by the right of that peace sworne
unto them, my next reply is most evident, <hi>viz.</hi> that
your answere, alledging <hi>Saul's</hi> killing the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi>
to have been cruell, and bloudy against their Right;
but not perfidious against that Oath and Covenant,
whereby their Right was granted, can no more be
said of <hi>Saul,</hi> then it might have been said of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who at first swore, if so be they had, the very
next hour, brocken their Oath, and destroyed these,
whom they had saved, it being a truth most certain,
that as every violation of Faith, is, an injurious inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of that right, which was thereby secured; so, it
is impossible for a right, arising from a Contract or
Covenant, to subsist, unless its cause do still stand,
&amp; be repute to be in force: You add, <hi>that Saul is taxed
of bloud and not of perjury:</hi> A poor shift; But I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewed him to be noted for both; &amp; <hi>bloudy</hi> &amp; <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull</hi>
are of too near a conjunction, to allow of your
negative inference, of the exclusion of the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
one only expressed. And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have
ended this point: only let me say it without vanitie
that as I judge, your folly in this last discourse to be
such, as no sober man could lightly fall into, without
a judicial desertion; so, I am confident if there be
any ingenuity in you, the return which I justly make
you of the Epilogue, which in this place you so vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59845:118"/>
use, will cover you with blushes, <hi>viz. Thus I have
taken more pains, then was needfull, to shew the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
fondnesse of your absurd notion. viz. That Children
can not be bound by their Fathers Oath;</hi> and have said
more to disprove it then ever you will be able to
answere.</p>
            <p>What follows in this Dialogue is a meere rapsodie
of railing, and in the first place to decline your N, C.
too pungent demand, <hi>that for all you have said, you
cannot deny but the Covenant binds these who tooke it,</hi>
you make a hydeous noise, of that <hi>Little noise,</hi> which,
you say, <hi>we made in breaking it in some things: viz. In
our silence, and not declaring against the Apostacy, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and Perjury of the Usurpers, and in our faint
giving over to Pray for the King,</hi> Sir, contemning
your calumny, I answere, were not the Usurpers
sufficiently opposed in their evill courses, while there
was hope? And is this all you can say, that the Lord
having broken us, and brought us under their feet,
in the humbling sense of his dreadful displeasure, we
did not madly declaime against such, to warn whom,
after their rejecting of our brotherly admonition, the
Lord did not further require us: We love not to vye
with you, or any other, either in stedfastness in the
Covenant, or faitfulnes to the King, in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
and calamitous times; but of this one
thing I am most confident, that his Majesty was more
obliged to the Covenant, and these who to this day,
adhere to it, for the continuance of his remembrance,
both with God and men, in the dayes of his Exile,
and in disposing to, and preparing the way of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
then to all the present high and false pretenders
who are not ashamed, in their flattering impudence,
to averre, that the most notorious and base acts of
Compliance, whereof they were then guilty, were
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59845:119"/>
yet the effects of a pure and constant loyalty: As for
<hi>the thundering,</hi> you say, <hi>was in your Pulpits, against
your course, before we were silenced, and is at this day in
our Conventicles:</hi> is it not enough, that you mock at
the warnings of the Lords Servants, whom for no
other cause, then true Zeal for God, and tender Love
to your Souls, and just indignation at your sin, you
have beaten and expelled; but you must also thereto
add falshood, in your alledgeance anent what you call
<hi>Conventicles,</hi> and insolent insulting over our undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
short-coming, in due admonition, after his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Restitution; whereunto an excessive desire, by
faireness and moderation, to stop the precipitant cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of your late defection, did too generally tempt us,
before we were ejected: but the Lord hears, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>You tell us, in the next place, <hi>That the Tyrann's
cruelty did formerly terrify us, and now we presume upon
the King's clemencie.</hi> If I had ever professed the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
part of that respect for <hi>Oliver</hi> that the Chief of
your way did, I would say, and say it truely, that
what ever he was <hi>Titulo,</hi> he was no <hi>Tyrannus Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio;</hi>
however, I am farre from justifying the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
their practices, or denying altogether his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Clemencie, whereof the indemnity given to the
same Usurpers doth exhibite so faire an evidence; but
this I must say, that as I do wholly impute the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of much of the Kings goodness and favour
from us, to the malign influence of the unlucky con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of accursed Prelates, whereby some even of
the great and most solemn acts of his Maiesties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
bountie have been frustrat and depraved; so such
hath been, and is, the implacable spite and rigour of
their Malice, and Persecution, that not only it hath
surmounted their resentment of the Sectarian inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59845:119"/>
and made them ascribe all these Mischiefs to us,
who were their most constant Enemies; but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees exceeded all the violences, wherewith the
<hi>Englishes,</hi> during their Domination among us, can
be charged: If you require a proof; instead of a long
condescendence that I might adduce, the case of the
then <hi>Tories</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> and late <hi>Risers</hi> in the <hi>South,</hi>
with the respective measures, where with they have
been treated, being impartially pondered and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
is an irrefragable instance. As to <hi>the trip,</hi> you
mention, <hi>of these who ceased, for fear of loss of Stipend,
publick praying for the King, which they had in print
owned for a dutie:</hi> As at the worst you can call it but
a <hi>trip,</hi> which I think, if not the respect you owe to
your Arch-master <hi>Sharp,</hi> who, at that time, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desisted whith others; but, as he may remember,
did overture it to his Brethren, to pray in publick
for the then <hi>Protector;</hi> yet, the many horrid lapses
whereof, upon smal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er temptations, yours are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
might have made you forbear to mention it, so, all
circumstances being examined, and the practices of
the Prophets and People of God in old times duely
considered, a Prudent correction of an over-zealous
assertion, will be found its more just censure.</p>
            <p>But your N. C. adding oyl to your flame, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
you, that <hi>for our particular failings, you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
all,</hi> you go on in your accusation, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aside our private faults, as if our publick alone
were more then your indignation can decipher, and
expressly waving all design of reflection, that by this
smoothing unguent, you may render the spears of
your envy better pointed, you tell us, <hi>That all you
do, is, but to let us see, we are but as other men; and not
such wonders as we would have the world believe?</hi> Sir,
though the world knowes, that this is but your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59845:120"/>
and not our arrogance; yet I must add,
that so strangely hath the apostasie, and wickedness of
your course prevailed in this Land, that a very small
measure of Faitfulness, is enough, without any miracle
to make any man both a sign &amp; a Wonder: but you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to tell us of <hi>Monstruous faults we committed in exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Oath of the League,</hi> over &amp; above <hi>that it was a
bond of Rebellion,</hi> as you hinted in your <hi>first Dialogue,</hi> &amp; I
have fully there refuted: And as to <hi>the Nationall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
you say, <hi>it was a cruell imposing upon Consciences,
to make a Nation sweare, what they could not understand:</hi>
A man would think that you having turned us from
being <hi>wonders o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that you were big with
some amazing discovery to ensue; but behold the
<hi>ridiculus Mus; you made the Nation renounce all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of poperie, and amongst the rest</hi> Opus operatum
<hi>a Latine word, and abstruse conceit; with many other nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that simple people did not understand:</hi> and to mend
the jest, you add, <hi>was it not a contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>diction, to make
them sweare against Worship in an unknown Tongue, and
yet in the Oath, which is an act of Worship, to use it?</hi> yea,
you made them preface this, with a great l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, <hi>that it
was after full &amp; mature consideration, of all particulars
whereof they were not capable, beside the Tyranny of making
men sweare in matters, whereof some were debetable: &amp;c.</hi>
Before I enter upon this weighty challenge of words:
I cannot but note the ingenuity that hath escaped you:
Your Brethren commence our work from the 37, and
tell us, that we were false pretenders to old foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but you by a plain impugnation of the <hi>National
Covenant,</hi> as it was first contrived, and sworne, in
the 1580. 81. and 90; do clearly intimate, the
true consequentiall extent of your common prejudice
and very plainly signify, that Malignancie and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59845:120"/>
for all the industrious dissembling of your Partie,
are nevertheless of a near cognation: nay forgetting,
that this Covenant was framed at first by King <hi>Iames</hi>
his speciall command, and by his reiterat autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and example, very solemnly confirmed, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by King <hi>Charles,</hi> in the beginning of the troubles
expressly ordained to be renewed; so prevalent is the
malice of your errour, that all the regard to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
whereof at other times you do so vainly boast,
doth not here in the least restrain you from staging
these two Kings with us, as <hi>Monstruous imposers.</hi>
But to the objection it self, 'Tis answered, <hi>first,</hi> that it
is indeed a cruell imposing upon Conscience, to
make a Nation sweare an Oath, they could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;
but do you think that because <hi>opus operatum</hi> is
a Latine word, that therefore the people, who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Poperie, had been too much acquainted with
Latine termes and phrases, and at the first breaking
up of the light o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Reformation amongst us, had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
both in private and Publick, heard the Popish
errors of Justification by works, <hi>Opus operatum, &amp;c.</hi>
fully explained and refuted, neither did, nor could
understand its meaning? Or because to you, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> appeares an <hi>abstruse conceit,</hi>
and many other Popish tenets, renounced in that
Covenant, seem to be but <hi>niceties:</hi> must they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be so to all? And was it impossible for these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Lord, who where imployed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the Nation, and did at first tender that
Oath, to make the grossness of these popish fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
and of this in particular, though under a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
name, sufficiently plain, even to the meanest
capacities? Certainly, Sir, the very simple ones,
whom you despise, do laugh at the weakness of this
arguing. 2. As you do not remember, that this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59845:121"/>
was first taken, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on the back of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
from Poperie, when all the errors, therein
renounced, were recent in mens memories; so,
you consider not, that thereby we first declare, the
true Christian Religion, to be that which is revealed
to the world, by the Preaching of the blessed Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
and received and beleeved, by the Kirk of
<hi>Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore do abhorre, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
all contrarie Religion and Doctrine; but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all kinde of Papistrie in generall, and particular
Heads as they are damned by the word of God, and
in speciall the Usurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Authority of that Roman
<hi>Antichrict, &amp;c,</hi> and finally, all his vain Rites, and
Traditions, brought into the Kirk, without, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the word of God, and Doctrine of this reformed
Kirk. Now I would inquire, if these general clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
clearly referring to the word of God, as the
only binding rule of Truth, may not be la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fully
sworn to, without a distinct knowledge of all the
Particulars, that possibly may therein be included?
And if the condescending upon Particulars, doth
import any thing more, then our sincere profession,
that we judge the same to be comprised under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Rule, and therefore as such, do renounce
them: seing then, that this enumeration, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
doth not invalidate; and when expressed,
doth require rather a sincere acknowledgement, then
a dilucide and through knowledge; your arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, from the possibility, nay even from the
probability of an incident mistake, while in the
mean time the perswasion of the truth of the blessed
Gospel, as the regulating Rule is held firme and sure;
is nothing solid nor concludent: but because the two
Latine words, <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> are the great ground
of your quibling, I suppose that the Oath, after the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59845:121"/>
positive part, and generall abjuration of Papistrie,
had only begun to enumerate particulars, thus, [and
in special, the usurped authority of that Roman <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
all his tyrannous <hi>Laws,</hi>] and in place of the rest,
had given us a faire <hi>et caetera:</hi> certainly as the premised,
and subjoyned qualification of this <hi>&amp; caetera,</hi> would
have fully salved its generality; so no doubt the known
signification of the words, had prevented the offence
of their being Latine: If in this you be doubtful, let
me only reminde you, by way of Argument <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi>
of the Prelatick Oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> with its blind
<hi>&amp; caetera</hi> which, though for its illimited laxeness,
joined with its evil tendencie, did give to all sober
men, just ground of seruple; yet upon the account
of the Latine, was never quarrelled, by either Man
or Woman.</p>
            <p>But you say it <hi>was a contradiction, to make them
sweare against Worship in an unknown Tongue; and yet
in that very Oath so to use it:</hi> A wittie knack indeed;
if you were arguing with the Apostle, against wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in a strange language, because the unlearned can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
thereto say <hi>Amen,</hi> would you not account this
reply, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a contradiction, to bring an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from the unlearned, not being in case to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to a strange Language, when that very assent
is, as to us, so expressed, absurd and ridiculous?
Why then doth this vain subtilty so pitifully delude
you? And why do you not advert, that a Tongue in
general may be unknown, and yet, many of its
words and phrases, not only transferred to our Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
with a suteable accommodation (as is manifest in
all our speech) but also simply borrowed, and by
custome rendered to all significant? Seing therefore,
it is the Tongue, as unknown, and not as Latine,
Greek, or the like, that is the ground of the abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59845:122"/>
against Worship in an unknown Tongue; and
yet in that same Oath to use a word from it, of a
known signification, is no contradiction.</p>
            <p>Next you add, <hi>That we made the people preface this
Oath with a great lye,</hi> of full and mature consideration
of all particulars, <hi>whereof we nevertheless knew they
were not capable:</hi> but why do you in fixing lyes upon
others, impinge so manifestly your self? The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
doth only preface, <hi>Long and due examination
of our own Consciences, in matters of true and false Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi>
as to your <hi>mature and full consideration of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</hi>
it beares nothing: 2. As every Oath is to be
made in <hi>Truth, Righteousnes, and Iudgement;</hi> so, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
the examination mentioned, is both every
ones capacity, and dutie; and no doubt, in all times,
when this Oath was taken, was not only recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but sufficiently warned of, instructed, and
promoved by these faithful men, by whom it was
administrate: but 3. Think you it so hard a
matter, for any person serious in matters of
Religion, according to the truth revealed in
Scripture, to be able from <hi>mature consideration,</hi> to
reject all these vain Popish Inventions, and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
enumerate in this Covenant; whereof, as
there are a great many that, without any curious scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
into their nature, meerely for want of warrants
and through Scripture-silence, come to be renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
so, in special, the conceit of, <hi>opus operatum,</hi>
being contrary to the very life and spirituality of
Religion, must to every one, who knows that God
requires the heart, and is to be served and worshiped
in Spirit and in Truth, certainly appear to be most
detestable? Sir, your scrupulous doubting and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in these matters, do sadly intimate a greater
measure of unsoundness, then I am willing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59845:122"/>
But you tell us, that <hi>many of the things sworne
against, are disputable:</hi> Pray, Sir, tell us which,
that you may be known? There are now nintie years
since they were all abjured, as Popish Errors and
Superstitions, without the least doubt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
by any Protestant among us: If you judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
it were better you were known, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendence,
then by your generall and subdolous
hints, left to render mens mindes unstable. But you
plead only <hi>charity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and think it hard, <hi>that no man
may be of our communion, except he be of our opinion in
all things:</hi> Sir, this is a groundless accusation, seing
it is sufficiently plain, that, whatever tenderness we
are to exercise toward such, as in points less mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,
do modestly differ from us; yet this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
being entered into, in obedience to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>Come out of her</hi> (that is <hi>Babylon) my people,
that ye be not partakers of her sins: and be ye separate
saith the Lord: and touch not the unclean thing:</hi> the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
abjuration of Poperie, as opposite to the blessed
Evangell, the summe and end of this Oath, doth not
in the least interfere, with that Christian forbearance,
which persons of the same communion, are mutually
to shew, in matters doubtfull and of less moment:
And where you compare this Covenant, for rigor,
<hi>to the bloudy and cruell conjuration of</hi> Trent, thereby
<hi>interminis</hi> renounced, it is too plain, that your turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the adequate extent of a just and necessary op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
designed by this <hi>Covenant,</hi> to that wicked &amp;
impious <hi>Bond,</hi> to be a ground of an invidious likeness,
is only a demonstration of your calumnie and malice.</p>
            <p>Having thus vindicate the Nationall, Covenant, as
it was first taken, I shall only put you in minde, that
the renewing thereof, in the 1638. and making the
people to stand to it, is so consonant to Reason and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59845:123"/>
Scripture-practice, that it needeth not my Patrociny.
But you say, <hi>it was a great trepane to make the Nation
sweare it in the 38. and then by an after-game to declare
that</hi> Episcopacie <hi>was abjured in it.</hi> I might tell you
that your so frequent use of the termes of Art, do not
a little insinuate, how expert a Jugler you are, in the
matter of Oaths: But it is answered, the Nation
swore it in the 1638. in the same termes wherein it
was first taken, in the year 1591; but because that
some doubts, whether the Innovations of <hi>Prelacie,</hi>
and the <hi>Perth Articles,</hi> thereafter introduced, were
by this Oath condemned; Notwithstanding that
its obvious meaning doth abundantly import the
same, both in the particular abjuration, of the
Popes corrupt Doctrine, anent the nature, number,
and use of the holy Sacraments, his unwarrantable
dedication of Dayes, and his worldly Monarchie,
and wicked Hierarchie; and also in the generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
which it contains, of all Rites, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
brought into the Kirk, without, or against
the word of God; And that the generality of the
Godly in the Land did so understand it; yet, such
was the tenderness then used, that the practice was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at first agreed to be forborn, and the determination
of the Question, for the gaining of the doubtfull and
refractory, referred to a lawfull Assembly. Now, if
this Assembly, in the light of the reasons, already
touched, and others mentioned in their Act, did clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determine this matter, and the Covenant was
thereafter taken, with an agreeable Declaration, where
can you fixe your challenge? To alledge, after an Oath
is taken, that to be thereby abjured, which doth
no where appear in it, is certainly, as false, as the
termes you use are scurrilous; but to declare from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
grounds, these things to be contained, in a
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59845:123"/>
prior Oath, which only the temptation, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
of an after-defection did make to be question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
is nothing els then a just vindication and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
requisite to a faithfull pursuance, and whereof
the instance of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> his renewing Covenant with
God, with a more large declaration of the manner of
the Sabbaths observance, then is to be found in the
Law, is an undeniable warrant.</p>
            <p>But reason failing, your passion and big words
must be made use of, to supply that de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect: for you
say, <hi>what violence did we use, to oblige all to bow on this</hi>
Idole? <hi>Church-men refusing were deposed; yea both
they and Lay-men also excommunicat.</hi> 'Tis answered,
A faithfull, and zealous prosecution, of the Lords
Oath, from the Conscience of his holy jealousie, is
only the just and laudable effect of his fear, and no
wayes to make it an Idol: But seing you love such
expressions, to sweare and forsweare, as your partie
hath done, without either constancie or repentance,
is certainly to make an Idol not of the Covenant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but of the Great God thereto invocked, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
will one day avenge it: As for the Censures
you speak of, if the perfidie of that refusall, with the
other transgressions and delinquencies, whereof, the
persons particularly censured, were, for the most
part if not all, notoriously known and found to be
guilty, be duely pondered, they will rather be found
to fall short of, then exceed the proportions of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:
And though I deny not, but the heats,
prejudices, and other temptations, inevitable, in
such changes, to humane infirmity, may possibly
have rendered the lot of some few (and these very
few) recusants (rather obstinate then malitious) a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hard and apparently rigid; yet, this is most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
that the late revolution, hath so infinitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59845:124"/>
not only for iniquity; but also in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of its oppressions, all the excesses chargeable on
former times; that nothing less then an impudence,
sutable to the late perjury, could prompt you, or
any of your partie, to move such an objection: but
let us hear your conclusion: <hi>What man of common
sense can think this the Cause of God, which had such
monstruous errours in its first conception?</hi> Sir,
though I think that in the matters of God, you do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to an ill Judge yet I am so little diffident of the
cause, which I maintain, that only wishing you to
be more sparing, in obtruding your own ridiculous
delusions for monstruous errours, I heartily referre our
discourse, to my greatest Opposite.</p>
            <p>In the next place, making a step of your N C.
weak and groundless concession, <hi>That there were faults
in the imposing of the Covenant,</hi> and taking it up at your
own hand. <hi>That the matters of the Covenant are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
indifferent:</hi> you go on to argue, <hi>that seing in
these things, a man is not his own Master; but by the
command of God obliged to obey the Magistrat, in all
things lawfull, a tye before all Oaths; as by no act of
ours, we can be bound to break the Command of God; so
no more can we oblige our selves to do any thing, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of anothers right, our Soveraign's Authority; and
therefore, since the King and Parliament, have by Law
annulled the Covenant, and required submission to Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie,
our antecedent Oath, a voluntary deed of our
own, can no longer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind us, against the commands of the
Powers, which are the mediat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> commands of God.</hi> I have
set down this argument of yours more fully, to the
effect, you may perceive, that if I have not so much
of your <hi>common sense,</hi> as to comprehend it, as a clear
demonstration; yet it is not for want of a just and
true apprehension; but really from the greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59845:124"/>
of the answeres subjoined: and <hi>first,</hi> I say,
your foundation fails, the matters of the Covenant
are not things indifferent; but in themselves true,
righteous, and holy, importing such an antecedent
obligation, as, in the occurrence of the preexistent
circumstances, did render the taking and requiring of
that Oath, an indispensable dutie: And this when
you think good to quarrell, I am most ready to make
out. 2. Supposing with you, that the matter of the
Covenant is indifferent, and that in such things, the
Magistrates power of commanding cannot, by any
Oath or deed of ours, be prevented or prelimited;
yet, Sir, think you, that your Omission, must so
farre charme us to oblivion, as to make us forget,
that as King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, did in plene Parliament,
An. 1641. under his hand-writing, ratifie the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Covenant, with the explication, and Bond
thereto annexed, and prior Acts made anent it, with
such solemnities and concurrent considerations, as it
is impossible to question it; so, his Son, who now
Reigns, did, in the year 1650. and 51. take and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
both it and the Solemn League and Covenant,
with such Oaths, Subscriptions, (as well private and
unrequired, as publick) Declarations and Acts, that
greater grounds of assurance, were never heard of,
amongst men: if then this was the case of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of these Covenants, at his Majesties returne
(admitting all that you suppose) dare you, or any
say, that the King and Parliament had power, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to resile, or to loose others, from the Bonds,
which they themselves had thus established? If a
Fathers silence, and non-contradiction, to a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
vowing, and whose vowes he may disannull,
do make her vowes to stand; so that he cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
make them void; how can the express, solemn,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59845:125"/>
and sworne confirmation of King and Parliament,
in favours of a Covenanting people, with any colour
of reason, be thought to be either, in it self ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory,
or toward others less effectual? But 3 to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
you, of the vain esteem you have for this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
the very grounds of it, are manifestly falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious:
For, granting that, in things indifferent, we
are by the command of God obliged to obey the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat;
yet this subjection is nothing so absolute, as
is requisite to the inferring of your conclusion: <hi>viz.
that therefore he hath such a right, as no antecedent deed,
or Oath of ours, can stand in the case of a subsequent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling
command:</hi> But, the solid principles whereby
this matter is clearly resolved are 1. That, as the
Magistrat is vested from above with power, requisite
and proportional to the ends of Government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he is appointed; so such is his right by virtue
thereof, that no Subject can either decline his lawful
Commands, or yet bind himself in all events, by any
such antecedent Oath or other deed, as, being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the condition of a Subject, may fall to
interfere with a supervenient rational command: for
example, sitting, standing, walking, are certainly
things indifferent, and in a mans power; if then, in
these things, a man should bind himself, by an Oath,
as never to stirre from such a place, or walk without
certain bounds, though, without question, the man
left to his own liberty be rather to observe his Oath;
yet it is as little to be doubted, that in opposition to,
or for exemption from the Magistrat's lawful and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
command, it could neither be binding, nor rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantly
alledged: I say, Rational Command, because I
am of the opinion, that if the Magistrat, without
any necessity, should for meer o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tentation of his
power, command the person contrary to his Vow,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59845:125"/>
on purpose to make it void; such an injunction would
be both sinful in the Magistrat, and no liberation to
the poor Votarie. The 2 principle, I lay down is,
That, as the Magistrat's lawful power doth indeed
grant him a large right over a mans liberty, in manner
just now explained; so it is most certain, that there
are many things, still left to himself, and at his own
free dispose, wherein he may freely vow, and having
vowed, must not break his word; but do according
to all that proceedeth out of his mouth, and which
are plainly of that nature, that the Magistrat's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand
would be only an accession, and no excuse to
a breach: I need not adduce examples, every passage
of our life, doth obviously exhibite them: if a man
vow the Tenth of his substance to the Lord, it is
evident, that the Magistrat's power cannot discharge
the performance: and the Lord's expresse and well-cautioned
concession of this dissolving power, only
to a Husband over his Wife, and a Father over his
Daughter <hi>in familia,</hi> and that by way of exception,
to the general command, whereby all other free
Vowes and Bonds are ratified, is such a confirmation,
and extension of the Rules, to the case in hand, as
admits no evasion? But to give you entire satisfaction
in this point, the summe is, <hi>first,</hi> That God hath
bestowed upon men a faire liberty, suted to their
dignity: <hi>Next,</hi> He hath also ordained the Powers, and
cloathed them with authority and right, requisite to
the ends of their appointment; whereof the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our just liberties, is not the meenest: as
therefore, by virtue of the former, a man, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance
of the Lord's bountie, so farre as his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
is not restrained, either by a lawfull command,
or by a visible inconsistencie of the thing vowed to
any other dutie, may freely vowe, and ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59845:126"/>
so all the effect of the latter, is only to make
void such vowes, as are directly, or designedly made
to frustrate its right; and to suspend the execution of
others, in so farre as the famine doth eventually cross
its lawful exercise: if you had perpended these things,
you would not have obtruded on us, such a raw dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
for a clear demonstration: the Magistrat hath
right to command, and, it is the will of God that
we obey him, in all things lawful; and this tye is
before all voluntary Oaths: but, doth it therefore
so swallow up our Liberty, that it leaves a man no
power in the same things, to binde himself by a vow,
unto the Lord? or may the Magistrat annul, and make
void the same, at his pleasure? I am certain, your
own <hi>Common sense</hi> tells you, these things are too laxe,
and liable to another regulation. No act of ours can
indeed oblige us to do any thing in prejudice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
right, neither can any Covenant binde to deny
obedience to the Kings just Laws: but as I have already
told you, that the Magistrat hath no such right, as
doth wholly evacuate our liberty, and leave us no
power in things indifferent, of binding our Souls by
an Oath to the Lord: and that the outmost extent
of his power, in these things, is only to make void
the Vow, or restrain the execution, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with his Government, or doth check its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
exercise: So I allow no such Covenant as bindeth
directly to deny lawful obedience; but such a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
such a Vow, such an Oath, yea such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
as being freely taken, without any direct or
designed inconsistencie to the Magistrat's lawful
power, and whereof the performance doth not even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
thwart any of his rational commands, I affirme
to be so binding, that it is neither in the Prince his
power, at his Pleasure, to dissolve it; nor can a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59845:126"/>
supervenient Law enacted, expressly for that purpose,
make void its obligation: And this is the true and
plain account, of the nature and obligation, both of
Vows and Laws, which while you, in your design
to exalt the power of the late Acts, above the Bond
of the Covenant, do so iniquously ballance, as to make
laws, <hi>the mediate commands of God,</hi> and Oaths, only
<hi>our own voluntarie deeds, to which we are not bound, by
any Divine precept,</hi> you grossly forget, that he who
hath commanded Rulers to be obeyed in all things,
committed to their trust, hath, on the other hand,
not only ratified the Subjects their reserved liberty,
but also, by his own sanction, confirmed all the
Vowes, and Oaths, that by virtue thereof, they do
freely make: whereby it is most manifest, that as
the obligation, and binding virtue of Lawes and
Vowes, is coordinate, and not subordinate; so, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
can an arbitrary after-law dissolve our Vowes,
at first freely and lawfully made, then our voluntary
prior Oaths can impaire or prejudge the Magistrat's
righteous Power, and Edicts. As for the application
of these things, to the case in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> whether
the Covenant, being once sworne, in matters at
present supposed to be indifferent, the Magistrat could
thereafter, by an after-act, render the matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
and so make the obligation to cease? It is
very easie to expede: for, seing all the laws which
you plead for its dissolution, and submission to Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie,
are such as do most arbitrarily condemn it,
without the least conviction to any serious person, of
the unlawfulness of our entering into that Oath, either
from its matter, or inconsistencie with Government,
and its righteous ends; it is evident, that to admit
such as sufficient to make it void, were to destroy all
liberty, and render men in every Oath, how free and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59845:127"/>
voluntary soever, obnoxious to the Magistrat's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
control, and plainly to ranverse both the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of making, and necessity of keeping all vowes;
which nevertheless the Lord hath most expressly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and confirmed. Sir, as I have, with you,
supposed the matters of the Covenant to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
indifferent, and taken this pains for no other
end, then to rectifie your <hi>Common sense,</hi> and refell
your pretended <hi>Demonstration,</hi> notwithstanding of so
faire a concession: so, give me leave again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you, and all concerned, that, seing the
matters in these Covenants, were antecedently true
and righteous, and are now concluded under the great
Oath of God, your pitiful quibling, upon the Kings
power in matters free and indifferent, is so far from
licensing us to the least violation, that, though we
do further unanswerably alledge his Majesties super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
ratification; yet it is more for your redargu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then our own confirmation, whose Consciences
are, by the former ground, most satisfyingly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished:
And here I might put a period to my reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
on this <hi>Dialogue;</hi> seing, that what remaines
doth nothing convel these sure grounds, whereupon
we are founded; but because, in pursuance of your
conceit of the Magistrats power, of rendering the
matter of Vowes, antecedently free, unlawful; and
thereby making their obligation to cease, you, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the Question, <hi>What could move the King to
preferre Episcopacie to Presbyterie?</hi> pretend to many
strong inductives, whereby you suppose the change
to be undeniably authorized: This calumny must
also be removed. And before I enter upon this matter,
I cannot but commend your providence, who, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that your allegations would be found false, do
prudently provide a refuge, in the profound and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluse
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59845:127"/>
deepth of Princes <hi>their secrets,</hi> which you think
should <hi>put a stop to the inquirie:</hi> which indeed neither
you, nor all men beside, are able to answere; but as
the strange wickedness and folly of this Act is such,
as all the devices imaginable cannot so much as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it, with any apparent colour, and its conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
have been so pernicious, as have left no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in the Nations unconcerned in their smart; so, I
hope, without the imputation of a <hi>mutinous curiosity,</hi>
I may take the liberty to tell you, that it was not our
Leaders, which occasioned the work, you hint at,
to the King's Grand-father, his Father, and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
<hi>Art thou he that troubleth Israel?</hi> is an old and
royall accusation of the Lord's Ministers: I wish the
answer now a dayes, were as improper, as I am
tender to use it: <hi>we have not troubled Israel, but thou and
thy Fathers house, in that ye have forsaken the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Lord, and thou hast followed thy own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions:</hi>
I need not put you in minde of K. <hi>Iames</hi> his
engagements to defend the Gospel, and maintain the
true and pure Ordinances and Discipline of God's
house, and how he thereafter turned, and corrupted
his way, by no less then a direct invasion of Christ's
Throne, manifest perversion of his Ordinances, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
subjection of the liberty of the Gospel and its
Ministery, to his lust and pleasure, and open perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of many faithful Ministers and Professours;
These things, if you were ingenuous, you should
rather have essayed to answere, as being already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
and proven by others, then provoked me to the
repetition: As to what you objecte, from latter times,
I am sorry that by so rude and false an accusation, <hi>viz.
You involved the Nations in bloud, and not satisfyed with
all the security you could demand; you engaged with the
King his Enemies in</hi> England: <hi>and opposed the design of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59845:128"/>
his deliverie An.</hi> 1648, you should engage me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon a worthy, but abused, Prince, all whose
faults I think both may, and ought to be buried under
his mis-fortune; but seing this you will not suffer, I
shall only desire you and others to consider these sad
grievances, which are elswhere undeniably cleared
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Prelatick Tyranny and impositions of
these times. 2. The rage and fury wherewith they
endeavoured to inflame and stirre up all against this
Kingdome, after that they had first constrained us to
just defence. 3. Their notorious and reiterate persidies,
whereby they rendered all securitie desperate: And
lastly the sin of that backsliding course 48. now so
evidently unmasked, by the 9 Act of the late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
1661 which, instead of delivering, did vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
precipitate his Majestie's sad fate: these things
are so manifest, even from the publick Records of
the Nation, that I can not but admire the effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
of your confidence, that can so overly pass
them.</p>
            <p>But you add a Question, <hi>In a word, what jealousies
had you justly raised in the hearts of Princes, of your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?</hi>
Sir, I wish you had deigned your self with
another word of answere; for really I know none,
except these old and endless ones, the temptation,
and sin of all worldly Powers, against the Lord and
his Anointed. As for our Tyranny 1649. against the
Nobility, you should first have answered for their
breach of trust, 1648: But since they themselves
have publickly, by the Act above mentioned, avowed
it; your charge of <hi>Tyranny</hi> against the moderately
disproportionate censures, then inflicted, merites no
answere.</p>
            <p>In the last place, you say: <hi>our Ministers divided
shamefully among themselves,</hi> I grant, and sinfully also,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59845:128"/>
though that all engaged were not equally guilty, and
this was a great triall; but since, that an excess of
charity toward your party, on the one hand, and a
sounder judgement of your principles or rather loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
on the other, was the only cause of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
is it not invidious in you, not only to have
dissappointed your favourers; but to taxe the
greater number, whom you have since so fully
justified, as men of maximes incompatible with
Government: Sir, this is the summe of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
you make us, of the reasons of his Majesties
change, with what evidence, the Reader and not
you, must judge? If he miss your <hi>Sun</hi> in its <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>
and finde your light to be but darkness, a
more simple eye and heart, may be both his satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and your remedy: If I might enlarge in a more
full returne, I could easily demonstrate, that, all
things being considered, both before, at, and since
the Kings restauration, his adhering to the Covenant,
and owning that interest, had been not only his safety
and peace; but his most certain establishment and
Glory: if the favour and countenance of the most
High, the firme love and loyalty of all good men,
and the undoubtedly equal compliance and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the other parties, may be fit <hi>media,</hi> in such an
argument; the conclusion is obvious: But lest you
say, art thou made of the Kings Councel? Forbear;
leaving events to God I shall be silent.</p>
            <p>Having all along endeavoured to <hi>burne,</hi> in the
close of this <hi>Dialogue,</hi> you go about to <hi>blowe us:</hi> I am
not for triffling with you, in such unsincere and mixed
complements: the Lord purge both you and us from
all dross, and restore to the Land Truth and Purity,
and then shall we certainly enjoy Peace and Unity.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59845:129"/>
As for the liberty you taxe in our discourses, and
writings, I hope no right discerner, will finde it
to be an <hi>invective;</hi> but the native, genuine, and well-becoming
freedom of Truth and Uprightness:
whether the license that you usurp, in your pretended
justifications of the King, the Laws, and your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
be indeed uncharitable, bitter and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
I neither say nor judge; he whose glory is
concerned he also judgeth: But for the allowance of
your defence by <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Pen,</hi> which you would
appear to plead, from our asserting of defensive
armes; you cannot be so serious in the demand,
as I am free to accord it; seing I am perswaded,
that if the defensive armes, which we maintain,
were no better warranted, and as little to be feared,
as the self-defence, which you pretend, neither
you, nor any other, would have accounted them
to be worthy of the opposing.</p>

            <p>SIR, Neither envying you that poor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
which you vainly captate, from
your Mock-Non. C. confessing himself
<hi>to be by you much shaken in the matter of Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops,</hi>

would cast on us by making him, or your self rather,

of his professed conviction, I come to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his quarrel against the Bishops on the account of
your Common-prayer-book, and what you answere.</p>
            <p>Your N. C. alledges <hi>That this Common-prayer-book
is a dead and formal Lyturgie, set up instead of the pure
and Spiritual worship of God:</hi> In answere whereunto,
pretending as vainly, that these are but <hi>big words,</hi> as
I have already clearly proved, that the <hi>Government</hi>
which we contend for, is <hi>the interest,</hi> and doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to <hi>the Kingdom of Christ;</hi> and thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
shewed this your confidence to be meer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
you undertake to discover the fallacy, by
telling us what it is to pray by the Spirit: And you
say, [<hi>To Pray by the Spirit, is, when out of a deep sense of
our misery and need, and firm confidence in God, we
draw near to him, to offer up our prayers and praises to
him, through Iesus Christ:</hi>] And you add, [<hi>That our
hearts being moulded in this frame, we pray by the Spirit,
use we words or not, the same or different; Nay, it will
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59845:130"/>
appear we are carnal, when we need to have our devotion
tickled, and provoked, with new words:</hi>] Which des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription,
and the deduction from it, being laid for
a ground, exciting your self, by the faigned inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of your N. C. surprises, at the wit and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
of your invention, [<hi>in representing the</hi> Liturgie-worship,
<hi>as</hi> Spiritual, <hi>and the</hi> conceived <hi>one, as</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:]
You go one, to discourse [<hi>of the differences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
spiritual devotion, and prayer by words,</hi>] the
termes, wherein you are pleased, very groundlessly,
and impertinently, to state the distinction: [<hi>And
the former</hi> (you say) <hi>lying in the will, and not in the fancy,
and being affected with the thing, and not with words,
can with the newness of affection, make the same prayer
in words, though an hundred times repeated, at every
return New: And, is a still, humbling, and melting thing,
and so equable, that it is above the frisking fits of the
fancy; neither doth it require a variety of words; but, in
its sublimest exercises, can persist long, with great sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in the simplest Acts; whereas, multiplicity doth
perhaps lead out the minde, from pure and still devotion,
interior prayer, and spiritual converse with God: On the
other hand</hi> (you tell us, that) <hi>prayer by words, lying in
the fancy, and its gratifications, by the varying of things
into several shapes, the devotion raised by such Chimes,
is only sensible, needing new phrases, to renew its fervour;
and words, and all the heat begot by words, are but a
false fire, in the natural powers of the Soul, which may
heat the brain, draw forth teares, seem to wring the heart,

to excell:</hi>] from all which you conclude, [<hi>that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
a more spiritual temper, to be able to worship God
in simple, and constant Forms, and that extemporary
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59845:130"/>
prayer, cannot be called praying by the Spirit; except by</hi>
Spirit <hi>be understood the Animal or Natural spirits.</hi> This
I suppose is a true account of your first floorish, upon
this subject, to what purpose, remaines yet to be
inquired.</p>
            <p>And <hi>first,</hi> I might take notice of the inaccuracy
of your expression, of praying <hi>by the Spirit;</hi> whereas
the Scripture-phrase, is, to worship <hi>in Spirit, Iohn.
4. 23. Praying in the Spirit, Eph. 6. 18. to worship in
the Spirit, Phil,</hi> 3. 3. to <hi>pray with the Spirit. 1. Cor.</hi> 14. 15.
And though the difference be more in words then
matter; yet, as the Scripture-diction is certainly the
founder; so, I am apt to apprehend, that your not
adverting to it, may have in part occasioned your vain
and impertinent digression, upon <hi>praying by the Spirit,</hi>
and <hi>praying by Words,</hi> as if these were by us wholly
distinguished, and the latter preferred. 2. I might
observe, that the description which you give us of
Praying by the Spirit, is more suteable to the calme
and serene progress of a Christians course, then to
these doubtings, feares, wrestlings, depressions, and
overwhelmings, so frequently found, in the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of all, to be thereto incident, which being no
less removed from, and destitute of, a firm confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
then the staying and assisting of the Spirit,
with groanes that cannot be uttered, is therein obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable;
your description appeares to be narrow, and
inadequat: But the plain answer, which I returne, is,
that as the stating of the Question, is by you wholly
neglected; so the reasoning, whereby you go about
to maintain your lifeless and superstitious <hi>Liturgie,</hi>
is altogether inconcludent. The controversie betwixt
you and us, anent your Service-book is twofold.
1. Whether the Publick worship of God ought to be
astricted to set and imposed Forms? And 2. Whether
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59845:131"/>
that form of Worship, which your Book contains,
be not in it self in many particulars, unsound and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
and consequently not to be received by way
of directory, farre less acquiesced unto as a precise
injunction? That these are the two hinges of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
will easiely be acknowledged; but what your
above mentioned discourse doth contribute to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
I must again solicite your second
thoughts, to render us an account. We have your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of praying <hi>by the Spirit;</hi> and we let it pass.
Next you subjoin, and that with many empty reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
that <hi>praying in words,</hi> specially <hi>extemporary
and various, is sensible, fancical, affecting and heating
the brain in lower minds, and producing only a natural fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;</hi>
and that thus it may be, with such, who pray
in words without the Spirit, was never by us denied;
but darre you, or any man els, not abandoned to utter
irreligion, propose this as your opinion, of all prayer
in conceived, and not precontrived and prescribed
words? Do not the very truth of Religion, requiring
both heart and mouth; the reasonableness of our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
consisting in their Harmony; the practice of
the Lords people, in all Ages; the frequent examples,
every where in Scripture; the experience of every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Soul; yea the common reason of all men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dargue
the gross absurdity of such a perswasion? Were

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59845:131"/>
Sir, I would rather suppose, that although your airy
discourse, hath wildly seduced your observation; yet
your heart abhorres such impiety: I will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
insist on the advantage, which this your laxe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertencie
so fairely offereth; nor shall I content
my self with this obvious retortion, that where one
instance can be given of conceived Prayer, only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by Fancie, and subsisting in its vain exercise,
thousands may be found of persons, through the
practice and custome of Set-forms, habituate to a most
lifeless and superstitious mummery, more suteable
to the worshiping of stockes and stones, then to the
service of the true and living God: Nor lastly will I
vex you, by shewing, that the distinction which you
make of praying by the Spirit, and by words, is so
impertinently by you applied, to our present purpose;
that though you endeavour thereby, to impugne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporariness,
multiplicity, and variety of words,
in Prayer; yet, it plainly concludes all words to be
superfluous: for, seing that in opposition to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
worship of God, which we contend for, you
tell us, that <hi>we may pray by the Spirit, use we words or
not, and that spiritual devotion is a still inward thing:</hi>
Is it not evident, that all outward Forms, whether
set or extemporarie, are thereby rejected? But freely
waving these your lapses, that I may come more close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the present purpose, it is to be considered, that
the right and true worship of God, is certainly inward
in the minde, will, and affections: God who demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the heart, doth thence expect, that tribute of
reverence, love, fear, acknowledgement, and praise,
which in his sight is acceptable; and all other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
performances, as they ought to be the sincere
expressions, and significations of this internal devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so they are wholly and only regulable, by the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59845:132"/>
prescriptions of Divine appointment. If this truth
were as seriously heeded, (as I am perswaded it is fixed,
and constant,) both by you and me, our controversie
would soon be ended: The Question then, is not,
concerning the life and truth of internal Prayer,
wherein, without doubt, the spirituality of that
exercise doth principally consist; but, seing that you
and we are agreed, that God whom we serve, is to
be worshiped in Spirit and in Truth, the debate is,
anent the manner, how this worship, specially when
Publick, is to be performed? Whether in set and
imposed Forms; or as the Spirit giveth utterance?
Or if, for preventing mistakes, you please to take it
at greater length; whether it be lawful for men, to
compose and impose Set forms for Prayer, and
Worship, and thereto to astrict the People of God,
in their performances? Or, whether it be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the will and service of God, that prayer and
worship, which are to be performed inwardly, in
the liberty and truth of the Spirit and understanding,
in their outward expression, be left to be managed,
by the free and sanctified use of the rational faculty,
for that end given, and in many observably gifted?
By which state, as you may easily perceive that I do
allow, not only the antecedent improvement of the
expressive power, by all warrantable aides and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
but also the free using, upon occasion, of
such words, as others have formerly, either dictated,
or made use of: Nay even in so ne cases of several of
you Set forms; both which I conceive are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with praying by the Spirit, either as by you or
by us defined: So, the precise point controverted,
and to which I would have you all along to advert,
is anent the imposing, and astricting, which I plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judge to be both destitute of Divine warrant, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59845:132"/>
contrary to the liberty of spiritual devotion; and so
repugnant, in both qualities, to that Worship in Spirit
and Truth, which only is acceptable. But before I
proceed to a confirmation, there occurre some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to be removed: one is, of some of your way,
who, defining praying by the Spirit, the uttering of
such petitions, as are immediatly suggested, both
matter and words, by the Holy Ghost, hold it for a
Gift proper to the Apostles, and their times, and
now ceased: thus the <hi>English Debater,</hi> and your own
headless allegeance, that <hi>extemporarie Prayer cannot be
called praying by the Spirit, unless we also call it infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
doth also coincide: But, seing by your descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
above mentioned, you do allow of praying by
the Spirit, as not yet ceased, and do thereby very justly
understand, rather the <hi>Grace,</hi> then the <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer;
although even the Gift, where it is (as it may be)
without the Grace, may also have the name of praying
by the Spirit; and seing that both the <hi>Debater,</hi> and
you, I suppose, would be offended, if any should
affirme, that no man using the Service-book-forms,
could pray by the Spirit, I only add, that as the Spirit
is the great promise of the Gospel, its Grace, the life,
and its Gifts, the strength of all Christian duties; so,
praying by or in the Spirit, can no more be impugned,
for want of infallibility, then any other good work,
of the same Spirit in us denied, for want of perfection:
But who would not pitie two Doctors of the
Church, either so disingenuous, or unable, as not
to distinguish, betwixt the Spirits ordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and extraordinary assistances. The next mistake
is, that reflecting upon the greater exactness of phrase,
attainable in a Set-form, above what can be expected
in an extemporarie work; and commending the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
conci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neness and gravity, that may be in
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59845:133"/>
the former, in respect of that rudeness, incohesion,
and levity, supposed to be incident to the latter, you
exaggerate the comparison, as if the whole stress of
the debate, did ly in this point, whereas he that
duely considereth, will not only finde your Forms,
at best to be but humane and imperfect, and that the
Gift of Prayer promised, if duely improved, in and
with the exercise of the Grace, is, farre more likely,
to furnish sound, savory and acceptable words; then
these jejune and lifeless composures; for framing and
enjoining whereof, men have no promise of the Lords
assistance: And lastly, that the whole word of God,
and the excellent patterns therein recorded, with
many other helps, are at hand, and allowed by us,
by way of Directory; but he must also grant, that it
is not our choice, but the Lords own prescription,
which he doth accept: Suppose your Forms were as
much better, then our conceptions, as a Mans First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
is preferable to the beast of the field; yet, if
not required, they cannot come up with acceptance
on his Altar: and therefore, I conclude, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the sincere Users may finde grace in his sight;
yet the peremptory Imposers, cannot be innocent.
A third mistake, is, that because in the use of certain
Set-forms, a man may possibly pray, with <hi>deep spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
impressions, and high elevations:</hi> Nay the <hi>sublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
acts of communion with God, may be expressed in the
simplest Forms, such as, Thou art my God;</hi> therefore you
conclude, that <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inted Forms, are more suted to true
spiritual devotion, then the multiplicity and variety of
words, in an extemporarie exercise, which do lead out,
and do too frequently only excite a phantastick transient
pleasure, almost evanishing with the sound, wherewith
they are pronounced:</hi> But seing, that the variableness
of the condition of a militant <hi>Viator</hi> can hardly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59845:133"/>
much less the free actings of the Spirit, in such
exigences, confined to any prescribed Forms, and
that the more Seraphick raptures of Divine contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
do therefore subsist in few and plain words,
because above the reach of expression; it is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
certain, that neither the right use-making, or
rather agreeableness of certain forms to very sincere
and serious devotion, nor the simplicitie of words,
used in the nearest admission of heavenly fellowship,
do at all remove the unwarrantableness and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie
of the restraint of Set forms, when under the
necessity of an imposition. As for what is insinuate of
these fancical heats and pleasures, wherewith words,
<hi>ex tempore,</hi> may possibly delude; it is only an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
inconvenience, from our corruption, and by
the faults of your imposed Forms, infinitly overbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced,
as I have already shewed. These things,
being thus cleared: for confirming of my assertion,
against your stinted, and imposed Forms, I say <hi>first,</hi>
That these impositions are peccant against the Truth
of Gods worship; because the samine requires his
own express warrant, and prescript: It is in vain to
worship after the commandements of men; the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which he requireth not, he abhorreth; Will-worship
is an abomination: But such is your imposed
and commanded Liturgie: if now, <hi>what doth the Lord
require?</hi> ought to be the serious reflection of every
one, that draweth near unto him; if, in all things
commanded, we ought to be circumspect, without
adding to, or diminishing ought from it; If the
Lord did most exactly define the manner, and every
rite and ceremony of the legal Sacrifices and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
yea every pin of the Tabernacle, with the whole
contrivance and orders of the succeeding Temple;
if strange fire, made use of even in an offering to God,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59845:134"/>
be so severely vindicat; and the erecting of another
Altar, then he had appointed, even for his Sacrifices,
what can we conclude, concerning your imposed
Forms and the manner of that service, which you
so arbitrarily enjoin? That they are of farre greater
moment in his Worship, then many of these things,
about which we see, his holy jealousie to be so atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
conversant, commonsense doth evince: how
then can they be receaved without his warrant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, all humane devisings are rejected? Say
not, that the rigor of this strictnes was a part of the
old legall bondage: for granting that it may be so,
as to the particular manner of that dispensation; yet
you are so farre from being thereby helped, that,
as I have formerly shewed that the burthen of the
things, by you imposed, stands manifestly convicted
by our Gospel-liberty; so, the immoveable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that, in his Worship, his own prescription is
the alone warrant of acceptable performance, doth
equally redargue the presumption of your imposing,
in whatsomever model, without his Command. But
it may be objected, that, seing our extemporarie Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
are as well a part of Divine Worship, as your
stinted Forms, and that as to the frame of the words,
the former can no more, yea rather less, then the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
pretend to a congruity to the word and will of
God, the argument from the unlawfulness of Will-Worship,
doth militat more against us, then you:
'Tis answered, If the question in this matter were only
whether Set-forms, or extemporarie straines, may
possibly be composed with the greater consonancie,
in words, unto Scripture-phrase, the objection might
have some, (though in respect of what I have already
touched of the promised gift of Prayer very little),
weight; but seing our debate runs clearly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59845:134"/>
the manner, how the true and Spiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God is to be externally performed; If the
Lord, whole alone it is to prescribe in this matter,
hath in a just congruity to the liberty of his own Spirit,
left it to the night and sanctified use of the rational ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
facultie, and the due improvement of these
helps and promises, wherewith he hath instructed us;
for man vainly to arrogat a better contrivance, in his
devised impositions, is an intolerable presumption:
and therefore, though the conceived, as well as the
stinted Prayer, be a part of Gods Worship: Nay,
though this, as well as the other, singly and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used, may be accepted; yet seing the Lord hath
allowed the liberty of the former, and doth not at
all require the obligation of the latter, the imposing
thereof must, of necessity, be repute and cast, as an
humane invention. I need not stay to resume, that
conceived Prayer, for the reasons above mentioned,
and in respect of the promised gift, and assistance of
the Spirit, whereof the composing and commanding
of Set-forms is destitute, may probablie be, and is
often found to be, the better phrased: Nor shal I tell
you, that the manner thereof is so undoubtedly the
more rational, genuine, and lively, that if even
those of your way could be perswaded, that men
were sufficiently thereto qualified, they would easily
grant the imposing and use of Forms, to be less ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
it is enough for us, that the Lord, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the best of our performances, in whatsomever
sort, to be but lame and imperfect, hath both allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and accepted of our extemporarie petitions,
whereas your injoined Forms are no where required.
2. I say, that the imposing of Forms impingeth u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Spirituality of Prayer and Worship; That
which boundeth and restraineth the free Spirit of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59845:135"/>
Lord, in the motions and breathings whereof, the
very life of prayer doth consist, impingeth upon the
Spirituality of Prayer and Worship: But so it is, that
the imposing of Forms restraineth and bindeth up,
&amp;c. Therefore, &amp;c. That the Spirit of the Lord,
whereby his people, especially in prayer, are guided
and acted, is free, not only in its gift, but also in its
operations, both Scripture and experience do teach;
<hi>The winde bloweth where it listeth, &amp;c. and so is every on
that is born of the Spirit: where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is liberty:</hi> not only from the bondage of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but in the wayes and paths of the Lord; and
more especially, in the large and all-searching disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
of the minde, yea of the deep things of God:
and what strange exercises have been, and may be,
in the experiences of the Saints, the result of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and of the variety of our unstable condition,
<hi>Iacob's</hi> wrestlings, <hi>Davids</hi> heart commu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ings, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit-searchings,
overwhelmings, and again exultings,
<hi>Ierimiah's</hi> mournings, and <hi>Daniel's</hi> supplications, do
exhibite a few examples. Now that the imposing of
Forms, which are set, certain, and determined,
doth stint this liberty, and cannot possibly quadrat to
all the variety above mentioned, needeth no other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
then that of an ingenuous reflection. I
have already acknowledged that in the right using of
several of your Forms, a man may have his heart
very deeply affected; and now I further suppose for
argument, that such may be the aptitude of a full and
sound composition, as may possibly suppeditat peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and expressions, convenient to every exigence;
but yet, that the Spirits free use-making, and mens
stinting thereof to these Forms, do vastly differ,
cannot be denyed; since that, notwithstanding of
all conceded, the enjoining of these impositions is
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59845:135"/>
not only inconsistent with the free methods, but also
doth confine the illimited enlargements of the Spirit,
as cannot but be obvious to any exercised discerner:
But that which, I suppose, doth induce you and
many others into an error, in this particular, is a
preposterous observation of certain good motions,
and sincere and servent devotions, which possibly
some may feel, in the use of your Common-prayer-book,
whence you inadvertently conclude, that the
same Forms, not appearing obnoxious to the escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
incident to extemporarie expressions, may,
more safely and sufficiently, serve to the exciting and
signifying the like spirituall motions and devotions,
in all; whereas it is certain, that as in the former
case, these motions were only the free breathings and
stirrings of the Spirit, and in a manner accidental to
these Forms, wherein they come to be uttered; so
to ty the same free influences to the manuduction of a
set of words, is more absurd, then the same words
are often found to be incompetent to the setting forth
of the singularity that may be in the case of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant,
whether a whole Church or single Person.
Really, Sir, when I consider, that the Lord craves
the heart, and that men Worship him in Spirit, and
that it is thence, and out of its abundance, that the
mouth ought to speak; and from a beleeving heart,
that the tongues confession is acceptable, I cannot but
wonder, how this inversion of preceeding and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Forms should be so much asserted: and certainly
if we may, after the Lord's example, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 8.
reason, in these things, from self reflection, may not
the knowledge we have of our own way, in such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
to or from our Neighbours, wherein the
heart, and not the justice and merit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the sute,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59845:136"/>
comes to be regarded, teach us, to reprobate, and
nauseate such impositions? If in hearty requests, we
ourselves can neither be confined, in the making, to
a rat of words put in our mouth, nor relish the like
practice from others, and do censure such methods,
as too cold and indifferent; how much more should
we stand in awe, to obtrude them to the Father of
Spirits, the searcher and lover of the heart? I might
arise higher, upon this subject, and demonstrate to
you, from the order of nature, which certainly the
Lord hath principally ordained for his own Worship,
Service and Glory, that the heart, and minde, and
not the eyes, common sense, or memory (unless
in so farre as is requisite, to the joining of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
in Publick prayer) ought to preceed, in all; and
without question did preceed, in the first acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
rendered to him by his creatures; but I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
love nor need to admixe such reasonings to these
Scripture-grounds already adduced: I shall therefore
summe up this argument, with answering two objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>viz.</hi> That I seem 1. to forget, that our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in publick prayer, do, as much, preceed and
lead the peoples devotions and affections, by their
conceived words, as if they were set and predevis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
2. To suppose, that all who can or ought to
pray in heart, are also qualified to a suteable utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
And to the <hi>first</hi> it is answered. 1. That it is
evident, that the People may, and ought to joine in
publick prayers, uttered by one as their mouth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the samine be by him conceived, and to them
unknown, until expressed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this is clear from the
practices of God's People, in these publick prayers of
<hi>David, Solomon, Iehosophat,</hi> and others already
mentioned: and you your self lay it for the ground of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59845:136"/>
an argument, <hi>viz</hi> that the people can joyne, and
pray by the Spirit, though the words be not of their
framing. 2, That although our Ministers do preceed
in words; yet seing the people are gathered in the
Lords Name, and he, with the power of his Spirit,
in the midst of them; and the Minister is called and
appointed to oversee them, know their condition and
necessities, and to be their mouth toward God; and
lastly, seing there is a promise of the Spirits publick,
aswell as private assistance, whereupon we may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
confide, both for a due instruction, sense,
and utterance in the Minister, of the Peoples state,
and exigence, and a sweet uniting of their hearts, in
an harmonious concurrence, the agreeablenesse and
advantages of conceived, and not imposed prayer,
are thereby abundantly conserved: and the difference
betwixt the Ministers preceeding, in free and Spirit-directed
words, from the manuduction of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricting
forms, manifestly held forth. Offend
not that I say Spirit-directed words; for if I should
descrive Prayer in the utterance, to be the expressing
of these desires, which through the Spirit we make
unto God, in the name of Jesus Christ, for things
agreeable to his will, in words directed by the same
Spirit; and thence draw an argument, for reprobat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your vain devising, and rigid commanding of
Forms, which practice the Lord hath neither order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nor blessed, I should but define the dutie, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Precept and Promise, which is no more
impugned, by the mixture of your infirmities, then
the account given by you, either of internal praying
by the Spirit, or external, by a Set-form, which,
as from us, do alwayes labour of imperfection, are
thereby made void. As for the <hi>second</hi> objection, that
I seem to suppose, that all that can, or ought to pray
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59845:137"/>
in heart, are also qualified, to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eable utterance;
I answere 1. That my present discourse, of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Prayer, doth no more suppose, all to be thereto
qualified, then your discourse of internal Prayer by
the Spirit, doth warrant the like construction: how
men do pray, and how they ought to pray, are easie
to be distinguished. 2. The Spirit of supplication, is
no doubt promised, not only for inward motions,
but also for outward suteable expressions; and the
teaching of God is sufficient, and may be forthcoming
for the one, as well as for the other: Nay as we
know, the expressive facultie, where the organes
are not impedite, to be alwayes more or less subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
enough to the mindes conceptions; so, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that the Gift, and Grace of Prayer, be
certainly distinct, yea in such sort separable, that the
gift may be, where the grace is wanting; yet seing
the Gift is promised, and given, for the help of the
Grace, at lest in general; (for, that in particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
the gift may be found without the grace, for
helping of the grace in others, is not refused) it is
scarce to be supposed, nor can it be easily instanced,
where one in whom the Grace was found, was totally
destitute of all measure of the Gift; I say, of all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
for that many have had the Grace, without
that eminencie of the measure, that men do ordinarily
terme the Gift, cannot be denied; but the thing to
be principally here adverted to, is, that we judge not
of the competencie of this Gift, according to mens
too frequent estimation. That the mixtures of that
wofull vanity, from which, of all vices, our minds
are most hardly purged, occasioned by a just aversion
of Forms, ill framed and worse imposed, have too
far altered the ordinary Rule, from sincere and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
simplicitie, is too true a regret; certainly,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59845:137"/>
if men were more denied unto their own wisdome,
and more surrendered to the conduct of the Holy
Ghost, even for the words which he teacheth, both
the ungodly scorn of many, mocking at apparent
weaknesses, and the pretended modesty, but reall
vanity, of others, their self-diffidence; and lastly our
true and undeniable insufficiencies, for a suteable
utterance in Prayer, would soon, and happily be
corrected: But 3. admitting that most men were more
unqualified, and worse furnished, then really they
are, for conceived prayer, pray, Sir, what doth
your imposing of Forms help the matter? That the
representing of Forms, and other Rules by way of
directorie, may conduce for instruction, will easily
be agreed unto; but that the imposition wherein the
evill of your way lyeth, addeth nothing by way of
help; but on the contraire, is a presumptuous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriving
in Gods Worship, a manifest restraining of
the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, and plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious,
both to the exercise and improvement of the
Gift of Prayer, is not less obvious, to every ones ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
then by the arguments adduced evidently
evinced.</p>
            <p>Having thus discussed the first part of our present
debate, anent the imposing of Forms in general:
The second part, whether that Systeme of Forms,
contained in your Service-book, be not (for not a
few of them) unfound, and impertinent, and not to
be received, so much as for a Directory, remains
yet to be handled? But since it is a little after, that
you are pleased only to give a touch on this head, and
that the samine on our part, hath been fully spoke to,
by such, who by their examinations and anatomies,
have abundantly discovered, both the Errors and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
which your Liturgie contains; I proceed
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59845:138"/>
to answere, what remains of your reasoning.</p>
            <p>And 1. You lay it down as a ground, <hi>that, in opposition
to your Forms, we hold spiritual devotion to be only the using
and pouring out of unprescrived words, as if that were all
required:</hi> Which is altogether false, and ridiculous;
seing it is evident, that as no prayer is acceptable,
unless made in the Spirit; so we therefore call our way
spiritual, yours formal, in respect, that ours is sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the liberty, and made dependent on the Spirits
direction, whereas your impositions, do both restrain
the Spirit, and are plainly a humane invention.</p>
            <p>2. You say, That <hi>it expresseth a more spiritual temper, to
be able to Worship God in simple and constant Forms:</hi>
But 1. That this doth indeed import more spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then the imaginative straines of these, who only
flow, and are fervide in words, and are not <hi>fervent in
Spirit, serving the Lord;</hi> which is the very summe of
your discourse, is no more certain, then imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
by you insisted on. 2. That the elevations of
Spirit may, sometime, surmount the faculty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
as I have already touched, is as little to your
purpose. 3. That it expresseth a more spiritual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
to be able to Worship in a set-form, then, in
the same inward frame, to be able in free and Spirit-directed
words, in a more full and lively manner,
then any stinted Forms can pretend, to expresse our
prayers, and our praises unto God; I utterly deny:
And am very confident, that when you attain to the
experience, you will be farre from thinking, that
this is a multiplicity, which doth lead out.</p>
            <p>3. You say, that <hi>if extemporarie prayer be by the Spirit, it
must be infallible:</hi> But poor man, do you not consider
1. That the Spirits direction, and out imperfection
are not incompatible. 2. That this doth as much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litat
against spiritual prayer, in, and by your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59845:138"/>
Forms, which you so much magnify; and yet
they are neither perfect, nor infallible. 3. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told you, that the Spirits extraordinary infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
assistance, and ordinary presence and direction,
are most distinguishable. 4. You your self plead,
that as we affirme, that the people may join with the
Minister, and Pray by the Spirit, though the words
be not of their framing; so the Minister may also
pray in the Spirit, though he use words framed by
others, and yet you know, that neither the one nor
the other are infallible. 4. You say, <hi>If one should
with a short-hand follow his prayer, whom we say prayes
by the Spirit; then, may not that prayer be used over
again? Or, is the Spirit in the prayer so volatile, that it
evaporats in the saving?</hi> Really, might I be free with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence, I would tell you my fears, that both
your Reason, and Religionare evaporat: art thou a
Master of <hi>Israel</hi> and askest such questions? do either
we affirm, that praying by the Spirit, doth consist
principally in the conceiving of words, so, as another
using, but not conceiving the same words, cannot
pray by the Spirit? Or, do you imagine that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in Prayer, is in the dress and form of words, so
that whoever doth use them, doth pray by the Spirit?
And seing that both members are groundless, what
can your question import? What it is to pray by the
Spirit, we have already heard, which, as it doth not
impede, why a man may not possibly join, and pray
in the Spirit, though in the words of your Forms,
when uttered by the coldest Form alist; so, neither is
it by us tyed to the conceiving and expressing of
words; nor doth a mans praying by the Spirit, yet
in words, either composed, or uttered by another,
in the least impugne that spiritual liberty in orall
Prayer, by us asserted, against your unwarrantable
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59845:139"/>
impositions; which liberty, consisting in the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
use of words, left to the Spirits direction, as
it is most agreeable to the freedom of the Spirit, and
our rational service, which the Lord, who requireth
it, hath not astricted unto Forms; so, in respect of
your carnal, restringent, and unwarrantable imposings,
is therefore, and most justly, termed spiritual. But
it were only a wearinesse to trace all your Mistakes,
and inconsistencies in this question; he who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that the spiritual manner of prayer by us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
is neither, on the one hand, a praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in <hi>new words,</hi> nor, on the other, such as can
be lawfully tyed up, to humane stinted forms; but
is to be performed, whether by a man for himself, or
with and for others, in words freely directed by the
same Spirit, from which the inward desires and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ought to proceed, will easily tell you, that the
case of a Ministers following this Rule, and being
astricted to words, framed by another, hold no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,
and with the same facility, unravel all your
other quiblings, and pitie your impertinencies: and
therefore I go forward. Your N. C. asks, <hi>but doth
not the Spirit help our infirmities and teach us to pray?</hi>
And you tell him, that, <hi>the words aright considered,
speak out a far different thing from what he would draw
from them, and that the Spirit doth indeed teach us the
matter of our Prayers, and also the manner,</hi> to wit, <hi>the
temper of our hearts; but, that words are not meant, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from what follows, and maketh interc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssion for us
with groans that cannot be uttered.</hi> But, Sir, if the
Apostle commend the Spirits assistance to us, in
prayer, in intending our desires, above the earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that words can express; doth it therefore follow,
that, in the directing of our utterance, which is a
lesser matter, his help is not to be expected?
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59845:139"/>
2. Though in this place, the Spirits help for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of our words were not meant; can you deny,
that, that gift, is not fully elsewhere promised?
have you forgot the <hi>anointing that teacheth us of all
things? The Spirit that giveth utterance?</hi> And <hi>the
Father of lights from whom cometh every good Gift?</hi> And
who <hi>enricheth us by Iesus Christ in all utterance and in
all knowledge?</hi> Or, need I to remember you of the
promises, that the <hi>heart of the rash shall understand
knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerer shall be ready
to speak plainly,</hi> or elegantly: and again <hi>the tongue of
the dumb shall sing:</hi> Really, Sir, if a man diffident
of the readinesse of his expression, cannot from these
open fountains draw supply, I am confident that the
brocken Cisterns of your imposed Forms, will make
him but small reliefe. After this, relapsing into your
former prejudice, and causing your N. C. to say,
<hi>That in this imbodied state, we need to have our Souls
stirred up by the commotion of our Fancies,</hi> you accept of
the acknowledgement, and thence inferre, <hi>That at
least, such a way of praying, is not so sublime, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought not to be called praying by the Spirit:</hi> But, Sir,
as I have already told you, that he, who being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
moved by the Spirit of Grace, neither needeth
a Set-form, to obstetricat his expression, nor therein
confineth himself to it; but out of the abundance of
his heart, and, in words directed by the Holy Ghost,
doth flow forth in his Prayers and Praises; is indeed
of a higher size, then he who having the same devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
toward God, is therein either stinted by anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or straitened in himself, to a limiting and restrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Form; so, your talking in this place of <hi>the stirrings
of the Soul, by the commotion of Fancie,</hi> and the <hi>grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of Nature and imagination,</hi> is, but the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of your own vanity, in as much, as it neither
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59845:140"/>
pertaineth to the present Question, whereof the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
or unlawfulnesse of mens imposing Set-forms
of Worship, and not the life or spirituality thereof
(wherein I hope we are agreed) is the subject; neither
do we either teach or defend, but plainly reject, these
carnal methods, here by you supposed to excite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
by fancie, and kindle our affections by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
where the inspiration of the Spirit ought
to warm the heart, and blowe the flame, as being
the offering of strange fire unto the Lord, in place of
the heavenly fire, that descends from himself, upon
his Altar: It is true, the heart, and desires thereof,
being once set on work, by this divine principle,
may, and ought to enlarge it self, by the summoning
and exciting of its affections, and whole minde and
strength, for the intending of its fervor, and elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Soul; but this truth, doth so little favoure
your impositions, in preference to our way, that by
a new argument, it further, and evidently confirmes,
the narrownesse and insufficiencie of your stinted
Forms, to that spiritual Soul-devotion, wherein the
Lord delights.</p>
            <p>But you say, That, <hi>you will convince us of the evill
of extemporarie Forms;</hi> and 1. you say, That, I <hi>must
long exercise my attention, to consider what he who prayes
intends, and this strangely draweth out the minde from
devotion, which cannot vigorously act two powers at once;
and therefore you conclude, that both in reason and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
Set-forms do conduct a mans devotion, with less
anxiety, wavering or distraction:</hi> To this it is answered
1. That seing the Churches of Christ are united, not
only in the same form of profession, but in the same
Spirit, and have the promise of the presence of the
Lord and his power, in all their Assemblies gathered
in his Name, whereby both Minister and People,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59845:140"/>
may expect all due assistance in their performances;
your supposed unacquaintedness in the People, with
what the Minister intends, with the long attention,
and strange out-drawing of the minde, which you
thence inferre, are but your own groundless and
faithless imaginations: 2. That a certain measure of
previous attention in joining, either with conceived,
or imposed Forms, is necessary to instruct our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is neither by you, nor us to be denied; but
how you can thence conclude, that attention, as
such, which in this case, both in your and our way
is absolutely necessary, directly preparatory, and
leading into, should lead out from the devotion to
ensue; and by what Logick you make the attention,
or inclination of the minde, and the devotion thence
arising, almost as connected, as the inclining of the
ear, and hearkening are, two powers, (and not two
acts) and these also incompatible, surpasseth common
understanding: It is true, if I could suppose with
you, that the People, nay the Minister himself, going
about to pray, were wholly ignorant, how he will
discharge it, and that therefore, they, either join
blindly, or with anxiety; nay further that our way
labours under <hi>many abuses of tedious length, scurrilous
expressions, involved periods, petulant and wanton af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectations,
and the like;</hi> I might possibly finde some
shadow of reason for your alledgeance: but since, you
not only speak as a stranger to the Grace and Gift of
Prayer, and to the unity of the Church of Christ,
which is one Body, baptised and united into one Spirit,
having one Hope, one Faith, one Lord, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
one God and Father of all, who is above all,
and through all, and in us all; whereby Christians
before Forms were imposed, are found both to have
been, and to have continued with one accord in
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59845:141"/>
Prayer, and Supplication, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to have lift
up their voice, and that one voice, in the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporarie
words to God, in Prayer and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving;
but do also subtilly and profanely take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
from escapes incident to humane frailtie,
to proclame the same as gross abuses, and thereupon
scoff and mock at the heartie and spiritual Prayers of
the Upright, wherein the Lord delighteth: I hope
your own vanity and folly shall reprove you: But 3. as
attention is requisite, even in the publick use of your
Forms, and in our way is attended with such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
that do both render it sweet and easie, and
fully secure the conduct of our devotion; so, by your
course, it not only happens, that oftentimes the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is sore put to it, and perplexed, as you objecte
to us; but the very Rule of devotion is made alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
insecure and uncertain: for proof of this, there
needeth no other Argument, then that you observe
these Forms, lately added to the English service,
that these were as uncouth to the People, at the first
hearing, and required as great attention, as our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporarie
conceptions; is clear and obvious: But
seing beside this, the People are put to join in words,
they know not by whom framed, and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
and commanding whereof, their appeareth
neither precept, nor promise in Scripture; that their
attention in this case, must be more exercised, and
their devotion in more hazard to be distracted, then
when they join with him, whom they judge to be
appointed by the Lord, to be their mouth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and on good grounds suppose, to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> instructed,
both with the knowledge of their condition, and the
Rule and Spirit, whereby he ought to make the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
known, in supplications, unto God, is beyond
contradiction: neither is this the only inconvenience,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59845:141"/>
of this sort, in your manner, there is a Court-prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that I could tell you of; how the King <hi>pro re
nata,</hi> useth to issue out a Form of Prayer, either for
his own Chappel, the Citie-Churches, or further
as he pleaseth to extend his orders; and if these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
prescriptions, be not more chargeable to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and disturbing to the devotion, then any
thing in our way; nay, if it be not a Method, as
dangerous in its tendencie, as destitute of warrant,
let men judge: But this is the Supremacie, too high
for you to have remembred: 4. If there were a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
exercise of attention in our way then in yours; yet
when I consider, that attention, if not surcharged,
or confounded, doth certainly tend to the quickening
of the devotion, and that on the other hand, by the
coldness of your stinted Forms, both the attention,
is, for the most part wholly slackened, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
deadened; the instance you make of a few se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
it may be, but weak and peevish persons of
your partie, professing a great stayedness in the use of
Set-forms; whereas in extemporarie Prayer, they
could not keep their minde from distraction, doth
neither impugne these more lively and powerful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
whereunto the Lord, and not man, hath
ordered our Method<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nor, in the least, doth it
counterballance these myriads of dead Formalists,
whom your way doth burie in utter securitie, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion:
In this place you tell us by way of wittie
discovery, that <hi>the way of extemporarie Prayer, was
well devised for spreading of Error, or Sedition, in respect,</hi>
forsooth, <hi>that Ministers prayed over their Sermons; so
that what in the discourse seemed the words of man, in the
Prayer was called the dictat of the Spirit:</hi> But, Sir,
darre you or any man deny, that extemporarie Prayer,
was the first manner of mens calling upon the Name
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59845:142"/>
of the Lord? Are you not then ashamed, to talk of
it, as a late device? 2. How come you to suppose,
that words in Prayer, spoken by us to God, may
rather seem the dictat of the Spirit, and more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
seduce, nor the same words delivered in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
in the Name, and as the word of God? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
admitting you had forgot, that you did already
upon this very pretext, endeavour to devest Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Authority; yet common sense might
have told you, that in this there could be no deep ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice:
But 3. Wherefore may not a partie given to
sedition, or error, devise and compose Forms to the
same purpose, and with more success? If Forms be
but of humane invention, and if, as you suppose,
they be more weightie and impressing, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporarie
words, it is obviously evident, that they
furnish a far more advantageous opportunity to this
your <hi>excellent devise:</hi> I might confirme this, by telling
you, how much this Method hath been made use of,
and prospered, for the propagating, and establishing
of many errors and superstitions in the Romish
Church; but a nearer and latter instance of that
piece of Herauldrie, blazoning the Kings Titles, and
Prerogative, very irreverently and undecently, to
God, foisted in by Act of Councel, in your Church-prayers,
for inculcating and advancing the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Supremacie, may satisfy the world, that your
evill and vain conjecture against us, was suggested by
your own practice.</p>
            <p>After the false and calumnious charge of gross abus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
incident to our extemporarie Forms, given in
by you, with much pretended tenderness and insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as I have already touched; you N. C. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres,
that <hi>we had a Directory of the things we should
pray for;</hi> Which, no doubt, if you had been pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59845:142"/>
to propound it, in its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull latitude, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
whole word of God, many other instructions and
forms thence drawn and delivered, and left to us
by godly men, with our own publick Directory, and
these of other Churches, and lastly, that the teaching
of our Parents, Masters, and Pastors, are all given
to us, to guide us, and assist us, both for matter and
words, in the prayers we ought to make: And if
you had understood it aright, <hi>viz.</hi> that seing the rule in
our way, is, as certain, though not so stinted, as
that in yours, and that our Ministers appointed to be
the peoples mouth, in publick Prayer and Worship,
are not only tried, in their utterance for preaching,
but also for prayer; And lastly that any material aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
is as discoverable and censurable among us, as
among you, you might have been fully satisfied, that
neither the infirmities nor abuses of men, are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
upon our manner of Worship; nor doth your
peremptorie imposing of Set-forms, more secure the
matter, from the like, and greater enormities. But
being resolved to carp, you say, <hi>why may not we have
a Directory forwords, as well as things?</hi> 'Tis answered.
1. A Directory for things to be prayed for, is no
doubt a Directory for words also, if the things be
fully directed, the application of words, the known
signes, can have litle difficulty: 2. The directory,
distinctly and particularly ordering the method, and
condescending upon the heads of prayer, with as
much exactness, as the latitude to be reserved to the
free grace and gift of God, will admit; cannot but be
received for a Directory, both of words and things.</p>
            <p>But you add, <hi>That it was but a cheat, to cozen the
World who might have startled, to have seen us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any rule for Worship, in as much as our Leaders
quickly wearied of it.</hi> It is answered, <hi>first,</hi> So long as
any Church doth own the revealed will and word of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59845:143"/>
God, for the rule of Worship, none, but such phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick
Formalists as you will prove startlers at this sure
and acceptable simplicity: 2. Whence you alledge
our Ministers their wearying of the Directory, as
such, except from the suggestion of your own malice,
I cannot conceive: that our Leaders neither turned it,
nor astricted themselves to it as, to an imposed Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
is very certain; but that they did not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it, is a groundless calumnie.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you add, that, <hi>Hence it clearly
followed, that the Preaching was the great matter of the
Worship; but the constant acts, wherein the Church
should adore God, were thought too homely:</hi> How you
will make out this connexion, seing, both the ground
is false, and the consequence doth not hold, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to your second thoughts; though our
Prayers and Psalms related to our Preaching, yet it
will not conclude, that therefore the Preaching, was
the great matter of the Worship; Your Service-book
makes many, both Prayers, Gospells, Epistles,
and Collects, relative to certain festivall dayes, is
therefore the observation of these dayes, the great
point of Worship? The great matter of Worship is
the rendering of our acknowledgement unto God,
which, if performed by prayer, hearing of His
word, and praises, and that in such a harmony, as
all the exercises may conspire, and be mutually help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
is thereby greatly advanced, and not in the least
marred. As for these <hi>Constant acts,</hi> which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderat
in our Service; if thereby you mean your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Set-forms,</hi> you are already answered; but if
only the dayly solemn performances of Prayer and
Praise, which in liew of the morning, and evening
Sacrifice, ought, as the stated and fixed recognizance
of the great God, be observed and kept up, in every
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59845:143"/>
Christian Society, when other things shall be restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I frankly promise you my assent.</p>
            <p>In the last place, you say: <hi>It is the least evill of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporarie
Forms, that a Minister is ready to pour out
his Soul to God, in such devotions as are then most in his
own Spirit, Which may possibly happen to be very unfit
for Publick Worship,</hi> Sir, this is so groundless a fear,
and so plain a diffidence of the assistance and presence
of the Lord, that I shall not trouble you with any
further answere, then to add, that as a thoughtfull
serious Spirit, is ever found to be most prepared for
dutie, and divine influences; so, all experiences do
conclude, that a Ministers particular exercises, have
been so farre from marring, that, on the contraire,
they have alwayes rendered his publick performances,
more spiritual and lively.</p>
            <p>And thus at length your dull N. C. comes to see
that you are for <hi>Set-forms,</hi> and demanding your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
tels you, that <hi>the Apostles used them not,</hi> to which
you answere, that <hi>you cannot doubt, but they used our
Saviour's Prayer,</hi> and really, though I do as little
doubt, but they might have done it; yet I think,
both you and I, must acknowledge, that we finde
no vestige of their doing of it. For as for your distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing,
betwixt <hi>Mathew's after this manner therefore
pray ye;</hi> and <hi>Luke's when ye pray, say,</hi> the pattern to
be proposed in the first, and the practice intended in
the second: seing the form is formally the same,
in both places, and the patterm so proposed by
<hi>Mathew,</hi> that the practice might be its most exact
imitation, and the practice so enjoined by <hi>Luke,</hi> that
yet the latitude of a Pattern, is not discharged, your
notion is but airie, and of no moment. But if it were
needful, to give you my thoughts in this matter, I
would say, that considering. 1. That this pattern was
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59845:144"/>
given to the Disciples, in the infancie of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
before the out-pouring of the Spirit, as a short
and easie rudiment. 2. That thereafter the Spirit is
promised, and that in such an abundant measure, as
it should flow like rivers of living water. 3. That our
Lord in his last discourse, commands them frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pray to and ask the Father, in his Name, and 4
that the Spirit being given <hi>de facto,</hi> they were enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto all utterance, and both in their own Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and in their Directions to others, how to pray,
do constantly make mention of the name of <hi>Iesus,</hi>
these things I say considered, I am verily in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
they did not precisely use, either this form
of Prayer, or any other; but leaving this digression;
and esteeming this Form to be the most excellent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,
and the very Substance of all prayer, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Apostles might have used it; yea supposing
with you, they did use it; yet what makes all this
for your imposing and enjoining of Forms, the
only point of our present difference?</p>
            <p>But you go on and say, <hi>the Iews at that time had a
Liturgie, and hours of Prayer, which our Saviour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reproves: ergo quid.</hi> I have told you already, that
to inferre an approbation, from our Lords tolerance
for a time, of either the whole, or any of the parts
of that service, which he was in a short space to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
totally, is bad Logick. 2. Admit this tolerance
were an approbation, how will you make it out,
that the <hi>Iews</hi> their Lyturgie, was more then a Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
and that they were thereby astricted, to an
imposed Set-form? Specially seing we finde, that
where, in their best times, certain Forms of Prayer
and Thanksgiving, dictated by the Spirit, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by <hi>David,</hi> and other men of God, to the
Ministers for publick use; yet the thing was both
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59845:144"/>
done, and observed, without the mention of any
precise astriction, or limitation.</p>
            <p>In the next place you tell us, that <hi>the Lords Prayer
is word for word taken out of the Iewish Lyturgie:</hi> and
thence you think, <hi>that exception against the English
Service, that some of its Prayers are out of the</hi> Roman
<hi>Missal and</hi> (not, or) <hi>Breviarie, to be foolish and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:</hi>
But pray, Sir, why talk you so confidently of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Liturgie of these times, (for other poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Liturgies availl not) since to this day, though
much search hath been made, and many forgeries
have been obtruded, no such thing could assuredly
be found: <hi>Next,</hi> if such a thing sound and pure was
in our Lord's dayes, think you it was then no better
Pattern, nor the <hi>Roman</hi> Missal, Ritual, and Brevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
were, in the very profoundest darkeness, of that
Superstition, immediatly before the Reformation
broke up; and when the first glimmerings of
that light, managed as much by Police as Piety,
did translate from it, the <hi>English</hi> Liturgie? The
disparity of these things is too palpable. 3. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Liturgies, used in the dayes
of our Lord, were yet truely extant, it will
not be sufficient for you, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hew the words and
sentences of the Lord's Prayer, to be therein disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
found, for so no doubt a good Christian prayer,
might almost be said, to be taken out of the Alcoran;
but even for evincing, that our Lord did respect them,
so much, as Directories, you must make out the
whole context of his Prayer, to be formally found
therein: But you add, that, <hi>Though the Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>les and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
immediatly inspired, might pour out extemporarie
Prayers, it doth not follow, that every one may use the
same liberty:</hi> Who would not pitie this folly? If infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie
be required in our extemporarie methods,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59845:145"/>
wherefore not also in your Set-forms? But seing the
Apostles, were only the better assisted, and not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
privileged, to pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> by their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Gifts; and if the same command of God,
and promise of the Spirits assistance, are still with us,
for our warrant, and encouragement to this dutie,
your argument here insinuate, is emptie and inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and in effect, doth as much prove, neither the
Apostles their Preaching, nor Praying, to be at all
by us imitable, as the point you aime at.</p>
            <p>Your next Argument for Set-forms, you usher in,
by the instance of the <hi>Corinthians, who in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
used Hymnes of their own composing, as well as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
and then you adde, that, <hi>you could never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
why we allow the Spirit to be restrained in Prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as to words, and not in Praying:</hi> Sir, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you preface the custome of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for
enforcing your imposed Forms, or as the reason of
your doubt, anent the difference used by us in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Praising, doth not appear from your words?
However, as it is evident, that in that Church,
there was rather an exuberant liberty, then any thing
like to your stinting; so, our practice, and theirs,
shal soon be reconciled; but <hi>first,</hi> let us take your
N. C. Answere to your main scruple, and he and I
tell you, <hi>that, because the Psalmes and Scripture-songs,
are a collection of Praises, dictated by the Spirit of God,
for Worship; and have been so made use, both by the
Church of the Iews, in the time of the old Testament, and
by the Christian Church, in all Ages; therefore, they
are used by us, to the same end, without either restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Spirit, in the performance, seing it is his own
appointment, or tying all our praises, to these Forms,
seing God hath thereto, only tyed our solemn praise, by
singing, and otherwayes left and allows us, a furder liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:59845:145"/>
To your N. C. part of this answere you reply,
that <hi>never were more absurdities crouded in less bounds:</hi>
And if I may also anticipat, I am certain, there were
never more profane and ignorant fopperies, stuffed
into a return, then in that, which you here do
make.</p>
            <p>And <hi>first,</hi> you say, <hi>it is clear we may worship in the
Spirit, and yet be restrained as towords; since we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that God hes done it in praising:</hi> But waving
that, which I have already plainly, and so often told
you, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is the imposing of men, and not the
free use-making of Set-forms, that we condemne;
how absurd is it for you, to alledge, that a man
worshipping in words, prescribed by the Spirit, is,
in so doing, restrained in Spirit? Could you not
advert, that the Spirits prescriving, and mens, are
different, and that he prescriveth to himself, without
any restraint?</p>
            <p>2. You say, <hi>there are many Psalms prayers; and
why may they not be used for constant prayers, as well as
the other for constant praises? Nay why, for instance, may
we not use the</hi> 51 Psalme <hi>in plain words, with a plain
voice, as prayer, as well as in hobling rime, with a Tune<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
'Tis answered, That I may <hi>first</hi> take out the waspish
sting of your Mockerie; is this the tender respect,
that you profess p. 70. to every thing, that relateth
to Gods service; to call the Psalmes in meeter, used
both by you, and us, <hi>hobling rime?</hi> or is your Poëtick
vain so nicely delicate, that you can endure no verses
inferior to your loftie <hi>Pindarick?</hi> Which yet, if Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
mistake not, doth trote more rudely, and lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then our hobling meeter: for my part, I see not
what answere can be given to these Questions, save
this, that it seems both your tenderness, and poesie,
are but false, and forced: But to the purpose, 2. I
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59845:146"/>
answere, that the <hi>Psalms-prayers,</hi> and particularly the
51 <hi>Psalm,</hi> may in plain words, with a plain voice be
used in Prayer, as Prayer, if so be, the Spirit do
so direct our utterance; but if by constant prayers,
you mean, that the Praying-psalms, may as well be
imposed, and enjoined for prayer, as the other for
praise; you want the warrant of the Word, and Spirit
of God, who hath appointed the whole Psalms, to
instruct our praise; but not to regulat our prayers,
and so you widely miss your marke. But here you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuat
two difficulties; 1. <hi>How we come to sing Psalms-prayers?</hi>
and this you afterward enlarge by demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>our warrant, for using all</hi> David's <hi>Psalms, since
many of them relating to particulars of</hi> Davids <hi>life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
not to us? Others of them are imprecatorie, hardly
to be sung, and many things there are in the Psalmes, which
we understand not,</hi> and lastly <hi>there were not above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Psalms used by the</hi> Jews <hi>in Worship.</hi> To this it
is answered, that being commanded we sing Psalms-prayers,
not with direct thoughts suted to the strain
of Prayer, wherein they were first framed, and said,
before they were appointed to be sung; but with a
reflexe acknowledgement of the goodness and mercy
of God, the hearer of Prayer, who both turned the
Authors mourning into a song of gladness, and hath
appointed it to be so used by us, that we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
and praise him, in the like hope: if in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all Psalms of Praise, we finde the preceeding
distress and afflictions, with the prayers and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
therein made, first pathetically commemorat,
as the ground of the ensuing praise, for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
is it not easie to apprehend, how that a small
reflection, might, after the Lord's reliefe, have
made the reciting of a <hi>Psalm</hi> wholly of lamentation,
the most exulting expression of the delivereds joy,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59845:146"/>
and may commend it to us, to the same purpose?
For my part, when I read or hear the 88 <hi>Psalme</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with crying, and ending with darkeness, and
like <hi>Iob's</hi> imprecation upon the day of his birth, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no light shining, but a cloud dwelling upon it,
and yet finde it a song of the Sons of <hi>Korah,</hi> directed
to the chief Musician, I cannot but acknowledge it,
for a Psalme of high praise unto God, who turned
such dolefull mourning, to be the matter of rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and thus, if you will rightly consider, that the
Psalmes are ordained for the matter of praise, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the manner, consisting in reflexe acts, directed by
the Spirit, unto such suteable meditations, as may
excite our joy in, and praises unto God, is most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
and warrantably expressed, by singing,
you may very quickly be satisfied, that the Saints their
complainings, <hi>David's</hi> particular History, Victories,
and the like, with all the composures made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon;
yea, even these imprecatorie Psalmes (which
though in the direct act, they appear to be hard, and
to need a special warrant, may nevertheless furnish,
unto all, sweet reflections of praise) are, most proper
for the matter of song, whereunto they were, both
at first framed, and have since been used: are all the
works of God wonderful, and such as may excite to
praise? and do you think it strange that the various
exercises of his Servants and People, should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
proper matter for this exercise? Sir, though
I be no pretender to Poesie, farre less presumptuous
PINDARUM AEMULARI; yet I conceive the
smallest intelligence of the Nature, and manner of
Encomiasticks, and Elogies, finding matter in every
subject, might have guarded you from this escape;
but here I must digress unto a very pertinent discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
I have already told you, that though by command
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59845:147"/>
we use the <hi>Psalmes</hi> in our praises; yet seing these
Forms are prescribed by the Spirit, it can import no
restraint, and therefore can furnish no argument for
your humane impositions; but now there appears a
more significant disparity, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Psalmes</hi>
being commanded by the Lord, only for the matter
of our praises, though many of them may suggest,
both inward elicite conceptions, and outward prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
expressions of praise; yet it is evident, that by the
injunction, the reflex acts, wherein the nature and
exercise of praise doth formally consist, are not in the
least narrowed, or confined, let be stinted, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained;
whereas by your imposed Forms, framed
on purpose, not simply, to furnish matter, but to
direct, nay to suggest, lead, and express our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the very formal desires of the heart, and spirit,
in their substance, at least, though not in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
are so led and bound up, that it is hard to
determine, whether this restraint be more visible,
or injurious.</p>
            <p>Having thus farre diverted I return to our purpose:
You say, <hi>there are many things in the Psalmes that we
understand not.</hi> To sing without understanding is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
sinful; but unless you affirme the Psalmes to
be in themselves unintelligible, you may not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of our ignorance, or weakness, reject the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of God: Lastly you tell us, that <hi>there were not
above twentie of the Psalmes used by the</hi> Jews <hi>in Worship.</hi>
'Tis answered. 1. You observe not, that all this
clatter, is no more against us then against you, at least
your Episcopal Church; for as for your self, I am
almost in the opinion, that you are yet so little fixed,
that the clearest redargution, will prove no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction:
2. The very inscriptions of more then thrice
the number of Psalmes by you named, do demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59845:147"/>
the groundless confidence of this your alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance;
beside that we finde, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 7. the very
first <hi>Psalm,</hi> delivered by <hi>David</hi> to the publick Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
insert in the Book of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
by way of title, what may we then conceive
of the rest? 3. Reforming <hi>Hezekiah</hi> commanded the
<hi>Levites</hi> to sing praises unto the Lord, with the words
of <hi>David</hi> and of <hi>Asaph</hi> the Seer; and this the opinion
and custome of the Church in all ages, have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of all the Psalmes: whence then is it, that you
do assert so boldly? The 2 difficulty which I am to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,
is, that <hi>you say we are not bound, or rather have
no warrant to use the Psalmes in meeter or with Tunes.</hi>
To this I answere, That we are bound to sing is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
both from Scripture-precept and example; and
that we are thereby warranted, to have the Psalmes
in meeter with Tunes, is as clear, as both are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
at least convenient in the propriety of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
for the use of singing: I deny not, but prose
may be sung; but seing it is certain, that our language
hath no such exact Prosodie, as either to render it
easiely measurable, or the measures distinguishable
by points and accents; nay that the import of the
<hi>musici</hi> or <hi>tonici accentus,</hi> in the Hebrew, <hi>qui olim mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derabantur
harmoniam musicam,</hi> is so farre now lost,
and unknown, that if we were now to sing the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Psalmes, we could not make use of them:
Pray, Sir, leave us but the way of meeter, in place
of points and accents, untill you teach us better Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar:
whereas you hint, that <hi>we may have all David's
Instruments as well as Tunes,</hi> if you could learn us to
sing without Tunes, as we may well do without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
I shal not contend, but seing that <hi>David</hi> did,
no doubt, invent and introduce these his Instruments,
as well by the special direction of the Spirit, as he did
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59845:148"/>
all other things, anent the service of the Temple, and
that the Primitive Christians, worshipping more in
the simplicity of the Spirit, then in outward showes,
<hi>canebant assâ voce non</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I think you may
now put up your pipes, and spare the cost.</p>
            <p>Next you say, <hi>Why may not the Christian Church
compose new Hymnes, as they of Corinth did?</hi> And this
you judge to be <hi>the more necessarie; because that</hi> David's
<hi>Psalmes have not such full and clear Hymnes, upon the
great Mysteries of the Christian beliefe:</hi> And you think
the liberty, which we plead for in Prayer, should
much perswade it. 'Tis answered, if you consider,
that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and particularly the 26. v.
you may understand, that as the Apostle's business,
in the place, is, to set an order to the use of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gifts, wherein that Church abounded;
so, the Psalms, Doctrine, Tongue, Revelation, and
Interpretation, there spoken of, appear to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
and afflatitious motions, which will not found
you any argument: And you your self do so plainly
observe, that these Psalmes of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were
framed by private persons, that I marvell, that your
remembring of the thing, to be extraordinary, did
not stop your translation of it, by way of Privilege,
to the Churches in our dayes. 2. Seing the Lord hath
provided us with a plentiful variety of Psalmes and
Hymnes; and beside, hath allowed us as full a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of praising in prose, as of prayer, I think it
doth fully remove, all that is here by you objected,
and abundantly warrant us, both to abide content with
Gods institutions, and refuse a superfluous mixture
of humane Odes, with these Divine Psalmes, which
he hath appointed, for the matter of our more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Praises.</p>
            <p>But your scope is, <hi>Why do not ye use the Glorie to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59845:148"/>
the Father,</hi> and your N. C. answering, <hi>Because it is
not in the Scripture and is but the device of men:</hi> you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<hi>who would not be sick with such pitiful folly?</hi> Thus
your nice ceremonious stomach, nauseats sure and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
truths: You add, <hi>shew me a reason, why you make
prayers and not praises?</hi> I answere 1. Whatever we
make we impose none. 2. We do not say, that we
make either prayers or praises; our plain profession is,
that as the Lord, whose it is, hath commanded, so
we worship him, using that allowed liberty of Spirit,
and utterance, both in prayer and praise, whereunto
he himself hath promised to direct and assist us: And
as for the Psalmes given us by Divine appointment,
for the matter only (and not for the formal expression
of our more solemn praising) we are satisfied with
his bountie; and therefore do refuse your vain super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addition
of an humane invention: That our Meeter-Psalmes
are no device of men, seing they are the same
in substance and sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, with these in prose, without
any greater variation, then the application of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of singing to us <hi>Scots-men,</hi> doth both require
and warrant, is obvious to any mans candid reflection:
As to the possibility of singing in Prose, as well as in
Rime, I have already acknowledged it, and when
you shall make it plainly and safely practicable, I
presume none will dissent.</p>
            <p>But you again return to the <hi>Doxologie,</hi> and asks,
<hi>Why it may not be used in the end of singing, as well as it
is used by us in the end of praying?</hi> And this second
Demand heats you to be unmannerly, and to tell us,
that <hi>such childishnes makes you doubt our rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi>
When in faire dealing, it would become your
charitie better to informe them: but, passing your
folly, I say, we close our prayers ordinarily, with
praise and glory <hi>to the Father, the Son, and the Holy
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59845:149"/>
Ghost;</hi> because it is warrantable from Scripture-prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
to wit, in Blessing; and agreeable to the truth
and liberty of Gospel-worship; and yet we refuse it
in singing, (marke it, not in praising) because, for
that exercise, the Lord having instructed us with a
sufficient plenty of Divine composures, we think it
neither needfull nor acceptable, that we should gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
an arbitrarie imposition, in receiving the supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an humane addition: It is true, the words
are Scriptural, but can you say, that the Scripture
beares any such allowance, for their use in singing,
as it doth for the Psalmes of <hi>David?</hi> Yea and many
other spiritual songs, in Scripture, whereof you might
indeed with some reason reprehend our too great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use:
Hence therefore it is manifest, that not only
the offence of your unlawful imposing; but also the
want of Scripture-warrant, doth exhibit the reason
of our different practice, in praying and solemn sung
praises, which you so hotly urge. Having thus, Sir,
vindicat, both the Truth and our rational Faculties,
with how much advantage, might I retort your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of <hi>Childish weakeness?</hi> suppose our Reasons for
refusing were no better then yours for imposing, is it
not a childish impotencie, to be angrie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> let be to
make such a stirre, for our scrupling to do a thing,
when you have no better reason for you, then because
we exactly and fully do the equipollent? And real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when in my self I consider, that on your part,
such is the nature of almost all the differences, that
fill this Church and Kingdome, with so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
how can it be sufficiently regreted? for
Men, yea Christians, yea Christian Rulers, to vex
and toss poor Innocents, whom they ought with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
to protect, for no other reason, even in your
acknowledgement, but because, they will not sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendare
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59845:149"/>
their Consciences to arbitrarie, vain and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
impositions, which the very natural liberty of
reason would disdain, is indeed a matter of wonder,
which nothing save a Devillish design to debosh
Conscience, and judicial delusion from the Lord, can
satisfie: But I pray the Lord to open their eyes, who
ought to see.</p>
            <p>In the next place, returning to Prayer, you bid us
<hi>consider how</hi> Hosea <hi>the Prophet prescribes a form, when
he sayeth take with you words and say:</hi> Strong reasoning!
The Prophet is exhorting a backslidden, impenitent,
and obdured People, to returne; and, for their help
and encouragement, instructing them, how by a short
supplication to God, they might avert his wrath:
And this you make a warrant for men, rigidly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Forms: If a Non-conformist should go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orth
in the Spirit of the Lord, and proclame, <hi>O Scotland</hi>
returne unto the Lord thy God, take with you words,
and say, take away the iniquity of a despised Gospel,
and brocken Covenant, and receive us graciously &amp;c.
would not you think him very impertinent, who
should thence conclude, that man to be for a set Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie.
But <hi>our saviour prayed thrice still in the same
words, and yet the third time more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervently:</hi> I will not
tell you, that even in the Text there may be a little
variation observed; but pray, Sir, who of us ever
affirmed, that fervour in prayer did consist in a vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the phrase, which is the inference you here
make, against us; and yet that a stinted form, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when imposed, may restrain fervour, is as
evident to any impartial discerner, as that a deep fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of Spirit may oftentimes fixe in one short peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nay sometimes be intended to a degree beyond
words, is certainly confirmed by manifold expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
You conclude that <hi>in the Church they used Forms</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:59845:150"/>
very early: I will not tell you, that antiquity is not
a better plea for Set-forms, then it is for Bishops:
And really in my opinion, it is so much the worse
for either, that it pleads so jointly for both; for that
corruptions do draw on one another, and especially
a declination in Government, a declination from the
pure worship, though the first beginnings, and an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tient
examples were more obscure, yet the joint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
and increase of these evils, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
and the renewed late experiments, which we have
had at home, confirme it above exception: But my
answere is first, that the liberty of prayer, which we
plead for, was in the Church long before Set-forms,
even from the dayes of our Lord, during the times of
the Apostles and their Apostolick Successors, is a
most certain truth, and a better pattern then any after-alteration:
why do you not then hold to it? As for
the Liturgies of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> you your self
disowne them, and they are notour forgeries. 2. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that in the third and fourth Centuries, partly
through declining formality, and partly for a remedy
of the then much advanced decay, both of Piety and
Gifts in the Christian Church, certain Liturgies
were composed and used; yet the very variety of
them, which you acknowledge, as of that of <hi>Basile</hi>
that of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> doth sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
testify, that though they might then have been
proposed for helps, and so used; yet there was not
one of them imposed by peremptory injunction: As
for what you say of the <hi>Reformed Churches, that they
have their Liturgies, and that so had we ours at our first
Reformation,</hi> it so exactly quadrats to what I have
answered, anent the antient Liturgies, their being
framed for helps, that there can be nothing more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite;
in as much, as it is a most certain truth, that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59845:150"/>
both our old Liturgie, (since you do name it so) and
these of the Reformed Churches, are so farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rent,
and free from the impertinencies, corruptions
ceremonies, and rigid restriction of your Service-book,
by which it grossly bewrayes its foul Popish
fountain, that they do more oppugne, then fortify
your principal intent: but the matter speaketh for it
self: what shall we then say of your bold assertion,
<hi>viz. That never were extemporarie hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> (as you love to
speak of the liberty of prayer, as rudely and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as if you were talking of race horses) <hi>used in the
Church?</hi> When not only frequent instances from the
Old, the constant practice of the times of the New
Testament, the first and purer ages of the Church,
but the professed allowance, and known practice, of
all the Reformed Churches, do so directly witness
against you: Verily this is such an impudence, that
le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t it tempt my Mediocrity, I rather leave it to your
own Conscience.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you make your N. C. alledge.
<hi>That our Church was purer then any by you named,</hi> on
purpose, that you may take the advantage to say;
<hi>That we were cheated to believe, that all the World was
wondering at us, a cheat like unto that of our alledged
Prophetess:</hi> whereof you, and you forsooth, on
your word only, <hi>assure, that neither were true:</hi> Sir,
if the grossnes of that lye, anent the use of extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie
prayer, wherein I have just now attraped you,
did not sufficiently secure us from the slander of your
scoffing calumnies; I could easily make it appear, that
all the paines we took, in our own just vindication,
was many degrees inferior to that restless labour taken
by your partie, to represent us to all, as most arrant
Rebells, and load us with the most atrocious reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
which the Father of lies could invent: but
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59845:151"/>
               <hi>Cui bono?</hi> It is sufficient for us, that as the work of
the Lord, among us, was honourable and glorious,
many wayes countenanced by his Grace, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,

particularly in M. M. whom, I suppose, you
have learned, from <hi>Balcanquels Mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esto,</hi> and not
from us, to call her our Prophetess, and only level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against the wickednes and tyrannie of a Prelatick
partie, enemie to all Conscience, and the scandal
and betrayer of the Protestant interest; so these hard
and contrarie things, that have of late befallen us,
in place of obscuring, do only tend to its greater ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation,
and more universal approbation, from
all that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity: But
you proceed and tell us, that <hi>it is strangely inconsequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
for us not to pray in a Liturgie; yet alwayes to bless
the people in a Set-form:</hi> But, is it not strangely redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for you, to dessemble such an obvious dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
And will you still arrogantly pretend to be a
Master of Ceremonies, in the Court of Heaven?
The Blessing, used by us to be pronounced upon the
people, at the breaking up of the Assembly, is only
a short <hi>formula</hi> of a Christian fare-well, warranted by,
and coppied from, the practice both of <hi>Moses</hi> under
the old Testament, and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in the shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of his Epistles; and therefore in use to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
sometime in the words of <hi>Paul</hi> only, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
in the words of both, and sometime also with
an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> agreeable variation from both: What then can
this make, for the imposing of set-forms, for all
publick Prayer and Worship? Do not both the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
nature of the things, and the difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a peremptory imposition, and a free imitation,
red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rgue this your reasoning? In civill converse, our
ordinarie ran counters are commonly prefaced &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59845:151"/>
with certain received <hi>Formulae</hi> of a respective
benevolence; should therefore all mutuall addresses,
be reduced, and strainted to the same methods? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the smallest attention will both acknowledge
the just application, and marvel that (as you say of
us) <hi>you are so little governed by reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now to the <hi>English Liturgie,</hi> which commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as an excellent Rule of Worship, and using other
vain floorishes, not worth the noticing: in answere
to your N. C. you tell us: <hi>That it is farre from being
an easie way of praying, and that a natural man, would
be better pleased, to be runnig out with his own concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
then to use the form of the Church, which is more
simple and humble.</hi> 'Tis answered, That there may be
some conceated Hypocrites, from such a carnal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
despising Set-forms, I shall not controvert;
but as I have already told you, what are our just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
against their imposition; so, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of men, who, for the most part, do only lay
clame to the name, and make a slight profession of
Religion, without busying themselves further in it,
are by the carnal easines, that they finde in your way,
not only more engaged to it, then to ours; but habituat
to a superstitious, stupid formality, wherein placing
the <hi>all</hi> of Religion, they ruine their own Souls, is a
truth that millions of sad instances do confirme: seing
therefore, this <hi>strong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> food</hi> (as you terme it) of your
Service is indeed both ranck and poisonous, we wish
that, that <hi>princely tenderness in our Soveraign,</hi> to
which you impute his forbearance to impose it, may
at length, in its just exercise, extend to remove and
discharge it, in all his Dominions. As for the <hi>discreet
prudence of our Superiors</hi> (the Bishops no doubt) which
you would also commend to us, upon the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
pardon us, Sir, if we be not such <hi>Babes:</hi> we
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59845:152"/>
have shared too largely of the strong food of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence;
and of the bread of adversity and water of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
from their hands, to be so abused; He who
rightly considereth will easily assent, that they have
hitherto been sparing, to enjoin these corruptions,
for no other reason, then that which moved the <hi>Iews</hi>
to forbear to take <hi>Christ</hi> on the feast-day, <hi>viz; lest
there be an uproare among the people.</hi> As for the ensuing
contest, betwixt you and your N. C. anent that dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and stupidity, which we see occasioned by, and
attending your formality, the preceeding discourse,
doth so rationally connect them, and common obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
so evidently confirme the matter, that your
alledgeance of <hi>some godly people,</hi> who, in a well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sincerity, have, in the use of your service, attained
to some feelings of pure and simple devotion, doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
you no stronger exception, then what the Papists
may also pretend for their Mass and Latine-service.</p>
            <p>After this, you make your Non-conformist objecte
the vanity of your Service-book-repetitions, in the
often redoubling of <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> and 2.
its confusion, <hi>in that all the people say some of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
together, and use Amen:</hi> but seing these objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are amongst the least of these exceptions, made
by ours against that Liturgie, which ye altogether
neglect: I only say, that as the 136. <hi>Psal.</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a summare enarration of the great things God did
for <hi>Israel,</hi> and most pathetically interrupted by these
frequent eruptions of praise, agreeable to such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
can be no precedent or warrant for the fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and imposing the battologies of your Letanie,
vainly composed, and as deadly exercised, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ison
to such a pattern; so, your instance adduced
from <hi>Acts</hi> 4. where it is said, that the whole company
<hi>lift up their voice with one accord to God,</hi> And the cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59845:152"/>
intimated by <hi>Paul,</hi> of the saying <hi>Amen</hi> at the
giving of thanks, do not remove the confusion objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
1. because, it is the opinion of some, that that
passage in the <hi>Acts,</hi> was an afflatitious motion, both dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat
and uttered by the Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s immediate inspiration:
2. It may be doubted, if the whole company did all
of them lift up their voice, in as much as one speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a company, and the whole consenting and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they may be properly enough said to lift up
their voice with one accord, though every single
member do it not: 3. Supposing, as is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the great exultation of that smal compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
did then express it self, in that extraordinary
manner; would you make such extraordinary
examples, precedents for ordinary service? sure Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
repugnes, and the effect of decencie doth not
answere: 4. For your <hi>Amen,</hi> as I am certain, that the
Apostles words, may be understood of a consentient,
though silent, <hi>Amen;</hi> so it is evident, that, even
in the point of order, your so frequently repeated <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
is superfluous, and vain: but if you will reduce
your practice to a decent use, seing the matter appears
to be indifferent, if you love to express it, use your
liberty, only permit us the like favour of ours. As to
what you subjoine, that <hi>The people all with their voice,
join in the Psalmes, and therefore may also in Prayers:</hi>
the disparities are clear. 1. we are warranted, and
commanded to sing, which necessarily requires our
own vocall performance and concurrence; whereas
the command of Prayer, either private, or publick,
hath no such import. A man may pray in his heart,
or join with another, without using words: I hope
you will not say, that he can also properly sing, and
not use his voice. 2. I grant, your Liturgie being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
the joining of all with their voice in Prayer,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59845:153"/>
though not very orderly or decent, is yet practicable;
but seing we refuse these forms, the reason of our
different practice, in this matter, from our use in
singing, must by your self be acknowledged: Having
considered your answeres to what you make your
N. C. objecte, against the <hi>English</hi> Lyturgie, I might
give you an appendix of many more important ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions:
As 1. Its scenical, and mimical composure
throughout, very unbecoming the Worship of the
great God: 2. The many impertinencies of its Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies,
Gospels, Epistles, and Collects. 3. Its manck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and confounding of Holy Scripture, specially in
its Collects: 4. The superstitious observation of dayes
and other ceremonies, twisted all alongs with its
whole tenor, and exercise: And 5. Its corrupt tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and unsavorie and unacceptable straines and
methods, which it derives from the <hi>Roman Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Missal, and Superstitious Ritual, and Breviarie.</hi>
whence it was translated; but seing others have fully
declared them, to whom you have thought good to
make no answere, civility forbids me to urge a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
Adversarie.</p>
            <p>And thus we are arived at the controverted Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<hi>viz. The five articles of Perth:</hi> which you
say, <hi>were all lawful, and most of them useful and necessary:</hi>
Sir, the matter of Ceremonies in general, and also
of these by you specially named, with all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses
that possibly can be alledged for them, have
been so fully treated and examined by ours, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
by <hi>Didoclavius alias</hi> Mr. <hi>Calderwood</hi> in his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare
Damascenum,</hi> and <hi>Gillespie</hi> in his <hi>English Popish
Ceremonies,</hi> that I marvell, how you had the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to set forth these poor mustie, and many
times and wayes refelled and basted reasonings, which
you adduce: Neither are you in this only censurable:
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59845:153"/>
but when I compare that wit and acuracie, adhibit by
others of your way, in the handling of this subject,
with that bluntne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and confusion, wherewith you
repone to us the very meanest of their Arguments,
not so much as in the least recocted, nay, that the
short motives and insinuations mentioned in the
tenor of the Articles themselves, are of farre more
weight, then all your superficial discourse, my cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
doth almost exceed to accuse you, either of bold
ignorance, or a designed treachorie: However, since
all the arguments, either used by others, or abused
by you, with all that could be invented, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
your vain plea, doth stand by us, fully and
evidently discussed; I minde not by a disadvantageous
repetition, to lapse into your error; and therefore
shall content my self, by a summare and close review
of what ensues, in this <hi>Dialogue,</hi> to bring it to a
Period.</p>
            <p>The first of the five Articles, which you begin
with, is, <hi>Confirmation:</hi> And you say, <hi>That if it had
been introduced as a Sacrament, we had reason to except
against it; but seing it was only designed for a solemne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
of the Baptismal Vow, that Children who do not
therein engage themselves, when they come to the years of
discretion, may then do it; and is confirmed by antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the probable meaning of the laying on of hands men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,</hi>
Heb. 6. <hi>and the assent of most Reformers, the
thing seems to be sufficiently warranted.</hi> 'Tis answered,
1. It seems that in this place you forget your self:
did you not tell us, in your 3. <hi>Dialogue,</hi> that <hi>wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the feet,</hi> and <hi>anointing the sick with oyl;</hi> though
in appearance, as particularly descrived, and as well
warranted by Scripture, as either of the Sacraments;
yet, since antiquat by the Church, are now lawfully
difused, wherefore then may not the Church, having
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59845:154"/>
power to exauctorate Sacraments, be also allowed
the power to institute new ones, and so establish your
<hi>Confirmation,</hi> as a Sacrament, specially since the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church doth so practise it? 2. Not to contend
with you anent the name and definition of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
How come you to deny to the Church, the
power of introducing <hi>Confirmation</hi> as a Sacrament,
and yet to allow it the power to appoint it, as a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
renovation of the Baptismal Vow? Certainly,
whatever be the difference betwixt the two, yet the
unquestionable Rule, that in the house and ordinances
of God, men are not, without Divine prescript,
either to add or change, doth equallie refute innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of all sorts. 3. You speciously obtrude your
<hi>Confirmation,</hi> as a solemn renovation of the Baptismal
Vow; but, if you consider the thing, as it stands in
the Article, whereby it is enjoined, it is plainly
the Bishops solemn benediction of young beginners,
for the increase of knowledge; whereby it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that your description, importing the young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner
his act, is manifestly different from the thing,
(being the Bishops act) which you undertake to
maintain. But 4. Whatever way we take it, its sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
solemnity, wherein its form consists, is not
only without all Scripture-warrant, but plainly super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous;
seing that, as the Bishop or Presbyters their
blessing is not thereby bettered, or materially diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
from their ordinary benediction; so the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
profession of beginners, in their examinations,
and especially their after-partaking of the Sacrament
of the Lords Supper, doth more then supply your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
solemn renovation. 5. As this conceit of
Confirmation, as it is explained by you, doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
derogate from the Sacrament and Covenant of
Baptisme, as to Infants; so, your appropriating
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59845:154"/>
the administration thereof to the Bishop, objected
by your N. C. in his next demand, doth yet more
discover its vanity and evill design: To the arguments
therefore which you bring for it, and 1. to its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
I answere, that the simplicity and purity of
the first Ages of the Church, knew it not: 2. As,
its very first beginnings cannot be calculate, beyond
the times of the Churches declination, so, it is most
certain, that from an arbitrarie well-meaning insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
it hath since been depraved to such an abuse,
as may sufficiently justify the total removal of its use.
2. As for your Scripture probability, from the laying
on of hands so notourly known to have been then only
used, in the conferring of the extraordinary Gifts of
the Spirit, or in the Ordination, or Mission of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
neither it, nor your alleaged assent of most
Reformers, do merite any answere.</p>
            <p>Next you tell us, in defence of <hi>Private Baptisme,
That for us to confine the Sacramental actions, to the walls
of a Church, is gross Superstition:</hi> But, who would
have thought, when you clamour so much upon our
Non-conforming Meetings, you would have stumbl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into such a mistake? Our exception against <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
Baptisme</hi> is therefore, not <hi>the want of a dedicated
House,</hi> as you do vainly alleage; but because our
Lord, having, by his commission, annexed it to the
preaching of the word, whereof it is the seal, and it
being the Sacrament of our initiation into the Church,
its performance doth evidently appear to be most
agreeable to the ordinary Church assemblies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
held; beside, that peoples mindes, prone to
superstition, may, by the practice of Private Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
be readily inclined, both to apprehend the
Popish absolute necessity of Baptisme, and thence to
regard the exterior action, more then the spiritual
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59845:155"/>
signification and efficacie, is confirmed, by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
experience, both in your and the <hi>Roman</hi>
Churches: For the inconveniency, which you poorly
exaggerate, from <hi>the distance of many Churches, the
badness of seasons, and tenderness of Infants:</hi> as, unto
this day, it was never made the ground of a reall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
so you should understand, that the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Gods Providence do not alter the dispositions
of his holy will.</p>
            <p>From Baptisme, you pass to plead for <hi>the private
administration of the Communion</hi> to Persons on death-bed,
and this you think, <hi>the seasonablenes of its use,
and the propriety of its ends to such a case, do abundantly
perswade:</hi> To which I answere, 1. That though at
no time, Faith and Love need more to be quickened,
the Death of Christ more to be remembred, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Church to be declared, then in the
approach of the last pangs, it will not thence follow,
that therefore the Communion may then be privatly
administrat: for, since not the seasonableness of the
fruits, but the warrant and Rule given unto us, is
first to be heeded, in the going about of holy admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations;
nay, since that, without this regard
duely adhibit, the blessing and fruits are but in vain
expected, it is evident, that barely from the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the fruits, to conclude, in any case, the
lawfulness of the celebration, is preposterous Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and worse Reason: Now 2. That the rule set
down to us, in this Sacrament, doth reprobate this
your observance, is evident not only from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,
that there is and ought to be observed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the word, and Sacraments: But, 1. From our
Lords own pattern in the institution, keeping this
solemnity with the company of his Disciples, making
as it were a little Christian Church: 2. Because the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59845:155"/>
Apostle in his regulation of this Sacrament, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and with respect to his Masters pattern, doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Churches coming together into one place,
and consequently the ordinary Church Assemblies, as
a necessary requisite, in the free and peaceable times
of the Church: 3. Because the very Mysterie of the
Lords Supper, representing the union of Believers
with, and their communion in <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> their Head
and the name that it hath thence obtained, 1 <hi>Cor. 10.
v.</hi> 16, 17. is not well consistent with this private
administration: 'Tis true, the Authors of your Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
not being able to decline the convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of this reason, do, among other preparations,
require that there be three or four, free of lawful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
present with the sick person to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with him; but as such a packt Conventicle,
beside other inconveniences, hath no just resemblance
of the Church her ordinary Assemblies; much less
can communicating with hand-weal'd companions
be a signe of that free, equable and comprehensive
communion, signified by this Sacrament; so, it is
manifest, that the forementioned requisite is only a
colourable evasion, manifestly acknowledging the
force of our argument, <hi>&amp; in fraudem Legis, salvis verbis
sententiam ejus circumveniens:</hi> But 3. This your <hi>Private
Communion</hi> is to be reprobate; because, as the decum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents
faith, love, and other graces, in that hour of
his need, are only best excited by the means at that
time allowed and competent, and the sanctified re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
and improvement of other privileges,
and ordinances, formerly enjoyed; so, it is certain,
that this observance hath not only been abused by the
Papists, unto the abomination of their private <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi>
but is also rejected, by the Reformed Churches, not
<hi>Lutheran,</hi> as found to be inductive of vain Superstition,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59845:156"/>
whereever it is used; and for this I need not go farre
in search of confirmations, for you your self in telling
us, <hi>That your practice was very early in the Church,</hi>
subjoin, that <hi>Iustin Martyr sayes, they sent of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
to them that were absent,</hi> and that <hi>the story of</hi>
Serapion <hi>shews, how necessary, Christians then thought
it, to be guarded by this holy viaticum,</hi> which two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
whether true or false, being generally held
to be an excess, both inclining to, and introductive
of vain Superstition; and therefore, reckoned
among the first <hi>Naevi,</hi> appearing in the face of the
Primitive Church, and now generally disused, by
all the Churches of Christ, as they are by you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
do too evidently demonstrate, how much,
both your spirit and customes, do bend to a relapse,
in these evils.</p>
            <p>In the next place your N. C. asks you <hi>What you say
for Kneeling in receiving; sure this looks like Superstition
and Idolatrie:</hi> And in return <hi>you confess, that it is
the Article of them all, which you have least fondness for.</hi>
And this indeed, is very fitly expressed, in as much
as it is evident, it can be no rational or solid liking,
which inclineth you, to any of them; but since even
your <hi>fondness,</hi> as to this Article, is defective; how
farre must you be from doing the thing <hi>in faith?</hi> And
how much more sound and Christian would it be for
you, here to subsist, and say, since, for want of the
warrant of Faith, this <hi>Kneeling</hi> cannot possibly please
God, let it be removed from his Holy Ordinance?
But you proceed and tell us, <hi>That since the kneelers do
declare, that they neither believe Christ to be corporally
present, nor intend any Worship to the bread or wine;
but direct their Worship to God and Christ, for that death
which is therein shewed forth, it is great uncharitableness,
for us, to call this kneeling Idolatrie.</hi> 'Tis answered, Sir,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59845:156"/>
as in the general, I have as dull a facultie, and small
an inclination, for constructive inferences, specially
in the worser part, as most of men; so really; if the
purpose of this discourse were only a contest of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
upon the practice of persons, professing, as
you say, and gracing the same with humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and sincere love of the truth, the great Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists
for a dubious performance, for all the evill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
which I finde in this matter, I think I
ought rather to informe, in the Spirit of meekness,
by pointing out the error, then by a severe naming of
it, though just enough, both involve in more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
disputations, and like wise irritate, but seing
our business lyes with such, who, having rejected
and scorned all information, resisted yea gone over
unanswerable light, and shewed perverseness in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
do further go about, subtilly to seduce, nay
rigidly and violently to impose upon others, who
both have escaped and renounced these vanities: If
the purity and truth of Gods Ordinances, and the
very end of charity, do in this case allow, a more
peremptory plainness, I think your censure of our
<hi>uncharitableness</hi> altogether unseasonable: Now that
all your Ceremonies, but specialy this act of <hi>Kneeling</hi>
are Idolatrous, and that not only <hi>reductivè</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipativè,</hi>
as they speak; but also directly, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
by rendering Formalists such, <hi>Gillespie</hi> in his
<hi>English Popish Ceremonies,</hi> hath so fully demonstrat,
and therein hath so diligently searched you out, in
all your subterfuges, and clearly discussed all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
pretensions; that I should but wrong both
him, and my self, and the cause, by offering either
to repeate, or add: Only to convince you yet more,
how little, in this affaire, I am inclined groundlesly
to taxe your way of Idolatrie: I grant that your
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59845:157"/>
Kneelers do not only profess, as you say, which may
aswell be alledged for Worship done before a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe,
and yet doth not purge it of Idolatrie. But furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
do acknowledge, the act of receiving and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
to be no direct act of Worship; but first
commemorative, having the acts of praise and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
in the next place, resulting from it, and the
gesture of adoration to be thereto only ascriveable;
yet, seing in mediate Worship, the <hi>media</hi> are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
objected, and of the very substance of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
without which it cannot subsist, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that external adoration therein used, inevitably,
though neither rationally, nor intentionally, respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and relating to these objects, must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be Idolatrous: For instance, suppose a person
abstracting in profession, as much as you do
from all respect to the minister, who in his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sustaines his Masters person, and declaring,
that neither rationally he could, nor intentionally did,
attribute any more then becoming reverence to the
word heard, should nevertheless in hearing, still
kneell, would not you and all men say, that such an
excess were superstitiously Idolatrous? How much
more then, must this kneeling in the actual receipt
and commemoration, (an act nothing so immediat
betwixt God and the Soul, as that of hearing his
word) of necessity respecting the Elements, in as
much as without the presence thereof, it would not
at all be by you exacted, fall under the same, yea a
worse, construction? But, not to dip further in a
discourse, which I have already told you, that I judge
superfluous, as I have here exhibited the fairest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of your way, and yet there is nothing
found, even under the legal Ordinances, wherein
the signes and instruments, often honoured with a
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59845:157"/>
visible Divine glory, were advanced to the highest
pitch of a becoming reverence, that can, by any act
of adoration, thereto properly directed or relative,
any where recorded, justify your practice; so, when
it occurres, that the samine is both contrary to our
Lords own example, incongruous to the meaning,
and end of the institution, and lastly known to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
by a Superstition, that very quickly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and brought forth, the most gross of all the
Popish Idolatries; how strange must this delusion be,
that not only retaineth, but presseth it upon others?
But when your N. C. urgeth you with our Lords
example of sitting in a Table-gesture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you tell him,
<hi>That none should alledge this, but such as communicate
leaning, and after supper, and in an upper Room:</hi> And
wherefore did you not add <hi>in the house, where one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a Pitcher doth enter; and in a citie like to Ierusalem:</hi>
and the like, that so the folly of your reply might
have discovered it self, without my medling? But
the matter is plain: Our Lords example is to be our
pattern and rule, both for the substance, and in the
circumstances properly respecting its nature and ends:
the substance of the institution, is, a mysterious Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistick
commemoration of Christs Death, by the
symboles of Bread and Wine, used in the manner
prescribed; the circumstances are, that the samine
be performed by way of a festivity, at a Table, and
the like: these things being observed, as the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
roome, time and manner of the <hi>Iews</hi> sitting men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Gospel, were only accidental; so, the
samine are variable, according to the customes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
People, and Nation, without the least deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Lords Ordinance, Nay if you would
but deall with ordinarie ingenuity, in these matters;
seing that our Lords familiar converse and Table-ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59845:158"/>
adhibite in this appointment, is not the least
testimony of that condescending love, thereby repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
the just and faire imitation of his example,
consisting in the like familiar manner, <hi>in genere actus,</hi>
regulate by a due decencie, doth equally reject, both
the affected reverence of your impertinent Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and also the other extreme of that rigid Apish
conformity, in things purely accidental, whereby
you go about to redargue our censure of your Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.
But you say, <hi>Seing the</hi> Jews, <hi>without any writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
warrant, did change the commanded posture of the
Pass-over, from standing to sitting, and Christ did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
conform, wherefore may not Christians, who are less
restrained, change the first gesture, which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and only lamely exemplified, by leaning?</hi> 'Tis
answered, The posture mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 21. in
the institution of the Passe-over, is, that they <hi>should
eat it with their loins girded, their shoes upon their feet,
and their staff in their hand:</hi> there is no express men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of standing. 2. Some are of opinion, that
supposing standing to be imported, by what is injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
yet the posture was particular to that eating, at
<hi>Israels</hi> departure from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that thereafter the
posture was free, in respect that the formal perpetual
ordinance, given after the first celebration, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 43.
makes no mention of the gesture; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the <hi>Iews</hi> did thereafter use sitting, at least
from the dayes of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> in sign of rest and secure li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
however, certain it is, that as our Lords
posture in eating the Passe-over, whatever it was, was
not contrary to the Divine prescription; so, the
<hi>Iews</hi> their practice, acknowledged by you to have
been the same, can be no ground for your Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
innovation of <hi>Kneeling,</hi> introduced contrary to
our Lords example, the Rule of the institution; and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59845:158"/>
both introductive of, and tending to plain Idolatrie.
As for that greater liberty allowed to Christians,
which you here plead; as we have already heard,
that you only alledge our liberty, from the former
rigor, to the effect you may impose your new yoke of
a more i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rational bondage; so, it is evident, that in
this pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e you mention our freedome of Gesture, on

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you may enslave us to the imposition
of your Superstitious <hi>Kneeling:</hi> but he truely walketh
at liberty, who keepeth the Lords Commandments.
You shut up this Article with a <hi>perhaps, that more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
is due to this action now, that our Saviour is
exalted; then he could have allowed of in his humiliation:</hi>
But. 1. the veneration, that you here speak of, <hi>to
the action,</hi> sufficiently intimateth, that for all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses
made in the contraire, the Kneeling, which
you plead for, is in some sort relative to the Elements
therein used, and therefore Idolatrous. 2. your <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,</hi>
unsoundly insinuats, that our Lord could not
have allowed of the same adoration, now due to him
in Exaltation, in the state of his Humiliation; which
you know to be false. 3. at best, it is a conjectural
intruding into these things, which you have nor seen,
and so not meriting any regard.</p>
            <p>In the last place, you treat of the Article, anent
the <hi>observing of dayes,</hi> and denying that you pretend
to make them <hi>holy dayes:</hi> you tell us, <hi>that it is another
thing, to keep peculiar dayes of thanksgiving, for the
great and signal mercies of the Gospel-dispensation,
and in such customes you can apprehend no evill?</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
Sir, I am confident you have seen as little good:
but to be short, remitting what may be said against
this Article, to the pious and learned Labours of
these Authors, which I have already commended;
I only add, that although the construction which you
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59845:159"/>
put upon this observation of dayes, is certainly the
most plausible that can be made; yet you know so
well, how grossly these dayes have, in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, been abused to superstition and profanity,
both in their dedication and observation, And it is so
obvious to any, how, to this day, the generality
in these Reformed Churches, where they are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
do, in the persvasion as well as practice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the same abuse, that I think, since they are
only an humane invention, not good in itself, your
own rule, p. 70. that, <hi>when such things are grossly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used,
then there is ground to change their use,</hi> may fully
satisfy you, as to the justice and reason of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>But you affirme confidently, <hi>that in all Ages of the
Church, Christians have had a peculiar veneration for
these dayes:</hi> 'Tis answered, <hi>a veneration for these dayes,</hi>
how doth this language agree with the above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
interpretation, whereby, reducing these dayes,
to the condition of a meere circumstance of a constant
Anniversary thanksgiving, you go about to purge
them of all further Superstition? But this wind of
your vanity can not he hid: it is as the ointment of the
right hand which bewrayeth it self. 2. These dayes,
were not in veneration, in the first and purest Age of
the Church, whereby, both the generality of your
assertion, and your argument, from Antiquity, are
subverted: you tell us that the observation of <hi>Easter</hi>
and <hi>Pentecost, are clearly derived from Apostolical prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices:</hi>
what you understand by <hi>Apostolical practices,</hi>
concernes me not, seing that the Apostles, and
Church, in their times, knew no such thing: And
this Negative, proving it self, cannot be controlled:
I grant, the succeding Ages became soon fond of these
vanities; but, what were the bitter fruites of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59845:159"/>
and schisme, which the Lord in his justice,
did suffer this earely corruption to produce, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourly
known, and certainly such, as alone might
have taught the whole ensuing generations, to be
more tender of Gospel purity and simplicity: Shall
we then also refuse instruction?</p>
            <p>But you say, <hi>Paul hasted to be at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>to keep
the feast of Pentecost:</hi> Pray, Sir, be more sincere;
all we find in Scripture, is, that he hasted to be at
<hi>Ierusalem, the day of Pentecost:</hi> And I appeal to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ingenuity, if that any rational man, considering
<hi>Paul</hi> to be a <hi>Iew,</hi> and to hasten, against one of their
three great Feasts and Convocations, then by the
<hi>Iews</hi> still observed, to his own Countrey and its
Metropolis, where the general and solemne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of his whole Nation was to meet, can thence
conclude, that he went thither to keep the Feast of
<hi>Pentecost,</hi> in the meaning by you insinuate and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to your purpose?</p>
            <p>In the last place you tell us <hi>that Paul sayeth of the
legall holy dayes, he that regardeth a day, to the Lord
he doth regard it:</hi> Whence you inferre, that <hi>if</hi> Moses
<hi>his Feasts might have been kept</hi> holy <hi>to the Lord, much
more may these be, which the Church hath institute.</hi>
Really, I am so wearied with this poor stuff, that
civility, forgetting it to be your own, doth almost
prompt me to demand your pardon, for resuming it:
The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in that Chapter, is most expressly
declaring, our Christian Liberty, and its right use,
and in the case of a weak Brother, esteeming one day
above another, belike from the difference made by
<hi>Moses</hi> Law, he only adviseth, that he be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
in his own minde, and seing he regardeth it
unto the Lord, he would not have him therefore
judged: Now tell me plainly, is this either the case
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59845:160"/>
or the controversie betwixt us? Are Bishops the
weak Brethren, from the abiding impress, of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
dispensation fulfilled and evanishing, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
antiquat, tenderly and conscientiously over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteeming
and regarding certain dayes; and therefore
only pleading a charitable forbearance. Or lastly:
Seing the Bishops do not only, without warrant,
keep up these superstitious observations; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
enjoin and impose them upon others;
whereas the Apostle in the same place, doth both
declare our Liberty, and, with equal care, prescribe,
that, seing he that regardeth not the day, to the
Lord he doth not regard it; that therefore he should
not be judged: Are they not by the very Text here
alledged manifestly convicted? But it is enough: And
whether our dislike of these Festivals, and the other
Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> be not well grounded, and your
observing and enjoyning of them both Superstitious
and irrational, I leave it to the judgement of all the
Lovers of Truth.</p>

DIALOGUE
Answered.</head>
            <p>SIR, To this conference, very visibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
for the commendation of your self and
your way, and wherein pretending, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
speculations and the swelling words of
a faire profession, to elevat Souls to the solid
hights, and true liberty of Christianity, you plainly
go about, to introduce a regardless indifferencie,
for all these corruptions and superstitious practices,
whereunto, in a convenient compliance with the
present course, you cunningly endeavour to subjecte
us; you make you N. C. preface, <hi>That there is no
good to be hoped from you, who are so fierce against us,</hi>
and to add with little serious reverence, <hi>but God be
thanked an ill-willed Cow hath short hornes:</hi> Whence
taking the occasion, you tell us of your extreme aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from fierce and violent courses, your love to all
Christians, your pitie of such as you judge mistaken,
and that you quarrel with no man for his opinion, in
these lesser matters, <hi>Which are but the skirts and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
of Religion,</hi> and so forth. Sir, if Censure were
either my Genius or office, how easie were it for me,
to strip both you and your partie of this your sheeps
clothing: We have heard in the preceeding <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi>
your frequent accusations of Rebellion and
Faction, your virulent calumnies of the most <hi>inhumane,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59845:161"/>
unnatural,</hi> and <hi>barbarous Wickedness</hi> that can be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled,
your insolent mockeries at fancied mistakes,
and lastly, all that hath preceeded, a continual quarrel
about these things, which you call <hi>lesser matters,</hi> and
all this, against the generality, nay, against the
whole of the Godly and sober in the Land; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
the Lords faithful and suffering Ministers;
and yet you have the boldnes, to wipe your mouth,
and make a boast of your singular gentlenes, Christian
love, compassion upon them that are out of the way,
and tender forbearance toward dissenters in lesser
things. But, I have already medled too far in this
concention, only, as I would not have men mistaken
concerning you, so, for preventing of their mistake
of us, from your N. C. suggestion, I assure you
plainly, that though any man may affirme, without
fear of a contradiction, that the Prelatick Spirit,
mingled in the midst of you, is irreligious, false,
fierce, jealous, cruell, covetous and proud; and,
in these few years bygone, hath less or more appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in all these evill qualities, yet as the seen fury,
folly and prophanitie of your Bishops and Curates,
and a secret conviction, in all men, of the consistencie
of true Loyalty with the Countreys just aversion from
them, may in politick prudence, induce our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to restrain some what of the rage of that Partie,
which we are thankfully to acknowledge, so it is our
Prayer to God, that he would lead them on, to a full
and just consideration of the true causes of all our
grievances, and to serious repentance and returning
unto God, who alone, with truth, can restore unto
us true peace and establishment. You subjoine here
the late King's advice of Moderation to his Son, who
now reigneth; and would, forsooth, have us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that his words to express both your opinion,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59845:161"/>
and temper: and really, though I cannot altogether
acquit their strain of prejudice, nor carrie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
higher then the ends of Policie; yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
so much of sound reason, and the later part of
them, <hi>viz. take heed, that outward circumstances and
formalities of Religion devour not all, or the best, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
of Learning, Industrie, and Pietie,</hi> is so sadly
verified, in the present condition of affaires, that I
cannot but with wonder reflect, how such a rational
instruction, taught to the Author, by long and costly
experience, should at his Majesties return, have
been so much neglected, and, even to this day, after
so visible an accomplishment, so little remembred?
But the use you make of this passage, is only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
your N. C. childishnesse, and shew a little of
your own affectation, by causing him first to say, <hi>It
seems you are a Latitudinarian,</hi> and then by your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering,
that <hi>if by latitude be meant charity, you glory
in it;</hi> but as I have already demonstrat, in the second
<hi>Dialogue,</hi> that it is conveniencie, more then sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which relaxes and dilates your charity; and, as
it is too too evident, that it is the love of Peace, more
then of Truth, which doth recommend men to the
favour of your good opinion; so, I would have you
to consider, that <hi>rectitude,</hi> and not <hi>latitude,</hi> is the
measure and character of the wayes of God: Nay,
when I remember our Lord's words, <hi>Enter ye in at
the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way,
that leadeth to destruction; but strait is the gate, and
narrow is the way, that leadeth unto life:</hi> The fairest
gloss, whereof your <hi>latitude</hi> is capable, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
me to the designation: It is therefore, in the
streightness, yea and straitnes of this Rule, and in
the practice of the new commandement of Love, that
you may truly glory, but only in the Lord: The
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59845:162"/>
assuming of Names, other then that of Christian, is
but an emptie vanity, and that of <hi>latitude,</hi> is so little
expressive of pure Christian charity, that you see it
is the very Gospel-epithet of the broad way of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>In the next place, taking, as it appears, with this
new name of <hi>Latitudinarian,</hi> for all your disowning
of it, within a few lines preceeding, you and your
N. C. together, playing to others hands, compound
a prettie garland of praises, for your self, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices:
And where he acknowledgeth, <hi>That you live
very good lives,</hi> are <hi>strong witted People, sound against
Socinianisme, clear and free from Popish errors,</hi> you add
on your part, <hi>That your principles are neither dangerous
nor loose; that there are none greater haters of, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to, Atheisme; that you give a rational and convincing
account of Christianity, to all clear witted men; that
with a due measure of Charity for Papists, and regard to
the union of the Catholick Church, you disclame all errors,
and give a most clear and scriptural account, of the
points debateable;</hi> and lastly, <hi>that even where the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of Gods soveraignity, and goodness, seem to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere,
by faith, you stope the mouth of weak reason:</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
then, the men of the latitude are sound, and
orthodox men; nay, no doubt, but ye are the people,
and wisdome shal die with you: Yet, if I might a
little search you out, I would demand, 1. Why you
thus distinctly characterize your self, under a peculiar
name; for, that you do not understand these Epithets
of all your partie, nay, not of your Bishops, and
most of your Curates, is evident, even from the first,
whereby you assert, that <hi>you live very good lives,</hi> which,
I am certain, many of them do not so much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to? 2. If the principles of you <hi>Latitudinarians,</hi>
be the same, that we have set down, in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59845:162"/>
               <hi>Dialogues, viz. that preaching is not to be termed
the Word of God;</hi> and consequently that Ministers are
not his Messengers; <hi>that the Church</hi> (and we know
not what Church) <hi>may antiquat and cause to cease, the
obligation of practices, such as the washing of feet, and
anointing the sick with oil, though, as punctually and
perpetually enjoined in the Scripture, as either of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;</hi>
that <hi>Christs Kingdome is so inward and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
that Offices, and Officers, can no more be thence
pleaded for, in the Church, then the stamping of Coin;</hi>
that, <hi>if the inward opinion be left free, no imposition upon
the outward practice can wrong Christian liberty;</hi> that
<hi>extemporate prayer is but fancicall and carnal;</hi> that <hi>there
is no praying by the Spirit, unless in a manner and in
words infallible;</hi> that <hi>the English Liturgie is an excellent
Rule of Worship;</hi> and many such like things: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if these, I say, be the principles of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinarians,</hi>
as they are yours, they are very loose
and dangerous, even subversive of the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the Word of God, and the Ordinances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
appointed. 3. You take to your selves the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of <hi>very good lives:</hi> I wish you may not be
deceived; the Pharisees made clean the outside of the
cup and of the plater; but God requireth and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the heart, and these things that come forth from
the heart, <hi>evill thoughts, deceit, blasphemies, pride,
foolishnes,</hi> as well as <hi>adulteries, murders, thefts, these
defile the man:</hi> What of these may be found in this
little Volume of your <hi>Dialogues,</hi> especially, lies, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
mockings, it were too rigid for me to reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulat;
I leave it to the impartial perusal of what
both of us have said: Only as I desire not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
so uncharitable, as to propose this, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional
cognizance of all the writings and sayings
of the men of your way; so, I heartily pray the Lord,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59845:163"/>
to make all of you, indeed, <hi>rectitudinarians.</hi> 4. As
for your <hi>strong wits,</hi> I wish you may be as little
puffed up with the conceit of them, as we are terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fied
by their opposition; that you do not abuse them
to <hi>Atheism,</hi> or <hi>Socinianism,</hi> we chearfully accept of
the acknowledgement: Only let me tell you, that
though we be as loath, as you are, to deny Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
both in its Articles of beliefe, and precepts of
practice, to be highly congruous, to the dictats of
right reason; and do grant, that Religion, the highest
accomplishment of Nature, is suteable to mans su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
faculty; yet, that <hi>thus to propose them, is the
most convincing way to all clear witted men,</hi> labours of
these difficulties, 1. That, although there be not
only as much obvious reason, in the revelation of the
Gospel, as may stop the mouth of all Gainsayers, and
unanswerably confound the vanities of <hi>Atheism,</hi> and
all false Religions, but also, such a Divine congruous
light, as, once entering and dispelling the natural
man's darkeness, causeth these things, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were to him as foolishness, appear to be the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God; yet, it is certain, that the things of
God, depending solely upon his free, holy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
good pleasure, and decree, and being only
communicat by the revelation, and receivable in
the illumination of the Spirit, to think to propose and
enforce them, by rational perswasion, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of men in the state of nature, is vain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous:
and therefore, if it be in this manner,
that you do understand your assertion, <hi>viz. that thus to
propose them, is the most convincing way to all clear witted
men,</hi> seing, it both imports a sufficiencie in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser,
and a possible capacity in the hearers, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
without efficacie of Divine grace, and the light
of revelation, it is doubly peccant. 2. In what sort
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59845:163"/>
soever your assertion be understood, the superlative
preference, which it giveth to your way of reason,
directly impingeth upon the Apostles their manner of
preaching; which was not with the wisdom of
words, but in that simplicity, which unto these,
that sought after wisdom, was as foolishness: It was
neither by the <hi>Wise,</hi> nor by the <hi>Scribe;</hi> nor by the
<hi>Disputer;</hi> but God choosed the <hi>foolish things of the
world, to confound the wise:</hi> Consider the Apostles
their Sermons, yet extant; specially <hi>Peters,</hi> not only
to the <hi>Iews,</hi> but also to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there can be nothing more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
either in perswasion, or in expression: Hear
<hi>Pauls</hi> testimony of himself [<hi>and I brethren, came not
with excellencie of speach, or of wisdom, declaring unto
you, the testimony of God; but was with you, in weakness,
and in fear, and in much trembling:</hi>] &amp;c. and certainly,
if you will be pleased to ponder the reason and end,
which he subjoins, <hi>viz. [that your faith should not
stand in the wisdom of men; but in the power of God]</hi>
You cannot but perceive, both the difference of this
way from, and its excellencie above that of rational
perswasion, which you so much commend. 3. As
neither the undoubted congruity of Christianity to
reason once enlightned, nor the sufficiency of reason,
by its own force, to redargue proud mockers and
despisers, do conclude its aptitude for the discovery,
explication, or right uptaking of the things of God,
without the Spirit, which alone knoweth them; So,
it is justly to be feared, that this new method, of
adventuring by reason, without the testimony of the
word, to propose and explain these mysteries<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> do
not only prove ineffectual, for true instruction; but
also inductive of the Authors themselves, into many
misprisions and errors: For men to quite and lay aside
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59845:164"/>
the conduct of the true and only light which is the
best evidence and manifestation, both of its self,
and of its object, and in a vain curiosity, to set up
and demonstrat by the taper of Reason, in the sunshine
of revelation, and to endeavour, to cause reason
lead or guide, which, with much difficultie, is able
to follow, is a presumption, not more full of pride
then of danger: <hi>Paul</hi> was a man very learned, long
exercised, and no doubt mightily fervid in all the
Arts and Methods of reasoning; but from the time,
that, that light from Heaven, above the brightnes of
the Sun, shined about him, and laid him on the
ground, trembling and astonished, we find his speech
in the matters of the Gospel, was not with entising
or perswasive words of Mans wisdom; but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the Spirit, with much fear: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
indeed he disputes, and thereby also confounds;
but it is his preaching that mostly converts. Think not
that, by these reflections, I aime particularly at either
the fault or fate of the men of your way: no, let
their writings speak for themselves; but that there is
such a vanity, too much in present practice, the late,
more pretendedly rational, then Scriptural, essayes
of many, do too sadly evince.</p>
            <p>4. You say that you <hi>Latitudinarians are neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
nor</hi> Cassandrians; <hi>but, in effect, charitable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
and that you are far from that hight of rigour,
of damning all Papists, which some of us owne.</hi> 'Tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That we are sufficiently tender in this point,
is notour to all, and this your challenge, if rightly
understood of Papists, that is of all, who live within
the verge of and own the Church of Rome, is as
groundless as your needless profession of an uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
charity, <hi>because they hold the foundation Iesus
Christ, though they build upon it, wood, hay, and stuble:</hi>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:59845:164"/>
I confess that, seing thereby you plainly enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate,
that <hi>Papists,</hi> even <hi>as such,</hi> do not erre funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,
and consequently, under this reduplication
may be saved, it imports to me an excess, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we ought not to comply. To join with the
merit of Jesus Christ, that of their own good works,
nay, of their own superstitious inventions; and to
his Mediation, that of Saints, seem to me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge
upon the very foundation, which you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
What shal we then say, of the avowed gross
Idolatries and Superstitions, ridiculous penitences
and perverted morality, whereby, both the truth,
and spirituality of Gods Worship and Service, with
the inward and genuine Grace of Obedience and Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
are subverted? Really, Sir, these appear
to me, to be a superstructure of such naughty stuffe,
as neither the sincerity of Grace, with which I judge
them incompatible, nor even the flames of their own
purgatory, will ever purge away.</p>
            <p>But you proceed: <hi>That though you will not say, that
all things controverted, betwixt the Reformed Churches
and them, are matters of Salvation; yet in their greater
errors, such as the Popes Supremacie, the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
the corporal presence &amp;c. you condemne them,
and perhaps on clearer grounds, then we do:</hi> 'Tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
1. That the things controverted with the
<hi>Papists</hi> are not all of them such, as do directly and
necessarily, in beleefe or practice, appertain to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
is not by us denied; but, where, in this
your latitude, you do in effect intimate such a dissent
from the Reformed Churches, as if many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and the Papists, were needlessly by us drawn
in question, it is such an undervaluing of the will
and way of the Lord, whereupon, even in our small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
differences, we hope, we are founded; that I
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59845:165"/>
could not pass it, without an observation. 2. Wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
you do indeed condemn the <hi>Papists,</hi> in many of
the points by you enumerate, let be on better grounds,
is to me very dubious? You say, <hi>you are against the
Popes Supremacie;</hi> but how is it then, that you have
transferred it upon his Majesty, and that with a more
ample extent, then ever was conceded to, nay, or
arrogat by any Pope? <hi>That the King, may enact such
Acts, and Orders, concerning the administration of the
external Government of the Church, and the Persons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
imployed, and concerning all Ecclesiastick Meetings
and matters, therein to be proposed, as he shall think fit,</hi>
is more then any <hi>Pope</hi> ever assumed: Pray, Sir, is the
difference betwixt the persons of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Prince,</hi>
the hinge of the controversie? Or, is this one of the
clearer grounds, you talk of? consider it at your leisure.
In the next place, you tell us, that <hi>you condemn the
Churches infallibility,</hi> and yet, p. 31. of this same Book,
your affirme that even in matters, as punctually set
down in Scripture, as either of these Sacraments, the
Church may judge, that God did not therein intend
any perpetual obligation, and, by her practice, oblige
us to a cessation, and consequently, alter Scripture-determinations:
Beside, you know what power you
attribute to the Church, to impose significant cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and other observances; which, although you
tell us, for an evasion, do not take away the liberty
of inward opinion; yet you affirme, that they do
bind in Conscience to a conformable practice: Verily,
if a Church so impowered be not infallible, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
are too large; but the truth is, <hi>Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible,</hi>
the <hi>Church fallible, and nothing fixed,</hi> appear
to be most aggreeable, to the <hi>lightnes</hi> of your brains,
and the <hi>Conveniencie</hi> of your <hi>new latitude.</hi> 3. You af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that <hi>you are against the corporal presence,</hi> and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59845:165"/>
also <hi>the worshiping of Images;</hi> and yet, you are for
Adoration, to, before, or, in order to, the Eliments:
For call it as you will, you plead for it, as due vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
in the action, whereof, they are the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
objects: how these do consist, I see not: For my
part, I cannot but judge, the <hi>Papists,</hi> though more
gross, yet more consequent. But we have enough of
this subject, and these few instances premised may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
well justify the excessive love, which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to the unity of the Catholick Church, wherein
you include the <hi>Roman;</hi> and your esteem for such,
meaning by <hi>Cassander,</hi> and others of his way, who
have studied to bring things to a temper, do palpab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold out your byass to their haltings: But if the
unity and temper, that you aime at, be of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
since it hath not truth for its foundation, the Lord
deliver his Churches from it.</p>
            <p>In the next place your N. C. and you fall a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling,
about <hi>Iustification,</hi> and after you have first
taxed, then smoothed, and again, in a manner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
the <hi>Papists</hi> their <hi>Iustification by works,</hi> and their
<hi>Merit,</hi> you proceed <hi>to Iustification by faith only:</hi> and
when you have given us your explanation of
it, you make a prettie bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, as it, forsooth,
by <hi>your right apprehension of things, you had, in a
few words, told that, which, with much nicety
swels amongst us to Volumes:</hi> Sir, I so greatly defire to
find you walking in the truth, and am so little in love
with contention, especially in a matter of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that I am resolved, rather fanely to pass, then
rigidly to strain, even your more ambiguous expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
but since you would make the World beleeve,
that, with you and you only, is to be found both
Truth and Light; and that, on the other hand, we
do perplexe this point, with <hi>Nic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ties</hi> and <hi>subtilties,</hi> it
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59845:166"/>
will not be amiss, that in this matter, I examine you
more particularly: which that I may performe, with
the greater candor and perspiciuty, I shall first exhibit
your words, in their full context, and thereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
them in parts.</p>
            <p>You say then, <hi>That Iustification and Condemnation
are two opposite legall termes, relating to the judgement
shal be given out, at the last day: For though we are said
to be condemned already, this is only, that we are now in
the state of such, as shal be solemnly justified or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
Now, at the great day, we must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our actions, and we must be judged accordingly;
but since all must be condemned, if God enter in judgement
with them; therefore God gave his Son to the death for
us, that thereby we might obtain Salvation: And all jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, by the Father, committed to the Son: and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ hath proposed life, through his death, to as
many as receive his Gospell, and live according to it: And
as that, which gives us a title to the favour of God, is the
blood of Christ; so that which gives us an interest in his
death, is faith, with a life conforme to the rules of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and the root of this new life, is a faith</hi> which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by love, purifyeth the heart, and overcometh
the world, <hi>and therefore Iustification is ascribed to it in
Scripture: and this,</hi> you say, <hi>is the right apprehension of
things; both ascribing all to Christ, and declaring clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the necessity of a holy life.</hi> 'Tis answered; The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Justification, being, in effect, the very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Gospel, and its right uptaking, of the
greatest moment, in order to our Salvation, for as
much, as you, by an affected simplicity, and simulat
smoothness, do palpably laboure to involve and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
it; I shal first represent, in your words, and in
its own colours, the error which you would impose,
and then discusse these reasons, and insinuations,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59845:166"/>
whereby you endeavour, rather cunningly to cover
and convey it, then plainly to maintain it.</p>
            <p>The scope then and aime of your discourse is, that
<hi>the proposall of life in the Gospel, through the death of
Christ, is to as many as receive it, and live according to it;
that, that which giveth us an interest in the death of Christ,
is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that because of the fruits of faith, love, purity of heart,
and victorie over the world; therefore Iustification is
ascribed unto it in Scripture.</hi> The meaning of which
expressions in plain language, is, that it is by good
works, joined with faith, nay, by good works prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
and faith referred to them, as the root there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and not by faith only, as the instrument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the perfect Righteousness of Jesus Christ is laid
hold upon, and becometh ours, in Gods sight, that
we are justified. Now, that this your opinion is false,
and is to be rejected, appeareth by these many, and
plain Scriptures: <hi>By the deeds of the Law there shal no
flesh be justifyed in his sight, Rom. 3. 20. The man is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to whom God imputeth righteousnesse without works,
Rom. 4. 6. By grace we are saved, not of works, lest any
man should boast, Eph. 2. 8. 9. Not by works of
righteousnesse, which we have done, but according to his
Mercy he saved us, Tit. 3. 5. God was in Christ
reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
unto them, 2. Cor. 5. 19. God hath saved us with
an holy calling, not according to our works; but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own purpose and grace, which was given us,
in Christ Iesus, before the world began, 2 Tim. 1. 9. He
hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him. 2. Cor.
5. 21. Iesus Christ, is made of God, unto us, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

life unto the obedient; and on the other, pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wrath and death, against such, as should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient:
The sanction and pain of this divine Law being
by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> incurred, and all mankind standing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
condemned, and bound over to wrath in Gods
sight, the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59845:167"/>
holding forth Jesus Christ, manifested in
our flesh, and therein fulfilling all righteousnesse, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in both Bodie and Soul, dying, shedding his
bloud, and making his Soul an offering, for a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ransome, for satisfiing Divine justice, and
reconciling us unto God, rising again for our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and being made perfect through suffering,
became the Author of eternal salvation to all them
that obey him; that is, believe and receive this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-covenant
(whereof he himself was also the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister)
holding him forth, for Wisdom, Righte,
ousnes, Sanctification, and absolute Redemption-to
all that come unto and imbrace him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as at first, Christ came into the world, by
doing the will of God, and making his Soul an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for sin, to bring in everlasting Righteousnes, even
the Righteousnesse of God through faith in his Name;
so, because he was obedient unto death, even the death
of the Cross, God hath therefore highly exalted him
and given him a name, which is above every name, and,
vesting him with all power in Heaven and in Earth,
hath made him the Head of all things, unto his
Church, and committed unto him all Judgement,
that he may, one day, render both vengeance unto the
Disobedient and Unbelievers, and receive unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and the Fathers Glory, his own, who, through
faith in his Name, are justifyed in Gods sight, and
by his grace purifyed, and preserved unto his heavenly
Kingdom. This being then the plain Gospel-revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to lost and condemned sinners: what els doth
it require, then, that in the knowledge and sense of
this our sinful, wretched and miserable estate, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Jesus Christ our Wisdom, we, by faith, lay
hold on him and his Righteousnesse, for our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
from wrath, and alone acceptation in God's
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59845:168"/>
sight; and also for obtaining of Sanctification, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the purging away of all filthiness of the flesh
and Spirit; which the penitent Convert; as he feareth
its guilt and wrath, doth, in like manner, detest
and abhorre; and the perfecting holiness in the fear of
God: And lastly for compleat Redemption from,
and victorie over, Sathan, the World, the body of
this death it self, in the triumph of the Resurrection,
and the plenarie possession of Eternal life. By all which,
it is evident, that whatever be these other graces and
blessings, which we partake, in and through our
Lord Jesus; yet it is through and by faith alone, as
an instrument, and in respect of its peculiar aptitude
for that end, apprehending or laying hold on Christ
Jesus, the only Propitiation, and his Righteousnes,
the alone Satisfaction, that we are justifyed in Gods
sight. And really, Sir, when in this sincere and
clear light, I have proposed this matter, I wonder,
what vanity or ignorance could seduce you, to the
doctrine which you here deliver. To grant, as you
do, Justification to be a judicial act, whereby, no
doubt, we are to understand, that God as the great
Judge, attempe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing justice with mercie, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
accept of a Ransome and Surety offered, and
therefore absolve, yea justify the Criminal; and yet,
notwithstanding of the evident Scripture testimonies,
that shew the Lord our Righteousness to be, in very
deed, this Ransome and Surety, and faith only its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
application, to join good works with it,
and state both, as the condition of our Justification,
is not only reproved by the Papists their more conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
explication, who, because they admit of
works in Justification, do therefore hold it, not to be
a judicial act; but rather a gracious work; but by
the common sense of all men, in these similare instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59845:168"/>
from which the manner of explaining these
things is borrowed: If in our ordinarie Courts,
the Law being transgressed, and the transgressor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed,
the pronouncing of the doome of judgement,
and its execution, were stopt, by the interposition of
a ransome and surety offered, so fully satisfying and
acceptable in the eyes of the judge, that, for his
sake, the poor Criminal were both pardoned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to special favour, would any rational man say,
that the person guilty, were thus absolved and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,
either for his act of laying claime to the price
and pledge, as a condition; seing it is only the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
instrument, whereby the true motive of the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somers
satisfaction is applyed; or yet for the act it
self, together with the absolved person his conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
good behaviour, which is the parallel of your
interpretation which is yet more absurd; And not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affirme plainly, that it is for the ransome and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
only, that the man is acquit and accepted? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
common ingenuity, which must acknowledge
all the defects of this similitude, to be the manifest
advantages of the point, principally pressed, will
both cede to the conviction of its evidence, aud trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it plainly to the case in hand.</p>
            <p>Having thus set down a Scriptural and easie account
of this important truth, which (reflecting upon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all Protestant Divines, with whom in this we
agree, and wandering in your raveries, after no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
guid then <hi>Patrick</hi> the Pilgrim) you say, is <hi>by us hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
with much niceness and subtilty:</hi> for its further
clearing, and the better discoverie of your vanity: I
shal now examine your discourse in its particulars: and
1. you say, <hi>Iustification and Condemnation are two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
legal termes.</hi> By <hi>legal,</hi> I know you mean judicial,
and therefore, in place of urging your mistake, I se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59845:169"/>
wish that the tenor of what ensues, had been
consistent to so true and solid a ground: but you add:
<hi>That they relate to the judgement shall be given out at the
last day:</hi> a strange fetch to compasse a false designe, I
might remember you, that the Scripture is express,
<hi>That being justifyed by faith, we have peace with God,
through our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> and <hi>there is now therefore,
no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesus, who</hi>
(by their assured partaking of his grace, and in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of their true faith in him, and Justification
therethrough) <hi>walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit:</hi> and that thence it is evident, that, as it is
God that judgeth; so it is by an act of his free grace,
in Jesus Christ, antecedent to the last judgement,
that we are reconciled unto him, and justified in his
sight. But your own words, <hi>viz. For though we are
said to be now justified as the unbeleeving are said to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
already, this is only, that we are now in the state
of such, as shall be solemnly justified or condemned;</hi> do
sufficiently reprove you, because,</p>
            <p>1. It is certain, that the unbelieving are not, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
and with respect only to that future judgement,
said to be condemned already; but, as by reason of
sin, judgement is already come upon all unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
and he that beleeveth not the Son shall
not see life, is under the curse, and the wrath of God
abideth on him; so it is manifest, that <hi>now</hi> it is, that
they stand truely under the condemning power and
sentence of Gods holy Law, from which, it is most
unquestionable, that condemnation doth directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
against all transgressours; however, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of God, they are not only for a time repriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but place left for a ransome.</p>
            <p>2. To be justified freely through grace, doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
import, the person justified to be antecedently
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59845:169"/>
under condemnation; if by the offence, judgement
had not come upon all to condemnation, there had
been no need of the Righteousnes of Christ, to the
Iustification of life: How then, can the opposite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Condemnation, be by your referred unto the
last day? Far less made an argument to deferre, untill
that judgement, our Iustification, which of necessity
doth presuppose it: Certainly, you cannot but grant
it to be most absurd, to think, that Believers shall,
in that day, be first condemned, and thereafter
justified.</p>
            <p>3. When you say, <hi>That it is in that day, that men
shall be solemnly justified or condemned,</hi> you clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the matter: <hi>viz.</hi> that as the solemnity of the
judgement of that day, shall be only declarative, and
finally executive; so it evidently concludes, that the
judgement, then to be pronounced, was given and
established of before. Pray, Sir, do you think the
Spirits of just men made perfect, are not as yet justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</p>
            <p>But 4. you grant, <hi>that we are now in the state of such,
as shall be solemnily justified or condemned;</hi> which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shews; your insinuation premised to be only a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
to obscure by words without knowledge, in
as much, as the question remains the same, anent this
state, and how we now attaine to it, as anent the
justification, which you would deferre: And 1. What
is the state of Iustification? Is it not that we who were
under the Curse and aliens, are accepted unto favour,
pardoned, and brought near? Wherein doth it then
differ, from actual Iustification? 2. How is it, that
we attain to this state? Sure not by works, either
alone, or in conjunction with faith, as we have heard
from Scripture, and shall be further evinced. But if
it be by faith alone, as the instrument laying hold on
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59845:170"/>
the sole meritorious Righteousnes of Christ, our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is only verbal, wherein you foolishly resile
from Scripture phrase: If you shall further add, that
by faith we do indeed attain to this state, but only
inchoatly, or unfixedly, and changeably, then you
evidently impinge, both upon the perfection of
Christs Righteousnes, and the faire and certain grounds
of the Saints their perseverance.</p>
            <p>It followeth in your discourse, <hi>Now at the great day
we must give an account of our actions, and we must be
judged accordingly:</hi> And I note in your ensuing words
<hi>That since all must be condemned, if God enter into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them,</hi> and that not only, if he should charge
us with our transgressions, but even if he should only
reckon with us, upon our good works, and for that
imperfection and weakness, wherewith, as they are
from us, they are tainted; doth not the certainty of
this judgement, above all things, plead the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and alone sufficiency of the Righteousness of Jesus
Christ, for our Justification? But to restore your words
to their own channell, you say, <hi>that since all must be
condemned, if God enter into judgement; therefore God
gave his Son unto the death for us, that thereby we might
obtain Salvation:</hi> And though by this passage, it be
clearly enough imported; that it is before God, and
by the sentence of his Law, that all men stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
and that therefore, he hath given his Son,
whose Death and Bloud is the Propitiation, and in
whom he is well pleased, to be a ransome, for libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and acceptation to all that believe on him;
whereby Justification by faith in Jesus Christ, without
the deeds of the Law, is in substance granted; yet
for ushering in your good works, to share with faith,
in Justification, by a strange connexion, you subjoin:
<hi>And all judgement is committed by the Father to the Son,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59845:170"/>
and Iesus Christ hath proposed life through his death to
as many as receive his Gospell, and live according to it.</hi>
But I must take notice.</p>
            <p>1. That by laying down the commission of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given to the Son, as a ground to his proposing
of the Gospel offer, you manifestly repugne to our
Lords own words and testimony, expressly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
the character of his first coming, which was
in the form of a servant, to minister, not to be minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
unto, and by performing the Fathers command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to save the World, and not to judge it; from
that of his second coming, which shall be with power
and great glory, to the Salvation of all that look for
him, and to judge and to execute judgement upon all,
that are ungodly.</p>
            <p>2. By making our Lords commission to judge,
antecedent to his ministration of the Gospel, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
Truth and plain Scripture-evidence, whereby it
is clear, that our Lord was first sent into the World,
to preach the Gospel, and lay down his life for sinners;
that, whosoever believeth on him should not perish,
but have everlasting life: And then, because of his
compleat, and perfect obedience, is exalted to be
the Head of all things, unto the Church, and hath
Authority also to execute judgement committed to
him, because he is the Son of Man.</p>
            <p>But. 3. By this your doctrine, you in effect sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the grace of the Gospel, in as much as, in the
place of the Gospel-covenant, offering pardon and
peace to poor lost sinners, through Christ Jesus, and,
with and in him, all grace and glory; you introduce
our Lord, as having, by his death, indeed merited
the privilege of a new offer of life unto sinners; but
making and renewing the same, in no better termes,
then these of the Law-covenant; for as the Law
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59845:171"/>
sayeth, that the man that doth these things shall live
by them; so, you tell us, that the termes of the
Gospel-tender, are to receive the same, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to it: Now, if the Law doth offer life, to
such as receive and live according to it; and our Lords
proposal stand in the like termes, admit the proposers
not to be the same; yet the proposals are certainly
coincident: and therefore, although the eternal trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
betwixt the Father and the Son, may be of
Grace; yet it is undeniable, that, in your opinion,
the tenders of the Law and Gospel, as to us-ward, do
rune in the same tenor; and the condescendence of
both, prerequiring our works, is equally to be
reckoned of debt: These being the consequences of
that Gospel-method, by you here contrived, and
its designe no less evident, to make works with saith,
the condition and procuring cause of our Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
at least in the sight of Christ, as the Judge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed:
I add;</p>
            <p>1. That your attributing of Iustification to Christ,
as judge ordained over all, in the last judgement, is
contrary to the Scripture, that telleth us, that it is
one God that justifieth, it is Christ that died, marke
the distinction made; and no doubt, reason it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
us, that it is the Law and Law-giver, and
not the Judge, which define dutie, determine paines,
and condemne the transgressors, <hi>poenae enim persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
non Iudicis voluntati mandatur; sed legis authoritati
reservatur:</hi> It doth also confirm, that it appertaines
unto God only, as the Law-giver, to remit the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
incurred, and accept and justify sinners,
upon an aequipollent satisfaction.</p>
            <p>2. The Authority to execute judgement being
given to our Lord, as the Mediator; and because he
is the Son of Man, in which respect, he is not the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59845:171"/>
principal Author and efficient, but only the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
cause of our Iustification; not the very act, but
only the solemn declaration thereof, can be ascrived
to him, in this capacity; unless you can conceive,
that our Lord is not only, both the Ransome, and
the accepter thereof, but that, by becoming the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,
he also becometh the partie to be appeased,
which are palpably inconsistent.</p>
            <p>3. The plain Scripture-truth, in this point, is
that our Lord having compleatly obeyed the will of
God, and being made perfect through suffering, is
therefore highly exalted above every name, and hath
all power and judgement committed to him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
as he doth, here in time, enrich with all Grace,
guid, support, and preserve all that beleeve in him;
and also over-rule, restrain, and punish all his, and
their Adversaries; so, shal he, in the last day, appear,
first, to receive and welcome all his redeemed ones,
formerly justified by his Righteousnesse, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by his Grace, unto his Fathers joy: And then
with them, to judge the reprobate, and take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
on all, that know not God, and obey not the
Gospel: by which it is evident, that Justification pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from God, for Christs sake, and necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preceeding, both our Sanctification here, and
Glorification in the last day, cannot be referred unto
that judgement, which is only declarative and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive,
according to these words, <hi>Come ye blessed of
my Father,</hi> nor explicate, according to its scheme:
And therefore, although our Lord do therein, for
our encouragement in well doing, and the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the riches of his bountie, make mention of
our good works, and shall certainly, in that day,
also crown his own free grace in us, with a reward;
yet, thence to inferre, that our Justification before
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59845:172"/>
God, and in order to his holy justice, having for its
alone cause, the Righteousnes of Jesus Christ, and
imported in the compellation, <hi>ye blessed of my Father,</hi>
is founded, on our weak love, and scant charity
which, even the Righteous in that day, seeme asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to owne, is both a groundless error, and high
presumption.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to your next words <hi>viz. That Christ
Iesus hath proposed life through his death, to as many as
receive his Gospel and live according to it.</hi> That, this
is a manifest perversion of the free Grace of God,
whereby our Lord Jesus doth freely hold out himself
unto us, not only for to be our Righteousnesse for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
but also our Sanctification through his Spirit,
unto the glory of God; and therefore doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
our holinesse, as an antecedent condition, seing,
it is indeed his own subsequent Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, the obvious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of so clear a truth, may sufficiently confirme,
and the following argume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts do unanswerably
evince.</p>
            <p>1. Our Lords own words, the surest Rule for
understanding the proposal controverted, do contain
a free tender, and not the termes by you represented:
Hear what he saith to <hi>Nicodemus: Whosoever beleeveth
in the Son of man, shall no, perish, but have eternal life:
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
Son, that whosoever beleeveth on him, should not perish,
but have everlasting life, Iohn 3. 15, 16. Iohn</hi> addeth,
<hi>he that beleeveth on the Son, hath everlasting life,</hi> chap. 3.
v. 36. And again, our Lord sayeth, <hi>this is the work
of God, that you beleive on him, whom he hath sent: And
this is his will, that every one which seeth the Son, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth,
may have everlasting life: Verily verily I say unto
you, he that beleeveth on me, hath everlasting life. Iohn.</hi> 6.
29, 40, 47. Surely these are Gospel proposalls, yea
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59845:172"/>
the very summe and substance of its offer, whereof
your condition of a conformable life, maketh no
part: I might add <hi>Paul's</hi> words to the Jailour, <hi>believe
on the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shall be saved;</hi> but
it is so much the strain of the whole New Testament,
that it were unnecessary to enlarge.</p>
            <p>2. If when we were Enemies, and not for works
of Righteousnesse, which we have done, we were
reconciled unto God, by the death of his Son, then
the proposal of life, and Justification, is made through
faith in his Name, without the condition of these
good works, which you join with it; but so it is,
that the antecedent is plain Scripture; therefore that
the consequent is identick with it, as Justification and
Reconciliation are, cannot be denied.</p>
            <p>3. That which is the end of our Election, Calling
and Redemption by Jesus Christ, &amp; is his undertaking
for us, in that respect, and is the fruit of our faith,
and of our acceptation therethrough, yea, and is
the product of the Fathers care over us, as accepted
in the Beloved, cannot be said to be required of us as
a condition antecedent to our justification, no more
then the same thing, can be thought, to be really both
antecedent and subsequent. But so it is, that we are
chosen, and called to be holy, and <hi>created in Christ
Iesus unto good works;</hi> through faith it is, <hi>and that
not of our selves, it is the Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God,</hi> that we become
partakers of Christ, for Reconciliation, and of all
his graces for Sanctification; and lastly we are in him,
Gods husbandrie, that we may bring forth the fruits
of righteousnesse. Therefore &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. Your requiring of good works, together with
faith, previous to our acceptance by Jesus Christ,
is an uncertain and desperat thing, in as much, as it
is evident, that unless we be first accepted of him,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59845:173"/>
and united to him, it is not possible for us to do any
thing: <hi>without me you can do nothing,</hi> are our Lords
own words. Say not that this Argument, equally mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litats
against previous faith, if we did hold faith, as it
is our act to be required as a proper potestative fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
condition of our acceptance, the objection
might be of some moment; but since we do affirme,
faith to be only the instrumental act, (to which the
word of power exciting) the Soul doth thereby lay
hold on, and close with Jesus Christ, it is thence
manifest, that immediatly, without any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requisite,
he becometh our propitiation, peace, and all.</p>
            <p>5. To these may be added, that this your Doctrine
joining good works to faith, for attaining to our
Lords acceptation, subverteth the peace, taketh away
the joy of Beleevers, checketh <hi>Paul's</hi> exultation, in
his so much professed assurance of the love of God in
Christ Jesus; and lastly, as to sinners in extremity,
called immediatly before the twelfth hour, removeth
all ground of hope; but I am already too full, in a
matter so clear, and so largely handled by many more
able Pens. I might here subjoin, that as your joining
of good works, as a condition with faith, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of the Gospel, is a manifest perverting of the
free grace of God, upon which these good works,
having a subsequent dependence, cannot, by any
reall antecedent influence, possibly move it; so your
turning faith, by this conjunction, to be a motive of
the same nature, and to be also respected in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a condition, is a palpable depravation of its
use, and comfort. Its true, our Divines taking the
word <hi>condition,</hi> in a large sense, as it signifieth any
thing prerequired, do ordinarily say, that faith and
faith only is the condition, on our part, of the Gospel-covenant;
but that it is not therein a condition, as a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59845:173"/>
condition doth properly and legally import: <hi>viz.</hi> that
which, though by convention only, yet hath a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
or moving influence, upon the other parties
performance, and such as works, previously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
either in the Covenant of works, or in that
of Grace (as you would have it,) certainly hath, and
can have, no other, I firmly maintain. I further
grant, that the requiring of faith, as a proper condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
doth no less exact the existence of the thing,
then if it were repute to be necessary as an instrument;
yet that it clearly changeth the office of faith, in the
new Covenant, unto that of the condition of works,
under the old; and that by respecting it as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
on our part, it doth diminish that immediat
regard, we ought to have to, and comfort, which
we derive from, Jesus Christ and his Righteousnesse,
tendered unto us to be laid hold upon, as the alone
motive and satisfaction, acceptable to God for our
Justification, cannot be denied.</p>
            <p>But I go on with your discourse, you add, <hi>And
as that which giveth us a title to the favour of God, is the
bloud of Christ; so that, which giveth us an interest in his
death, is faith, with a life conforme to the rules of the
Gospel:</hi> But passing your conjunction, and this your
third <hi>and</hi> which I am certain would require more
study, to discover therein a connexion, then you did
adhibite in the using; let me ask if the bloud of Christ
giveth us a title to the favour of God, is it not
then the sufficient, and sole price and purchase
of our Iustification, in his sight? And must not faith
its alone proper application render us accepted to the
Beloved? What then can your, <hi>So,</hi> further import,
<hi>Viz. so, that which giveth an interest in the death of Christ,
is faith, with a life conforme to the Gospel?</hi> Can you,
or any man els<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, conceive, that a man by faith alone
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59845:174"/>
in the propitiation, the bloud of Christ, should be
reconciled unto God; and yet not attain, to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Christs death, without a holy life, superad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and concurring, in the same causality? Nay,
these things are plainly inconsistent: 2. The fairest
sense that your words can bear, is that, as we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to a capacity of favour with God, by the
bloud of Christ; so, it is faith, with a life conforme
to the Gospel, that gives us an actual interest in his
Death, and thereby unto the peace of God; but seing
the result of this, in plain language, is no other then,
that our Lord, having by his own bloud ransomed
fallen and forfeited mankind, hath in liew of the
first Covenant, made with man and by him transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
proposed to us a second, adding to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a holy life, required by the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st, that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.
That this is altogether dissonant, both to
the declared love of God, and the grace revealed by
Jesus Christ, in his Gospel, any Christian may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            <p>Your next words are, <hi>And</hi> (a fourth <hi>And) the
root of this new life is a faith, which worketh by love, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth
the heart, and overcometh the world; and there
fore Iustification is ascribed unto it, in Scripture:</hi> But
pray, Sir, how is it, that faith becometh such a
fruitful root? Is it not by laying hold on Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
by which, pardon being obtained, and
we reconciled unto God, we have right unto, and
so do attain, in due time, the benefite of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Grace, which, in Christ Jesus, are <hi>yea,</hi>
and <hi>Amen?</hi> or, that the same faith, which layeth
hold on him, as our Righteousnesse in Gods sight,
doth also unite us to him, for Sanctification, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing
us, as it were in him, through the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of his grace, purifieth the heart, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59845:174"/>
the World? Or lastly, is it not, that by
faith we are brought to the bloud of Sprinkling, which
is both the bloud of atonement, that sprinkleth from
an evill Conscience; and also the Laver, which cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from all sin, and wherewith we are sanctifyed?
This being then, the Scripture account, and it being
most apparent, that Christ, through faith, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
first our Righteousnesse, for remission of sin
and Justification in Gods sight, and then our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
unto Good works; your own acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that <hi>faith is the root of this new life of holiness,</hi>
may evince, that a holy life, subsequent to faith, and
our acceptation therethrough, cannot be therewith
joined, as a condition, for our Justification. But
that which followeth in your discourse, <hi>and therefore</hi>
(i. e. because of the above enumerat frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, which it
produceth) <hi>Iustification is ascribed unto faith, in the
Scripture:</hi> is, the grossest error of all, because 1. It
directly repugnes to Scripture, clearly intimating,
that it is unto faith, as the instrument only, whereby
the Righteousnesse of Jesus Christ is unto us applyed,
that Justification is in Scripture ascrived. If we be
justifyed by the faith of Jesus Christ, and if, by the
Righteousnesse of Jesus Christ, the free gift cometh
upon all, to the Justification of life; if he be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,
through faith in his bloud; and our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
which is of God by faith, are you not
affrayed to say, that Justification, requiring a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie
righteousnesse, is ascrived to faith, because
of its poor, and imperfect fruits in us, and thereby
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light and vilipend the perfect Righteousnesse of
Christ, the immediat object, whereon it layeth hold,
and our only acceptation in Gods sight? 2. Because
this your error derogates from Divine justice. We have
already heard you call Justification <hi>a legal or judicial
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59845:175"/>
act,</hi> and consequently, an act, wherein free grace
doth not more favour the lost sinner, then justice doth
regard a valuable ransome and surety: If Iustification
then be ascribed in Scripture to faith, this must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be understood, either as faith is in it self, or is
relative to a compleat and adequat satisfaction. Now,
to think that faith in it self, or as it is an act, or habite,
which is the Gift of God; or its fruits, which, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
that they are also the gift of God, and our dutie
as from us, are mixed with much weakness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection:
or lastly, that any thing else then the
Righteousnesse of Jesus Christ apprehended by faith,
can be commensurable to holy Iustice, is more then
redargued, by the simple proposal. 3. This your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
Iustification unto faith, in regard of a holy
life, which it produceth, doth no less detract from
the praise of the glory of the grace of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he hath made us accepted in the Beloved: Is it the
praise and commendation of this wonderful love,
and grace, that he spared not, but gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son, to be a ransome for sinners; and that it is
in the Beloved, that we are accepted and justifyed;
and should not you be ashamed to say, that it is unto
faith, as the root of a holy life, and not as it doth
respect and take hold on him, who was made to be
sin for us, and knew no sin, that we might be made
the Righteousnesse of God in him, that Iustification is
in Scripture ascrived? 4. This your error, as it is
contrary to the Scripture, and derogatorie to the
Righteousnesse of Christ, the Holinesse of Divine
justice, and the Glory of free Grace; so, it is the
manifest product of, and cannot but be a most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
temptation to, that inward and spiritual pride,
in the heart of man, of all sin the most subtilly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating,
deeply rooted, and pernicious: A price,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59845:175"/>
or something meriting, or moving, at least of our
own, is that which the natural man liketh well; nay
knoweth not how to renounce: was it not a subtile and
strange effect of this pride, and corrupt selfe? <hi>Shall
I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my
body for the sin of my soul?</hi> When as the thing required
by the Lord, <hi>was to do justly, love mercy, and walk
humbly with God.</hi> And whence did the Iews their
stumbling at the Gospel proceed? Was it not, that
they went about to establish their own righteousnesse;
and therefore, they did not submit themselves unto
the Righteousnesse of God? Say not, that this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
against you, is unwarranted: I know you tell
us, <hi>That your explanation ascribes all to Christ, through,
whom it is, that our sinnes are pardoned, our services
accepted, and grace and glory conveyed to us,</hi> But it is
evident, that these are but vain words; in as much
as, though you here tell us, that <hi>our services are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
through Christ;</hi> yet almost immediatly before,
we heard you say, that it is faith and a life conforme
to the Gospel, by way of antecedent condition, which
gives us an interest in his bloud: Now, that our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
cannot be prerequired, by way of condition,
to his acceptance of us, and also only accepted as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by us, in him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is of it self manifest. 2. Though
you should, more clearly, and consistently, ascribe
all unto Jesus Christ; yet by turning his grace into a
condition, the subtilty and folly of your pride doth
but the more bewray it self: For, as simply to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
our own good works, which in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of the most exact and confident legalist,
are both commanded and given us of God, is a proud
presumption; so, the more you attribute either the
strength or the acceptance of performances unto the
grace of God in Christ Jesus, while, in the mean
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59845:176"/>
time, you do still arrogate them, as a condition on
the creatures part, you the more declare the folly,
but in nothing diminish the sinfulnesse, of your vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
These things need not to be illustrat: question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
who ever doth consider his lost condition, by
reason of sin and wrath, and hearkeneth unto that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Gospel-precept, <hi>deny thy self, imprimis</hi> all
self-righteousnesse, and <hi>beleeve;</hi> will find the power
thereof so deeply descending into his Soul, that all
the desire, trust, and hope thereof, will be fixed
on Jesus Christ alone, and to be found in him, not
having his own righteousnesse, which unto his sincere
reflection, will be so far from appearing a condition,
that it will disappeare as <hi>dung;</hi> but that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which is through the faith of Christ, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
which is of God by faith. But who can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
declare and regret the madnes and ingratitude
of this pride of man? Jesus Christ is made of God
unto us, Righteousnesse; and yet we will thereto
join our own, for Justification in Gods sight: He
is also made unto us Sanctification, that in Him we
may bring forth the fruits of holinesse unto the
glory of God; and the very same fruits, will we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriat,
to be the condition, and, as it were, the
price of our acceptance, even with himself, who is
our only acceptation, and our all. Sir, be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as they who in the sight of sin, and fear of
wrath, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee unto Christ alone, for a refuge, do finde
his Righteousness, not more sufficient, then freely
offered, to every one that willeth, for Justification
in Gods sight; so, your Doctrine, requiring both
faith and a holy life, as the previous conditions, to
give an interest in Christs Death, and ascriving Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to faith, because, forsooth, of the pitiful
fruits of our righteousnesse, and not that perfect
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59845:176"/>
Righteousnesse of Jesus Christ, which it doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
is wholly dissonant unto the method of the
Gospel, and cannot possibly attain its end. What
shall be then said of your ensuing words? <hi>Now judge,
but a little, what it is, to have a right apprehension of
things? since I have, in a few plain words, told you
that, which with much nicety, swels among you, to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes:</hi>
Really, Sir, if I may use the liberty of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering,
by you permitted: I would say, what a sad
thing is it, to have a wrong and conceited appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of things; since you have in a few involved
words, in such a manner, obscured and confounded
a plain point of truth, that notwithstanding of express
Scripture-light; yet it hath necessarily required a
great many words, clearly to unsold it. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
now to be considered the main reason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
as you shut up, so you would seem to enforce, the
opinion which we have heard: and that is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of a holy life, which you say, <hi>Your way of
Iustification, doth clearly declare; as being that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we shall be solemnly judged, justified, and absolved,
at the last day:</hi> and afterward, you add, <hi>That it may
correct the error of many carnall Christians, who love well
to hear of Salvation, by the death of Christ, provided they
be bound to do nothing themselves, that they may be saved.</hi>
'Tis answered.</p>
            <p>1. That there are many seeming Christians, who
have a name that they live and are dead, who have
and do delight in a form of knowledge, but want the
power; of whose delusion, the error which you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may be a part, is an old and true regret: And
yet the explication by you delivered, being so many
wayes unsound and peccant, as we have heard, cannot
possibly be an antidote.</p>
            <p>2. As these carnal Christians, pretending to lay
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59845:177"/>
hold on Jesus Christ for Righteousnesse, and yet
wholly neglecting the study of holiness, are, of all
men, the most sadly deceived, and most wretched
deceivers; so, your manner of Justification, dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
from the holy Iustice of God, and the perfect
Righteousnesse of Jesus Christ, flattering the natural
mans pride, to which, of all vices, we are most
prone, and seducing souls, from the free Grace of the
Gospel, cannot be less dangerous and pernicious.</p>
            <p>But 3. This your reason, for departing from Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by faith only, as encouraging to licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
is so directly the objection which the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> taketh notice of, and fully answereth, after his
having declared the truth of Justification, as by us
professed, that we are thereby exceedingly fortified:
The passage is thus, the Apostle having shewed, that
it is by the Righteousnesse of Jesus Christ, that the
free Gift cometh upon all men, to Iustification of life,
and that it is by the obedience of one, that many are
made righteous; and summing up the whole matter,
that it is grace that reigneth <hi>through Righteousnesse,
unto eternal life, by Iesus Christ our Lord;</hi> he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joineth,
<hi>What shall we say then? shall we continow in</hi>
sin <hi>that grace may abound?</hi> Seing it is not by our
works, but of free grace, through faith in the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Jesus Christ, that we are justified from sin,
shall we therefore, in as much as sin commendeth
grace, and our good works availl not, continow in
sin, that grace may abound? The plain insinuation
of what you object: Now hear the Apostles answere
both for us and himself. 1. He saveth justification by
faith only, cannot encourage to sin; because such as
do thereby, truely lay hold on Jesus Christ, partake
of his death, and are made conformable thereto:
<hi>How shall they then, that are dead to sin, live any longer
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59845:177"/>
therein?</hi> Sin may indeed remain, but that they who
through faith in his Death, are planted in the likenesse
thereof, and become as crucified with him, should
live any longer in sin, is not possible: To the same
purpose it is, that the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> saith, <hi>whosoever
is born of God doth not commit sin, and he cannot sin,
because he is born of God:</hi> And yet, if any false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender,
should therefore say, either that he cannot
transgress, or that his transgressions are no sins, and
so license himself unto wickedness, he but deceiveth
himself, and the truth is not in him. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> saith
that Justification through faith importeth a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
assurance of good works, then any thing by you
urged. The necessity of good works, which ye plead
for, is only that of a condition, strict indeed, as to
its obligation; but very uncertain, if not desperat, as
to its cause and reall existence; being previously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
unto our acceptance by, and being in, Christ,
as I have already shewed: whereas the Apostle tells
us plainly, that according to the truth of Justification,
by him and by us asserted, the necessity of good
works, is causally certain, depending upon such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
causes, that whereever true Faith is, the study
of holiness must necessarily ensue; and where this is
not, the pretense of Faith, and Justification thereby,
is but vain and groundlesse: For seing by Faith, the
only requisite, on our part, for Justification, we are
not only dead indeed with Jesus Christ unto sin, but
planted together with him, in the likeness of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and alive through him unto God, that
we also should walk in newness of life, the necessity
of holiness is evidently thereby as much assured, as
the acts of life are in their proper principle: How
can it then be alledged, that, in our way, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of holiness is less secured, then in yours? Nay,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59845:178"/>
such is the certainty of this truth, that true Faith in
Jesus Christ, is the root and principle of the new life
of holiness, that, as it is by you acknowledged; so,
I cannot but wonder, how reason could so quickly
desert you, as to think, that any necessary effect,
such as you must grant good works to be of true Faith,
can be rationally joined with its cause, in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of a condition, which your discourse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports?
If fire or life were, in any case, required as a
condition, he that should thereto join heat or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
necessarily thereon dependent, were plainly
ridiculous: I need not take notice, of what may be
objected, from these seeming Beleevers, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their profession, are said to be in Christ, and
yet for want of fruits, to be cut off; as it doth not
more militat against us, then against you, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
true faith to be alwayes fruitful; so, it
answereth it self: But 3. because by necessity, its like
that you do understand, the obligation to holiness,
as if, in your way, it were rendered more binding
and pressing, and thence would commend your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation,
as more engaging unto a holy life; I shall
not here resume, what I have already declared, <hi>viz.</hi>
1. That to press the necessity of holiness, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to our being, and acceptation, in Jesus Christ,
is vain, and fruitless. 2. That to join our imperfect
holiness, with Christs unspotted and alone sufficient
Righteousnesse, which is faiths value, is proud and
presumptuous; but rather represent these true grounds
of the necessity of holinesse, which are found in our
way, equally, yea more obliging, then all your vain
pretenses.</p>
            <p>And 1. We say with the Apostle, that the holy and
just and good Law of God remaineth in its entire
force, threatning and condemning all sin, whereever
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59845:178"/>
found; and as the poor sinner convicted, is thereby
urged to flee for refuge unto Christ, who alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth
from the wrath to come; so, he who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
Salvation, by the Death of Christ, and doth
not witness the truth of his profession, in a holy life,
is, in so farre, no less exposed to its severity and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
neither can the Beleever sinning, whatever may
be the difference of his state in Gods sight, more
pretend to the peace and favour of God, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
renewed, and faith in Christ reacted, whence
the study of holiness will undoubtedly revive and
flow; then the wicked, persisting in his impenitence:
What is then the difference betwixt you and us? You
must acknowledge, that the great obligation of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
doth descend from the Law of God; and we
grant that this holy Law continueth, in the same
force and power, against all sin (I say not sinners)
whereever found, whether in the Beleever or Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever;
so, that thereby, in our way, licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to sin must be equally excluded. If you say,
that by requiring Faith alone for Iustification, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxe
the study of holiness; I must again tell you, that
true faith in Christ Iesus, the thing which we require,
cannot be without the study of holiness: <hi>Next,</hi> if any
person should thence delude himself unto licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Holy Law of God remaining in the same
severity against it, cannot but, in our way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that high aggravation of turning the Grace of God
unto wantonnesse, is more manifest, be also more
powerful. If any man go on to urge us with the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
delusions of presumption and libertinisme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the Devil both hath, and may abuse the truth
and free grace of God, he but fighteth with the Devils
weapons, whereby mans wretched frailty is indeed
discovered; but the truth, by <hi>Paul</hi> plainly asserted
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59845:179"/>
against the like cav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions, and by us owned, not in
the least impugned: Nay, I may further affirme, that
as all error is delus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, and inductive of more; so,
where one hath been tempted to abuse the proposal of
free Grace, hundreds, through Natures pride, both
desiring, and overvaluing propriety, have stumbled
upon this your so descrived conjunction of our good
works, and fallen into that, not entire submitting unto
the Righteousness of God, and a going about to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
their own Righteousness; by which sin, the rock
of Salvation became unto the <hi>Iews</hi> a rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>2. As the Law, in the severity of its sanction,
doth still abide in force, to deterre from all sin, to
bring in and reclaime unto Iesus Christ our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and also our Sanctification; so, its more binding
Authority, derived from the greatness and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, its own holiness and perfection, are,
upon none so powerful, and in none so effectual, as
these, who, through faith, have laid hold on Christ
Iesus, for Righteousness, and therethrough alone
have attained unto peace. I need not tell you, that
true repentance, discovering the sinfulness, as well as
the guiltiness of sin, cannot but endeare holiness; and
that God appearing in Christ Iesus, in that inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
glory of his Holiness, Iustice, Love and Mercy,
and justifying us through Faith, in his Name, cannot,
but beget a deeper reverence, and a greater regard to
his will and commandments; then all the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of mount Sinai, the greatest motive to holiness
in the construction of your way. But when I consid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that <hi>Christ is the end of the Law for Righteousnesse,</hi>
and that the Law through Faith is not made void, but
more established; and therefore we are chosen, and
created in him unto holiness, and good works, to
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59845:179"/>
the Glory of God; when I observe the connexion,
that God hath established, and his word holds out,
betwixt Iustification and Sanctification: (1.) In his
purpose, <hi>Eph. 1. 4. 2 Thess.</hi> 2. 13. (2.) In his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>Ezek 36. 25, 26, 27. Micah 7. 19. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light in holiness, as well as pardon, recorded
of the Saints, in all the Scripture, specially <hi>Psal. 51.
&amp;</hi> 103. 3. (7.) In the description of lustification,
given us by <hi>Paul,</hi> in the first 6 chap. <hi>Rom.</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.
I seriously wonder, how you, or any man, can doubt,
but a holy life, both in its obligation, and also in its
performance, is, by the way of Iustification by Faith
only, molsty assured.</p>
            <p>3. In the way of Justification by faith only, not
only the obligation of the Law of God remains, in
the manner declared; but also, our Lord, for our
further encouragement unto holiness, hath graciously
intimat, that even these good works, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
in his strength, shall be, by the same grace
from which they flow, also graciously rewarded:
Wherefore the Apostle saith, <hi>That being made free
from sin, and become servants to God, we have our fruit
unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</hi> Now then,
if there be a constraint in love and gratitude, above
the perswasion of fear; and if the desire of reward be
powerful, above the apprehension of punishment,
these considerations are certainly cumulative, and,
in our way, above any thing that yours doth contain.
That I may therefore summe up this discourse, anent
the necessity of holiness: Know, that <hi>without holiness
none shall see the Lord:</hi> But hence it doth so ill follow,
that holiness by way of previous condition, is to be
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59845:180"/>
joined unto our Faith, in order to our Justification,
that on the contrary, as God hath elected us in Christ
Jesus to be holy; so, he also justifieth us through
Faith in his Name, not because we are, but that in,
and by him, we may be partakers of the glorious
riches of his free grace, in begun holiness here, and
consummat holin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss in Glory hereafter; and hereby
is our obligation unto and study of holiness, so far
from being remitted; that it is both promoved, by
the same standing fierie Law against all sin &amp; ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and strengthened, by that alsufficiency of grace,
which is in Christ Jesus for our compleating, to whom,
through Faith, we are united: And lastly, we are
bound and encouraged unto it, by all that is most
binding in the Laws Authority, and obliging in
Divine bounty. To all which, this consideration
may also be superadded; that, as the exercise of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
remaineth with us, still under the obligation of
Divine precept, and is certainly the end and effect
of our acceptation in Gods sight; so, the same being
the necessary consequence, and inseparable effect of
beleeving, and thereby becoming its most assured test,
must, upon this ground, stirre up as effectually unto
the truth and sincerity of Faith, whence it flows, and
which doth again incite to the sincere, closs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
study of holiness, by a reciprocal influence, as
your vain stating of it, as a condition in our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
doth but lamely perswade its persuite.</p>
            <p>But I hasten to the last part of your discourse, viz.
<hi>That it is upon the necessity of holiness that we shall be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
judged justified and absolved at the last day:</hi> I
cannot now enlarge upon these mistakes, that are
again by you crouded into these few words, it may
here suffice, that I tell you, that it is without all
doubt, that, on that day, all men shall be solemnly
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59845:180"/>
judged, according to the holy Law of God; and
therefore seing, <hi>by the deeds of the Law, there shal no
flesh be justifyed in his sight,</hi> The righteousness of God,
which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon
all them that beleeve, without the mixture, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of our imperfect righteousness, in the often
forementioned respect, is only thereby the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
2. Where you say, that it is upon this,
so understood, necessity of holiness, or upon our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
that we shall be, in that day, solemnly justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
and absolved; you erre, and impinge most gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
contrary to Scripture-evidence, the value of
Christs Righteousnesse, the holiness of Gods Justice,
and the glory of free Grace. as I have already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat.
I grant indeed, that, in that day, when our
Lord shal gather into one, welcome, and appear
glorious in, all Beleevers, he will also confess them
before his Father, and the holy Angels, comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
their charity and good works, and, in the
exceding riches of his bountie, reckon his own grace
in them, unto the increase of their reward; but thence
to inferre, that it is upon our holiness that we are jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed,
and absolved in Gods sight, is destitute of all
truth and reason: Nay, the very figure of that jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement,
wherever represented in Scripture, bearing,
only, in order to Beleevers, their solemne reception
and welcome from our Lord and Saviour, as such,
who are already, in him, blessed and justifyed, and
by him redeemed and sanctifyed, doth, most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and powerfully confute it.</p>
            <p>And thus, I hope, I have evidently demonstrat,
not in the language of men, or in Schoole termes,
which on purpose I have declined; but in the express
revelation of the Gospel, that, that Doctrine of
yours, which you make your N. C. only to taxe,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59845:181"/>
as singular in its phrase, and you your self do the more
commend, as being closely Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al, is in effect,
both vain and antiscriptural, in matter, as well as
expression. What you mean by preferring <hi>the stile of
the Catholick Church to Modern and Scholastical expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
under which the Doctrine of all the Reformed
Churches is unavoidably comprised, let others judge:
but as for the abuses which you mention, <hi>viz. the
presumption of such, who love to hear of Salvation by the
Death of Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> provided they be bound to do nothing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they may be saved:</hi> seing there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more engaging, and effectual unto holiness,
then that, which in Scripture termes we do assert;
<hi>viz.</hi> That we are saved, and called with an holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
not according to our works, or <hi>doings;</hi> but
according to his own purpose, and grace, given us
in Christ Jesus, the sin thereof remaineth with the
Authors, and pure and certain truth, is neither
thereby lessened, nor ought to be stumbled at: And
therefore having fully redargued the falsehood of your
Doctrine, and the vanity of all your pretenses, that
I may, once for all, vindicat this most precious and
important truth, of <hi>Iustification by Faith only,</hi> from all
calumnie; and warne all of that delusion, which you
would, very unjustly, make proper to our way; I
plainly and positively affirme, that the study of holiness
is a most necessary and indispensable dutie, unto the
justifyed Beleever, 1. By the necessity of Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
at length above declared. 2. By the necessity
of loves constraint; holiness being both amiable in
it self, and the high path way leading unto the seeing
and enjoying of God, who therein delights. 3. By
the force of fears perswasion, in regard of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
displeasure against all sin; a motive most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
perswasive to all, that are truely godly. 4. By
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59845:181"/>
the obligation of gratitude, which is indeed the cords
of a man, and cannot but powerfully engage the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
to the constant acknowledgement of God's free
love, and grace, and to walk worthy of him, who
hath delivered us from death, and called us with so
heavenly a calling. 5. For the manifestation, to our
selves, of our faith, and justifyed state, to our own
peace and comfort. 6. For the adorning of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
to the edification of others; nay, in a word, if
our felicity be in God; if glory be our desire; if free
grace be the most powerfull attractive, and sufficient
help; and if there be any dread and terror from Gods
displeasure, the study of holiness, is by the united
force of all these motives, most strongly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by the wonderful free love of God, in our
Justification, through faith in Christ Jesus, only yea
infinitly intended.</p>
            <p>In the next place, your N. C. having acquit
you of Poperie, how justly, or unjustly, I leave it
to the Reader: You make him say, <hi>but are you not,
ARMINIANS?</hi> And to that I must confess, in
the words of your N. C. you answere with so much
Legerdemain, that you are not easily discovered;
yet these few things are manifest.</p>
            <p>1. That such is the strange extent of this your lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
that it is more inclineable, and favourable to
any Sect or Partie, then Conscientious Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists:
If you deal with Papists, then all their gross
Idolatries and superstitions, yea and their horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
and Cruelties, are forgotten, and they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
hold the foundation, and only build upon it
wood, hay, and stuble: And you earnestly wish for
a <hi>temper,</hi> which, undeniable experience shews,
your partie hath endeavoured after, at the rate of a
hundred fold more condescendence, then is required
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59845:182"/>
to the appeasing of all our complaints: If <hi>Arminians,</hi>
come in your way: not one word of all these errors,
so highly injurious to the Doctrine of the certainty &amp;
immutability of Gods holy Decrees; of the freeness
and efficacie of his Grace, of the extent of the merit
of Christs Death; and to the comfortable truth of the
Saints Perseverance; nor yet of these disorders and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
wherewith, we know, they have infested
the Reformed Churches: but <hi>away with these contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
the itch of multiplying, and canvassing subtill
questions, hath proven the chief pest of the Church: It
is good to be sober-minded:</hi> And, thus, we see, they
do indeed vent, profess, and seduce, according to
their pleasure, whereas, if this <hi>your tendernesse of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and sober-mindedness,</hi> were reall, would not
the first more readily teach you, that the departing
from the simplicity, and humility of the Gospel,
hath been the visible inlet to all the wickedness, and
darknesse, at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> And
the second, that in nothing sober-mindednesse, is
more sober, then anent imposing upon such, as do really
scruple in Conscience, things that the Lord hath no
where commanded: which two, are the hinges of
most of these debates, which at present disturbe us.
Now on the other hand, how you have treated
Non-conformists, all alongs, I leave it to your
own, and every mans obvious reflection: Rebellion,
Hypocrisy, and Peevishness, you, falsely, make
their ordinary Epithets: And for your inclinations
towards them, a short look forward exhibits them
in Verse, wherein, after your approbation of the
bloud and fynings, that we have suffered, you melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
sing.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:59845:182"/>
               <l>This strange distemper doth all skill defy:</l>
               <l>Physicians hopes still falsify.</l>
               <l>But as a joint, which Gangren doth corrupt,</l>
               <l>Must be cut off, from the sound lump,</l>
               <l>Better the body grow a stump;</l>
               <l>Then by such members, banckrrupt.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And then again, lest such rigour may prove a stain
to your Christian and Catholick latitude, you add
a forbearance for us, such as it is, wherein, though
your own interest plead for a delay; yet you can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
nothing, it is only
<q>
                  <l>Till brimful be their cup;</l>
                  <l>Then chaffed justice, shall the chaff devour,</l>
                  <l>And Angel-reapers bring the Iust to Heavens floor:</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This, this, I fear, is the inside of your pretended
charity; and it but too plainly evinces, that all your
professed stretches of a faire and comprehensive Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
are, in their regard to us, but the forced pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
of your own conveniencie.</p>
            <p>2. By your opposing to the Soveraignity of God,
which the <hi>Arminian</hi> opinion doth proudly impugne,
his infinite Goodness, and Holiness, which they make
their great pretense; and declaring, that the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
of these attributes is beyond your capacity; it
is evident, by resolving this objection in the common
difficulty of the unsearcheablenesse of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
both by them and by us acknowledged, you
take part on their side; however it is not my purpose
to draw you unto debate; the Counsel o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ections, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
maketh upon this subject: Pray consider the
passage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. where the Apostle, after having
shewed, that before the children had done any good
or evil, God in his free purpose according to Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not of works, but of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that calleth, preferreth
the Younger, and passeth by the Elder, loving <hi>Iacob</hi>
but hating <hi>Esaw,</hi> to vindicate the Righteousnesse of
God, which is your stumbling, recurreth to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity,
<hi>having mercie on whom he will have mercie,
and whom he will hardening:</hi> And he is so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
with you, that the Soveraignity of God, on
the one hand, and his infinite Goodness and Holiness
on the other, are to humane capacity irreconcileable
attributes; that it is from this high Soveraignity,
that he not only deduceth the excellencies of mercy,
and illustrateth the glory of Gods power, and wrath;
but rationally answereth, the proud reply of poor
clayes carnal arguings against the Lord, its infinite
maker, and free and absolute disposer. But you say,
that <hi>you may well take his own oath for it, that he taketh
no pleasure in the death of sinners:</hi> And so you may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
very safely, if either you understand it, of the
death of sinners, simply and abstractly in it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
or with respect to his serious call, to them
to repent, and live, as the context of that passage
doth hold out; but if you would thence deny, that
God willing to shew his wrath, and to make his
power known, purposed from all eternity, to pass
by such, on whom he willeth not to shew mercy,

               </gap>s of
wrath, fitted to destruction; you directly contradict
the Apostle, and all these other Scripture-passages,
whereby God, and the Saints their rejoicings, in the
manifestation of his righteous Judgements, are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
holden out.</p>
            <p>But 3. wishing to you, and all men, much fear,
sobriety, and Scripture-simplicitie, in the Doctrine
of this high mystery of Predestination, and not urging
further the designed indifference, which, under a
faire general, you clearly go about to introduce, for
all <hi>Arminian</hi> tenents; my earnest desire is, that the
Rule, which you give for a conclusion, may indeed
both stint curiosity, and direct practice, <hi>Viz. Let none
of our good be ascribed to our selves, and none of our evill
be imputed unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You proceed to make your N. C. alledge our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
their jealousies, of this your new way; that
you ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> again appeal to, and make a boast of your

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly
searched, and shaken you, and left all to

               </gap>nt, to that
most righteous cognizance.</p>
            <p>But now, you are wearied of these your <hi>wranglings,</hi>
and therefore you resolve to leave these <hi>dry, and arid
matters,</hi> and talk a little with your N. C. on <hi>better
subjects.</hi> Sir, your resolution is just and good; only
transferre not the faults, of your vain, airie, and insipid
reasonings, upon the matters themselves by you treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
If you have foolishly and petulantly impugned,
not only the work of God, and his Covenant, in
these Lands; the Ordinances, of the Government,
Discipline, and Worship of his House; but also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to unsetle and subvert the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Justification by Faith in Christ Jesus, without
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59845:184"/>
the deeds of the Law; a sent Gospel-ministerie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
Sacraments, and Christian Liberty; And
if your N. C. pretending to be the Respondent, hath
on the other hand, manifestly betrayed the Cause, by
such a faint, ridiculous, and absurd defence, as you
were pleased to suggest, the folly of this your wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
remaineth with your self alone; the matters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
handled, as they continow still to be the firme
truths, signal blessings, and especial means given us
of God, for the declaring of his Glory, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of our Salvation, and are not by your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
in the least, prejudged; so, they are so farre
from excusing, that they greatly aggravat these je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>june
and gustless Methods, wherewith you manage
this your conference; but foreseeing this censure, you
cunningly cast in our way, the mention of <hi>better sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi>
whether with a designe thus to evade, or by
your insinuat distinction betwixt the forgoing matters,
<hi>as dry, and arid,</hi> and your subsequent speculations,
as these better things, only to be pursued, to drive
on the deceit of an irreligious indifferencie, so much
at present studied by the Adversarie, and his Emissaries,
let others Judge? Two things only I must say. 1. That
to go about to smooth the World, with the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of sublime and Seraphick attainments, and, in
the mean time, from these hights, as it were, but
really, in a convenient accommodation to every guise,
whereunto carnal ease doth invite, and outward peace
perswade, to slight, despise, and labour to relaxe
from, the conscientious observance of these ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and midses, which the Lord hath given and
appointed, as the only way, leading to himself, and
the felicity of his favour, is the most delusive appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of an Angelick light, wherewith Sathan can
possibly palliat his blackest enterprises. 2. Though
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59845:184"/>
your subsequent discourse were much more sound and
candid, both in its tenor and scope, then truely it is;
yet, therein to figure your self, to be, as it were, a
new burning, and shining light, teaching your N. C.
in such a strain, as if all of us, whom by him you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonat,
were wholly ignorant of the truth of Religion,
both in its methods, and ends; and altogether stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to its life, is visibly more disingenuous and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
then sincerely charitable: Say not that I am ill
natured, if you find these words a little more point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
its you that hath sharpened them: Nay, if I should
assume a furder confidence of boasting, in behalf of
the Lords Ministers, and the true Seekers of his face,
found amongst us, according to the measure of the
grace, which God hath distributed unto us, and even
become a fool in glorying, for the abasing of your
self-flatterie, I do neither want a just provocation,
nor a clear precedent, for my warrant. But seing there
are several things by you here proposed, which may
be for the use of edifying, to a serious and considerat
Soul, and wherein a real union would indeed prove a
most effectuall corrective, both of sinistruous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
and evill mixtures; I shall therefore wave
the direct prosecution of such discoveries, and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, that power, light, and life, which is in
true and pure Religion, may indeed end all our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
I heartily join my assent to your subsequent
discourse, with all the harmony and affection, that
truth doth allow. That some do place Religion wholly
in debates, others in external Forms, others in some
privat devotions, others in the regulation of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, and others in certain inward speculations,
and self-devised strains, are things not so strange, as
grievous; but as to know the Father, the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent, is the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:59845:185"/>
summe and substance of Religion, and Eternal life,
in which profession we are all agreed; so, it is the
power of this knowledge, descending from Christ
Jesus our Wisdom, and apprehending him, for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
Sanctification, and Redemption, which is
mostly, and most sadly wanting: If in the conduct
thereof, men were abhorring and denying themselves,
and in the acknowledgement of him, who hath called
us unto Glory, and Virtue, laying hold on these great
and precious promises, which in Christ Jesus are all
<hi>yea</hi> and <hi>amen;</hi> then, from the application of His
Righteousnesse should the peace of reconciliation,
and joy in the Holy Ghost abound; from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of his life and grace, should the Divine
seed propagat, and diffuse it self through the whole
man; and from and by this truth, and power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Believers should be transformed, into the
likeness and image of God, and rendered partakers
of the Divine Nature, by which, it is manifest,
that as Christ Jesus is the only foundation; so it is,
that in him alone, there is Salvation, <hi>neither is there
any other name under Heaven given amongst men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we must be saved:</hi> The power, as well as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
of Natures light, was long since forfeited in
<hi>Adam;</hi> and though in the succeeding Ages, God
left not himself without a witness, in that he did good,
and gave the invisible things of him, from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World, to be clearly seen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the things that are made, even his eternal
power and Godhead; yet, the ungodliness of men
still prevailing, and holding the truth in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
this weaker light, served only to render them
without excuse: 'tis true, the Patriarchs were burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and shining lights; but it was from Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
and the oracles, and promises of God, in
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59845:185"/>
which they saw Christ's day and rejoiced, and not
from natures light, that this their radiancy was deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The dawning opened by <hi>Moses,</hi> had certainly a
great splendour, and therein Christ Jesus, the end
of the Law for Righteousnesse, was very observably
held forth; but as it pleased the Lord to vail the glory
of this discovery, with many types and shadows,
not making it <hi>a great ridle,</hi> as you do unadvisedly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme;
but keeping and conducting that people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Pedagogie of that more burdensome and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
dispensation, until the fulness of the time
should come; so then it was, that he sent forth his
own Son, a light to lighten the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the
glory of his people <hi>Israel;</hi> to bless them, in
turning away every one of them, from their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities:
to turne them from darkness unto light,
and from the power of Satan unto God, that
they might receive forgiveness of sins, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
among them which are sanctifyed, by faith
that is in him: &amp; thus our Lord Jesus abolished death;
and brought life and immortality to light through
the Gospel: and the great designes thereof not lying
in that preposterous in coherent order, by you repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
are first, by proposing to us that stupendious
mysterie of the Redemption of sinners through Jesus
Christ; and proclaiming, that whosoever beleeveth
on him, shal not perish, but have everlasting life;
to reconcile us enemies, and bring us aliens, nigh
unto God; and then being thus accepted, that in the
same Lord Jesus, we may be filled with all grace, by
the Spirit of grace, to the knowledge, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of God his wonderful bountie, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable
love, his glorious holiness, his eternal
truth and faithfulness, and unto the exciting, in us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
of that ravishing and constraining love, that filial
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59845:186"/>
and perswasive fear, and that comforting and joyous
hope; which graces, more and more moulding us
into a lively conformity unto him, that loved us, and
washed us from our sins, in his own bloud, and is
become our life, our light, and our all; and thereby
causing us, to bring forth the fruite, of holiness, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
patience, brotherly love, and of all virtues, to
the praise of God, are the sweetness, excellency, and
delight of Grace, here, untill it shall be perfected
by, and swallowed up of Glory, hereafter: This,
this is the work and purpose of the Gospel. And seing,
it shall availl us nothing, to gain the whole world and
lose our own souls, it ought indeed to be the great
designe of our lives, to conforme unto it, even to
hearken unto the call of God, and by beleeving in
Christ Jesus, that we may be delivered from the wrath
to come, to labour to be fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our own righteousness, which is of the Law; but the
righteousness, which is of God by faith; that so we
may know him, and the power of his Resurrection,
and the fellowship of his sufferings, and still reaching
forth, unto these things which are before, press
toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of
God, in Christ Jesus. The way then, to purify and
save our souls, is not barely to affect a little virtue, or
morality; nay, nor yet, from our selves, without
the Mediator, to apply our mindes to God: God not
in Christ Jesus is a consuming fire, the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Glory, and Holiness, instead of deriving,
into our souls, his excellent perfections, would but
fill them with amazement and horrour: If the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
shew and figure only of this sight, was so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
even to <hi>Moses,</hi> that he said, <hi>I exceedingly fear
and quake;</hi> How do you think, that poor sinners can
approach? We are therefore, to apply onr minde unto
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59845:186"/>
God; but, only in and through Christ Jesus, that
by him, obtaining peace, and from him, grace,
we may have access, and by faith (not by speculation
only) have our hearts purified. Your precepts of
<hi>stilness and abstraction of minde, to become of a thinking
temper, and give up with passions &amp;c. and use much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
recollection:</hi> As by you proposed, for the way
to spirituality, without Jesus Christ, who is the
only true way; are but stoical dreames<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vanities: The awakened sinner, whom sin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frights,
and wrath terrifies, findeth no rest nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge;
but in Christ Jesus, and the peace, and favour
of God in him; and being in him accepted, is by his
grace purified, and made to partake of that blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
pronounced by the procurer of it, <hi>Blessed are
the pure in heart, for they shall see God:</hi> And thus with
open face, beholding as in a glass, the Glory of the
Lord, he is changed into the same image, from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to glory, untill that hereafter, he be brought to
see him, as he is, and thereby be perfected; these
are the great means, to attain to, and continue in,
converse and fellowship with God. <hi>If any man love
me,</hi> saith our Lord, <hi>he will keep my words, and the
Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and
make our abode with him:</hi> And thence, no doubt, it is
that, not only all that sweetness of the meditation of
God and his attributes, the admiration of his mercie
and love in Christ, the adoration of his excellencies,
and these soul breathings, and continual aspirings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, which you here mention, will flow in
into the soul, to its constant satisfaction, in an entire
submission and delightsome complacencie, in all Gods
wayes and actings; but also the Beleever will be
stirred up, prompted, and animat, in the holy and
pure zeal of God's Glory, to fight out the good fight
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59845:187"/>
of faith, acquit himself strenuously, in that warfare,
with the World, Sin, and Sathan; wherein now we
stand ingaged, and readily to embrace every occasion,
whereby he may approve himself unto him, who
hath so dearly loved us; and walk worthy of God,
who hath called us unto his Kingdom and Glory: but
to suppose, that a man may think himself into this
frame, or by the simple means of that Metaphorick
ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ilation, that is in meer thinking, attain to this
Divine likeness, is no less groundless, then the active
militant state of Christians, within time, is ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
by your imaginary <hi>stilness.</hi> Now, if any man
would understand, wherein the sweetness, that is to
be found in Divine converse, doth consist? The
stilness, wherewith the minde is overflowed; the
clearness of the judgement, stedfastness of the will,
and calmeness of the passions, wherein you place it,
are indeed qualities, which do highly advance a man,
unto the perfection of his nature; and the Divine
<hi>touches,</hi> that you mention, whereby the soul is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
carried unto sublimities not utterable, are also
found in the records of Christian experience: but the
only proper answere, which can be returned, is, <hi>O
tast and see, that the Lord is good!</hi> The unsearcheable
treasures of his goodness have no measure; the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of his glorious perfections, have no parallel;
the poor narrow soul, admitted unto these felicities,
by attributing unto God, the very form, essence,
and substance of all its pleasure; and magnifying him,
as its alone love, joy, and delight, hath, by these,
as by the application of whatsomever else it doth
conceive to be amiable and delectable, endeavoured
to adumbrat this Divine satisfaction: But as the
constant result of these ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ections hath been ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
and wonder; so, a forced silence in that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59845:187"/>
transport, of the Spouse her raptures, <hi>yea he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
lovely,</hi> is only its most significant period. What
part our affections and passions have, in these enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
it is not needfull to mention; certainly, God
who hath commanded, that we love him, with all
the heart, with all the soul, with all the strength,
and with all the minde, will both purify and satiat all
these capacities.</p>
            <p>As for your telling us, that <hi>sensible passions
may be very high, in an impure minde, and of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
devotion; specially in a person melancholick, a
woman, or hysterical, which may mount very high; but
doth not humble, or purify the minde.</hi> I judge it, to be
such an unsavorie and little pertinent mixture, that I
must expresse my fears, that it doth denote a minde,
in your self, little humbled, and less purified: But
that which you add, of Persons Divinely acted their
deniedness unto all things, their absolute resignation
unto, and intense delight in, and desires toward God,
as the blessed effects of the souls union with him, is
that which I rather observe. And here indeed it is,
and in your declaring self abhorrence, and abnega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and humble applications of the soul, unto Jesus
Christ, to be that strait passage, and low gate, which
is by violence to be entered, for attaining unto that
heavenly state, wherein, spiritual solaces here, and
immediat Divine enjoyments hereafter, do not only
compense and swallow up all the preceeding anguish;
but surpass all possible apprehensions of that uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
glory, that I do most heartily embrace that
saving truth, if rightly understood, of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which hitherto I have desiderat. O that
in the possession of so great a joy, and the hope of a
greater blessedness expected, we would all vigorously
set about the duties of a Christian life, not intangling
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59845:188"/>
our selves with the pollutions of this world, nor with
the affaires of this life, how to serve our own lusts
and ease, and comply with every device, and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, but enduring hardness, contradiction,
reproach, and all persecution, that we may please
him, who hath chosen us to be Souldiers! Certainly,
he whose heart is thus fixed on God, in and through
Christ Jesus, his life and actions will quickly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that he hath not only the forme, but the power
of Godliness; his rational and unconcerned contempt
of this present world, his hatred of base and debasing
lusts, his undervaluing of the things of sense, his well
squared and solid indifferencie for all conditions and
occurrents; and lastly, his love of truth, and study
of innocencie, and delight in goodness, in all his
words, and works, do evidently shew forth the love,
and fear of God, to be, as it were, the vital springs
of all his thoughts and motions, while self-denyall
emptieth, and humility vaileth him, as nothing,
and out of the world, the native and genuine lustre of
free grace in him, is thereby rendered more conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
and his light, doth the more shine, unto the
praise of God, who hath called us unto Glory and
virtue: He peaceably, and chearfully obeyeth the
publick Father of his Countrey, but only in the Lord;
he remembreth and honoureth such, who watch for
his soul, who speak unto him the word of God, of
these he is a follower, as they are of Christ, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their faith, and considering the end of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
he pursueth Charity, as the Crown of
perfection. <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father,
which is in heaven is perfect,</hi> hath not with him a more
commanding Authority, then an inviting and soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ishing
attraction: Hence it is, that as his bounty
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59845:188"/>
and beneficence toward men is prompt and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined;
so, his obedience toward God is most punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and circumspect, having respect unto all Gods
commandments, and esteeming his precepts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all things to be right, and hating every false
way; a latitude of love, and good will toward all
men, he heartily acknowledgeth, and rejoiceth in;
but a latitude of compliance with sinful courses, and
indifferency, even in the smallest matters of God,
under whatsomever pretext, he from his heart ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth.
These, indeed, are a few of the faire lines,
that compose the Christians Character, by which,
as you may see in part, wherein Christian Religion
doth consist; so, it is too too apparent, that many,
who in their vain vaunting of serene and still specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and high abstractions, do alledge the strickness
of Conscientious practices, to be but loud pretenses,
do themselves sadly and most dangerously, recede from
it. O how much is it to be desired, that not only such,
but all, would, in their secret retirements, often
review and examine their actions, that, discovering
their errors and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lings, they may be humbled and
brought, unto the renewed and more serious exercise
of repentance, stirred up by a more lively, and active
faith, to lay hold on Jesus Christ, and from him,
and by the power of his grace, quickened to new vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and alacrity, in the wayes of God! Then should
the Divine love, in Christ Jesus, inflame and elevat
the soul, and captivate the whole powers thereof,
unto these pure and free resignations, wherewith God
is well pleased; then should the power of the grace
of our Lord, mortify sin, overcome temptations,
and advance, in every thing acceptable, unto God.
And lastly, then should the offerings of our praises
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59845:189"/>
to God, for all his mercies, especially for the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
and unspeakeable Gift of Christ Jesus, ascend
with gladness, and bring back the returnes of more
grace, and joy: and our prayers and supplications,
in the name of Christ, according to the will of God,
for all things, that we may be careful in nothing,
and for all men, especially for Kings, and all that are
in Authority, that we may lead a quiet, and peaceable
life, in all Godliness and honesty, should be set forth
before him, as incense, and mount up, as the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sacrifice: And it is, from these heavenly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
and the communications of Grace, which flow
therein, that the heart is firmly fixed and strenthened,
to order and do all to the glory of God, and the
minde continually bended, by the strong applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of fear and love, to direct all its wayes, as in
his sight: And these truely are the frame, and fruits,
of inward and secret devotion. As for publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
he who considereth it, as commanded by God,
for the avowed and more solemn acknowledgement
of our dependence upon him, and testifying our union
with his Church, and that therefore, not only in
reason, but also by express precept, it is to be serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sincerely performed, with and from the heart,
and in that holy and pure manner, which he himself
hath prescribed, without the contaminating mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of mens presumptuous and vain inventions,
will certainly go unto the congregation of the Lords
people, met together in his Name, and sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
thus to seek his face, not out of custome or
formality, whereunto, of all things, the devising and
imposing of humane forms and modes do most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
delude; but, that he may, jointly with others,
cordially adore, and praise his Maker, and Redeemer,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59845:189"/>
and give, not only an external concurrence, according
to the Rule and decency of the Worship; but with
his soul, and all that is within him, will blesse his
holy Name, and joine his <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have my hearts assent, to the truth that
I find in your conclusion, my desire to God is, that
both you, and we, were by a serious, humble, and
holy practice; and not by talking only, experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the solid edification, and pleasure, that lyeth in
these heads: If this you had minded more, you and
your partie would have been farre from vexing the
Lords Church and people, in these Lands, contrary
to the Word of God, solemn Oaths and Covenants,
established Laws, sound Reason, and Policy, and the
general inclinations of all, with that grievous yoke of
wicked and pervese Prelacie, and these vain and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome
corruptions, wherewith, in all Ages, it
hath been attended: Which things, as to your own
recollected thoughts, they appear to be but extrinseck,
and of little moment; so, pray Sir, whence did they
proceed? And what have they produced? Certainly,
if either serious reflections upon all the Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
especially upon these alterations, that have
happened amongst us, since the Reformation; or a
just consideration, of the present condition, and
state of affaires, could have place; as the pride, and
avarice of corrupt Church-men, and consequently,
of the worst of men, assisted, since the rejection of
the <hi>Pope,</hi> with the same irreligious spirit, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
observed in former times, of an aspiring Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,
moving under the specious pretexts of order,
and peace, will appear to be the only spring, and
cause; so, ignorance, profanity, violence, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
will be found, the woful fruits of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59845:190"/>
But it is of the Lord, for the punishment
of our iniquities; especially, our not receiving, and
walking worthy, of the glorious Gospel, that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is farre from us, neither doth justice overtake
us, we wait for light, but behold obscurity, for
brightness, but we walk in darkness: We look for
judgement, but there is none, for salvation, but it is
farre from us. The Lord see to it, and let his Arme
bring salvation, and his name be glorified.</p>
            <p>As for the concluding complement of affection,
which you do here give your Non-conformist, and
make him to repay, at our cost, with the confession
of his former <hi>unmeasured fury,</hi> it is but too palpably
the wantonnesse of your own extravagant fancie,
wherein to looke for more truth, then you do shew
constancie in your resolution, to put a point to these
matters controverted, and never to resume them
againe, were great weaknesse. You add in words,
<hi>Let us provoke therefore one another to charity and good
works,</hi> and yet we know your practice to be, to
press your trifling conformity, and provoke the
Powers, against such, as cannot comply: We have
indeed a blessed exercise for our tongues, even with
them to bless God the Father; but since you do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
in your maligning the wayes, work, and people
of God, your mouth must, and shall be stopt, if
the small endeavours, by me used, might make you
minde the pursuance of truth more, then the study of
your so often repeated <hi>Temper,</hi> my satisfaction would
be little inferior to your advantage; but seing both
your words and works, do shew, that thou art neither
cold, nor hot; but lukewarm: I counsel the, in the
words of the great Counseller, <hi>To be Zealous therefore,
and repent: behold he standeth at the door, and knocketh,

if any man hear his voice, and open the door, he will come in
to him, and sup with him, and he with him. To him that

even as he also overcame, and is set down with his Father,
in his throne.</hi> And thus passing your preposterous post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,

DIALOGUE
Answered.</head>
            <p>SIR, Beginning this your seventh <hi>Dialogue</hi>
with your ordinary insinuations, whereof
the slender artifice, obvious to the first view,
needeth no further discovery, I only take
notice, that where your preface affirmeth
that the true reason of your consenting to the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the former <hi>Dialogues,</hi> was, <hi>That since yow had
allayed, a great deall of the heat you met with in your
<hi>N. C.</hi> upon these matters, you presumed it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the like good effect in others.</hi> It is an alledgeance
too serious to be groundless, and beyond what the
license of the fictitious form of your conferences will
allow; and therefore, since any excess of heat that
appeares in your N. C. is not ours, but purely your
own invention, your pretense of having allayed it,
doth both bewray your vanity, and shew this to be
indeed the true cause of the publication. As for the
advantages yow reckon upon, yow reckon before
your Host, reckon again, and then boast of your <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:59845:191"/>
But you would also be accou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted a Droll for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
though you say, you <hi>have only adhibite som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of that, not out of humour, but for sweetening the
transitions, according to the manner of all Dialogues;</hi>
certainly you <hi>Latitudinarians</hi> are all brave compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
spirits, Masters of all good qualities, whether
you possesse them or not, and yet I dare affirm, that
a pleasant humorist, will laugh more at this passage of
your conceitedness, then all the drolries that hitherto
you have vented.</p>
            <p>But now begins your half-proselited N. C. and
without connexion tells you, <hi>that some charge you with</hi>
Socinianisme, <hi>others with</hi> Poprie, <hi>others with</hi> Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme,
<hi>and others with</hi> Quakerisme, <hi>though as it
seems to him upon very slender grounds.</hi> Sir, what may
have moved you, after what we have heard in your
sixt Dialogue, again in this place to resume these
things to so small purpose, I do not conceive. You
shew as if you were extremly picked by such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and tell us, that <hi>you know the arts of such,
who will tell their people, that you are unsound and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teredox,
and back ther hard words, with grave nods and
ivry faces.</hi> Poor man, your passion is stirred, and I
am sorry to find you so impotent, as again to relapse
in such a childish reflection, whereas to have used it
once before was too much and unworthy of your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sure who ever are your accusers, (who
really to me are unknown,) they have too visible an
advantage, in this your weakness; and if many men
be not mistaken, no less ground of retortion in your
own scenical gesticulations, and affected grimaces.
The thing I am concerned to notice is, why being
so sharp in your resentment, are you so scant in your
purgation? You ask, <hi>if they do understand things,
who charge him with</hi> Socinianisme, <hi>who believeth that
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59845:192"/>
Christ is the eternal Son of God, and hopes for salvation
only through his blood.</hi> And I grant that these things
being truely understood and believed, as I hope you
do, are indeed the truth opposite to the <hi>Socinian</hi>
errors: But seeing you know that some <hi>Socinians</hi> do
also very easily admit, and acknowledge the same
form of words, and that the cardinal point of this
Controversie is, <hi>whether or not Iesus Christ the Son of
God, be indeed essentially &amp; naturâ Deus,</hi> according
to that Scripture, <hi>And we are in him, that is true,
even in his Son Iesus Christ, this is the true God and
eternal life.</hi> I wish you had chosen the same positive
assertion for your vindication.</p>
            <p>As for your clearing your self of <hi>Poprie</hi> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Justification, because <hi>forsooth, that you ascribe all
we receive in this life, and in that to come, to the love
and grace of God, thorough Iesus Christ.</hi> It is so far
from being a sufficient test of your orthodoxy, that
I am confident, there is scarce one understanding Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
who would not say it were a calumny, to charge
them with the contrary. Nay you your self, in your
sexth <hi>Dialogue</hi> do plainly say, that they hold the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
Jesus Christ, and expressly wave their opinion
of Justification, in the enumeration of their errors,
which in effect amounts to all by you here asserted;
however, having already at great length handled this
purpose, and not loving to vex any with odious
names, I shall only adde, that when you shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and teach, that Christ alone, is our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Peace, and that it is by the faith of Jesus
Christ, and not by the works of the Law, that we
are justified, then shall you have a good report of all
men, and of the truth itself.</p>
            <p>Next you subjoin, <hi>that we know that all that</hi> Calvin
<hi>and his followers aime at in the matter of</hi> Arminius <hi>his
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59845:192"/>
points, is that all our good be ascribed unto God, how
then can he be erroneous in this matter, who asserts that?</hi>
Sir, having already waved these debates, I shall not
now resume them, but though I have formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
and am still perswaded that this general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
rightly understood and seconded with a sincere
practice; would prove a happie antidote against the
<hi>Arminian</hi> errors; yet I am far from the opinion, that
its bare profession, which hardly any other then an
Atheist will disown, should acquit you as to sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in these controversies. Where you say that <hi>Calvin</hi>
aimed at no more, I might tell you, 1. That that
might be true, and yet he and <hi>Arminius</hi> differ in the
manner. 2. It is certain that <hi>Calvin's</hi> aim was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from Scripture-revelation, to vindicat both the
Soveraignity of God, and the deep mysterie of the
Divine counsel and decrees, from mens narrow self-devised
and presumptuous notions and apprehensions,
&amp; also more evidently to defeat the errors of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Redemption and the uncertainty of Perseverance
bottomed upon the same ground: But since <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
himself and all his followers, would be far from
denying God, to be the alone Author and fountain of
all good, what need of more words, for redarguing
such a pitiful vindication.</p>
            <p>Now follows your purgation of <hi>Quakerisme,</hi> which
I confess is plain and positive, and I am indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
(though ignorant of them) that the grounds
of that accusation, which you are ashamed to name,
are in effect ridiculous; the severity of that mode, is
no doubt too strict for yours of the Latitude: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it shall still be my wish, that its large compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
may not at least include some of the peculiar
principles of that Sect, which to the discerning of all,
that have penetrat into its deeps, you do very justly
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59845:193"/>
terme the subtilest device yet broached for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>To this you adde, but <hi>if that spirit be not the womb,
from whence all these Sects and errors have sprung amongst
us, let all that look on judge.</hi> Pray, Sir, what spirit do
you meane; that there is a <hi>chasma</hi> here is manifest,
but whether in the print, as is obvious from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or rather in your brains, as the futility of the
reasons subjoined do more evidently perswade, may
be very rationally doubted: In the mean time, if for
the better examining of your discourse, I may supply
the first, I suppose you meane, that the Presbyterian
spirit is the womb spoken of; and this you go about
to prove, because <hi>none fall to them viz.</hi> to <hi>Quakers,</hi> as I
judge, <hi>but such as were formerly most violent in their.</hi> i. e.
the Presbyterian (for all is here manck and conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral)
<hi>way.</hi> But 1. If you knew how to reason fairly,
to give your Argument a collour of probability, you
should have taken it, not from the falling away of the
most violent, which may be the issue of that excess
from the soundest profession, but from the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in whom the natural tendency of opinions is best
discerned. 2. That the more serious Presbyterians
do remain stedfast and unbrangled with these delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
is that which you dar not deny. 3. Even of
these <hi>most violent</hi> that you speak of, the number fallen
away is so few, that urged to a condescendency you
would be ashamed to reckon them. 4. Your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whatever way understood, is no more appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to Presbytery, then to Christianity; nay if such
loose reasoning, were of any moment, the thousands
of heresies, which the Christian Religion hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned,
should postpone it to <hi>Paganisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you say, <hi>though you are sure, that we are far
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nough from being</hi> Quakers, <hi>yet our principles have a
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:59845:193"/>
natural tendency that way,</hi> and for evidence, <hi>you demand,
whence, think you, have they suckt there rejecting of all forms
and order (under a pretence that the spirit is not to be
prelimited) but from your notions against Liturgies and
for extemporary heats.</hi> 'Tis answered. 1. Seing that
we disprove your imposing of Set-forms, and reject
your Liturgie from solid Scripture-grounds, as I have
already evinced, the <hi>Quakers</hi> their abuse thereof being
the same, whereby they pervert the plainest Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
signifieth nothing in your behalf. As for the
mention you make of <hi>extemporary heats;</hi> though your
profane spirit, doth not stick to mock at the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of spiritual prayer, so much practised in Scripture,
and by the people of God in all ages, under this false
character, yet I think your own vanity, may make
you blush at such a conceited repetition. 2. If I did
not love to exceed in candor, more then you do hate
calumny, I could retort to you with very good reason,
that it is not so much the very abuse of our grounds
against your Liturgies, that have deluded the <hi>Quakers</hi>
unto the rejection of all form and order, as it is the
manifest irreligion of your rigor in imposing, and
dead formality in practising of these vain inventions,
that have stumbled not only <hi>Quakers</hi> into their fancies,
but many thousands into palpable Atheisme.</p>
            <p>Next you tell us, <hi>that the liberty we take to medle in
matters too high for us, and judge of every thing, without
thinking on the reverence we owe the Church, opens a wide
door for their pretensions, to a liberty of the spirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
all modesty and humility.</hi> Really, Sir, this
arguing appeares to me so mean, that I can scarce
repete it without blushing, we have heard you fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
object, that our Ministers did labour much
to ty up the people, in an implicite faith, and here
you taxe us for the contrary excess; if you say, that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59845:194"/>
the fault here mentioned might be true of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and your former challenge hold of the people,
you miss your mark, since you cannot charge our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
with that falling away which you object; but
why do I trifle? As you cannot convince our way,
either of the excessive liberty or irreverence alledged;
so it is evident, that it is only our not subjecting our
faith to your Lordly Prelacy, and complying with
every foolish device of man in the matters of God,
that moves your spleen.</p>
            <p>But you proceed to object, <hi>that our humor of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
begets that giddiness in people, that no wonder they,
being shaken from the Unity of the Church, also stagger
through unbeliefe.</hi> Thus you move every stone that you
may reach us; in former times the rigor of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
against separation, was a great clamour, and no
doubt, if you had been Prelatick in those dayes, you
would have made it a far more plausible <hi>medium</hi> for
the same conclusion. And now our constancy to the
truth once received, and most solemnly ingaged unto,
and our abhorrence of the falshood and perjury of
such, who, casting off all fear of God, and regard
to their own reputation, either as Christians or men,
have subverted the righteous and pure constitution of
this Church, usurped its name and authority, and
are turned to be persecutors of such who cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with all this wickedness, is made by you not only
a charge of separation, but exaggerat as a preparative
to the <hi>Quakers</hi> their folly. O with how much more
reason, and undeniable evidence, might the perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
lightness, and versatile falshood of your Prelats
and their adherents, who have been carried about by
every wind of tentation, be accused as the cause, not
only of the <hi>Quakers</hi> their giddiness, by you objected,
But of all that contempt and regardless indifferency,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:59845:194"/>
whereinto at present, we see Religion thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitat.</p>
            <p>Your next quarrell is, <hi>that we cherish in our followers,
a dejection of mind too much, as if Religion, which gives
a man a right to the purest joyes, should become a life of
doubting, and this,</hi> you say, <hi>introduceth a spirit of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
making way to pretended enthusiasme.</hi> Whether
or not this your challenge doth not in effect coincide
with the cavils of the profane world, and directly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
that spirit, which continually decrieth Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our melancholy and inconversable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
let every serious soul judge. It is enough for
our vindication, that we do not teach any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
then that of humble repentance, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and self-denial; this is indeed a hard work, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
in Scripture to the most bitter and grievous
mournings, nay unto death it self; and seeing the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure
of grace and glory thereupon founded, is
exceeding weighty and high, it is certainly very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that these foundations be firmly laid, and
ever the deeper the better: But as it is by the power
of the spirit of Jesus, and in the sense of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
both depressing and exalting love, that these
things are best performed, so an excess of humbling
(if not despairing) abasement in this matter, is no
just fear, and more unjustly made our reproach. As
for Religion, no question it gives a man a right to the
<hi>purest joyes,</hi> and is also even in this life, attended with
a most ravishing foretaste, and a most glorious and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
hope: but if in this our bodily estate, the
same pure excellency of the thing, and searching dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
which it makes, do by reason of the enmity
of Satan, and detestable and yet inevitable importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and warrings of the World and the Flesh, render
us necessarily obnoxious to many doubtings, fears
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59845:195"/>
and oppositions, against which we are oblidged and
by the word commanded to pray, watch, wrestle
and fight continually; do you therefore, because we
thus warn, justly accuse us, as if we made Religion
a life of doubting, let be to countenance these melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
affectations and pretended enthusiasmes? Sir,
if you were as serious in the practice, as you appear
affected in the speculations of Religion, your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the many devices of Satan, the deceitfulness
of your own heart, the uncessant oppositions of the
Flesh and Spirit, together with the oppressing and
grievous sense of a body of death and sin which doth
so easily beset, would certainly convince you, not
only that security and not doubting is the common
bane of professors, but that our brightest shinings of
joy in time, are after the saddest shours of mourning,
that the most relishing wine of our consolation is
made of the water of Repentance, that it is from the
seed of teares, that the harvest of our joy groweth;
nay that our blessedness here is in a manner wrapped
up in <hi>mourning,</hi> and that it is hereafter only that we
are to look for the times of refreshing when we shall
be fully comforted: But the Lord grant your more
reall and solid dejections, and deliver you from the
vanity of an airy imagination which both in it self
doth bend to, and is frequently in righteousness plagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by these enthusiasmes, wherewith you do reproach
us. And thus all men may see, how unjustly we are
by you blamed, for the progress that <hi>Quakerism</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
amongst us; and how directly, not only that,
but most of the irreligion and profanity of these dayes,
is chargeable upon your way. To this vindication I
could further subjoin a very significant testimony <hi>viz.</hi>
How that <hi>King Iames,</hi> in his <hi>first</hi> and more innocent
years, did make his boast of the constitution of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59845:195"/>
government, as the most effectual bulwark
against error and heresie, but the certainty of this
truth needeth no such support. For your insinuation
of piety and love here subjoined, we have so often
found the most keen arrowes of your calumny dipped
in this oyntment, that I think you oblidged to my ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
when I pass it as one of your poor sweetening
transitions.</p>
            <p>In the next place you license your N. C. To
characterize you freely, to the effect that, seeing you
are resolved to let him prove nothing, even what is
truth in his charge may be construed prejudice: but
seeing it hath been my endeavour, so to draw and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in vive collours, that naming would appeare super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
I need not prosecute such a representation.
As for the answere you return of your brave temper
against reproach, <hi>Apostolick firmness</hi> against all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
your pure anger without sin, and more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
goodness even to die for your hating traducers,
it were folly in me to question the truth, where sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
alone would be an incredible happiness; but
seeing these elogies are the smoak you cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at, I grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
you not.</p>
            <p>You go on, and truly I beleeve with no less can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
to class us, in some sober and modest, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sour, heady, uncharitable and unsociable:
and for the <hi>first,</hi> yow honour them, great civility,
&amp; honour them the more, <hi>for their first founder Calvin,</hi>
great wit, and then lest this be taken for a jeer, you
tell us <hi>that the first being ever Presoytery had, was in
Calvin's brain;</hi> and this <hi>you assure,</hi> a great evidence
indeed; and verily whether your civility, wit, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
be the greater, it were hard to determine;
only as it must be an extraordinary complement, to
which a scoffing jest doth make an accession, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59845:196"/>
jest, to which falshood gives the point,
and an extraordinary falshood which both the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the practice of the first and purest times of the
Church, and the more judicious and ingenuous of
your own partie do redargue; so questionless in all
the three you are eminently singular.</p>
            <p>Now for the second Class of us, which you make
to consist of narrow headed, hot brain'd, crosse grain'd
<hi>Fanaticks,</hi> you must be licensed to use them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely;
and with all my heart use such as you please,
only use the whole party and their cause truly, and
then I am confident this member of your distinction,
will be found but a groundless malicious forgery;
but to confirm it, you remember a passage of one of
our Preachers, allowing Sharpness in defence of the
Truth, and to check the proud conceit of Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and though it arise most natively from the words,
and be clearly verifiable in all times and occasions; yet,
loving to rake in our former divisions, you will have
it to be directed against the <hi>insolence,</hi> forsooth, <hi>of
the then protesting partie,</hi> and to serve as a complete
apology for any sharpness you have used: But, Sir,
as you cannot subsume in the termes of that doctrine,
either upon your own defense of the Truth, or upon
our proud conceit, and consequently do fall short of
your designed apology; so your reflecting upon these
differences, wherein you are nothing concerned,
being plainly intended for the disgracing of the whole
party, doth far more discover your malice, then our
infirmities: and therefore to use the words of the
Text, seeing you use these of the doctrine, <hi>although
there be mockers with us, and our eye doth continow in
their provocation, at which upright men may be astonied,
yet let the innocent stir up himself against the hypocrite and
the righteous hold on his way, and he that hath clean
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59845:196"/>
hands shall be stronger and stronger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next wedge which you set and drive for to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
us, is to tell the world, <hi>that our humors and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
are not chargeable upon the <hi>whole Presbyterian
party,</hi> that <hi>the English Presbyterians are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar beyond us in
moderation, as appeares from</hi> Baxter's <hi>Disputations on
Church-government, and all they desired in the late treaty,
was to be joyned with the Bishops in the exercise of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
which we refuse.</hi> 'Tis answered, what your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is of the whole party, shall not be taken from
your fraudulent insinuations, but as these are plainly
enough confuted, by your more free expressions in
other parts, particularly in your, 1. <hi>Dialogue, Pag.</hi> 6.
Where you say, <hi>Rebellion was the soul of our whole worke,
and the Covenant the bond thereof,</hi> and <hi>Dial. 4. P.</hi> 62.
where you charge both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots, with all the
blood of the late war;</hi> So these umbrages of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which you alledge, either from a particular
person his problematick disputations, or a streatch
of Accommodation, flowing in a great pressure of
necessity from men not by oath tyed with us to this
preservation of that where unto they had not actually
attained, but only to endeavour a Reformation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the sure rules therein set down, ought not to be
either a matter of stumbling, or an excuse to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
            <p>But now forgetting your distinction, with the same
breath you exhibite one of your former charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us all in these words, <hi>before the late dissorders,
all the Presbyterians in</hi> Scotland, <hi>did sit in the Courts
for Church-discipline, and why may not you aswel do the
like;</hi> And to this you make your N. C. Answere
upon the old legal establishment then standing, and
never rescinded untill the year. 1662. On purpose that
you may <hi>surprise</hi> him, as you speake, with a new
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59845:197"/>
discovery forsooth of an <hi>Act</hi> published, and printed
now 57 years ago, whereby you say, the <hi>Act.</hi> 1592.

you pretend such amazement, and do make
such exclamations upon our disingenuous forgery,
or intolerable ignorance and groundless and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
shisme, that this whole passage, saving your
reverence, doth plainly appeare to me to be but the
schareleton tricks of a pitiful impostor. For,</p>

I confess I waved this matter as not worthy the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering)
That the reason of our different practice now
in order to your meetings, from what was used for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
is plainly this, that Prelacy, being at first
introduced in this Church mostly by cunning, and a
lent procedure, our true Presbyteries were not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
discontinued, but only injuriously invaded and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
upon; of which practices, any honest Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
being free, and purging himself of all appearance
of accession, by open protestation, might very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
sit still, and serve his Master therein: but in the
late overturning, all things being carried at a far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
rate, and not only the old Presbyteries distol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

but a new foundation being laid, of the Kings
Supremacy, and all the power and jurisdiction of this
Church therein fountained, and both Bishops and the
present pretended Presbyteries, thereon founded, it
is most manifest, that your present meetings, being

by any true Minister of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>2. You make your. N. C. lay claime to a legal
establishment, as a necessary warrant to impower Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to meet in Ecclesiastick-courts, whereas you
know, that although we judge Magistrats bound to
give Christs Church the assistance and protection of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59845:197"/>
their authority and laws, yet we constantly hold the
power of assembling, as well as of Discipline, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinseck
in the Church, derived unto it from Jesus
Christ its head, and this is certainly a <hi>jus divinum,</hi>
to which all true Non-conformists do constantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here,
and which your. N. C. doth very foolishly
and weakly omit.</p>
            <p>3. The noise you make, that <hi>it is in all our mouths
that the law for Pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of meeting, and doing all other things, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

terminat, as I heard once affirmed by one of your

do abundantly elide this conceit. However I do again
tell you, that our consciences, in this matter, are

would bring you down, destroy the incorrigible, and
shew the rest the evill of there defection: but, you say, how
would we take it, if you should pray, that God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
our party, and shew us the evill of our Rebellion,
and other wicked courses.</hi> 'Tis answered, 1. Seeing
that wo shall certainly be unto all such, and they are
far from the love of God, who are incorrigible, that
God by making manifest his righteous judgments,
would glorify his own Name, and deliver his Church
from such adversaries, is a prayer clearly warranted,
both from the word, and the practice of the Saints,
nor is it in the least discordant, from that Christian
charity, whereby I am really moved, earnestly to
desire the Lord to deliver you and all both from the
thing, and its punishment. 2. That God would bring
down the proud that exalt themselves against Jesus
Christ, and give repentance to backsliders, is a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
so agreeable to the will of God, and full of love
to the persons prayed for, that I am certain, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may be said against our principles, which I remit
to the impartial discerner, yet our practice in this, as
being both tenderly Christian, and fairly consequent,
cannot but be approven. 3. Mistake not, if you should
pray for us, in the same strain, we might possibly,
and with great reason, account it an aggravation of
the evils of your other principles and practices: but
we are not so narrow, as to construe it a particular
breach of charity: Nay for my part, as I would think
it rationally consequent, so, abstracting from the
errors which it suppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, I would take it for the
greatest testimony both of your zeal toward God, and
love toward us. But if I may use a little freedome,
why do you please your self so much in vain talk?
though we hear not many of your prayers, yet, I
am sure, all know, that we want not plenty of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59845:199"/>
and instances for a retortion, in what termes soev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
you please to frame your challenge: are we so
short in memory, as not to remember how your
pulpits sounded, both in preaching and prayer, after
the late rising, and that not only against these poor
broken innocents, but in such a manner against our
whole party, as, by false and fierce accusing of all
without distinction, might almost have excused in
them the like attempt, to save from that fury that
thundered every where? If you would have any latter
and more particular instances, pray inquire after the
B. of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrew's</hi> Sermons, specially that preached
by him the 30 of Jan. 1669. and the other before the
last Parliament: you complain of the severe stile of
our prayers, he, good man, being ill satisfied, with
such soft and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rie tooles, and having passionately
fumed out a most bitter invective against our Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Ministers, not long since his brethren and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
did very agreeably close it in these words,
<hi>these are circumforaneous Demagogues, acted by a spirit,
otherwise to be cast out then by fasting and prayer.</hi> But
what need I mention your prayers, when indeed
many of your practices have most visibly been such,
as may justly make your fairest words suspected of the
deepest dissimulation. I know some of you have a
fashion of praying, that God would <hi>unite this poor
Church, and heall our breaches:</hi> But if that be all the
evidence you can bring, to shew <hi>the healing and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
spirit to be on your side.</hi> Pray tell me, why the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that may boast as much of the same
<hi>formula,</hi> may not as justly pretend to it? I might
further adde, that it appears to be no extraordinary
merit for such as are countenanced by the Powers,
and do Idolize peace and ease, to wish for an union
with any whom they apprehend to be their opposits,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59845:199"/>
and that perhaps the more sober amongst you, for all
their compliance under the tentation, yet are not so
far abandoned, as that they dare in Gods sight justifie
there defection, and pray against the party and courses,
which they know they did not desert, from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
conviction. But I have insisted too long on
so poor a subject, and I can in your own words assure
you, that we are not only ready to unite with you,
but are extremly, though not implicitly, desirous of
it; and do therefore dayly pray, that God would open
your eyes, reclaim you from your backslidings, and
grant unto us union and peace, in truth, to his glory.
This is <hi>the Accommodation,</hi> that is only desireable, if
you pursue any other, I am certain, that, however
it may be consonant to your designes, yet it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
dissonant from your pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ession; and therefore,
if we be more rational and upright, to hate all sinfull
Accomodation, and rather to wish that <hi>our differences
may stand,</hi> and be perpetuat in the behalf of truth,
then cemented by a sinful compliance, wherein are
we to be reprehended? Now that this is all that we
teach in this matter, the same books which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
to, do testify; and that it is none other, then
the very doctrine of the School of Christ, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Scripture-injunctions to the defence of, and
stedfastness in the truth, with the commands of a just
opposition to, and avoiding of every false way and its
promoters, do sufficiently evince.</p>
            <p>But you adde, <hi>Let all men judge, if there be not a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness

since you are pleased to ingage me into particular vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications,
I answer, That, seeing the plainness of
truth hath alwayes been an unsufferable bitterness to
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59845:200"/>
all perverse spirits, this your reflection doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
any special notice, if I were inclined to retort,
it were not more easie for me, then evident to say in
your own words, and <hi>let all men judge, if there be not
a subtile poisonous malice, in your few Dialogues, above
all the pretended bitterness against which you clamour:</hi>
But, seeing these Writings, that you here mention,
are not only too clearly warranted by undeniable truth,
but manifestly approven by Scripture-practice, and
almost stile, in the like cases of backsliding and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasy,
your charging them <hi>with a bitterness unsampled
in any Satire,</hi> hath a higher tendency then probably
you did advert unto.</p>
            <p>But you proceed, and <hi>what cursed doctrine is it</hi>
Naphtali <hi>broacheth, concerning private persons their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of crimes in case of the supinnesse of the Magistrat?</hi>
Pray, Sir, what is it? For really I am of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that, notwithstanding of your insinuat suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
the thing is only notour to your self. We finde
indeed, that <hi>Naphtali,</hi> respecting the order and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
of ends, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God in the first
place, the good of the whole Society, wherein the
safety of the particular members is included in the
next place, and <hi>thirdly,</hi> the maintenance of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Governours, for the procuring of these
other ends, doth accordingly determine the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and duty of Subjects; and as from this principle,
both he and many others do, in the case of intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and inevitable oppression, allow, even to the
smaller part, the right of self-defence; so, in the case
of notorious Rebellion against God, and perversion
of his righteous lawes, he, by an inference as much
stronger and clearer in this case, then in that, as the
indearing importance of the matter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Glory of
God and the salvation of souls, is greater then that of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59845:200"/>
our perishing lives and fortunes, and a manifest revolt
from God and open overturning of his work, is a
more enforcing exigence then any necessity can be
pleaded for self-defence, the principal grounds of that
privilege, proceedeth to assert, to these small or great,
few or many whom the Lord stirreth up in the ceasing
and failing of other means, the power and right of
Reformation; and thence, by way of anticipation of
an objection, he goeth on to shew, that the deed of
<hi>Phineas</hi> may not be made a cavill, and that the samine,
being only an heroick stretch of his more fervent zeal,
and not an extraordinary act by reason of any special
express warrant, may, both for encouraging unto,
and justifying the like practices, very justly be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as an imitable example: but as for your blunt and
uncautioned general, <hi>viz. that private persons may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
crimes in case of the supinness of the Magistrat,</hi> I am
confident who ever peruseth that whole passage in
<hi>Naphtali,</hi> will find it no less calumnious on your part,
then it is remote from the account that I have exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
Now, if you remain still of the opinion, that
even the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by me acknowledged for <hi>Naphta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li's,
is accursed,</hi> when you shall have answered the
reasons and Scriptures by which he confirms it, and
particularly the command given, <hi>Deut. 13. v.</hi> 12, 13,
14, 15. with the examples of <hi>Phineas</hi> executing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without legal process, <hi>Saul's</hi> souldiers rescuing
<hi>Ionathan</hi> from the Kings injustice, <hi>Elijah</hi> killing
<hi>Saul's</hi> Priests, not by any special command mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the presence of the King, without his leave,
as the King himself narrates it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19, 1. and
<hi>Azariah</hi> with fourscore valiant Priests, their resisting

his making use of that instance of <hi>Phineas,</hi> and do
think, by the inferences which you thence make, to
render the truth odious, it will not be amiss that I
enlarge a little on this subject.</p>
            <p>And first I say, that the fact of <hi>Phineas</hi> appeares to
me, not to have been extraordinary, or to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
upon any particular commission to him given,
but plainly to be such, whereunto in its then-proper
circumstances, any one of the Congregation was
equally warranted, and which in the like exigence,
hath still a laudable use for imitation. If you inquire
my reasons, there can be none more convincing, then
the Scripture account of this matter, <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Shittim,</hi>
joines himself unto <hi>Baal-peor,</hi> and the anger of the
Lord being therefore kindled, the Judges are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to slay every one his men that were joined
unto <hi>Baal-peor;</hi> yet the plague by this execution is
not stayed, and the whole Congregation are weeping
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:59845:201"/>
before the door of the Tabernacle, when, behold,
even in there sight about such an exercise, because of a
destroying plague raging in the camp, a man of <hi>Israel</hi>
in his most impudent wickedness cometh, bringing a
<hi>Midian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tish</hi> woman unto his brethren, which <hi>Phineas</hi>
perceiving, he riseth up from among the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(<hi>tanquam quilibet</hi>) taketh a javelin, and going
in after the Israelite <hi>brevi manu,</hi> in the very Act,
thrusteth both the man and the woman thorow, and
so the plague was stayed, and the Lord saith unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Phineas hath turned my wrath away from the children
of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them,
wherefore, behold, I give unto him my Covenant of peace</hi>
and thus <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. Which the Spirit of the Lord
again commemorating. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. Describeth in
these words, <hi>then stood up Phineas, and executed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so the plague was stared; and that was compted
to him for righteousnesse, unto all generations for evermore;</hi>
by which Scriptures this deed, in it self upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
agreeable unto a positive and clear command, being
represented, as proceeding, in the Author, not from
any special call from God, or command from <hi>Moses,</hi>
whereof there is not the least vestige in the Text, but
from the alone impulse of an holy and fervent Zeal,
exciting him <hi>to stand up</hi> to execute judgment, and
therefore counted to him for righteousnesse, &amp;c. If
these be not the undeniable circumstances and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a deed only in the manner heroick, and which
any person in that Congregation, acting from the same
sincere zeal of God, might without any particular
warrant have performed with equall acceptance, let
all ingenuous men judge.</p>
            <p>2. I say that whatever capacity may be attribute to
<hi>Phineas,</hi> as the son of <hi>Eleazar</hi> then high priest, (which
indeed is all we find in Scripture concerning him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59845:202"/>
this time) or upon the ground of any other
conjecture; yet the samine doth no wayes make out,
that this deed was an Act of ordinary administration,
and consequently deprives not <hi>Naphtali,</hi> of its perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
application, in as much as it is evident, that
<hi>Phineas</hi> did not do this deed, either by vertue and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the power of any Authority, wherewith possib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he might have been vested, or yet by <hi>Moses</hi> his
order, or command, but simply from the motive,
of that sincere and high measure of zeal whereby,
without waiting the command of the superior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat,
or observing a legal procedure, he was suddenly
acted in such a flagrant, and openly provoking wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse,
immediatly to interpose and execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore we see, that as nather by <hi>Moses</hi>
his command, nor by the judges there obedience, in
slaying every one his men that were guiltie, the fierce
anger of the Lord was turned away; so it was only
by <hi>Phineas</hi> his fact, as being of another nature, and
his eminent zeal appearing &amp; prompting him in such a
manner that the Lord was appeased, &amp; the plague stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And really when I observe, that it is in the readinesse
and fervor of <hi>Phineas,</hi> his zeal transporting him, as
it were, to the omission of the ordinary solemnities
of judgment, for the punishing of such a manifest and
provoking villany, that the Spirit of the Lord seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to place the high and singular praise of this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I cannot but equally admire, how that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
should either attribute it to an extraordinary
command, or account it an Act of common obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to <hi>Moses,</hi> or yet of ordinary jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>3. I say, that although in certain particular cases,
such as <hi>Abraham</hi> his stretching out his hand to slay his
Son, the <hi>Israelits</hi> there borrowing to the spoiling of
the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Samsons</hi> killing of himself with
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59845:202"/>
the <hi>Philistines,</hi> all obviously interfering with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
commands contained in the law, where an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
warrant is not recorded, the samine may, and
ought to be supposed; yet where the deed is in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
agreeable to the precept, and the apparent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of any circumstance remitigated by another
extraordinary occurrent, and where the performance
is expressly ascribed to the actors zeal or fortitude,
and not the least mention made of any special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
there, to recurre to tacite warrants, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
groundless. If this the author of the <hi>Survey</hi> had
adverted to, he could not in the pursuance of his alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
that the soveraigne God can cross ordinary
rules, and appoint some to execute his judgments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily,
wherein they are not to be followed
without the same special commission (a truth which
we do not controvert) have thereto subjoined exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
so widely different, as <hi>Moses</hi> his killing the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> which having vengeance admixed over and
above the quality of the Israelits defence, is by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
referred to an express warrant <hi>Act. 7. 24, 25.
Ehud's</hi> killing of <hi>Eglon,</hi> which on the other hand was
without all question lawful to any Israelite against
such an oppressor, <hi>Elias</hi> his destroying of the fifties
with fire from heaven, which no doubt doth not more
upon the matter require, then by its extraordinary
manner it is witnessed to have had an special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
his killing of <hi>Baal's</hi> Priests, which on the
other part I do nothing question, to have been only
a noble act of executing Gods judgment, which a
wretched uxorious Prince fearing to do, the people
themselves might lawfully have done: <hi>Abraham</hi>
going to kill <hi>Issac,</hi> which is plainly and particularly
commanded, <hi>David's</hi> ingaging in duell with <hi>Goliah</hi>
as I judge, which any in the camp of <hi>Israel</hi> might lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59845:203"/>
with the same permission have undertaken, and
lastly <hi>Samson's</hi> killing (not murthering, as he inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
speaks) of the <hi>Philistines</hi> with himself, which
for the reason above assigned did certainly proceed
upon a particular license. But the <hi>Surveyer's</hi> design in
this so inconsistent a mixture is evident, <hi>viz.</hi> that
having premised so many, part pertinent, part imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
examples to his position, he might with the
lesse observation adde the Lords stirring up of <hi>Phineas</hi>
as a suteable instance, whereas it is obvious, that the
same is not more unlike to the cases of <hi>Abraham,
Moses, Samson</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias</hi> with the fifties, then it justly qua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drats
to that other of <hi>Elias</hi> against <hi>Baal's</hi> Priests, &amp; both
this &amp; these of <hi>Ehud</hi> &amp; <hi>David,</hi> are nothing referable
to the ground he layeth down, but do plainly proceed
by vertue only of general rules taking place in there
respective exigences without the necessity (what ever
message <hi>Ehud de facto</hi> had) of any special commission.</p>
            <p>4. I say, that <hi>Phineas</hi> his fact, was indeed a stretch
beyond the line of his ordinary vocation, but so far
from importing upon this ground the necessity of a
special warrant, that as the Scripture doth clearly
impute this his transport to the rare measure of his
zeal, inflaming him in a manner to the present execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a just vengeance upon such a detestable abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
so it doth no lesse evidently hold forth how
that particular and extraordinary exigences <hi>de facto</hi>
occurring, the very common principles of duty, may,
without a special extraordinary warrant, carrie to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
performances. And thus we are arrived at the
main point, whereunto this example of <hi>Phineas</hi> is by
<hi>Naphtali</hi> applyed, and about which both the <hi>Surveyer,</hi>
and you do raise such a noise, and yet in effect the
matter doth contain no greater difficulty <hi>in thesi,</hi> then
that which is fully satisfied and removed by the most
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59845:203"/>
common and ordinary distinction of a mans calling
unto that which is proper and particular, whereunto
in the ordinary course of things, he is regularly and
commonly confined, and unto that which is general,
which not being circumscribed by any particular rule,
doth, from the common obligation of the end for
which all particular stations are institute, in the clear
exigence of an extraordinary incident according to the
general rules of righteousnesse bind, to an agreeable
practice. I know <hi>Naphtali</hi> in his tenderness to offend
for preventing of mistakes, insinuates severall distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and subdistinctions, whereby an action heroick,
and a call thereto, may be discerned from that which
properly and strictly is termed extraordinary, and its
call, and that the <hi>Surveyer</hi> in his rambling way, by
proponing the distinction of acts heroical and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
to consist in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that acts heroical do not
deviat from the common rules of vertue, but differ
only from its common acts <hi>quoad modum perfectiorem,</hi>
whereas acts extraordinary go beyond ordinary rules
and are founded upon special warrant, goes about to
impugne <hi>Naphtali</hi> in that wherein they both agree.
But seeing that all the difficulty of these distinctions, as
I have said, is very easily and plainly resolved by these
several aptitudes of a person in order to a commanded
performance, which depending upon circumstances,
may be thereby so diversified, that what in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and unperturbed condition of things would be
accounted an excesse of our particular calling and an
usurpation, in an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>aordinary occurrence becometh
a necessary duty of our general calling, and seeing the
certainty and usefulness of this distinction, according
to the continual variety of humane affaires, may be
undeniably instanced in thousands of experiences, and
particularly in that more ready then regular concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:59845:204"/>
which we see practised in the case of fire, or
any such surprising calamity, the more zealous then
orderly interposition which all men would allow to a
son, even in the presence of a righteous Magistrat, for
preventing or staying a sudden outrage intended against
his fathers person, that resentment of <hi>justus dolor,</hi>
which the common law indulges to a husband against
his wife and an adulterer found in the act in his own
house, and in many such cases, I think, I say, that these
things considered without pursuing any further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
I may from the grounds already laid down
fairly conclude, that as <hi>Phineas</hi> his fact was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
in respect of any special warrant, neither
probable nor necessary in this subject, but a pure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of that large measure of holy zeal wherewith he
was endued, and whereunto all men ought to aspire:
so there may be certain exigences of the glory of God,
which tristing with a suteable degree of the same zeall
without waiting the consent of a godly, far more
without regarding the opposition of an ungodly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat,
may, upon the general grounds and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to righteousnesse, lawfully provoke and excite
to convenient action.</p>
            <p>Now, if it be objected, that this conclusion being
only general, allowing the power, but not defining
what is the exigence requisite to its exercise, may
more readily prove a snare and an offence, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to any good purpose, It is answered 1. That
seing my undertaking was, to vindicat the Scripture
truth of <hi>Phineas</hi> his deed, recorded for our instruction,
from mens mistakes, and <hi>Naphtali</hi> from their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
if I thence rationally elicite the inference
made, the accidental hazard of mens misapplication,
flowing from their own weakness and corruption,
cannot more properly be charged upon <hi>Naphtali,</hi>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:59845:204"/>
then vpon his <hi>Surveyer;</hi> but it is in effect an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
which all are concerned to explicate. 2. I
freely acknowledge that such is the fervour of corrupt
passion, far more rapid, almost in all, then the
pure zeal of God is to be found active in any, that too
much caution, tenderness and fear, can scarce be
adhibite in a subject, wherein even the most war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
provocation of holy zeal is ordinarily atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
with such a concurrence of self-interest and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
carnal temptations, as it is impossible without the
signal assistance of the Spirit of grace, to have its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
in any notable measure or manner, without
the mixture of a sinful allay, beside the evil of ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
whereunto, it may be very readily and most
pernicio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sly drawn; and therefore seing the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
resulting from the concurrence of all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
whereupon the right dignoscing of such
deeds doth mostly depend, is oftentimes most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
and delicate, the more easie and safe course,
and best use of this whole doctrine, is rather to give
judgment upon a case of that nature, when actually
existent, and its whole contexture exposed to certain
examination, then to set down general rules directive
of such practices, But 3. As the Lord hath delivered
unto us the rules of righteousness, in themselves cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and evident, and absolutely comprehensive of all
cases incident, so he, who knoweth and doth the
same, is no doubt of a good understanding, and whose
heart is sound in the Lords statutes, walking therein
continually in fear, humility and uprightness, he
walketh surely and shall not be aehamed; <hi>The Law
of the Lord is perfect converting the soul, the testimonie of
the Lord is sure, making wise the simple, the Statutes of
the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart, the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.</hi> Here
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59845:205"/>
is the complete and fixed Rule, and who so taketh
heed thereto diligently, in faith and fear, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fitted and prepared for all ordinary duty, but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
furnished unto all good works. It is true,
that in all heroick, and more elevat acts, beside the
rule and common vertue whence it flowes, we do
find the exciting and impelling motions of the Spirit
frequently mentioned, as customary and necessary
thereto; but seing unto every righteous performance,
the assistance of grace is requisite, and the impulse and
excitation mentioned is nothing else but a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of that assisting grace, which the extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the case, and the difficulties therein occurring,
do call for, and, at most, doth only determine to
the <hi>species</hi> (as Lawyers speak) of the action; but it is
not at all its rule and warrant, the interveening of
such motions dot not alter the rule, or restrict its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
nor yet hinder the action so performed, to
be to all an imitable example. That actions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from and depending upon special antecedent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
which, for the most part, are singular in
their matter, as well as in their manner, are not to
be taken for examples, is very readily confessed: but
that an extraordinary motion, first supposing duty,
and in the next place only requisite and given because
of some uneasiness in the execution, should restrict
the duty in general to the person so gifted, when the
same or the like measure of assisting grace is rather to
be by all desired, is not at all agreeable. I say first,
supposing duty; for, that great gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts, or strong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses
are not the rule of duty either under an ordinary
or extraordinary exigence, much less do give men a
call to go beyond the rules of their calling (as the
<hi>Surveyer</hi> captiously alledgeth <hi>Naphtali</hi> to suggest) is
by me heartily conceeded, as a very important point
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59845:205"/>
for clearing the truth which I maintain: That which
only remains to be adverted to is, that although these
singular motions and impulses be indeed subsequent
&amp; subservient, both to the rule of duty, &amp; to a mans
calling resulting therefrom, and from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
wherein he is stated; yet, they seem to have
such a peculiar determining influence in these heroick
performances, as to the <hi>species</hi> of the action, that it is
not so much the particular deed, that we are to heed
for our imitation, as we are to emula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the grace and
principle of zeal, which produceth it, and is therein
so conspicuously relucent, for our upstirring to acts in
like manner, as God shall give us the opportunity.
From all which it is obvious, that as it is the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
<hi>res facti,</hi> and the assistent motion of the Lord's
Spirit, which chiefly do determine, by way of excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to the particular <hi>species</hi> of an heroick enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise;
so, it is only from the known and immoveable
Law of God, and the nature of the occasion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the samine doth take place, &amp; from which two our
calling doth proceed, that the obligation of <hi>Phineas</hi>
his deed, and of all other the like practices, doth
descend, and according whereunto they are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and in their conformity thereto be proposed
for imitation</p>
            <p>These things then being thus explained, I shall
take leave to lengthen this digression a little further,
for the removing the <hi>Surveyer</hi> his calumnies and objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against <hi>Naphtali</hi> on this point. And <hi>first,</hi> he
saith, <hi>That</hi> Naphtali <hi>by adducing the instance of</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,
<hi>for the Patrociny of such, whom he would have
esteemed, as having acted from the like warrant and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
maketh every man judge in his own privat discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to fall in hand with such practices, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
giveth leave to all or any, upon pretense, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59845:206"/>
he thinketh that Rulers have fallen into Apostasie,
by any means to cut them off.</hi> But 1. if <hi>Phineas</hi> his
fact be indeed such, and of use for imitation, as I
have already proven, the perversness of the <hi>Surveyer's</hi>
Malignity, is not so much levelled against <hi>Naphtali,</hi>
as against the very Scriptures of truth, whence his
doctrine is taken 2. Where doth <hi>Naphtali</hi> allow mens
private judgment and discretion to be their warrant in
such practices? That every man doth <hi>de facto</hi> judge,
and practise according to his own private discretion, is
indeed no more requisite to the procedure of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
agents, then, because of mans ignorance and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
it hath both in matters of this kinde, and
all other matters of truth and righteousnesse, been the
sad productive of many great inconveniences; and if,
for such inconveniences, the sure rules of truth
and righteousnesse must be altered, I am certain, as
there is nothing truth, either in natures light
or Scripture revelation, which hath, through mans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,
produced so many and so sad evils, as that of
the power of, and submission due to soveraignity,
which almost every where, and in all ages hath been
perverted unto tyranny and oppression, and, for one
instance of disorder or sedition that, can be charged
upon popular liberty, is attended with thousands of
far greater extravagancies; so the <hi>Surveyer</hi> &amp; his party
of all men ought to be most sparing in the sophistry of
such objections: but seing <hi>Naphtali</hi> alloweth no other
judges <hi>de jure,</hi> save these unerring rules, which the
Lord hath appointed, this fallacy which the <hi>Surveyer</hi>
doth continually and most foolishly beat upon, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
all his <hi>Survey,</hi> alledging still where <hi>Naph.</hi> allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
to rational men a discerning facultie, (without
which it is most certain, that nather reason nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
can subsist) that therefore he doth set up this
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59845:206"/>
judgment of discretio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to be the only dictat of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
is by that most notour and obvious distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of the last result of the practical judgment from
the fixed rule of righteousnesse, unanswerably refuted,
it being thereby manifest, that, as the former is, <hi>de
facto,</hi> the necessary interveinent <hi>medium</hi> of application
to every moral action; so, the later is that, by which,
<hi>de jure,</hi> both the judgment it self, and the action thence
ensuing, ought to be regula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and judged, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either turning the use of our discerning, unto an
implicite and stupid deference and submission, or
exauctorating the rules of righteousnesse, by a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
licentious liberty.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Surveyer</hi> urgeth <hi>Naphtali</hi> with another ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny;
and that is, <hi>That although</hi> Naphtali <hi>doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that he holdeth not such instances as that of</hi> Phineas
<hi>for regular precedents, for all times and persons; yet he
giveth no caution against the false pretense of heroical exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
it is easie to raise the divell, but not so to lay him;
if he could set down rules to bar a headie people from tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
and confusion, he would say something to satisfaction.</hi>
But 1. Is not his declaring such instances to be no regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
precedent, but restricting their imitation to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of extreme necessity, or the like manifest exigence, a
very considerable caution. 2. <hi>Naphtali</hi> doth so
plainly require, not only that the matter of the action
be just and lawful, and of it self natively and really
conducing to the glory of God, but, in an evident
necessity, formally intended by the actor from a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of holy Zeal, wrought and excited by the Lord,
with whom is the residue of the Spirit, &amp; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
breatheth upon people and persons, when and as
he listeth, that I marvel how the <hi>Surveyer</hi> was not
ashamed to contradict so clear an evidence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But if
he say all these things may be pretended, where they
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59845:207"/>
are not, and for this there is no caution given. 'Tis
answered, seing it is impossible to adhibite a better
caution against hypocritical shewes, then the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of truth, whereby they are to be tryed, and the
abuse of lying pretensions is incident unto the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
and certain duties, <hi>Naphtali,</hi> requiring truth
and reality, and not admitting mens delusions, and
imaginations, cannot be herewith justly charged; but,
the truth is, the <hi>Surveyers</hi> whole representation of
<hi>Naphtali</hi> in this matter is so foully calumnious, that,
without following him further, I shall content my
self briefly to review the objections, which he maketh
against the doctrine delivered, anent the imitableness
of <hi>Phineas</hi> his act, where finding himself caught by
Scripture-evidence, how with disjointed reasons, and
lame testimonies, he strangely tosseth and turneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for an issue, the impartial eye, in his eight particular
Answers to <hi>Naphtali</hi> subjoined, will easily discern.</p>
            <p>And. 1. He doubteth if <hi>Phineas</hi> was a private person,
and thence doth groundlesly pretend the warrant of
his ordinary calling, as to the fact controverted. 2. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from this, upon the supposition that he was a
private person, he, without any reason, insinuateth
from <hi>Moses</hi> his being present in that great assembly of
the people, and his after-approving of the deed, that
therefore it was done by his authority and command
3. He impertinently differenceth the case of Israels sin,
from that of our present backsliding, whereas (waving
the too manifest parity of our present open rebellion
against the Lord, usurping his Kingdom, changing his
ordinances, and filling the land both with the idolatry
of poperie and all leudnesse, to the then horrible ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and villanous whoredome, wherein he places
Israels sin) the main disparity of a then godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat,
is <hi>Naph.</hi> undeniable advantage. 4. He falsly,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:59845:207"/>
and inconsistently with his former grounds, alledgeth,
that <hi>Phineas</hi> acted by special commission, of which
the Scripture is not only silent, but doth very signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly
intimate the contrary, as we have heard. 5. He
foolishly cautioneth, that actions specially warranted,
are not for common rules, to which I freely adde,
that not only such, but even these, which are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
from the sole reason of their singular exigence,
are not to be drawn to common example. 6. He
needlesly quarrelleth, anent the distinction of Acts he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical
and extraordinary, and misconstruing the
Lords approbation of <hi>Phineas, Numb.</hi> 25. He plainly
wresteth the elogie. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. And that was <hi>counted
unto him for righteousnesse,</hi> as if its emphasis were not
the rare commendation of the deed, but that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it might have been imputed to him for sin, unto
an inconcludent inference of a special command and
calling. 7. He calumniously asserteth, that <hi>Naphtali</hi>
holds great gifts, and secret impulses to be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
call for men to go beyond the ordinary rules,
which God hath set to them in their callings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
all we find in <hi>Naphtali</hi> is, that joyning a zealous
excitation to the Lords command, in an exigence of
extreme necessity, he thereof, for superabundance,
maketh up a sufficient call to the heroick action there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ensuing, And. 8. And lastly, he grosly perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the question, as if any of us did affirme, that we
have warrant now to look for extraordinary persons,
having Gods special and secret mandat to do works,
which neither Reason nor Scripture do warrant, when,
on the contrary, <hi>Naph.</hi> Labours mainly, to show,
that even <hi>Phineas</hi> had no such character. Now that
these are the <hi>Surveyers</hi> reflections upon this fact of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi>
and this their successe, the perusal of his Papers
with what I have here said doth aboundantly cleare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:59845:208"/>It remains, in the next place, that I declare, how
that, as <hi>Naphtali's</hi> doctrine, here vindicated, is by
him only <hi>narrativè</hi> delivered from the records of our
first Reformation; so, the samine is there truely and
more fully to be found; and that <hi>Master Knox</hi> and our
worthy Reformers were of the same opinion, as to
the instance controverted, and from the ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
did give a resolution, in a case far more debatable,
then that of <hi>Naphlali,</hi> the following passage may
evence. In the year 1563 the Queen having emitted a
proclamation against the Mass, and yet conniving
thereat, and the Kingdom being visited by an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
death, which master <hi>Knox</hi> sayes, was for the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
of our wicked Rulers, and our ingratitude, that
suffered them again to defile the land with that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
the brethren generally offended, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to put to their own hands, and to punish, for
example to others, and so they practised on some, and
made intimation to the rest. The Queen offended here
at, sendeth for <hi>Master Knox,</hi> and dealeth with him
earnestly, to perswade the people, and principally
the Genlemen of the West, not to put to their hands
to punish papists. <hi>Master knox,</hi> on the other hand,
exhorteth her to execute justice, which, if she o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
he feared some would let the papists under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that they should not be suffered so manifestly
to offend without punishment. To this the Queen
answereth, will yow allow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>that they shall take my
sword in their hand? Now observe his reply <hi>The sword
of justice, Madam, is Gods, and is given to princes
and rulers for one end, which if they transgress, sparing
the wicked and oppressing the innocents, they, that in the
fear of God execute judgment where God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
offend not God, although Kings do it not; nather
yet sin they, that bridle kings to strike innocent men in their
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59845:208"/>
rage, the examples of</hi> Samuel <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Prophets, and</hi> Phineas, Zimri <hi>and</hi> Cozbi <hi>are
evident. And so, Madam, your Majestie may see, that
others then cheif magistrats have lawfully punished, and
may punish, the crimes that God commands to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which discourse it is evident, as the sun light, that
<hi>Naphtali</hi> in place of being the <hi>broacher</hi> of this doctrine
doth indeed come short of that, which <hi>Mr Knox</hi> hath
long since asserted; it is true, in his conclusion he saith,
others then chief Magistrats, &amp; as if meaning by infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
thereafter subjoines, that by <hi>act</hi> of Parliament po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
is given to all judges, to search and punish mass-mongers
and hearers; but seing the same is only spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with an accomodation to the then case, and that
both the grounds of <hi>Master Knox</hi> his reasoning, in this
place, and his declared opinion, in his appellation
&amp; admonition to the commonalty, <hi>viz.</hi> that the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of idolatry and such crimes, as touch the majestie
of God, doth not appertain to rulers only, but to
the body of the people, and every member thereof,
according to his vocation, and according to that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility,
which God doth minister, together with
the manifest consequence of clear reason, give no lesse
power to the people against subaltern then to subal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
against supreme magistrats,</p>
            <p>I need not hereupon enlarge, far lesse to answer the
<hi>Surveyers</hi> profane &amp; inconsistent reflections upon these
times: if the opposition then made to idolatrous and
persecuting Rulers, had been indeed <hi>sedition or rebellion</hi>
sinfully raised for some unjust cause extrinseck to the
matter of religion, by our first Reformers, as many
professors of that time were no dout too palpably
guilty <hi>of sacriledge and self-seeking,</hi> there had been
ground to have placed all into one category, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59845:209"/>
the Lords word from the sin of such instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
but seing, the then-resistance was visibly made
in the same Spirit, which, in the preceeding dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of and call to suffering, had so patiently and
constantly endured firie and bloudy trialls, for the
testimony of Jesus, and was carried on by these refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
who continually testifying against the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and self-seeking mentioned, did from clear
scripture-grounds, out of the manifest zeal of God,
and for the maintenance of his Gospel, strenuously
assert and promove these courses, it is certain, that
their testimony is very significant, adding as much
confirmation, as can be drawn from humane authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and the Surveyers alleviating thereof, by alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<hi>that our Lord was crucified by wicked hands, and
yet the result was the worlds redemption, that reprobat
ministers have saved their hearers, a leprous hand may sow
good seed, and that heirs of glory may be gotten in bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is not more impertinent from its non consequence,
these works being manifestly evil, then wickedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious
and ungrate: but behold the instability of
this double minded man, who having vented all this
foul malice, against these doings of our first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
subjoineth, let it be so, that much of their way
was justificable upon the account of these motives,
which then impelled them; yet how unlike was the
case then, to what it is now, &amp;c. Whereby it is evident,
that it is neither <hi>Naphtali's</hi> principles, nor yet his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
concerning <hi>Phineas,</hi> but the <hi>Surveyers</hi> different
present apprehension of the <hi>hypothesis</hi> &amp; consequently
the blindfolding charme of self-interest against the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

to their absurd contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having thus asserted</hi> Naphtali's <hi>doctrine against
your maligne misrepresentation, it is time that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59845:209"/>
what you objecte against him. And you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ane Casuists, you shall not find a more impious and
detestable opinion among them, then this doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
private persons their punishing of crimes, in cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of
the supinnesse of the Magistrate.</p>
            <p>But pray, Sir, 1. Wherefore do you enumerat
the <hi>Provincial Letters,</hi> so elaboratly write against
them, among other profane <hi>Casuists?</hi> This your escape,
if designed, should be a bad reward for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
pains taken against that wicked School,</p>
            <p>2. Though the assertion, as by you indefinitly laid
down, be not a little invidious; yet seeing it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable,
that <hi>Phineas</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did, neither as
Magistrats, whatever was their capacity, nor by
special warrant, punish crimes and execute judgment;
and that desperate disorders in the publick govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may, by the force of necessity, license to
private persons, specially parents and masters, this
power controverted, to affirme without exception
that the doctrine concerning private persons their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of crimes, in case of the supinness of the
Magistrate, is cursed, seemeth rather to be the
effect of passion then of reason.</p>
            <p>3. Divine impulses have been and are still casible,
and that the Lord thereby, without the giving of
any special commission, may stirre up to such an
heroick act, as though necessarily debording from
common methods, may not the less, in its whole
tract and event, be attended with so peculiar a lustre
and evidence of Gods approbation, as may even force
from you an assent, notwithstanding that the deed
can only be maintained by these general positions,
which you seeme to disprove, is to me unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And therefore, your so severe disowning,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:59845:210"/>
without any reserve, of private persons their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of crimes, in case of the supinness of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
excluding all possibility of divine excitations
to that purpose, appeareth to be very precipitant.
Are the contingencies of humane affaires, and their
surprisals and pressures such as to move Kings and

            <p>
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:59845:210"/>4. If I may come a little nearer on this subject,
wherein, I protest sincer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly, I have no designe, but
to vindicat the truth and wayes of the Lord, with all
tenderness and fear, and with all due regard to the
deceitfulness of humane passion and corruption, are
there not many suppositions casible, wherein, to
speake roundly &amp; freely in the extreme pressure either
of our own, or our neighbours interest in matter
of life or estate, both you, and I, and all others, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be our shynesse in opinion, would have a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to act many things of the same nature with, or as
important as the punishing of crimes, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
but even, in some cases, against the Magistrate:
how can we then deny the like obligation and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to the highest and most important concernment
of the glory of God, in its just and manifest exigence?
Sir, I know that the wrath of man worketh not the
righteousness of God: but, verily, when I reflect,
how that in many cases relating to self, the most part
of men, and even dissemblers in profession, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
in practice firmly perswaded, and, in
some cases, all without exception, are even in opinion
most determined, as to their right and obligation of
defence and resistance, And withall consider, that
our love, which is certainly the foundation of this
right and obligation, ought to be infinitly more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
toward God, then toward all things else, I
cannot but wish, that both the perswasion and zeal
of all men, in his matters, were accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional
to their value: But oh! who is now on the
Lords side? and who are they that aspire unto <hi>Levi's</hi>
blessing, who said unto his father and to his mother,
I have not seen him, neither did he acknowledge
his brethren, nor knew his own Children?</p>
            <p>5. Although the position be by you exhibited, in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59845:211"/>
such a laxe Manner, as if, upon the emergencie
of every crime, every private person were constitute
the Magistrats overseer and exacter of his administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that you may the better load us with your
forged absurdities; Yet <hi>Naphtali's</hi> doctrine above
declared, over and above the just exigence required,
is so clearly set down in the case only of gross and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
backsliding and defection, countinanced or
connived at by the Magistrate, wherein the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods glory, and our call to assert the same,
is far more discernable and manifest, then in the
punishing of other crimes, that, I hope, I have said
enough to cut off vain and impertinent cavillations.
It is therefore certain, that though this doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
private persons their punishing of crimes, in
case of the supinnesse of the Magistrate, in its undefin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and uncautioned latitude, may be obnoxious to
gross abuses, yet absolutely to deny the same, and
thence to condemne not only many fair scripture-examples,
but all heroick excitations, which, in their
suteable exigences, are by a clear concurrence of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
manifestly demonstrate to be from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, as to the matter warranted by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and, in their manner dependent on his sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity,
were most rigid and unjust,</p>
            <p>But you go on and tell us, <hi>that what cursed effects
this cursed doctrine produced, all the Nation saw, when
in the sight of the Sun, a villain, with a pistol, invaded
the persons of two of the fathers of the Church, and that
in the chief <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

effect, <hi>a villain, fathers of the Church, chief str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>et, roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
City,</hi> big words indeed. Sir, the way to be just
in your resentments, is first to be equal, and then
I doubt, but if you have as much respect to our
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:59845:211"/>
Lord Jesus, King over his Church, as you pretend
to your fathers of the Church, that the wrongs and
invasions by them villainously committed, with a
high and insolent hand, in the sight of all the Nations,
against his glory and prerogative, will not only make
you give to them the epithet, wherewith you
censure their invader, but account the effects of their
wickednesse a hundred-fold more accursed: But
lest I offend you by such extenuations I verily think,
all circumstances considered, &amp; their exigence due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ballanced, that the deed was rash, precipitant &amp; of
evil example; but wherefore accursed, since against
such a <hi>sacrum caput,</hi> and a person self-devoted, upon
whom and his associats, by executing justice, both
our Rulers, and the whole Land, may so certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consecrate themselves unto the Lord, that he
might bestow a blessing upon us, I confesse I hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
            <p>In the next place you adde, <hi>that though the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God sheilded one of your fathers to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ally from his
fury, and preserved the life of the other, though with the
losse</hi> (or rather disabling only) <hi>of his arm; yet his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
was not to be blamed, for that assassinations were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wanting to complete the parallel betwixt that Spirit
and the Iesuits, which is indeed the same moving in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
characters.</hi> But, seing you would appeare so
accurate an observer of Providence, why do ye
not also remember, how easily and safely the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
did escape? Surely whatever may be the moment
of these circumstances <hi>of the sight of the Sun, and the
chief street of our royal City,</hi> as to the aggravation for
which you adduce them; yet, in order to this passage
of the escape they are of a more important considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to render it remarkable. If you say that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
impunity, doth not argue innocency, the retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59845:212"/>
is so just and manifest against your reasoning
from the Bishops their providential preservation,
that I need not insist. But this was <hi>an assassination only
wanting to complete the parallel betwixt that Spirit and
the Iesuits, which is indeed the same moving in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
characters.</hi> Sir, if I did intend the patrocinie of
this fact, I could tell you. 1. That there can be
no proper assassinat, without an interveening price,
which in this case, you do not so much as alledge.
2. Admitting your meaning to be only of a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
insidiating murther, yet, I would have you to
consider, that it is from the matter, and not from
the manner that the guiltiness of many deeds, doth
principally descend: For, as we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the greatest villanies to have been sometimes
perpetrat in forme of justice, so it cannot be denyed,
that very eminent acts of righteousness have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
without any legal process, as the deed <hi>of
Phineas</hi> and the other examples above adduced, with
many such like Histories that might be alledged, do
plainly hold out; and really, when I consider but
this one <hi>viz.</hi> how <hi>Saul's</hi> murthering of the Lords
Priests, and <hi>Iehu</hi> his killing of the Priests of <hi>Baal;</hi>
as to their summare manner of procedor, of so near
alliance, nay, that this later hath plainly, in respect
of the dissimulation used, a worse appearance then the
former, I think this one reflection may direct you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a more solid judgment in thir matters. 3. The
Iesuits their mischievous plots, flowing from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
principle, enslaving mens consciences to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
compliance to their dictats, without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to forms of justice, and being levelled against
innocent persons, in order to their most wicked ends,
and designes, are not only most remote, yea most
opposite to <hi>Naphtali's</hi> doctrine, but nothing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:59845:212"/>
by this very fact wherewith you urge us.
But having above, seriously disowned this rash
and inconsiderat attempt, and already cleared, how
that it is not only the matter, but the concurrence of
circumstances, bearing such a pressing exigence, as
either cannot be satisfied by, or needeth not to attend
the ordinary course of law, which doth sustain their
more singular and heroick attempts, your paralleling
of that Spirit (of <hi>Naphtali's</hi> I suppose) so congruous
both in principles and practice, unto undeniable scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
grounds and precedents, with that perverse and
cruel one, working in the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and making them
to be the same moving in different characters, is like
unto the rest of these bold and groundless calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
wherewith you study to reproach: However,
it were to be wished, that you who, upon so unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grounds, have the confidence to draw parallels,
were upon the other hand as ingenuous, as to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these most certain and evident arguments of pride,
violence, falshood &amp; irreligion, whereby your prelatick
Spirit doth discover it self, to be not only Jesuitick,
but unquestionably Antichristian and diabolick.</p>
            <p>Now in the close, and after having made it your
work all along to brand any measure of zeal for God
to be found amongst us, with the characters of a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our, unsociable, violent and cruel disposition, you
adde, <hi>that you charge not this fact upon the party, but
acknowledge that all of them abhorre it;</hi> but yet you sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joine,
that, <hi>without all uncharitableness, you may charge
it on the Author of Naphtali:</hi> And thus having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned <hi>Naphtali,</hi> as one of their Books and
Authors, at lest owned by them, the vanity and
deceit of this your insinuation is too too palpable.
But seing that which is crooked cannot be made
streight, it shall suffice me to say, that, as I have
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59845:213"/>
evinced <hi>Naphtali's</hi> doctrine to be none other, then
the just vindication of <hi>Phineas</hi> his practice copied
from our first Reformers, and also shewed, that the
fact, which you do here objecte, hath not thereon
any rational dependence; so your particular charge,
with all the foolish clamour of your party, upon this
account, against <hi>Naphtali,</hi> doth not so much reflect
upon him, as on <hi>Phineas,</hi> and the Holy Ghost by
whom he was acted.</p>
            <p>After this, you cause your N. C. complain, of
your design, To <hi>make him regardlesse of the state of the

not that I find in your answere abstractly considered,
any error; seing it is very certain, that the wrongs
done to these most dearly affecting concernes of God's
Glory and his Churches welfare, ought not to be
more tenderly afflicting, and powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out this consistency; and is so far from being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to a holy touching grief, upon that account, that
on the other hand, you may find the necessary cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cainty
of God's Glory, the ground both of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and assurance of our Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>'s supplication, and of
the comforting answere made to his troubled soul,
whence it did proceed. But, that which I would
enquire, is how you come to make such an answere
to your N. C. challenge, which being very rational
and sound, complaining only of a stupid misregard
and profane indifferency, without the least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>exure
to the other extreame of sinful anxiety, had, in
my thought, been better and more ingenuosly
answered by a simple denial, then by your unnecessary
cautions: To oppose one truth to another can have
no innocent design: Nay, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I may use your own
<hi>maxime,</hi> that <hi>all things have two sides,</hi> I fear this
your discourse prove also double faced, and that,
under the colou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of excessive anxiety &amp; dej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
you do indeed condemn that mean of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
solicitude for Gods Glory and his Churches
wellfare, which you seem to allow, and by i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating,

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:59845:214"/>
resolve all its seriousness into the indifferency ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>But lest you judge this challenge, which is only
an anticipation, to be want of charity, I proceed to
what ensues, which is first your N. C's reply, to wit:
<hi>That all this your preceeding discourse is still contrary to
the holy men of God; the</hi> Psalms, Prophets, <hi>&amp;</hi> Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<hi>are full of sad complaints, and certainly a greater
measure of zeal becomes the more clear manifestation of the
love of God under the Gospel.</hi> And to that return which
you give to it, running out upon the difference of the
old and new dispensation, <hi>shewing</hi> forsooth, <hi>that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
desolations and losses, which under the former were
curses and grievous, under the later are pronounced
blessings and matter of joy,</hi> and so forth. What strange
dealing and doctrine is this? Your N. C. tells you
of the complainings and mournings of the holy Men
of God in old times, for the desolation of Gods
house, departing of his Glory, and the blasphemie
of his Adversaries, Which I am certain every
serious soul will take to be no other, then the same
careful regard to the Glory of God, and the good
of his Church, which just now we heard you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
and is, no doubt, inseparable from the true
Love and Zeal of God in all ages: But you, in your
present Answere, would have these regretes to be
only suteable to a carnal dispensation, and nothing
agreeing to that of the Gospel. Now, if this be not
a palpable discovery of your sinistrous design, let all
men judge: Or if you think that I do wrest your
words, do you, or any man els, make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
in any other sense, &amp; I am content to bear the
blame.</p>
            <p>But neither is this your doctrine in it selfe more
sound: You say, <hi>That outward desolations and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:59845:214"/>
were of old, signes of Gods displeasure, &amp; cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
but now they are pronounced and made blessings.</hi> Pray
Sir, make you no distinction betwixt a sign of Gods
displeasure, and a curse: Or do you think, that
sufferings and afflictions, may not be, both signs of
displeasure against sin, and yet profitable corrections,
yea matter of joyous consolation in the event? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if you had consulted Scripture in this matter,
you would have found, that, as the sufferings of
Gods People under the New Testament: are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
chastisements, and consequently signs of the
Lords displeasure against sin, which thereto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes;
so, under the Old they were no less to be by
them regarded, as the chastenings of a loving father,
and the rebukes of love: But it seems you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
the exhortation, which under both dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
speaketh unto the Lords People, as unto chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>My son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,
nor faint when thou art rebuked of him; for whom the Lord
loveth the chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth.</hi>
Nay, <hi>blessed is the man whom thou chastenest,
O Lord, and teachest out of thy law,</hi> being so plainly
said of old<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I wonder how you could lapse into thir
mistakes. I grant that the Jewish dispensation is
much countenanced by temporal promises, and that
even the manner of divine service thereby appointed,
did much depend upon their performance, Whereas
that better Covenant being established upon better
promises, is, in effect, so ordered, that afflictions
and persecutions did and do tend rather to its advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But, if thence you conclude, either that
the People of God in old times were to regard their
sufferings, as they respected themselves, differently
from what is commanded to, and commended in
Christians, or that their complaints for the corrupted
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:59845:215"/>
or suppressed Worship of God, and the departed
Glory by reason of prevailing backsliding, or outward
desolation, may not now under the Gospel, in the
like calamities, be lawfully and laudably resumed,
over and above your evil design mentioned, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
palpable ignorance.</p>
            <p>I might here further adde, that you may not only
observe the same patience and fruit of chastisements
under the old, that is found under the new dispensation,
but also read the grace and glory of their confessions
and martyrdomes, in almost the same termes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you go about to represente the sufferings under the
Gospel as new and singular. <hi>Others were tortured not
accepting deliverance, they were stoned, they were sawn
asunder, were tempted, were s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain with the sword, they
wandered about in sheep-skins, being destitute, afflicted,
tormented, of whom the world was not worthy.</hi> Pray
Sir, who were they, or wherein is this account short
of that, which you exhibite of Christians their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
in sufferings, except in the vain excess of your
superstitious festivals, <hi>viz.</hi> the dayes of the death of
Martyrs, observed by the Church under the name of
<hi>Natalitiae Mart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rum?</hi> But I have already sufficiently
demonstrate both the folly and falshood of this your
impertinent distinction: And the mixture of the cup
of Gods Children, being clearly confirmed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of all ages, your taxing of our mourning
because of a broken Covenant, a profaned Sanctuary,
and abounding wickedness and violence, as sinful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining,
because of personal sufferings, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that the joy and strength of the Lord hath
been very conspicuous in our dying Witnesses, and our
other Sufferers, doth plainly adde malice to your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:59845:215"/>But in our complainings you reprehend both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
and excess, and for injustice you tell us,
<hi>That the reason thereof is only the alteration of the Law's
and the Magistrat's denying to us further encouragement,
and punishing us not for Conscience, since none hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
because he was for Presbytery, or against Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
but for unruly humors and practices.</hi> Sir, if our
complainings and mournings, were according to their
just causes, <hi>viz.</hi> our high handed Rebellion against
God, unparalleled breach of Covenant, perjurious
subversions and alterations of the Ordinances of God,
aswel as the Laws of the Land, with the profanity,
ignorance and violence, that have thence abounded
and filled the whole Land, neither should I, or any
of the fearers of the Lord, have eyes to write or read
this my vindication. It is true, all this iniquity and
mischief is introduced and established by form of
Law, and thence you take the impudence to smooth
it over, as if there were no more in it, then the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of Laws; nay, as if what before the <hi>Act</hi> &amp;
<hi>Law</hi> made were righteously refused out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
after the accession of an humane injunction
could not be forborn, but out of humor: And as if
Conscience and Laws could not inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ere, you go on
to tell us, <hi>That the reason of our suffering is neither our
adhering to Presbytery, nor our non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> compliance with
Episcopacy, but only our unruly humors and practices.</hi>
But seing the colour of Law, which you p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etend,
is indeed no relief of conscience, but the greatest ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of that Apostacie and persecution, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we complain, and that notwithstanding of any
reproch wherewith you do slander it, the true cause
of all our sufferings is none other then our stedfastness
in the Oath of God, binding us to the maintenance
of Presbytery, and extirpation of your Prelacy. And,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59845:216"/>
lastly, seing that we bemoan no violence, either to
death, banishment, bonds or spoile, which, the
taking of your <hi>Declaration</hi> against the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
would not certainly have prevented, the witness of
our cause and sufferings, who is in Heaven, heareth,
and will reprove your lies.</p>
            <p>As for our excess, you say, <hi>We make complaints to
to God, as if Heaven and Earth were mixed, and adapt
all the lamentations of</hi> Ieremiah <hi>to our sorry matters, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the overthrow of Presbytery, to the Babylonish
captivity:</hi> But oh that the causes of our grief were
thorowly weighed, and the hainous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess of our provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
with the calamities come upon Gods House,
Ordinances and Servants, laid in the balance together;
certainly then, you should more regrete our defect,
then now you mock at our excess: And in asmuch
as sin is more grievous then judgment, and judgments
spiritual, heavier then judgments temporal, Nay,
Gospel Ordinances more precious, then these of the
old dispensation, You would judge the overthrow
of Presbytery visibly accompanied with breach of
Covenant, and the rejecting and expelling of the
Lords ministry, far more important, at least in
these respects, (whatever other aggravations there
might have been in that distress) then the <hi>Babylonish</hi>
captivity.</p>
            <p>To these objections you adde, <hi>Now, were your
way what you imagine, you should rejoice that you are
called to suffer for it, and not make such tragical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</hi>
Who ever heard such ridiculous discourse
in such a serious purpose? Your N. C. doth only
plead for a due concerning regard to the state of the
Church, and the interests of Iesus Christ, you your
self allow a fervent solicitude to God-ward, in behalf
of His Glory and the good of His People: And we
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:59845:216"/>
do not only propose for imitation the practice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Gods Servants, who, both of old &amp; of late &amp;
in all times, have from the love &amp; zeal of Gods Glory,
made the desolation of Gods Sanctuary, the corrupting
and removing of his Ordinances, with the persecutions
of his People, matter of heavy complaint, and deep
mourning, but do also, greatly rejoice in that grace
and glory, whereby the Lord hath countenanced and
beautified the tryals of particular sufferers amongst
us, no lesse then these of any other his Martyrs upon
record: And yet after you have confounded the
complainings of the Lord's People of old, for the
desolations of his Sanctuary with their concernment
in their own private losses, and falsely, and vainly
distinguished betwixt the duty and deportment of
Gods People under the old and under the new dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
in order to afflictions, you say dully, without
any connexion or regard to the mixtures of the cup of
Gods People, <hi>Our way is not what we imagine, els we
should rejoice, that we are called to suffer for it.</hi> But
the Lord, who giveth us both strength and joy in our
sufferings, doth also know and hear our mournings,
and will reprove your mocking.</p>
            <p>But you say, <hi>That our bitternesse against our enemies,
looks nothing like the mildnesse of Christ or the primitive
Sufferers.</hi> How long <hi>will you love vanity, and seek
after leasing?</hi> That we approve not bitternesse against
our persecutors upon any account, is our serious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
whereunto our practices ought to be conform:
But with all, that we hate their way, pray that they may
lay aside their opposition to the cause and people of
God, otherwise, that such troublers were even cut off,
and when God enables and calls, do stand up for the
defence of the Gospell and our selves against evill
doers, is so far from jarring with primitive prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:59845:217"/>
that both Scripture, Reason, and the practice
of all times do allow it. And really Sir, when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these your discourses, so directly tending to the
blunting nay extinguishing of all zeal for God, and
the perswading of a stupid (not patient) endurance
of all injuries, under the pretext of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,
that wickedness and violence, so much
at present prevailing, may the better be estabilished,
as I cannot but regrete this point of your conformity
to primitive examples, (not indeed these of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but of their persecutors, who in the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their wickedness did often whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and intende their cruelty to the persecuted by
their scornful reciting of the gospell precepts to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
suffering); So, I must tell you my fears,
that your pretendings to <hi>the serene</hi> and <hi>dove-like spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
are only collours to palliat your deep deceit and
malice.</p>
            <p>But making your N. C. decline your instance of
the primitive Christians with a vain scoff of your <hi>own</hi>
suggesting, <hi>that far fowls have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>air feathers,</hi> and appeal
to the practice of late Reformers, <hi>as such who univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
resisted the Magistrate, out</hi> of an exceding vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as you pretend to the same Reformers, you
do undertake <hi>from undeniable evidence of History, to
convince us of the falshood of that vulgar error, that the
Reformation was carryed on by resistance.</hi> But here,
in the entrance, you must give me leave, (though
I acknowledge that you take no advantage from it)
<hi>first</hi> to rectify your expression, that the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in many places, where opposed by force, was
maintained by resistance, Is that which we with as
plain and full an evidence as can be instanced in any
matter of fact, do very confidently assert: But that
it was <hi>carried on by resistance,</hi> Is not only inconsistent,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:59845:217"/>
               <hi>resistance</hi> sounding rather for the defence then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of any cause, or interest whatsomever) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proper import of the phrase, <hi>carrying
on,</hi> intimating force to have been the mean used
to propogat Religion, very false and caluminous.
2. I must premise that when I reflect on your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
in this place, and there with compare that of
Doctor <hi>Heylen</hi> in his <hi>Aërius redivivus,</hi> I can not but
observe the deep deceit of Sathan's contradicting
Methods for advancing one &amp; the same error: for
whereas to disprove the righteousnesse of <hi>Defensive
Armes,</hi> in behalf of Religion, you go about to show
that all the lawfull wars instanced on our part for our
assertion, had their rise from an other cause; he,
on the other hand, aiming at the same mark, is so
far from referring these wares to any other cause,
that in his fury against Presbytery, he chargeth all
home upon the Reformed protestant Churches, as
Religious rebellions, just as in an other case, <hi>viz:</hi>
for one and the same design of destroying Conscience
and making void the ordinances of God, we find the
Devill the old Serpent winding him self in courses
no less opposite: for while on the one hand <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>
standeth up for the liberty of prophesying, and
<hi>Henrie More</hi> for his liberty of Conscience; And
on the other <hi>Hobes</hi> and <hi>Parker</hi> do no less plead for the
subjection of Conscience to the Magistrat's dictates;
that both do joyntly point, though differently, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
by dissolute relaxing, and the later, by a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
blindfolding and enslaving, to make void Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and all its obligation in these matters of God,
which they would have to be Arbitrary, is evident
as the Sun's light.</p>
            <p>But passing these preliminaries, and without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prefacing upon the strange and selfe contradicting
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:59845:218"/>
Arguments, whereby you go about to make an <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable,</hi>
nay generally on all sides <hi>an undenyed</hi> truth, a
<hi>vulgar error,</hi> I come to examine your proofs. And first,
you say, <hi>The Waldenses resisted not the King of</hi> France,
<hi>as is clear in the History, notwithstanding of unparalleled
persecutions, viz. 60000. killed in one town of Beziers, &amp;
7000. Murdered at once in one Church. It is true that
there were wars betwixt the</hi> Count of Montfort <hi>&amp; the</hi>
Count of Tholouse; <hi>but</hi> Tholouse <hi>was a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er of</hi> France,
<hi>and a vassal rather then a subject, besides he only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
Montfort, <hi>who was a bloudy Emissary of the Popes,
not authorized by</hi> Philip <hi>then King of</hi> France, <hi>who only
permitted his subjects to Arme in this war. So that here
there was no resistance of subjects against their Soveraigne.</hi>
A man would think, by the reading of this passage,
that certainly all these thousands killed at <hi>Beziers,</hi> were
in a submissive non-resistance persecuted to death by
the Kings Authority, els to what purpose is their not
resisting of the King, notwithstanding of their unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled
persecutions by you mentioned? And what
can the connexion import? For, if either they were not
persecuted by the King, or not killed without resis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
it is evident, that the instance is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.
And yet it is certain, that as this execution
was indeed one of the funeste effects of the war, which
you afterwards mention, and therefore not suffered
without resistance; so, you your selfe, upon the same
consideration, do deny the King's concurrence &amp; there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
by plainly subvert the insinuation here made of their
submission, &amp; discover your own absurdity. But that I
may cleare the truth in this particular from your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
&amp; deceit; the matter of fact (as by all recorded)
Is most clear, <hi>viz.</hi> that, that time being the very hour
&amp; power of darkness, wherein all the World wondered
after the <hi>Pope,</hi> it was indeed by his instigation, and,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:59845:218"/>
in a manner, under his banner, <hi>viz.</hi> The Croisade, that
this war was raised against the <hi>Waldenses;</hi> &amp; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
by him was the Count of <hi>Montfort</hi> nominate
to the conduct thereof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and, for his better encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had, by decree of Councel, the dominions of
<hi>Tholouse</hi> gifted unto him. But as it is most apparent
that the King, who not only permitted his Subjects
to go to that war, but sent his Son to take the crosse in
it, as you your self do alledge, and also allowed of
the commission, and confirmed the Gift <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ade to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
did therein concurre; So your denying thereof
is both groundless and absurd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Groundless, because
of the deeds of his concurrence mentioned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
by all the Histories of these wars, and by
your selfe confessed; absurd, because if the King did
not concurre, the example proves not your affirmation,
<hi>viz. That the</hi> Waldenses <hi>did not resist the King of</hi> France
<hi>notwithstanding they were grievously persecuted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now before I proceed, for confirmation of what
I have said both of the King's persecution and the
<hi>Waldenses</hi> their resistance, take the following testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,

Magdeb. Cent. 13. pag. 216, &amp; 218. What then can
be more evident, then that not only these <hi>Waldenses</hi>
resisted their persecutors, though countenanced and
authorized by the King; but that even though the
King himself had been <hi>Dux belli,</hi> as his Son, by your
own relation, was <hi>belli particeps,</hi> he had met with the
same opposition. But you say, <hi>that the Count of</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse
<hi>was a Peer of</hi> France, <hi>and by</hi> Hugo Capetus <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
Peers were rather Vassals then Subjects.</hi> It is
answered, <hi>ne ultra crepidam,</hi> if Peers be Vassals, as
they are indeed, being such Peers among themselves
only, and not with the King, that therefore they are
of all the most strictly oblidged subjects, is notour to
all that know the fidelity and gratitude which Vassal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
doth import, so that whatever priviledge their
Peerage may give them over their inferiours, yet that,
in order to their Soveraign and Liedge Lord, they are
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:59845:219"/>
in every respect subjects, is uncontroverted. But why
should I spend time on your triflings? Admitting that
the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> in this war, had not so directly and
immediatly resisted the King their Soveraign, as not
being their direct and immediate Persecutor, have we
therefore no advantage from this passage? And are
there not many other precedents in the History of
that people, which do fully and exactly infer our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion?
And as to the <hi>first,</hi> do we not at least finde,
even in your own concession, the <hi>Waldenses</hi> persecute
for Religion standing to their own defence. Now if
once you allow to Religion the common priviledge
of a defensive resistance, the main strength of your
arguments, founded upon a pretended singularity in
the cause of Religion, as disowning forsooth all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
and, in a special manner, astricted to suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both by Gospell precept and primitive practice,
is thereby dissolved and removed. I may not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
on this subject: But, once for all, let me demand
you, may not Religion be defended aswell as other
rights and interests? If you say it may, but neither
that nor any other against the invasion and persecution
of the King and soveraign Power: This is indeed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent,
but so destitute of all reason, that, as there
is scarce a man in the world so stupid or debauched
by flattery, that will not, in some suppositions, grant
the lawfulness of resistance; so, the most precious
import of Religion, and the atrocity of the injuries,
whereby it useth to be persecute, can not but render
it the first and most favourable of all excepted cases.
But if you say it may not; then, whether is it your
meaning, that it may not at all be defended either
against Superior, equall, or inferior? And certainly,
the Scripture, and also many of the primitive instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
abused to prostrate Religion unto tyranny, do
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:59845:220"/>
seem to run in this latitude, without insinuating any
distinction, so that this generality, being manifestly
absurd, doth of necessity evince them to have an other
meaning, and to be nothing conclusive to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Or do you understand, that in this the cause of
Religion is singular, that though against persecuting
inferiors or equals, Religion, aswell as other rights,
doth permit defence; yet against the Powers over us,
it is subject to a special restraint. Assigne me for this
speciality but any colourable pretext, <hi>&amp; cris mihi
magnus Apollo.</hi> That the Gospel precepts, <hi>Resist not
evill, Turn your cheek to the smiter, Love your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
&amp;c. Have their holy and Christian use of patience
and godliness, for all manner of injuries from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ever
hand; And that these other commands of
<hi>subjection, non-resistance, honour, and obedience to Kings
and all in Authority,</hi> have also their righteous influence
of determining, in every occasion, our due compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and submission, without the least vestige either
in all or any of the places, of injoining a singular sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to Powers persecuting for Religion, is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
evident. What speciality you will gather from
primitive practices, the general mistakes that we find
in their opinions, as we may understand from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
and <hi>Augustine,</hi> condemning private defence
even against Robbers, <hi>ne dum salutem defendit pieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
contaminet,</hi> may give us a satisfying conjecture.
From all which we may assuredly conclude, that seing
Religion doth lay no speciall prohibition of resistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in order to Superiors, upon Subjects by them
persecuted; and that the above-written passage of the
<hi>Waldenses</hi> doth at least evince, that in other cases it
hath the common priviledge, your inferring of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al
consequences, in favours of the Powers, from
abused generalls, is but a politick improving of your
lies unto base and selfish flattery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:59845:220"/>Now as to other examples that may be found
among the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> Pray Sir, was this the only
passage in all that History, which you conceived did
favour our cause, or was you loth to follow them
over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> unto the valleys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> to meet
with instances, which indeed you have reason to think
can only be best answered by concealing them, in the
obscurities of the places where acted? And really,
this omission is so grosly supine, that you must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me to think it designed. However, the History
that I referre you to, for a full and particular account,
aswell of the faith, stedfastness and simplicicy of
these <hi>Waldenses in Piemont,</hi> as of their many and great
persecutions by their own Rulers and Princes, and
their just and frequent oppositions made against them,
particularly from the year 1540 to the year 1561.
And how in the year 1571 they entered into a League
of mutual assistance, and from that year did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
many vicissitudes, sometimes of peace and quiet,
then of cruell and barbarous persecutions, wherein
they testified great constancy and patience, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of necessary defensive resistances, wherein they
witnessed no less uprightnesse and courage, even until
the year 1658, wherein the narration terminates, is
that of the Evangelical Churches in the valleys of
<hi>Piemont,</hi> very faithfully and acuratly collected and
written by Mr <hi>Morland,</hi> Where, I am confident,
every ingenuous person will finde the case of defence,
for the cause of Religion, against persecuting Rulers,
so justly stated, so tenderly and submissively proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into, and, lastly, so singly and moderatly prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
and that not only once or twice, but often;
that as he will be thereby greatly confirmed in the
righteousness of this practice, so he can not but observe
the inexcusable omission of your silence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:59845:221"/>The next instance which you undertake to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
is <hi>that of the</hi> Bohemians <hi>under</hi> Zisca, <hi>their
fighting and resisting when the chalice was denyed them.</hi>
And for answere to this, you bid us <hi>consider, that the
Crown of</hi> Boheme <hi>is elective; in which case, certainly
the States of a Kingdom share more largely of the Soveraign
power.</hi> But 1. You hereby plainly acknowledge that
Religion is not indefendible, except by meer subjects,
against their Soveraign: So that again we see, it is
not from the cause of Religion, but from the quality
of the persons, that you foolishly go about to exclude
Religion from defence, which yet notwithstanding,
in several excepted cases, all inferior to that of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
is to subjects against their oppressing Princes
by all almost allowed. 2. That the States of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
share more largely of the soveraign Power, in
an elective, then in a successive Kingdom, hath no
proper dependence upon the way of election, but is
thereto meerly accidental, the Dictators in free <hi>Rome</hi>
were elected, and that only occasionally, and for a
short space, and yet were uncontrollable: The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire, though elective, yet gave to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
absolute Soveraignity: And, on the other
hand, we see many Kingdoms successive, wherein
nevertheless the Soveraignity is divided betwixt the
King and the Estates; so that your ground doth not
hold. As <hi>Grotius de jur. belli l. 1. c.</hi> 3. §. 11. in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of that distinction, <hi>aliud esse de re querere
aliud de modo habendi,</hi> doth fully cleare. 3. Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Crown of <hi>Boheme</hi> to be elective, which yet
you know, in the competition betwixt <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and,
<hi>Frederick,</hi> was much controverted; and that the
Estates do indeed share largely of the Soveraignity,
And further, that they were the Authors of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
which also you ought to have alledged; yet
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:59845:221"/>
the opposition by them authorized upon the denying
and with holding of the Chalice, and undertaken upon
the common and just grounds of defence, considering
the participation of power, which our Estates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Majesties restitution did constantly acclaim,
and oftentimes by themselves exercise, this similitude
of the cases doth only the more assimilate this instance
to that of our last Reformation. 4. Although the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi>
being numerous in <hi>Bohem,</hi> and their provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
very injurious and intolerable, the success of
<hi>Zisca,</hi> their Chieftain, did in a little time draw the
whole Estates of the Kingdom to appeare on that
side; yet it is apparent from History, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of these troubles were so far from being au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by the Estates, that they were rather occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional,
and, as it were, tumultuary, upon the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of some <hi>Hussites</hi> in the town of <hi>Prague</hi> to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brat
the Lords Supper with their accustomed solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
which the <hi>Hussites</hi> by force resisting, it was
from this spark that the flame kindling, the party
became to be headed by <hi>Zisca;</hi> and he and they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
breaking down Images, and dissipating
Cloisters, until at length he contracted a just Army,
and strenuously stood to his defence, and thereby
obtained the concurrence of the Estates against <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
then both Emperour, and upon <hi>Venceslaus</hi> his
death, become King of <hi>Boheme:</hi> Now whether this
was not a clear resistance of the people, begun at least
without the States, against their Soveraign, upon
the account of Religion, I remit it to your second
thoughts.</p>
            <p>But you say, <hi>that</hi> Comenius <hi>gives but a slender cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of</hi> Zisca <hi>and his business, extolling him chiefly as
a good souldier.</hi> And, I pray Sir, what would you
have him to say more? beside that it is not <hi>Comenius</hi>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:59845:222"/>
his testimony, but the practice of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi>
which upon your own appeal, we are concerned to
notice.</p>
            <p>In the next place you tell us, <hi>That the Iustifiers of
the late</hi> Bohemian <hi>wars never run upon this strain of
subjects resisting their Soveraign, upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but upon the laws and liberties of that elective
Kingdom.</hi> I intreat you, Sir, to consider what you say,
That the injuries provoking to that war, were the
invasions made upon the Liberties of Religion, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
confirmed by <hi>Maximilianus</hi> and <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> is
notour and manifest: Now, if in this case they did
aggravate the wrong, not only from that liberty,
which is every where due to truth, but from these
royal concessions thereto superadded, certainly this
can make no disparity to our prejudice. But if you
mean that these Resisters had not only law for them,
as to the making out of the wrongs which they
suffered, but were in a legal capacity, as being the
States of the Kingdom, to resist the invasions of their
Prince, I have already told you how much this,
if it were true, would make for and not against us.
2. You must consider, that the opposition, which
gave the immediat occasion to the war 1618. and
the war thereon ensuing, did proceed from, and
was carried on only by the <hi>Religionis Bohemicae socii Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines,</hi>
and not by the whole <hi>Ordines Regni,</hi> which
were <hi>partim P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntificii, partim Religionis Bohemicae.</hi>
So that the share, which the Estates of the Kingdom
had of the Soveraignity, in this case, doth not assist
you. I grant, that the <hi>Ordines Religionis Bohemicae,</hi>
at first prevailing, seem thereafter to have attained to
the whole power, and so to have proceeded to the
election of <hi>Frederick.</hi> But the lawfulness of his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not now the point in question.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:59845:222"/>You add, <hi>Neither were the Protestants too well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the last</hi> Bohemian <hi>businesse.</hi> And it is very like,
that the briskness of the first assaul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon the King's
Counsellers, with other miscarriages in the progress of
that businesse, might possibly offend; but can you
thence infer, that either these defensive wars were not
undertaken for Religion, or that on this account, the
Protestants did dislike them? As for what you subjoin,
<hi>Yea K.</hi> James <hi>notwithstanding of his interest in the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
King, was no way cordial for it.</hi> He who desires a true
account of King <hi>Iames</hi> his deportment in this affair,
&amp; how, contrary to the inclination of all English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
the advice of his best Councellers, and
the earnest solicitation of Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> he
strangely delayed to assist, and in effect deserted both
his Son in Law, and the cause of the protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in that juncture, may finde it at length in. Mr.
<hi>Rushworth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s collections.</hi> But the truth is, his Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in that particular was so possessed and captivat by a
design, or rather an humor, that then overacted him
toward a Spanish match, not only in prejudice and to
the ruine of his own Daughter and Son in Law, his
own and <hi>Englands</hi> honour and interest, but contrary
to his sounder opinion in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>vors of the French protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

the honour of his memory, you had in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
chosen to be silent.</p>
            <p>Your third instance is adduced by your. N. C. In
these words, <hi>But you know there was fighting in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many
<hi>upon the account of Religion,</hi> To which you
answere, <hi>This showes how overly you read History when
you bring this as a precedent.</hi> And truly Sir. I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at the most overly reading may give so full
and intire satisfaction, as to this point, that I excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
long to hear, how your more accurat peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59845:223"/>
will convel the evidence. You say <hi>when</hi> Luther
<hi>rose the Duke of</hi> Saxon, <hi>moved of God, did receive the
reformation peaceablie into his principalities, &amp;c.</hi> And
what then as to the matter of defence? But you adde,
<hi>that in the years. 1524. and 1525. There arose a war
in</hi> Germanie <hi>fomented by some troublesome Preachers, as
saith the Historian, who pretended the liberty of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
for their chief quarrel; And this war of the Rusticks
was again and again condemned by</hi> Luther <hi>as an execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rebellion, nay opposed and broken even by protestant
Princes.</hi> All the concludency of this passage on your
part, depends upon the supposition, that this war
of the Rusticks, was by them necessarily ingaged
into, for defence of themselves and the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
against their persecuting Adversaries. Which
though you be bold enough indirectly to insinuate,
yet all your confidence durst not positively assert: But,
that all men may see your disingenuous dealing, in this
allegeance, it will not be amiss that we take a more
exact account of it, in <hi>Sliedan's</hi> own words, where
we find in his fourth Book, <hi>mense novembri, Ann. 1524.
Ceperunt a suo domino Comite</hi> Luphio suevo <hi>dissidere ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
rusticani, propter onera quibus gravari se nimium
querebantur, idem &amp; alii deinde vicini faciebant in suum
quisque Magistratum.</hi> Here you may perceive that the
liberty of the Gospel was not so much as pretended
to be the quarrel, let be the chief quarrel; but that as
oppression only and not Religion was the cause which
they held out, so their too prompt and illegal resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by way of violence, without the pressure of an
extreme necessity, is that for which they are very
justly censured. The next mention we have of them is
in the same Book, the following year, <hi>Cujus verè
primo per</hi> Sueviam, <hi>&amp;c. altera fuit exorta tempestas
Ordinis plebeii contra quosdam proceres Ecclesiasticos.
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:59845:223"/>
jamque jurejurando ac fide data societatem coibant obducta
causa, quasi &amp; Euangelii veritatem tueri, &amp; servitutem ab se
profligare vellent:</hi> And the author adds, <hi>Magistratus
quidem cognoscere de quaerimoniis ipsorum, &amp; quod ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum
esset, emendare se velle dicebat; verum illi perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verabant,
&amp; eorum postulata, mox aliis communicata,
passim novos incendebant motus.</hi> Which obstinacie and
refusal was certainly unjust. Now what these <hi>postulata</hi>
were, I need not repeate, in so far as they did only
demand the liberty of the Gospel and the reliefe of
their oppressions, all men will judge them reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
yea <hi>Luther,</hi> for all his vehemence against them,
Yet upon these considerations, doth not only seriously
admonish and reprehend the Princes for their perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and tyranny, and tell them that, <hi>talis est vester
dominatus, ut eum homines nec possi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, nec velint, neque
sane debeant ferre diutius, &amp; cujus Deus aut per plebem,
aut per novos hostes quos excitabit, poenam exposcet:</hi>
But also concluds, that if neither the one nor the other
party will abate and hearken to right counsels, <hi>se fore
utriusque ruinae spectatorem: nesas enim utrinque versari,
&amp; bellum esse plebi contra principes ut in oppressores ipso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
salutis atque doctrinae, magistratum invicem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictari
cum plebeiis ut cum latronibus, &amp; iis, qui nomini
Christiano contumeliam faciunt.</hi> But the casting reasons
against these tumults, were, that in effect what was
right in their demands was only speciously alledged,
to palliat an unjust design of a licentious levelling li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in all, and a more wicked ambition in their
chief leaders and instigators, and that as carnal impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and revenge, did give the rise to these stirs;
so, their contagion and progress every where was
carried on rather by an inconsiderate and fatal fury &amp;
rage then any shew of reason, or good conduct. Whence
it is manifest, that these courses, being so plainly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59845:224"/>
cannot be paralleled to the cases of defence
by us mentioned.</p>
            <p>But you say, <hi>they were fomented by some seditious
Preachers, who pretended, the liberty of the Gospel for
their chief quarrel?</hi> Thus you love deceitfully to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
where you cannot justly accuse. But because
that <hi>Thomas Muncer,</hi> quiting first the truth, and
then his station, did, under that general fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> pretext,
with some others his associates, heeding their own
delusions and dreams, and aspiring to enthusiasmes,
become ringleaders to a mutinous rable, for the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off, of all Magistrats as wicked, and the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying
of propriety, Dare you thence infer, that
the practices, which we defend, are of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
And that the Lords Ministers amongst us were
no better? Certainly your calumny not hardie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to turn this oblique reflection unto a direct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
doth clearly enough evince its own fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>But you add, <hi>that Luther wrote again &amp; again unto
them, condemning what they did, as an excerable &amp; cursed
rebellion.</hi> It is answered, what <hi>Luther</hi> did write,
first in answere to their appeal and demands, more
soberly, by way of disswasive, and then upon their
eruption unto hostility, more vehemently by way
of incentive, to incite all, even private persons,
by what somever manner of way, to repress and kill
them, is extant on record. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing that I have
already cleared, how widely the rising of these Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
doth differ from the defensive risistances by
us asserted, I am very free, upon the matter, to
subscrive to his judgment. But because I confess his
reasoning doth proceed upon the same grounds of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
to the Magistrate, not resisting of evill, and
our Lords hindering of <hi>Peter</hi> to fight in his defence,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:59845:224"/>
which the men of your perswasion do commonly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use,
and are indeed handled by him in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as may seem to give you an apparent advantage,
Yow must pardon me, for this my ingenuity, to use
a sutable liberty, and tell you, <hi>first,</hi> that although
<hi>Luther,</hi> in his first discourse doth make certain sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
<hi>viz,</hi> of the Magistrat's being intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for persecution and oppression, and that we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
as atrocious injuries from him, as <hi>Peter</hi> and
the rest of the Apostles did when our Lord was taken
and led away from them; and even in such cases doth
prohibite fighting; yet examine his words, &amp; you will
finde, that it is to restrain from revenge, and not to
prohibite, that he there useth these passages. As
for example, after having said, <hi>Sit Magistratus
plane intolerabilis,</hi> he addeth, <hi>non tamen idcirco exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi
motus: Nec enim cujuslibet est coercere maleficia
&amp;c.</hi> And after having mentioned Christs comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Peter</hi> to abstain from his defence, he subjoyneth,
<hi>gravi latâ sententiâ in eos qui gladio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eriunt, hoc est, qui
contempto Magistratu vindictam privatam exercent:</hi> So
that albeit his words after the usual manner of dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives,
do seem some what tending to the contrary
extreme; yet his scope being fairly adverted to, as
the surest rule of genuine interpretations, they ought
not to be extended beyond the condemning of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
revenge. 2. I say, that as all humane authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are but accessory and not leading Arguments,
And <hi>Luthers</hi> judgement in the matter of war, as in
other things, was but progressive, and not at first
thorowly enlightned; So although he had been more
positive against us, at this time and upon this occasion,
it ought not to stumble us; for as much as, in the
first years of his Reformation, from which this war
of the <hi>Boures</hi> was not far removed, <hi>Sleidan</hi> tells us,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:59845:225"/>
that he wrote not only that the Magistrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was in no
case to be resisted <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. But that to war against the
<hi>Turk</hi> was to resist God; who useth him as a scourge
to chasten us. <hi>Lib.</hi> 14. Both which he afterward,
in his own manner, did retract and qualify as you
shall hear. 3. Albeit the Boures their wars, were
unjust, and seditious, as we have heard; yet that
<hi>Luther</hi> in his arguing against them might, and did
overstrain, beside the arguments already adduced,
is easie to be gathered from his excessive vehemence,
in his second writing, wherein, forgetting his main
principle of appropriating the sword of justice and
vengeance unto the Magistrate, he instigates even
private persons to take vengeance on them, and (if
you will understand it a right) to turn <hi>Phineases</hi> in
the case, and this <hi>Sleidan</hi> sayes, <hi>ut nimis aerem et cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entum
multi passim vituperabant.</hi> The next thing you
alledge anent thir wars, <hi>Is that the Protestant Princes
stirred up by</hi> Luther, <hi>did fight against the Boures and
break them.</hi> And why not; seing their rising<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> specially
that of <hi>Muncer,</hi> against which they took armes, was
plainly seditious and rebellious? And thus we see,
how that by laying down of false suppositions, you do
only accumulat impertinencies. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But the best advice
that I can give you, is that which your confidence
blindly offereth unto your N. C. <hi>viz. not to hearken to
the tatles of ignorant persons, but read the History it selfe</hi>
and there you may both understand the truth, and
the true estimat to be made of <hi>Luther's</hi> Papers.</p>
            <p>In the next place you tell us, <hi>That upon the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and combination of the Duke of</hi> Brunswick &amp; <hi>others
against the Lutherans, the Duke of</hi> Saxon <hi>the Lantgrave
of</hi> Hesse, &amp; <hi>other Princes and free cities met at</hi> Smalcald
<hi>to unite among themselves: but</hi> Luther <hi>was dissatisfied
until that from the</hi> Bulla aurea, <hi>and other constitutions
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:59845:225"/>
of the Empire, it was shewed him, that it was lawful for
them to defend themselves. Whereupon he consenting, they
entered into that famous league.</hi> To this you add, <hi>and
every one knows, the princes of the</hi> Empyre <hi>are</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
<hi>within themselves, And that the Emperour is only
the head of the union.</hi> From all which, it seems, you
would infer, that though this be an instance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Princes standing to their own defence, upon
the account of Religion, against their Superiour; yet
it can not warrant people to resist their Soveraign:
But here let me reminde you first, of your own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
which <hi>was to convince us of the falshood of
that vulgar error, that the Reformation was carried on or
mantained by resistance:</hi> Now, whether this passage
of the <hi>Smalcaldick</hi> league doth answere your designe,
or not, I appeal to your second thoughts: You pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
your selfe in the proposal, as if you were to
prove, that the Reformers were altogether for suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and not at all for resistance according to the
misconstructions that you make of the practice of the
primitive Christians; And yet when you come to
this instance, all your offer is a politick conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<hi>de facto,</hi> incident, which neither as to Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-rules,
or antient precedents, by you commonly
abused, is of the least moment, as I have already shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
2. Although the provocation, which you
mention, to the <hi>Smalcaldick</hi> League, <hi>viz.</hi> the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
&amp; combination of the D. of <hi>Brunswick</hi> &amp; others
against their neighbour protestants, do signify noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in your behalfe, but be altogether proper and
agreeable to the nature of defence, which we do
maintain; yet, seing it is not so consonant to truth,
in matter of fact, and that the true and genuine rise
and progress of that League do much more illustrate
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59845:226"/>
our assertion, you must give me leave to note your
inadvertency, in asmuch as we finde that the league
of <hi>Smalcald</hi> was both proposed and entered into, long
before the opposition of <hi>Brunswick</hi> and the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of <hi>Norimberg,</hi> whereby it was fortified. And as to
the first beginning of the league at <hi>Smalcald,</hi> we have
it, in the year 1526. At <hi>Spire,</hi> where the D. of <hi>Saxon,</hi>
and the <hi>Langrave</hi> calling the Commissioners of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Cities, tell them <hi>quoniam ipsis charam esse vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Evangelii Doctrinam, &amp; vero quid Episcopi molian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
atque pontificii non sit obscurum, deliberare sese dicunt
num qua societas atque <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

causa periclitari contingat, mutua subministrentur au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xilia
&amp;c.</hi> Thereafter when several Princes and Cities
had first protested against the second <hi>Decretum Spirense,</hi>
and, by many meetings and other previous transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
had prepared the thing, in the year 1530. these
protestants meet at <hi>Smalcald, atque faederis concipiunt

and after the Popish Princes and Bishops had leagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together at <hi>Norimberg,</hi> against the Protestants,
that we find <hi>Henricum Brunswicensem totum ad rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendum

ut belli fieret initium adversus Protestantes.</hi>
And it was in the year 1542. that, <hi>Ob vexatas</hi> Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariam
&amp; Brunswicum Smalcal. <hi>Foederis Civitates</hi> Saxo
<hi>&amp;</hi> Langravius <hi>communi sociorum nomine bellum ei fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt,</hi>
clear arguments of your mistake. But, by all these
and many other passages incident in these times, it is
evident, that the principles of the then protestants
did maintain the lawfulness of resistance, no less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:59845:226"/>
persecution for Religion, then against any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
injurie. I might here adde the league made in the
1529. By the <hi>Argentinenses cum Tigurinis, Bernati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,
&amp; Basiliensibus</hi> for mutual defence in case of
invasion for Religion, and that other, made the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
year, upon the same grounds by the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
with the same Cities, but I forbear to insist on
examples so obvious and frequent.</p>
            <p>As for what you say of <hi>Luther's Dissatisfaction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
that Lawyers shewed him, how that, by the</hi> bulla aurea
<hi>and other Constitutions of the Empyre, it was lawful for
them to de end themselves;</hi> That which I find in <hi>Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
to this purpose is, that <hi>Luther</hi> had ever taught
that the Magistrate was not to be resisted: but when
in this deliberation, Lawyers did shew, that the
lawes did sometimes permit resistance; and that now
matters were stated in one of these excepted cases, He
ingenuously professeth, <hi>that he knew not this to be lawful.
And because the Gospel doth not impugne or abolish poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
lawes, and also because, in that so doubtful and
dangerous a time, many things might fall out, so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that
not only Law, but the very force and necessity of
conscience, might make us take armes,</hi> He concluds,
that a League for defence might be entered into.
Now, whether this passage do more favour your
design, or our assertion, is very discernible, if we
consider, first, that there is no mention here of the <hi>bulla
aurea,</hi> which though it do indeed contain the rights,
liberties, priviledges and Dignities of the Princes
and States of the Empyre; yet beareth no permission
of resistance referable to this case. 2. The laws here
spoken of sometime permitting resistance, are, no
doubt, no other then these ordinary exceptions found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the law of nature, whereby the laws of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and submission, flowing from the inferior law
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:59845:227"/>
of Nations, are by all Lawyers held, in some cases, to
be restricted. And though I grant, that many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists
do require to the lawfulness of subjects their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
beside the justice of the cause, the concurring
of inferior Magistrates; yet that the same grounds,
with better consequence, do also allow to the people
by themselves (inferior Magistrates either joining
with the supreme oppressor, or deserting their dutie)
the right of defence, is the opinion of the more
judicious. Nay, seing it is most certain, as I have
often touched, that there are certain atrocious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
which do force, even from the most rigid roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list,
a particular exception in favors of single persons
thereby attacqued, it is evident, that all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
is more <hi>in hypothesi</hi> then <hi>in thesi.</hi> 3. If it be
remembred what were <hi>Luther's</hi> mistakes, in his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
years, in the matters of war &amp; resistance, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
that beside the information of Lawyers, he had a
further and a most important reflection upon <hi>the force
and necessity of conscience, in times of uncertainty and
danger;</hi> it must of necessity be acknowledged, that
this passage is not meerly a politick discovery,
whereof before he was ignorant, but a manifest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation
of former mistakes.</p>
            <p>I have already hinted, how absurdly the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for not resisting of evill, and for subjection to
Powers, are abused, by Court-flatterers, to a special
prohibition of all resistance from Christians persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for conscience sake, against their oppressing
Princes, Only for sooth, because their unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Religion, doth sufficiently secure them from
the consequence; whereas it is clear as the Sun-light,
that the same Scripture-rules do make no distinction,
from what cause, let be from what person, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie
doth descend; but equally and indefinitly enjoyn
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:59845:227"/>
patience and submission, in their exigence and season'
without the least prejudice to these other rules of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
whereby, aswell in the case of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Religion, as of injurious invasions upon other
accounts, the persons invaded, when in an other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
unrestrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d capacity, are warranted to resistance
in their own defence. And for this, it may suffice,
though there were no more, that <hi>Luther</hi> tells us, that
he ever taught, that the Gospel <hi>doth not impugne or
abolish politick laws,</hi> much less then the fundamental
laws of nature, to which all politick laws do cede.
But what he further addes, <hi>of a force and necessity of
conscience,</hi> thereby joyning the obligation to the right
of defensive resistance, is certainly a ground, which
if it were here pertinent, I could improve to more
then I have hitherto asserted.</p>
            <p>But you say, <hi>that every one knowes, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are Soveraigns within themselves, and the Emperour
is only the head of the union.</hi> How doth this blinde Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
medle without understanding. That the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Empyre is purely feudal, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
Liege-lord, and all the Princes feudataires recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noscing
him, and subject to the imperial Chamber,
where they have been often doomed and for faulted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Is a thing most obvious. What do you then bable of
<hi>united Soverraigns,</hi> and <hi>Soveraigns within themselves?</hi>
By which dialect of discourse, and a fair descent a
<hi>Majori ad Minus,</hi> you or any other private person may
<hi>quo ad</hi> his reserved rights and liberties, be termed a
Soveraigne within himself: We know, that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
they have large priviledges, <hi>and that most of
the regalia</hi> appertain to them, but are they therefore
<hi>Soveraignes?</hi> Or is the Emperour only the head of
the union? Beside, how will you make thir things
quadrat to the Hanse-townes and free Cities, who
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:59845:228"/>
certainly, for all their immunities and priviledges, are
immediatly, and directly subject to the Emperour,
and yet have often ingaged in these defensive leagues
and wars against him. Thus I answere you, in your
folly. But, pray Sir, do you think, that ever our
Lord commanded, or the Gospel meant, that,
though the poor people may not defend themselves,
when persecute for Religion; yet great men their
superiors, though subject to the Supreme, may? Or,
if you be more rational, can you imagine, that an
oppressed people upon any account, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curse
of inferior rulers may defensively resist their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
to whom all are subject, and that the same
people, no more, but rather less subject to these infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
then all are to the Supreme, may not as lawfully,
upon the like provocation, defend themselves against
both the Supreme &amp; Inferror joyning in an oppressive
combination? Specially, seing it is most certain that,
as the Supreme hath all his power from the peoples
suffrage and consent; so, the Inferior doth wholly and
precariously for the most part, subsist by his grant.</p>
            <p>But I proceed, you say, <hi>As for the war that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
followed betwixt</hi> Charles <hi>the</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
               <hi>&amp; the Duke of</hi>
Saxe, <hi>besides that the Duke was free to defend himselfe,
as I have told,</hi> Charles <hi>the</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
               <hi>declared it was not for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
he fought.</hi> 'Tis answered, for the freedom of
the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> that it was no greater in this case,
then the people may acclaime in the like, as also,
that if the Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi> his war was lawful, upon
the account of injuries, for other causes then that of
of Religion, Religion doth only aggravat, and not
alter the case, I have already cleared. But what a
pitiful allegeance is this, that <hi>Charles</hi> the fift for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
declared it was not for Religion he fought?
Whereas first by the league betwixt him and the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:59845:228"/>
               <hi>Pope,</hi> it is expressely convented, <hi>That wherefore many
years</hi> Germany <hi>had continued in great errors, for which
the Councel of</hi> Trent <hi>was called and set down, And that
these of the</hi> Smalcald <hi>confederacy, did reject the same: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the</hi> Pope <hi>and Caesar, for the Glory of God and safety
of that People, have transacted, that</hi> Caesar <hi>levy an army
against Iuny next, and by force of armes reduce these
Refusers of the Council, and Defenders of errors, into the
old Religion and obedience of the holy See.</hi> 2. The Duke of
<hi>Saxe</hi> and the <hi>Langrave</hi> writ to him to disswade him,
closing, that <hi>when ever they should understand his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
causes for that war, they would so answere, ut
quivis intelligat, &amp; injuriam nobis fieri, &amp; te Romani
Antichristi ac impii Concilii</hi> Tridentini <hi>impulsu bellum
hoc suscipere, ut &amp; Euangelii Doctrina &amp;</hi> Germaniae
<hi>libertas opprimatur, nec ullam aliam subesse causam
docebimus.</hi> 3. They at the same time, emit a publick
vindication for themselves, proving by unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
arguments that Religion was the only cause of
that war. And should not you be ashamed, to obtrude
to us <hi>Caesar's</hi> groundless and calumnious assertion,
against both the Princes their declaration and reasons?
4. The very letters written by <hi>Caesar</hi> to the <hi>Argenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenses</hi>
and other Protestant Cities, wherein, accusing
the Princes of Rebellion and Oppression, under the
pretext of Religion, he really maketh out nothing,
together with their answer, wherein all his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are taken off; nay <hi>Sleidan's</hi> whole sevententh
Book, containing the <hi>Pop's Bull,</hi> his letters to the
<hi>Helvetii,</hi> the distinct returnes made to <hi>Caesar's</hi> demands
by the Protestant and Popish Cantons, with many
other letters and declarations, is but one evidence,
and that irrefragable, against you. What impudence
is this then whereinto you are hardened?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="440" facs="tcp:59845:229"/>But <hi>the Electors of</hi> Cullen <hi>amd the</hi> Palatine <hi>both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
lay neuters.</hi> And what then? Do we not
know how rare a things it is, in a time of danger, for
all concerned to unite even in the most uncontroverted
duties? Beside, the Elector of <hi>Cullen</hi> was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
deposed and excommunicate, and his people
(specially his principal Clergie) and he at great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,
for the Reformation by him intended. And
the <hi>Palatine</hi> inclining to favoure, &amp; in effect aiding
the Princes with 400 horse, was by the evil suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of the war forced to retreat and excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>Next you adde, <hi>That the Elector of</hi> Brandenburg
<hi>and</hi> Maurice <hi>of</hi> Saxe <hi>armed for the Emperour.</hi> And I
grant, <hi>That</hi> Albertus <hi>&amp;</hi> Ioannes Brandenburgici

their resting upon <hi>Caesar's</hi> assertion and promise, for
the security of Religion, was, by all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of that war, declared to be but an emptie
pretext; so <hi>Iohn's</hi> breach of faith, in this his ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
can as little be denyed, as his relation of Son
in law to <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> then detained cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

Brothers, did stand off neuter, endeavouring rather
to mediate, as the History testifies, and we may see
by his interposing betwixt the Elector of <hi>Saxe</hi> and
<hi>Maurice,</hi> at the seige of <hi>Lipsick.</hi> As for <hi>Maurice,</hi>
his part, it was indeed foulest, and deservedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by all equal Judges. But seeing you can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

broils about it, till after seventy years, that</hi> Sigismond
<hi>King of</hi> Polland, <hi>the Son of their former King, and
therefore by them acknowledged, though a Papist, was by
force entering the Kingdome, resolving to root out the
Protestant Religion: Whereupon they deposed him; no
strange thing in the Sweedish History, that being before
an Elective Crown, and but newly then become hereditary,
and the States still retaining the supreme Authority.</hi>
Sir, I must confess, that this is a passage, whereunto
I can make no reply; your undertaking was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us, by undeniable evidence of History, of the
falshood of that vu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gar error, <hi>That the Reformation
was carried on</hi> (that is maintained as, I have before
shewed) <hi>by resistance;</hi> and here you give us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of a Kingdome, not only resisting, but depos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their King, because of his invading of Religion:
Which, in place of a vindication, is a full and plain
concession: For, as to what you insinuate, that that
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:59845:230"/>
Crown had been a little before Elective, I told you,
upon the instance of <hi>Boheme,</hi> that though it had been
even for the time Elective, yet it could not make for
you, much less when you acknowledge that then
(for, as for your own or the Printers escape, referring
the change to the Year 1644. I urge it not) it was
become successive. And where you alledge, that the
States did still retain the Supreme Authority, if you
understand it otherwayes then according to that
power and priviledge which appertains to our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
it is only your own fiction. But you, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne
that, <hi>If this serve not to vindicat the</hi> Sweds,
<hi>at least, the Reformation was not introduced by wars
among them.</hi> And pray Sir, who of us did ever
defend such a practice? To introduce, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
are things so different, that they can not be
fairly confounded. The last shift you make is, <hi>That the
actions of that state were never looked upon as a precedent
to others:</hi> But, if so, why then do you mention them,
and if they be indeed a precedent, certainly it is hard
to determine, whether you be more false in your
general assertion anent the establishing of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or ridiculous in this part of your vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>The fift instance you mention, is, <hi>That</hi> Denmark
<hi>received the Reformation peaceably.</hi> But seing this
hypothese excluds the question controverted, anent
the maintenance of Religion by armes, not casible
without the antecedent violence, It is evident, that
it is rather transiently then pertinently by you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at Zurich <hi>received the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
peaceably, but being maligned by the other</hi>
Cantons, <hi>and by them injured, at the Popes instigation,
it broke out into a civil war, purely defensive upon</hi> Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches
<hi>part, Likeas the</hi> Cantons <hi>are not subject to one
another, but free States only united in a League.</hi> It is
answered, that here, upon the account of Religion,
there was force used in <hi>Helvetia</hi> is clear from your own
narration. How then do you taxe your N. C. for
this allegeance, <hi>as a superficial Reader of History?</hi>
As for that, that it was used by one associat against
another, and not by subjects against their supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
it is only accidental from the condition of
these <hi>Cantons,</hi> &amp; the other circumstances of that war.
And seing, that neither the Gospel, nor Reason,
do lay any special restraint upon subjects, in case of
their Superiors intolerable persecution because of
Religion, as I have already shewed, this precedent
is no small confirmation of the practices by us main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
2. I must tell you further, that this war,
on <hi>Zuriches</hi> part, was not so purely defensive, as
you give it out, in asmuch as it is certain from <hi>Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.</hi>
4. and 8. Books, that the provoking injuries
were, for the most part, committed upon their citi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zens
without their territories, and the first act of
hostility, by the interclusion of passages, was done
by these of <hi>Zurich,</hi> so that, although their guards
were indeed surprised; yet dating the war from the
hostile interclusion, it appears rather to have been
assertive then purely defensive. 3. The advantage,
which this example doth give us, is the more obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
from that preface they make to their expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
emitted to their confederats in these words.

observation, holding out how in a continued tract
of injuries the duty of patience may at length cease,

reject these abusive inferences of absolute subjection,
or rather stupidity, in the cause of Religion, which
men, assured by their indiffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

4. When you remembred the practice of the
<hi>Suitzers,</hi> in the point of Reformation, how came
you to forgett <hi>Basile,</hi> Where you may finde (<hi>Sleid.</hi> l.
6) that after the Reformation was in a manner esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
the Papists nevertheless did prosecute their
own designe, until the citizens thereby provoked, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
and supplicate the Senate, that certain of their
number, countenancers of the popish preachers,
might be removed; Which being refused, they make
an other Assembly and Supplication <hi>&amp; quamvis sine
armis, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> non tamen tam demisse quàm antea,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Senate returning a second displeasing answere,
and the people being more offended, because of the
apprehended usurpation of a few, they openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that they would take a course, not for Religion
(<hi>viz.</hi> simply and only) but for the vindication of
their own right: And so they instantly take armes,
And the same day, one of them casting down a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
statue, they suddenly take the occasion to throw
down all the idolls and statues within the city making
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:59845:231"/>
answere to such, who came from the Senate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the matter, <hi>that what the Senate had been advising
upon, for three years, they would perfect in one hour,
that idols might no more be the cause of contention.</hi>
Upon which the Senate grants th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In which passage, subjects their maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and asserting of the Reformation by armes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
their superiors, is so evident, that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easie to conjecture the reason of your silence and
omission. It is true the people do mention the
vindication of their right, and not religion, as the
immediate cause of their taking armes: But seing
their meaning is plain enough, that their just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
in behalf of Religion were in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
refused, as not only their common right, but
their special priviledges were injured; and seing, in
the progress, the cause of Religion was by them most
directly intended and pursued, it is manifest above
exception, that, as it was the occasion, so the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion, was the principal motive and
end of all this stir.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Geneve,</hi> you say; <hi>the Bishop fled from it out
of a pannick fear, when the Reformation was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
And 'tis true the History saves, that upon the
change, <hi>Episcopus atque Clerus irati discesserunt ab urbe.</hi>
But is it then pertinent for you to observe, that no
force was used where there was no provocation. But
you subjoine, <hi>that</hi> Geneve <hi>was a free Town, neither
subject to the Bishop, nor the duke of</hi> Savoy. And no doubt
you give this caveat for that war, which, you know,
was made against them, in the year 1534. By the
duke of <hi>Savoy, adjutus ab ejus urbis Episcopo, vel potius
instigatus partim ob Evangelii pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>essionem, partim aliis
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:59845:232"/>
de causis.</hi> But, seing although <hi>Geneve</hi> was a free
Town, yet it had a considerable dependence upon the
Bishop, and though it had not, yet the instance is no
less concludent for us, then that of the war of <hi>Zurich,</hi>
I will not insist in any longer reply.</p>
            <p>The seventh instance, you also adduce by your
N. C. Questioning <hi>what you say to the war in the</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands.
To which you answere, <hi>that you say still
they fought not for Religion:</hi> And that they fought not
for Religion, that is, to propagate it by Armes
you are in the right: But that persecution for
Religion, carried on by the making of new Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops,
the Inquisition, and bloody Edicts, was the
principal cause of all these wars, Historians on both
sides, such as <hi>Bentivoglio, Strada, Grotius, Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoun</hi>
and his Authours do so fully attest, that your
confidence is to me admirable. But you say, <hi>Papists
and Protestants did jointl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> concurr in it.</hi> It is answered,
1. That the cause of these wars being complexe, the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> endeavouring no less to subvert the liberties
of these Provinces, then to extirpate the Reformed
Religion, it is nothing strange, that there should
have been a joint concurrence i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the opposition.
Specially seing, 2. even the persecution at that
time, practised upon the Protestants in these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> strangers, was so tyrannous,
ragefull and pernicious, that many of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriots,
though otherwise not of their Religion,
were yet induced to favoure their cause. But 3. As
it was the spreading of the Reformed Religion in
these parts, that first gave the <hi>Spaniard</hi> occasion to
exercise tyranny, and, by violating and subverting
their Liberties, to designe an uniforme royalty over
all his Dominions; So it is unquestionable, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and the cruelty practised upon its Professors,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:59845:232"/>
were the originall and principal cause of that war as
the Apology, set out by the Protestants, after their
first defeat, in the end of the Regency of <hi>Margaret,</hi> doth
fully witness. And here I might tell you of the joynt
supplications and confederacies made about that
time by these of that Religion for their own preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and also the concessions made to them in that
behalf; But the History is so large in this matter,
that it were superfluous in this place to be more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
And therefore I say 4. That although in the
beginning, the mixed designe of the extirpation of
Religion mainly intended, and of the erecting of an
uniforme Monarchy assumed through the occasion
thereof, carrying along a manifest and most injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
violation of all rights, liberties and priviledges,
did at first ingage even Papists in the resistance; yet
it is most certain, that the principal cause of the war,
<hi>viz,</hi> Religion, more and more prevailing, of the
<hi>Flamings</hi> themselves there were few, save Protestants,
that took part on the defensive side. And as for the
<hi>French</hi> or others, who joyned afterwards upon a clear
ground of interest, it belongeth not unto the present
consideration.</p>
            <p>You adde, <hi>that</hi> Egmond <hi>&amp;</hi> Horn <hi>beheaded, by the</hi>
D <hi>of</hi> Alve, <hi>as the chief instruments in it, died both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</hi>
'Tis answered, <hi>Egmond</hi> and <hi>Horn</hi> plainly accused
of having joined to the confederats against the inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp; for remisness in the maintenance of the Romish
Religion, were very early cut off, even in the first fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
as it were of these tumults, before the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
war was formed; but, however, certain it is,
that although they professed and practised mainly for
the liberty of their Countrey against tyranny, yet they
greatly favoured the persecute protestants, and also
much inclined to their way, as is clear from their very
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59845:233"/>
accusation, and also from the manner of their death,
specially <hi>Horn's,</hi> who, for all <hi>Grotius</hi> his saying,
that they were execute, <hi>post sacra romano ritu peracta;</hi>
yet, at first refused to confess to the Bishop of <hi>Ypre,</hi>
saving that he had confessed himselfe unto God.
What then doth this allegeance, destitute of reason
and little favoured by truth, avail you?</p>
            <p>Your next argument is, <hi>that the States by a</hi> Placaet
<hi>declared it scandalous, to say they fought for</hi> Religion.
Sir, I wish you had given us the words, at least the
date of that <hi>Placaet:</hi> For, sure I am, that in what
termes soever, the Estates in policie might think fit to
declare and publish the cause of these wars, and to
assigne for the same rather the invasion of liberties and
priviledges, which was the effect of the <hi>Spanish</hi> perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
then Religion, which was the more remote
cause; yet whoever reflects upon their first beginnings
will finde that it was after this manner. The <hi>Flamings</hi>
receiving the light of the Gospel, &amp; being therefore
sore vexed by long and cruel persecutions, the same
upon the succession of <hi>Philip</hi> to his Father <hi>Charles,</hi> are
by the <hi>Spainards</hi> much intended, and a resolution being
taken, to root out the Protestants, new Bishops are
created, the Spanish Inquisition is threatned, and
many terrible edicts emitted, by which courses, not
only in themselves wicked, but also contrary to the
priviledges, and destructive of the liberties of that,
people, many tumults and confusions were in all parts
occasioned, untill at length the Nobles do confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
for resistance, and mutual assistance and relief;
in consequence whereof, they petition the Regent,
and applications are made to the King, when in the
meane time, on a suddain, these of the Religion
seeing no success that way, keep their meetings and
assemblies openly, assuming armes for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:59845:233"/>
aggainst suddain violence, and by the meaner
sort of the people, images and idols are as with a
whirl-winde (<hi>quales olim saepe motus Iudeorum erant</hi>
which is <hi>Grotius</hi> his remark) thrown down almost
in all places. These things make the Regent more easie
towards the Protestants, and force her to remit by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
and indulge their Preachers: but the Lords
retearing to their respective charges, for rendering
the concessions effectual, and being terrified by the
reports of the King's implacable displeasure, betake
themselves to divided Councels, whereupon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
resiles from the agreement, renewes the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
levies new forces, imposeth new oaths, and
the <hi>Spainards,</hi> supposing the whole people one way
or other to have been involved in the late tumults,
conceive them, as guiltie of rebellion, to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted
their former liberties, and to be become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to an absolute domination. This being the
condition of matters when the <hi>Duke d'Alva</hi> was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to the government, the Prince of <hi>Orange &amp; Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derode,</hi>
both Protestants, retire. <hi>Brederod</hi> his forces
of the same Religion resist and are beaten, and many
shift for themselves: then the <hi>Duke</hi> arriving fills all
places in a moment with tyranny and persecution, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to death many Lords and Gentlemen, and many
thousands beside, because of the former confederacie,
and upon the account of their Religion: And the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> being cited and not compearing,
his Estate and Lands ar seised on, and thereafter tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
armes by the perswasion of the banished, and
declaring to the world both the injuries done unto
him, and that he was of the Religion, he is once
and again beaten; so that there remained no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the <hi>Duk's</hi> rage &amp; violence, save what was
made by a few, escaped from the former defeats gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:59845:234"/>
to the Protestants, who made war in the Princes
name, partly by piracie at sea, and partly from
woods and forests, against Priests only and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of justice. In this deplorable estate, under most
insolent tyrannie and violent persecution, these poor
Countries remain, untill the Earl vander <hi>Marke</hi> with
his Protestants or sea Gueux, as they were then
called, surpriseth the Town of <hi>Breill,</hi> after which
<hi>Flussing</hi> and several other townes in <hi>Zealand</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
refuse spanish garisons, and being Protestants
revolt to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who having implored
the aid of all Protestant Princes, after a successess
enterprise for the succour of his Brother <hi>Ludovick</hi>
at <hi>Mons,</hi> and a proclamation emitted, declaring the
cause of his ingagement to be for relief of these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
form <hi>Alva's</hi> tyranny, and from the crueltie and
oppression of his proclamations, edicts, taxes, and
imposts, cometh unto <hi>Holland,</hi> from which time
the war for Religion and liberty, proceedeth thorow
many and various accidents, and both are in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
equally restored. This is the plain and true and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the rise of these wars, at which period, even
<hi>Grotius,</hi> who, of all the writters of that History,
doth most decline and wave the cause of Religion as
an ingredient in the quarrel, noteth, <hi>Religionis causa
primi talibus caeptis sociaverant Smalcaldico faedere Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,
post quos</hi> Galli <hi>proceres plurimis etiam Scriptis
disseruerant non peccare, in fas obsequii minores potestates

que innocentium, si necesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oret, armis defenderent,
&amp;c.</hi> And a little after, <hi>romanae ceremoniae ejectae tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plis,
&amp;c.</hi> Whether or not then persecution for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
appears to have been the cause of these wars, let
all impartial men judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="451" facs="tcp:59845:234"/>But you tell us, <hi>that the true ground of the
quarrel, as we may read in all the Histories, was
that their Prince was not an absolute Soveraign, but
limited in his power and that by expresse compact, they
might use force if he transgressed his limits, as he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
did.</hi> Sir, for the true and proper ground
of the war I have alreadie clearly narrated it, from
the best Historians: that which you point at here,
is rather a justification of their resistance from the
right and capacity whereunto their Prince was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricted.
But 1. You cannot deny that persecution for
Religion, whereby they were injured both in their
special priviledges, and common and natural rights
and liberties, was the provoking cause of these wars;
and consequently that Religion no more then other
interests, doth not forbid to subjects necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and resistance against their Superiors. 2. For
all the vaine talke that you and your fellowes make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us for allowing to the people a discretive judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
anent their Princes actings, yet you not only
suppose and approve it, in these of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
in order to their Prince, but stick not to vent your
aime, in saying that the King did most notoriously
and tyrannically pass his limits. 3. Though we
should urge this instance no further then you allow it;
yet it stil remaines a very agreeable precedent for jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
our late courses, it being certain, that not
only the rights and priviledges of both Kingdomes
were violate, but that the undoubted priviledges of
Parliament, and the resticted nature of the Kings so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity
over us, did give us as good and sufficient
a warrand for the oppositions then made, as upon
this head can be alledged and instructed by these of the
<hi>Netherlands.</hi> And really, when I reflect upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
case of the late warres betwixt the King and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:59845:235"/>
Parliament, and how that in the Papers printed by
consent of both, for clearing the controversie, there
appeareth nothing, save the pretensions and pleas of
prerogative and priviledge, and yet all do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Religion to have been the original cause, I think
this sole consideration might have made you to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
this poor vindication.</p>
            <p>It is true, <hi>Grotius</hi> sayes, and seems to lay much weight
upon it, <hi>quod Brabanti illud quoque proprium pacisci
solent, ut, principe leges violante, ipsi fidei &amp; obsequii
vinculo liberantur donec demantur injuriae.</hi> But not to
draw you to long discourses, anent the effect of an
irritant provision adjected to a mutual contract. 1. It
were no great difficulty to shew you from undeniable
reason, nay from <hi>Grotius</hi> himselfe, in his <hi>de Iur. Bell.</hi>
that as there is such a connexion in all contracts, that
the failzeer of the one party doth in so far liberat the
other from his mutual &amp; corresponding ingagement,
and repone him to his antecedent condition and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
so in the present case, an irritant provision,
though, in other cases, it may sometimes extend its
vertue and influence beyond the intrinseck import of
the failzie wherby it is committed), appears not to
have any special use, but only to serve, <hi>ad majorem,
quia expressiorem cautelam.</hi> 2. It might here be
sufficient to make that answere for us, which <hi>Grotius</hi>
a little, after in the same place makes for the other
Provinces, <hi>viz. ab aliis quoque Belgarum nationibus idem
jus moribus usurpatum;</hi> which may be verefied as to
<hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> by many most pregnant and
luculent examples. But<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 3. As I grant that a reservation
of these things, which otherwse would be imported
in the peoples surrender, &amp; appertain to the Soveraign,
fortified or not fortified, by an irritant provision, may
give to the people when therein wronged, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:59845:235"/>
of asserting their own right, which without a
special reservation had been none; so undoubtedly,
as to such rights, which do reserve themselves, and
are so much ours, that even by an express surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they cannot be absolutely resigned (such as the
right of Religion, our lives and whole fortunes are,
the preservation whereof, being the very ends of go,
vernment, can not be understood to be permitted to
the Governour's absolute arbitrement) the people
therein invaded, by vertue of the power inherent to
rights reserved and the liberation, flowing from all
such failzeours, though not expressed, may very just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resist, and demand reparation. And, is it indeed
possible, that any rational man should think, because
of a reservation of things of less value, and therefore
within our power, a Prince transgressing may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be resisted, and that nevertheless these high and
atrocious invasions, in matters of the greatest value,
and which therefore can neither be absolutely surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
nor do need an express reservation, should
and ought to be stupidly swallowed down? But seing
the greatest Royalists do, in certain suppositions,
wherein their own sense and interest do give them a
better understanding, not stick both to acknowledge
and practise, according to this principle, it is very
evident, as I have often said, that it is only their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
in matters of Religion, and the security
that they thence derive, which makes them and us to
differ on this subject.</p>
            <p>In the close of this instance, you tell us, <hi>That for
all this, you refer us to</hi> Grotius. And for matter of
fact, I decline him not, as you may perceive, but
if his too manifest prejudice in matters of Religion,
do make him less express to our purpose, I hope the
supplement of other Authors, and also of solid reason,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:59845:236"/>
shall obtain from you &amp; al men a just acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>The 8th instance that you would vindicate, is that
of the Civil warrs of <hi>France,</hi> and first you say, <hi>Their
first civil wars, were managed by the Princes of the blood,
who by the laws of that Crown are not ordinary subjects.</hi>
And certainly by all law and common sense, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
persons may well be said not to be ordinary
subjects; but are they therefore not subjects? Surely
the conferring of high dignities and great Authority,
may well intend their obligation, it doth not alter
their condition. And how often have we heard and
seen them accused and forfeited for rebellion? Why
do you then render you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> selfe ridiculous by such a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
alledgeance?</p>
            <p>But you add, <hi>besides, the wars were begun in the
minority of the King.</hi> And do you seriously think, that
(setting aside the greater incapacity it might have
put them into) had the King been major, they would
have been of another minde?</p>
            <p>But you say, that, <hi>in this case, the power of the
Princes is greater;</hi> And we have indeed often heard,
that the dignity of the Princes doth consist mainly in
two, <hi>viz.</hi> their right of succession, and privilege of
Regencie, during the Kings minority or absence:
but as, in the matter of Regencie, the nearest, and
not all the <hi>agnati</hi> of the royal blood can pretend to it,
and that only in the case of no nomination made by
the preceeding King, and during the space of the
young King's pupillarity, just according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
rules of <hi>tutela legitima;</hi> so you may remember,
that the wars, we speak of, falling out in the reigne of
<hi>Francis</hi> the Second, being for the time, at least,
sixteen years of age, there was no place for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
their pretence of Regencie: beside the first appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of these wars was only supposed to be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59845:236"/>
but not openly by them owned. And as for the
continuation of the war, in the non-age of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Nynth, it is certaine, that the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
to whom, as nearest agnat, the Regencie belonged,
did voluntarily renounce his pretension, in favours of
the Queen mother, nay that he joined with her &amp; the
<hi>Guisians,</hi> and died fighting against the Protestants
headed by <hi>Conde</hi> and the <hi>Admiral.</hi> And likewise,
these wars were againe renewed in the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority;
But, not to enter further into these iliads of
tumults, and confusions, occasioned by the restles
perfidie and unsatiable cruelty of the adversaries,
though I should admit, that these wars were not
only incited and provoked to by persecution, but
that also, even on the Protestants their side, they
were not a little influenced both by particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
and passions, and the general fervor of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(Which in effect is the very worst account that
even the enemies of the truth do give of them, and
cannot be received by any impartial inquirer) Yet,
seing it is most evident, that persecution for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was the true cause moving the body of the Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
to their own defence, and that their Ministers
and Teachers, whom God had honoured to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
in their conversion, as <hi>Beza</hi> and others,
did countenance these wars, and constantly maintain,
that a defensive resistance to subjects in a due capacity,
was no more prohibite, upon the account of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
for Religion, then in the case of any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
oppression. The mixture of mans corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(inseparable even from his best actions) in the
prosecution of so good a cause, can neither prejudge
its justice, nor deprive us of the advantage of this
precedent.</p>
            <p>But knowing your former answers to be weake and
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59845:237"/>
unsatisfying, you subjoyne, that <hi>you do not deny their
following wars to have been direct Rebellion.</hi> And is this
the vindication you promised? Only, you bid us,
<hi>consider the fierce Spirit of that Nation, and we must
confess it was not Religion, but their temper that was to be
blamed.</hi> Well Sir, is this your candor? The question
is, whether or not Religion was the cause of these wars,
which, if the lawfulness thereof were not first suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were utterly impertinent; and you not darring
to deny it, do first tell us by a blunt <hi>petitio principii,</hi>
that <hi>the wars were rebellion,</hi> and then, that <hi>the</hi> French
<hi>temper more then</hi> Religion <hi>is to be therefore, blamed,</hi>
Who should regard such a pitiful Sophister? But,
seing it can not be denyed that the many and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
suffered upon the account of Religion, were
the just provocation to these wars, although some
small censu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e either of precipitancy, or of excess in
the prosecution may possibly be imputed to the hote
temper of that people, or excused by the signal inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of ther provocations; yet, sure I am, that
neither the cause of Religion, nor the justice of it,
is thereby in the least disproven.</p>
            <p>But now you say, <hi>many of the eminent men of that
Church are fully convinced of the evill of these courses, yea
one of the glories of our Nation</hi> Cameron, <hi>in the wars of
the last King, directly preached against their courses as
Rebellion.</hi> I will not answere, that possibly it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
the eminent men of that Church, as it did many
of our own, who, as they were removed, from the
first times of the Reformation, &amp; the then opposition
of adversaries, &amp; from the evidence of the Lord's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
&amp; presence that therein appeared; so according to
the influence of after temptations, were induced to
condemne that, which otherwise they would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven.
It is enough for us, that your <hi>many eminent,</hi>
               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:59845:237"/>
whoever they be, are more then overballanced by
many more and more eminent still abyding on our
side. And for <hi>Cameron,</hi> whom, forsooth, in your
pedantick stile, you more then cannonize, by terming
<hi>a Glory,</hi> you must pardon us, who know him better,
whatever be his opinion in this matter, not to be
dazled by his splendour, specially seing you know,
that, if we were disposed to vie with you in such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
we might by adducing King <hi>Iames</hi> his justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the <hi>French</hi> Protestants their defensive wars,
in his answer to cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> eclipse this your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
into obscurity: but what need of more words. If
these last wars were purely defensive for Religion,
they could not be rebellious; and if they were not,
we only lose the instance, but not the argument, as
I have abundantly proven.</p>
            <p>But to this you make your N. C. Answer by ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>How did the late King give assistance to the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers,
<hi>in the last wars, if so be they were rebellious?</hi>
And to this you reply, <hi>That it proceeded from a
particular reason, Viz. Because the King of</hi> Britain
<hi>had become the surety in the former pacification that the</hi>
French <hi>King should observe the agreement.</hi> Sir, If I
had the management of your N. C. part. I think I
should not have troubled you with this answer. The
assistance you mention was so like rather to a treachery
that both for the good of these poor Protestants, and
for the honour of our King's memory, I wish it had
never been. But, since you suppose it to have been
real, how is it that by your return, you do so piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
betray your cause? For, seing by your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
the late King did in the pacification,
after the second war of <hi>Rochell,</hi> with consent of the
<hi>French</hi> King, become surety to his Protestant sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
for due observance, and, by this his accession,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:59845:238"/>
clearly acknowledged the lawfulness and validitie of
the Protestants their treatie, it is a more manifest
confession of the Peoples right and capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
both by contract and necessary force the unjust
and persecuting violence of their Prince, then all
the instances adduced do afford.</p>
            <p>It is true, you adde, <hi>That this assistance was on our
Kings part most just, what ever the Subjects of</hi> France
<hi>their part in it might be.</hi> But where is your reason
for this insinuat distinction? Or what Logick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> can
prove that a just concurring assistance may be given in
an unjust war? That the King of <hi>Britain</hi> interposing
was injured and affronted by the King of <hi>France,</hi> his
breach is not denyed by, or contrary to, us, more
then the injury done by the <hi>French</hi> King unto these his
Protestants subjects. But to clear this passage of
your foolish quibles. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in the
Ninth of his Politick Discourses, entituled, <hi>His
Apology upon the last troubles of</hi> France <hi>because of the
Religion,</hi> plainly tell us, that the King of <hi>Britain</hi> did,
by a Gentleman sent to him, remonstrat how he was
surety in the last peace, and did compassionate the
Protestants their sufferings, that if by fair means he
did not obtain relief, he would ingage his whole
Kingdomes, and his proper Person in so just a war
to which he found himselfe oblidged in honour and
conscience, providing that the Protestants would
take armes with him, and promise, as he would do,
not to hearken to any treatie, but jointly with him.
And thereto the <hi>Duke</hi> subjoines, that this promise
of assistance was his principal ingagement to arme:
What think you then? Do not these words plainly
enough denote both Religion to have been the cause,
and what was the Kings approbation of these wars?
Or, if you doubt the <hi>French</hi> man's faith, pray take
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:59845:238"/>
but a view of <hi>Mr Rushworth's</hi> Collections as to this
affair, and there, beside the confimation of what the
<hi>Duke</hi> sayes, I am perswaded you will find, the King
so express, and the Parliament so cordial, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
of the wrongs done to these poor Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
and in their readinesse to assist for their relief,
that you will be ashamed hereafter to scorn your selfe
by such confident childish conjectures and distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But, I am sorry, that by reflecting upon the
part of the <hi>French</hi> Protestants, in that war, as less
just then the King of <hi>Britains,</hi> you should have forced
me to a discovery, which rendreth its event so disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to our King's memory.</p>
            <p>Having run thorow so many examples, with such
success, as we have spoken, you conclude, <hi>And
thus I have cleared the Churches abroad of that in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urious
stain you brand them with.</hi> But seeing I have so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifestly
discovered your falshood and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in this matter, I will not insult over this your
folly. You go on in the next place to our <hi>Britain,</hi>
and tell us of the <hi>English Reformation, and how that it
was stained with no blood, save that of Martyrs, and
that indeed was no stain,</hi> but, as you do well cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
your selfe, <hi>its chief Ornament.</hi> But Sir, if the
Reformation in other places were no less confirmed
and rendred glorious by this zeal and testimony, and
withall the People, by defensively resisting, when
in a sufficient capacity, did evidence a greater and
more universal constancy, not versatile by every blast
of Authority, and ambulatory at Princes their pleasure,
doth it not rather augment then diminish their
praise.</p>
            <p>You adde, <hi>That in England, though a Popish and
persecuting Queen interveened, betwixt the first Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of King</hi> Edward, <hi>and the second of Queen</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:59845:239"/>
               <hi>yet none rebelled.</hi> And what then? Pray Sir,
how or wherefore doth <hi>Scotland</hi> want that glory?
Sure I am, that the Reformation being established
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> after a sharp war (and by the way, you
may remember, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> sided with the
subject) both by Pacification, Authority and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of a General Assembly, yet we receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> a declared violent
Papist, without the least question anent her right of
Government, or any opposition moved against her,
until provoked by such weakness &amp; wickednesse, as I
am ashamed to mention. Wherein then in this regard
are we inferior to <hi>England,</hi> unless it be that neither
for the favour nor fear of a woman, we were moved
by any publict act, let be by vote of Parliament, as the
Representative of that Nation, to deny the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, and
again take on theyoke of the <hi>Romane</hi> Antichrist? Or
how are you not ashamed, to reproach your Nation
with a nimious fervour, specially upon this occasion,
wherein our worthy Reformers did make the Court
complyance, back-drawing and lukwarmness of a
few temporizers, their great and continual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you tell us, <hi>that all that travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the World, can witness that we were not approven in
our late rebellion,</hi> and passing by <hi>Diodat, Spanhem,
Rivet, Salmasius, Blondel, Amerald,</hi> de <hi>Moulin,</hi> and
others, not named, as all either in print or publick
discourse declaring for you, you say, <hi>There was an
act made by the Consistory of</hi> Charentoun <hi>that no man
should be barred the communion for the</hi> Scots <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
except it were for a crime; And this,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
<hi>was a loud declaration of their disowning of our
practice?</hi> 'Tis answered. 1. Though you could give a
account of the opinion of the Nations abroad, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:59845:239"/>
our late wars, yet their judgement, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
so remote from their knowledge, and wherein,
the favour generally born to Kings, specially when
so fatally unfortunat as <hi>Charles</hi> the first was, is able
to create in the most part, very little inquisitive, a
very strong prejudice, cannot amount to a testimony
of any moment. 2. That the more knowing among
them did, both by their Histories and other writtings,
&amp; also by their letters, approve our proceedings, might
be very easily made out by an unanswerable conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendence;
nay that the generality both of <hi>Dutch</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> Protestants did condemne the King's party
and their practices, I am certain, none of these to
whom you appeal, in this matter, can justly disown
it. As for <hi>Diodat,</hi> and the rest you name, why do
you not e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hibite their words? You say indeed for
some of them, very wisely and safely, <hi>That they
did only declare themselves in their Discourses and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
And for these I think you must be excus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
because you heard them not. But for the
rest I ingage, that whatever passages you shall
adduce from them on your part, I shall redargue
either their information, in matter of fact, or
their reasons in matter of Right, to the satisfaction
of all unbyassed men: Beside <hi>Salmasius</hi> is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable,
in respect he was imployed, and got
money in the cause: and yet, in the judgement of
many, though he had unanswerable advantages, as
to the main design of his defence, he was even in that
shamefully baffled. And for <hi>Amerauld,</hi> read but his
own vain and ridiculous Dedication of his paraphrase,
upon the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> to the King, in the year of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and I am certain you will allow us to think
the want of his suffrage no prejudice to our cause.
Now for your act made at <hi>Charenton</hi> I confess your
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:59845:240"/>
not producing of it doth the more dissatisfy, because
you represent it in termes little consistent, <hi>viz. That the
Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Excommunication should not debar, unless it were for
a crime.</hi> That you take a crime in this place in its larger
acceptation, for an offense, and not in that more strict
and proper wherein Lawyers use it, it were disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
in me for to call it in question. But then how
Excommunication can otherwise proceed without
the allegation of any crime, as you seem to accuse us,
is indeed to me a difficulty inexplicable, &amp; whereof,
I am sure, our Church could not be guilty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seing the Consistorie could not doubt that the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> did hold an offense and obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to be the necessary causes of excommunication,
for them to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lighted the tryal by us made, and
judged the particular grounds of our procedure not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the general rule, had been breach of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
communion and charity, whereof your naked
assertion shall never make me think the <hi>French</hi>
Church guilty: withal yow know that the Bishop of
<hi>Galloway,</hi> whom you alledge to have been <hi>upon this
act admitted to the Lords Table, notwithstanding of his
excommunication,</hi> was excommunicate upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of clear crimes. So that, what you call
a loud declaration on the Consistories part, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
to be only a loud calumny on yours.
But, whatever be in that act, or the Bishops ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
upon his own information, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all your vain pretenses of contrary Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it is certain, that not only the truth and right
was on our side, but also that our practices were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven,
yea applauded and we therein encouraged by
letters from several of the reformed Churches, yet
extant upon record.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="463" facs="tcp:59845:240"/>But, in the next place, your. N. C. Demanding
it, <hi>you undertake to tell him ingenuously what precedents
there are in History for subjects fighting upon the account
of Religion. And the first,</hi> you say, <hi>that you know, is
that of</hi> Gregory <hi>the seventh arming the subjects of</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie
<hi>against</hi> Henry <hi>the fourth, from whom other Popes
taking example, they made no bones upon any displeasure,
pretending alwayes some matter of Religion, to depose
Princes, and liberat their subjects, As you instance
in</hi> Frederick <hi>the. 1. und</hi> 2. Lewes <hi>of</hi> Bavier, <hi>and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others, but the latest precedent,</hi> you say, <hi>is the
holy league of</hi> France, <hi>from which you think our whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
seems to be transcribed.</hi> I have on purpose exhibited
these passages together, that men may the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the malice of your calumny, which prefacing
and palliating with a great show of ingenuity, you
prosecute with meer falshood and impertinency. But
first, dare you, after second thoughts, affirme upon
your <hi>ingenuity,</hi> small as it is, that this History of
<hi>Gregory</hi> is the first precedent that occurres to you of
fighting for Religion? I have already told you, how,
before <hi>Constantin's</hi> Empire, the Christians in the
East, the <hi>Armenii</hi> by name, did by armes assert the
liberty of the Gospel, and rout <hi>Maximinus</hi> their
Persecutor, and that the <hi>Persian</hi> Christians, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
by their Princes, did implore the assistance of the
<hi>Romanes</hi> against them, is obviously notour. Are not
these then antient and undeniable precedents? But
2. What likeness find you in <hi>Gregories</hi> case to these
practices that we maintaine? An usurping Prelat,
according to the Spirit of pride and violence, moving
in that order, quarrels with the Emperour, anent the
investiture of Bishops, whether upon just grounds
or not, is not the present concern, and thereupon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
him, extites his Subjects, yet unstable
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:59845:241"/>
after a recent rebellion, to a second rising. Pray Sir, was
this a war provoked to by persecution &amp; the necessity
of defence, in which points, the justice of our courses
doth cheifly Consist? Sir, do you think that a war,
being sometime made upon a false or unjust pretense
of Religion, should be an instance sufficient to disprove
all warres whatsomever upon a Religious account?
Certainly, if we admit of such reasoning, the most
necessary and just defensive war that ever was or can
be supposed, may by the objecting (though most
groundlesly) of any of the most arrant rebellions, by
the same consequence be condemned. Seing therefore
that <hi>Gregorie's</hi> course was plainly wicked. 1. Because
his medling with the Emperour after this sort was a
proud usurpation. 2. Because whatever right or
wrong was in the matter, abstractly considered, yet,
without doubt, the Emperour's pretense was better
founded, then the Pop's. 3. Because he not only
abused the spirituall censure, but perverted it to the
instigatting to perjury, rebellion, and blood, for
his own tyrannous lust and ambition, your reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
us, who from our heart detest all such wayes;
either with this or any the like act of the papal inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
and domination, is but dull and ridicluous
envy.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Holy league</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> from which,
you say, <hi>our whole matter seems to be transcribed,</hi> Was
it not contrived and entered into, at least in pretense,
for the restoring and settling of <hi>Romes</hi> superstition,
and consequently for the extirpation of the protestant
Religion? How then can our necessary undertaking
for the defence of our selves, in the maintenace of the
true Religion, and covenanting together, in this
cause, expresly against <hi>Romes</hi> designes and instruments,
be assimulat to that precedent? Out of what Topicks
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:59845:241"/>
will you prove such direct opposites, as a League for
establishing error against truth, and a Covenant for
truth's defence, to be parallel? Or do you think,
that the same common name and forme of a League, or
the accidental similitude of certaine ordinary methods
and circumstances is sufficient to conclude all ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
accordingly modelled, under the same
character? But it is so certaine, that the most wicked
combinations of the ungodly may proceed in the same
form &amp; manner, with the righteous Covenants of the
faithful, and that as these may joyn themselves to
the Lord, in a perpetual Covenant, so those also may
conspire against the Lord and against his anointed,
plote against the just, and make a Covenant even
with hell and death, that I am ashamed of your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility.</p>
            <p>But you say, <hi>That herein we symbolize with Courtiers,
Canonists and Iesuites the worst gang of the Romane
Church, and yet fill heaven and earth with clamors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Church of</hi> England, <hi>for innocenter resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
Sir, This your <hi>(herein)</hi> needeth explication;
for that as they did, so do we enter into Leagues, is
too general to import any reflection: and as to the
specifications of that popish League, seing they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
our cases to no less opposition, then that
of error, persecution and destruction, on their part,
to truth, necessary defence and preservation, on our
part, what remains to make out this your objected
agreement? 'Tis true, these <hi>French</hi> leaguers were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and did pretend for their Religion, with an
avowed preference to the subordinate duty of their
allegeance to their Prince: but seing their religion was
a false superstition, and their ingagement neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by injurie, nor limited to defence, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
malice, Without the countenance of Authority,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:59845:242"/>
entered into, to suppresse, by bloud and violence,
truth and innocenie, our Covenant, authorized by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the unanimous vote of the Estates of Parliament,

both from our first and chief obligation
unto God, and unquestionable liberty and priviledge
of selfe defence, can not without an impious effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
be compared to that wicked and cruel Bond.
And here, if comparisons were not more odious then
pungent, it were easie for me to prove, that as our
<hi>National Covenant</hi> was at first made in opposition to
the bloudy decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the
combinations framed for execut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and our
<hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> afterward ingaged in, upon the
express consideration of the continual plotes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
of the enemies of God, against his truth; so,
it is only the practice of your Prelats, their persecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </gap>ellum Episcopale,</hi> and not our defensive Covenants, that
can be reproached with the imitation of these popish
courses. But seing the necessity and justice of our cause
was plainly such, as neither can be convelled by your
aspersions, nor needeth the confirmation of the
known precedents of the <hi>French,</hi> and other protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
counter-leaguing, in opposition to that wicked
League devised against them, I shall not detain you
longer on this subject.</p>
            <p>As for the Church of <hi>England's</hi> seeming to sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize
with <hi>Rome,</hi> in some innocenter things, as you
phrase it, I wish she were indeed as innocent in that
matter, as we are in what you objecte. But seing
what you would only have to be a seeming appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
is a manifest reality, already clearly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
by the Authors of <hi>Altare damascenum,</hi>
and the <hi>English Popish Ceremonies;</hi> passing this poor
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59845:242"/>
reflection, as one of your affected transitions, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
you to your next purpose.</p>
            <p>Which you table by a challenge from your N. C.
<hi>that you still retain the papacie, and do only change the
person from the Pope, to the King, whom you make, and
swear to, as Head of the Church.</hi> And to this you ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
very vehemently, <hi>that it is an impudent calumny,
as you promise to clear by an account of the whole matter.</hi>
But behold the worthie performance; a lame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
pitiful storie, <hi>how the Pope, beside his general
tyrannie, did, upon King</hi> John <hi>his base r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>signation,
exercise over</hi> England <hi>a particular authority; that after
the Reformation and the shaking of the papal voke, the Oath
of Supremacie was brought in, to exclude all forraign Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
and reinstate the King is his Civill Authority;
That</hi> Henrie <hi>the 8th did indeed set up a Civill Papacie,
but the Reformation of</hi> England <hi>was never dated from his
breach with</hi> Rome: <hi>that the Oath of supremacie was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
designed to take away the Churches intrinseck Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
or to make the power of Ordination, of giving Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
or of Discipline to flow from the King, that
however, because the generality of the words might sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
scruples, they are explained in an Act of Parliament
of Q.</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and in one of the 29. Articles, and
morefully by B.</hi> Usher <hi>with King</hi> Iames <hi>approbation. And
lastly since we have this oath from</hi> England, <hi>none ought to
scruple, the words being sufficiently plain, and the
English meaning ours.</hi> This is the full and clear account
which you promise; But who knows not these poor
and insignificant pretenses: King <hi>Iohn's</hi> resignation
was indeed so base, that by all disinterested it was ever
held to be invalid, and in after times scarce ever men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
let be pleaded. It is therefore the Pop's <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
tyrannie,</hi> and what it was, and whether abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in these Kingdomes, or in effect only transferred
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:59845:243"/>
from him to the Prince, that we are here to consider.
And, I think, I may take it for granted, that you
judge the Pope's exorbitant usurpation, specially his
assumming to himselfe, not an external assisting over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
(which we grant to be the proper right of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
but, by way of an intrinseck and direct power, the
sole and uncontrolable care of the Church, her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
and ministers, with his arrogating an architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick
power in the ordering of Gods Worship, so
that in all Ecclesiastick meetings and matters therein
proposed, he may enact what canons he pleases, to
be parts of the Papal tyranny, not only as in him, but
in all men under our Lord Jesus Christ, unwarrantable
and antichristian; nay some of these are points of so
high a nature, that the greater part, even of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, do reclaim against them.
Now questionlesse if this power be to the Pope un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
and incompetent, all secular persons and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are therefore much more excluded, in asmuch as
the Pope being at least in shew a Church-man, and,
according to the hypothese even of your Hierarchy,
the first Bishop of the westerne, if not of the whole
Church, he is fortified by certain seeming pretenses,
of which the clame of civil Princes is wholly desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.
To come then to our purpose, that after the
Reformation, the Popish yoke not only as to the
particulars above mentioned, but also as to his forreign
Jurisdiction, unlawfully usurped over Church-men
in civills, to the prejudice of the King's Soveraignity;
was righteously shaken off, and the King re-instated in
his Civil authority, over all Persons, and also, in all
Causes, in so far as they are committed to his royal
direction and tuition, is not at all denyed: If that
matters had here sisted, and upon the abolition of
the Papal domination, the things of God and of <hi>Caesar</hi>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:59845:243"/>
had been equally restored, who could have gain-said
it? But that, on the contrary, by the Pop's exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and, in place of this righteous restitution, the
King, under pretence of the vindication of his own
Supremacy, did procure to himself a very formal and
full translation of what the Pope had not only usurped
from him, but arrogate from God, specially in the
things above-specified, both the occasion of this
change, and the manner how this Supremacy hath
since been exercised, do aboundantly declare. And
for clearing the occasion, it may be remembred,
1. That the <hi>Peter</hi>-pence, called in the beginning the
King's almes, imposed by on <hi>Ina</hi> King of the <hi>West
Saxons,</hi> was discharged by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament in the
reigne of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and the contention anent
the exemption of Church-men from the King's Courts
most hotly agitate, in the reig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of <hi>Henry</hi> Second and
King <hi>Iohn,</hi> was composed many years before the
dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight: So that neither that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
nor this old debate, and far less King <hi>Iohn's</hi>
most invalide resignation, not worth the naming,
could be the cause of King <hi>Henry</hi> his acclaiming the
Supremacy. 2. The only motive that we find in His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
whereby <hi>Henry</hi> was instigat to reject the <hi>Pope,</hi>
and to declare himself to be supreme in causes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick,
aswell as civil, was his purpose of divorce
from Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> wherein, finding himself abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Legates their delayes, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
all appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> appointing them to be
made from the Comissary to the Bishop, from the
Bishop to the Archbishop, and from the Archbishop
to the King, and is thereafter first called by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and then declared by the Parliament, to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
head of the Church, in liew of the Pope, whose
authority was abrogat by the same Act: These things
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:59845:244"/>
then being certain, and you your selfe acknowledging
<hi>that King</hi> Henry <hi>did set up a civil Papacy,</hi> It is easy to
determine, that this change was not a bare exclusion,
but a plain translation of the Popes usurped power.
<hi>We know the Reformation of</hi> England <hi>was never dated
from that breach with the Bishop of Rome:</hi> But what then?
Can you deny that this was both the rise and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Supremacy, which being transmitted
to <hi>Edvard</hi> the sixth, and then renounced by Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> and again restored to the Pope, was by Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> reassumed, and so continueth untill this day?
It is true, that after the breaking up of the more clear
light of Reformation, whereby not only <hi>Rom's</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
bot also the Popes usurpation and tyranny,
in many things, was, upon better reasons, rejected,
and especially after the succession of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
to whose Sexe the former title of headship, for all
the smoothings that had been before used, was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
construed not to be so agreeable. Many expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
were adhibite for qualifying the Supremacy,
both in answer to the opposition of Papists and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
the offence of the Protestant Churches. But
the truth is, these explications, though more sound in
their grounds, yet, in their explication, were noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conclusive as to the present debate, and their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
arguing for the Supremacy from the examples
of reforming Kings and Emperours, acting not by
vertue of an assumed prerogative, but only from that
extraordinary power, which the necessity of the end,
upon the failzour of other midses, doth measure out
to Princes first, and to others also, if in a competent
capacity, did rather infer the justification of the work,
then conclude the approbation of the Supremacy, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
it was therein imployed. Nay, while
by these their reasonings, they went about from such
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:59845:244"/>
extraordinary interpositions, only warranted by the
exigence of necessity, and the rectitude of the work
thereby effectuat, to establish to the Prince a constant
setled authority, properly conversant about these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the argument is far more absurd, then if because
a Governour may, in a manifest incident disorder
falling, for example, in a Family, repone the Father
and head thereof to his paternal oversight, one should
thence conclude to the same Governour, a proper
power and faculty of placeing and displaceing Heads
of Families, and appointing the Rules thereof at his
pleasure. Now that thus it fell out in <hi>England</hi> after
the Reformation, and that the same (if not a more
exorbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant power) taken from the Pope, was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
and setled upon the Crown, as a perpetual pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
thereof, is in the second place by the manner of
its exercise, and its ensuing fruits, ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y evidently
held out. For proofe whereof, the office and actings
of the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> as Vicare General, appointed
by <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, over the spirituality, though
by the good providence of God ordered to be a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mean for advance of the Reformation, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
argument. And as to the continuance of the
same usurpation, in order to other effects in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
evill, and not to be justified, there needeth no
curious search; the frequent practices of after Princes,
laying claime to this power, namely <hi>Elizabeth, Iames</hi>
and <hi>Charles,</hi> in their ecclesiastick medlings, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of his Majesty now regnant, in his interposing
in Church-matters, and thereby overturning a true
Gospe-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ministry, introducing a new model of Church-government,
absolutely dependent upon himselfe,
reviving vain, groundless and antiq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> ceremonies,
appointing and imposing new Religions, Dayes and
Forms. And lastly, giving Rules to Ministers their
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:59845:245"/>
doctrine, what points to preach and what to omit
all according to the device of his own heart, are an
obvious demonstration: which things are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so evident, that I strange you should accuse
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eight of a civil Papacy, and so inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
acquit al his Successors: Whereas, in effect,
they not only acted in Church-matters after the same
method by him observed, using the same prerogative,
in the grant of their High Commissions and in other
acts, which he exercised in his vicarious deputation;
but he is the Prince who (waving his haltings upon the
other side, and considering the necessity there was at
that time, of an extraordinary remedy, for the good
things that he did) seemeth to have employed their
usurped Supremacy most excusably, and also very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously
for the promoving of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Bot you tell us, <hi>that the Oath of Supremacy was never
designed, to take away the Churches intrinseck power,
or to make the power of Ordination, of Sacraments, and
of Discipline, flow from the King.</hi> It is answered,
seing the many evill effects of this Supremacy, do so
pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly evince its direct and proper tendency, and its
late explanation by Act of Parliament, doth put its
nature and extent beyond all controversy, to tell us
what at first it was or was not designed for, is but a
vain suggestion. And therefore according to these
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urer grounds, I must now tell you. 1. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the King, not likely to be tempted by such an
empty curiosity, hath neither expresly declared in
his own favour, nor assumed to himselfe the exercise
of this power of administration; yet that by vertue of
his Supremacy, as it now stands explained, he may
do both or either, when he pleaseth, is not to be
doubted. I need not reminde you that any Church-power,
not acknowledging a dependence upon, and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:59845:245"/>
subordination unto the Soveraign Power of the King
as Supreme, is abrogate and discharged. But, pray
Sir, he who may enact what he thinketh fit concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Ecclesiastick meetings and matters, may he
not, if he think fit, declare himself to have the
power of the ministerial function? Nay, what may
he not do? But 2. admitting that this was not
meaned by the Parliament, in their explanation, and
that in probability the King will never affect the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
yet that the intrinseck power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
belonging to the Church, both as to a Society
of our Lords erection, and by his express gift and
concession, is by the Supremacy taken away, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it will be so far from being disowned, that it is
rather vaunted of as its principal end and advantage.
But referring the truth and evidence of this point,
anent the power of Government, given by our Lord
immediatly to his Church, to what hath been very
fully by others declared, and is by me above hinted
at, I verily think, that though we had no other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
save the sad changes that of late have ensued
upon the usurpation of this Supremacy, the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and excellency of this intrinseck Government,
is thereby rendered apparent, beyond the evidence of
any further confirmation. And really when, together
with the authority of its founder, I consider the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
necessity and expedience of an internal power
of Government in the Church, as the most significant
mean for making all its other gifts, powers, &amp; offices
effectual, And how much it is commended by the
signal usefulness of a proper Government in every So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
but more especially to our adversaries by that
high yea sacred estimat, which they so much incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
of that Civil-government, and all its punctilios,
whereupon their interest depends, and when, on the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:59845:246"/>
other hand, I reflect upon the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ous and woful
influences, that in all ages have constantly attended
either the suppression or usurpation of this great divine
ordinance, I cannot sufficiently regrete, that the
pride, ambition and vanity of men, in setting up and
advancing this Supremacy, should be so sinfully
subservient to the Divell's great design, of crossing
the progress of the Gospel, and propogating irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
Which evil is the more to be lamented, that
nothwithstanding that our own experience of its
wretched consequences, doth evidently redargue this
usurpation, yet these men who, in the matter of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
government, make every circumstance sacred,
and exclaime against the smallest innovation, as if all
confusion were imminent, can and do, in the business
of Ecclesiastick government, with a more then <hi>Gallio</hi>
indifferency and coldness, slight all its concerns, in
opposition to their carnal designes, as questions of <hi>meer
outward forms,</hi> and <hi>the skirts and suburbs of Religion, far
removed from its life and substance.</hi> Whereas it is very
certain, that eternal life and salvation, the great end,
is not more preferable to temporal peace and outward
tranquillity, then our zeal for the government of
God's House, institute by himselfe in his Church, in
order to our everlasting welbeing, ought to exceed
our regard to Civil government, which in this respect,
are but the ordinances of man, in order to our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
interests: Nay, so apparent is the lukwarmness
&amp; hypocrisy of mens reasonings in behalfe of this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
that though in the supposition that our Lord
had by himselfe immediatly erected in any Kingdom,
a Society or incorporation with masters, laws, and a
competent jurisdiction, in order to some temporal
advantage, as he hath, in the acknowledgement of
all, institute his Church with Ordinances, Officers,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:59845:246"/>
and Government suited to its great ends, all ration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
men let be the members of that Society, would judge
the King's pretending to an arbitrary and absolute dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of these previleges thus granted, to be an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
invasion and usurpation. Yet, in order to the
Church and her rights and immunities, they are not
ashamed to cut off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o even and just a parallel, and deny
so evident a consequence in behalf of her righteous
liberty: <hi>But wisdome is justified of her children.</hi> And
how much were it to be wished, that, at the least,
the children of light were as wise as the children of
this world are in their generation. 3. Beside the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion
threatened to the Church, in its power of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
and the usurpation from the Church of
the power of Government, which this Supremacy
imports, it further attributes to the Prince, according
to our Parliaments late explication, an illimited
power in matters of Religion, proper and reserved to
God alone. To enact whatever a man thinketh fit in
Ecclesiastick meetings and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ers, I am certain, is
that which the Lord did never allow to any meer man
under heaven; and yet that this power is assumed,
and how, by vertue thereof, old, unwarrantable super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions
have been retained, new rites and ceremonies
in Divine Worship devised, and Churches turned and
overturned, according to mens pleasure, is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known without my condescendence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
seing the King, by vertue of his Supremacy,
doth not only intermedle, by giving his civill sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and confirmation to the intrinseck powers of the
Church, by you mentioned, as you do allege, or
by acts imperate, as others, in contradistinction to
elicite acts in these matters, doe use to express it,
but doth lay claime to an absolute power in and over
all Church-matters and persons, the filly pretense
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:59845:247"/>
whereby you go about to smooth it is not worthie of
any mans notice.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you tell us <hi>of some explications pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for removing of the scruples, which the generality of
the words of the oath of Supremacy might suggest.</hi> And to
this it may suffice for answer, that seing these expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
are certainly confined to <hi>England,</hi> and by no
publick Act received or owned among us, your alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
with your childish ground, that we have this
oath from them, is wholly impertinent as to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
But seing the setting down of these explications,
contained in the <hi>English</hi> act and Articles above cited,
(Which you do counningly omit) will not only,
by comparing therewith the far different practices of
the Kings of that Realme, discover the inadequatnesse,
not to say the slightnesse of these sensings, in effect
meerly devised to palliat an excess in it self nowise
justifiable, but more fully manifest the strange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance
both of the practical acceptation, and late
express interpretation of this Supremacie. You may
read them as follows; the words of the Act in <hi>quinto
Elizab. Declare her power and Authority to be a soverai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity
over all manner of persons, borne within the Realme,
whether they be</hi> ecclesiastical <hi>or</hi> temporal, <hi>so that no
forreigne power hath or ought to have any superiority over
them,</hi> and these of the Articles, run thus. <hi>Art. 37.
We give not to our Princes the ministring either of Gods.
Word or of the Sacraments, the which thing the injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
also lately set forth by</hi> Elizab <hi>our Queen do most plainly
testifie: but that only prerogative, which we see to have
been given alwayes to all godly Princes, in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
by God himselfe, that is, that they should rule all
Estates and degrees committed to their charge by God,
whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain
with the civill sword the stubborne, and evill doers.</hi> These
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:59845:247"/>
being the termes of these explications, what conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie the medlings of their Princes in imposing rites,
ceremonies and formes of Worship, enjoyning their
own dayes, and profaning God's, commanding what
Doctrine Ministers should forbear, permitting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comunication
in their own name jointly with the
Lords, and finally, by sitting and ruling in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, as in their own Court, do hold therto,
is obvious to the first reflection: Only this I must say,
that if the Kings of <hi>England</hi> their Ecclesiastick actings
be indeed sufficiently warranted, by the foregoing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations,
the Author of the late discourse of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick policy, who, in prosecution of the King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, doth plainly annexe unto it the Authority
of the preisthood, and power over the conscience, at
least the obedience of men, in matters of Religion;
in place of that applause, wherwith he is generally
received at Court, deserves rather to be demeaned as
the highest calumniator and depraver of his Majesties
government.</p>
            <p>But not to trouble you further with these double
English senses, <hi>viz</hi> that pretended by their Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and Articles, which I grant to be more sound,
and such wherewith many godly men have rested sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and the other more true, received and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
by their Court and Clergie, nor yet to insist upon
your <hi>incomparable and blessed</hi> (Who now hath mens
persons in admiration?) <hi>Bishop Usher</hi> his more full
interpretation equally redargued by what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
said. Let us consider our <hi>Scots</hi> most excessive,
though more ingenuous, explanation; and although,
I do apprehend the words of the Oath of Supremacie
to be in themselves capable of a sound sense, and that
by understanding <hi>supreme Governour of this Kingdome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not to be a limiting designation, but a plain qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:59845:248"/>
of the nature of the government as being in order
to its correlat this Kingdome, in it selfe civil, and only
in this notion, to be extended to persons and causes
ecclesiastick, all difficulties may be salved; yet, when
to the rise and manner of this Supremacie above decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
I adde how of late it hath been made the ground
of the King his restoring of Bishops, and framing
their government to an absolute dependence upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

               </gap>rted to that
absurd hight, as doth import a plain surrender of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and submission of all Matters of Religion
(for as to civills, we are not so rash) to his Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
pleasure, in a more absolute manner, then ever
to this day hath been acclaimed either by Pope or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council. These things, I say, being weighed,
I think I may safely conclude, that I look upon the
Supremacie not only as a <hi>civill Papacie,</hi> but an height of
usurpation against our Lord, King in Zion, whereunto
never Christian Prince nor Potentate did heretofore
aspire.</p>
            <p>And here, your N. C. seconding my assertion
tells you, <hi>that this Supremacie clearly makes way for
Erastianisme.</hi> To which you answer, <hi>That this is one of
our mutinous arts, to find out long &amp; hard names, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe

childishness of this conceite, as if either a long or hard

N. C. rather vail it with an obscure name, then
leave it to an open discoverie; and in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it was, that the men of your gang, after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to broach their dangerous, dissolute, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
principles, thought fairly to have palliate
all with the gentle name of <hi>Latitudinarian,</hi> as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
obleidging to all parties: But now that they
are detected, they turn their talk, and loth to marr
their affected smoothness by terming it otherwise
then, <hi>the long name,</hi> they blame us for loading them
with reproach: whereas, to the best of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
it was their own invention and choise. But
not to detaine you about names, which really I do
so little value, in any respect, that I do not so much
as regard the name <hi>Fanatick,</hi> nor these many other,
wherewith the truth, and partie, which I maintain
have been standered, let us proceed to what you say to
the things.</p>
            <p>And first you tell us, <hi>that in the old Testament the
Kings of</hi> Judah <hi>frequently medled in divine matters, and
the</hi> Sanhedrin, <hi>which was a civill Court determined in all
matters of Religion,</hi> 'Tis answered, did you not just
now give us an account of certain restrictive explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made of the Supremacie? What do you then
intend by these instance? Not that I do exclude Kings
from a due medling in divine matters, or do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the righteous practices of the Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> in
the largest construction that they can receive; But
certainly, if what you say of their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> be true,
it will overturne all your pretended limitatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, at
least, give to the King a determining judgement in all
matters of Religon, which neither ought, nor can
be admitted. But. 2. This threed-bare argument, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and the Sanhedrin, for
your Supremacie, is so fully answered by others, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:59845:249"/>
by Mr. <hi>Gillespie,</hi> in his <hi>Aaron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Rod;</hi> and
he hath so evidently cleared, that there was a Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin
ecclesiastick, distinct from the civill, and that
these two governments were not confounded, that I
wonder you are not ashamed of such jejune repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And, in effect, it is so plain in Scripture,
that none of these Kings did interpose in matters of
Religion, otherwise then by their extrinseck over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
and assistance, except either by immediat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and direction from God, as it happened in
the establishment made by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> not
to be drawn in consequence, or els in the case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Reformation, in which, ordinary means
ceasing, the obligation of the end doth authorize
even more extraordinary endeavours, that seing the
Lord himselfe did immediatly reprove the usurpation
of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> I can not imagine from what particular
precedent you do designe your advantage. However,
of one thing I am most perswaded, and I am chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to think that all your confidence dare not deny
it, that had any one of the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> arrogate to
himselfe a Supremacie in all causes, and over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
aswell Ecclesiastick as Civill so as to declare
that whatsoever he, should enact, anent Ecclesiastick
meetings or matters should be obeyed and observed
by all his subjects, he had been repute no other then a
rebell and usurper against God, and a proud contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his Law: And as for the <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> though
it were not proven that there was one Ecclesiastick,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n other Civill, yet their distinct, sacred, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
Preisthood, doth so strangly plead for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
separation where we find the Lord to have made
a divided institution, that any conjunction in that
Court, or any thing beside occasioned by their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
mixed Policy, can nowise infer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
you plead for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="481" facs="tcp:59845:249"/>The next thing you say is, <hi>That the Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
did medle in matters of Religion,</hi> 'Tis <hi>ans.</hi> That the
first Chistian Emperours did medle in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
so as to confirme the truth and Ecclesiastick
decrees by their Civill sanction, to establish the
Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch in the condition wherein they found her, to
adorne her with certain priviledges, enrich her with
revenues, and beautifie her with fair structures, is
not denyed; But what is all this to your Supremacie?
And who is he who doth not wish for a just measure
of the like favour and assistance? You add, <hi>that they
called the first general</hi> Councils. And why not? Who
denyes that the King may, within his Dominious,
do the like? But the point you drive, is to have this
power to the King solely, and exclusive of any right
and power in the Church to appoint and meet in such
Assemblies, (what ever be the necessity) contrary
to the Kings prohibition: And that, for order and
decency, the King's consent and countenance should
first be sought, nay, that his refusal ought to be of
that moment as not to be counter-ballanced, but by a
very visible urgencie, is by all granted. Only that
he hath an absolute <hi>veto</hi> in this matter, I positively
and firmly deny: for, seing it is evident, that the
Church, while under pagane Princes, did enjoy
this power, how she should lose it, upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Christian, otherwise then to be tyed, out
of respect and for order, to make to him the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
to be regulable by his reasons, and very
tender of his displeasure, is utterly unexplicable, and
were in plain termes to defer to them as Christians,
though acting as Antichristians, and worse then their
pagane predecessors. And further it may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the power of conveening in Council, being
founded on the same warrant with the Churches li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:59845:250"/>
to meet for the duties of Worship, the former
no more then the later can be made dependent upon
the Prince his pleasure.</p>
            <p>But you subjoine, <hi>that they presided in these Councils:</hi>
And to this there is no answer like unto your own,
<hi>viz. that in presiding they only ordered matters but did
not decide in them;</hi> which, together with a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator,
after the example of the first <hi>Nicen</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
wherein <hi>Constantine</hi> presiding, <hi>Eustathius</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
did by prayer open the Council, you know we
do willingly allow. But to help you a little in this
point, I grant that <hi>Theodosius</hi> in the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> seems to have gone a great length; yet all
that we find upon record is that the Council being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
without issue, by the opinions of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe,
&amp; of the <hi>Macedonians, Arrians &amp; Ennomians,</hi>
the Emperour requires their several confessions, and,
after much earnest prayer to God for light and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he declares for the <hi>Nicen</hi> Faith; whereunto
the Synod agreeing, the contrary heresies are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
And this was no doubt a very laudable prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
warranted both by the exigent and the truth it
selfe, whereby many things less regular, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
an ordinary and proper power in the Author
for their warrant, have very often been sustained. A
good turne, specially when done in the cessation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
midses, doth sufficiently subsist by its own merit.
<hi>Iehojada</hi> a Priest in a state of necessity, armes against
a Tyranne, and reformes the Kingdome: But can you
or any man thence conclude, that therefore he acted
from an ordinary power and facultie, a priviledge
proper to his office? Why then should men be so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly
unequal, as from the like extraordinary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of Princes, in Church perturbations, to
attribute to them a proper inherent right and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
prerogative?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="483" facs="tcp:59845:250"/>Next you say, <hi>That the Emperours also judged in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Schisme.</hi> But seing that any judgement given by
them was consequent to the Churches determination,
though perhapes with a little attemperation for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,
whereof determinations in these matters do
very naturally allow, the instance is no more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
then the rest you have adduced. But <hi>the</hi> Code,
Basilicks &amp; <hi>Capitulers of</hi> Charles <hi>the great shew that they
never thought it without their sphere to make laws in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
matters.</hi> 'Tis answ. This objection shewes, that
either you are little acquainted with what is in these
Books, or little advertent to the conclusion you have
in hand. The laws you mention, are either imperial
confirmations of the truth, owned by the Church,
or for condemning and punishing of declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
or for authorizing and ordering a slender um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
of jurisdiction called <hi>episcopalis audientia,</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Church-men in charitable and favourable cases,
or for restraining and correcting their dissolute man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or lastly, anent the regulating, of Hospitals,
Alms-houses, &amp; other things, pertaining to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
policy of the Church. Pray Sir, what make
these for your Supremacie? Or was ever this part of
his Majesties power by us questioned? But where
wil you finde, in all approven antiquity, that ever
a Prince by vertue of a pretended inherent right in his
Crown, or any acclaimed prerogative and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,
in causes Ecclesiastick, took upon him, with
one blow, summarily to overturne the established Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of a Church, by himselfe formerly by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Oath confirmed, introduce new Office-bearers,
set up a new frame of Church-government, declaring
himselfe to be the sole head and fountain thereof, to
whom all others, as subordinat, must be accountable
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:59845:251"/>
for their admistrations? In what antient record did
you ever read of a Commission granted by a King for
Ecclesiastick affaires, impowering Secular persons to
appoint Ministers to be censured by suspension and
deposition, and Church-men to punish by fining,
confining, incarcerating, and other corporal
paints? What Emperour or Prince did ever assume to
himselfe, in the right of his royal power, at once to
impose upon a whole Church a new liturgie and form
of service never before heard of among them? Or,
did it ever enter in the heart of a Christian Potentat
to declare for a Law, that what ever he should please
to enact anent Church-meetings and matters should
upon the publication be by all obeyed and observed,
and, in suite of it, to statute, that if either Minister
or other person, not allowed by his or his Bishops
authority, do preach, expone Scripture, or pray,
except in his own house, and to these only of his
own family, it shall be judged a Coventicle, and
liable to pains of Law? These are a part of the native
fruits of your Supremacie. If you look back to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
it by antient precedents, pray, give us but one
parallel. I grant, that <hi>Iustinian,</hi> in some of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
after having declared and confirmed the
truth, received by the Church, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>termined by
her Councils; not only <hi>condemnes,</hi> but <hi>anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizes</hi>
the contrary heresies. But seing his using of that
phrase peculiar to the Church, and properly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a power, acknowledged not to be competent
to secular Athority, doth only express his more enixe
detestation of these errours, and approbation of the
Church her censures against them, it cannot with any
colour of reason, be made use of for your purpose.</p>
            <p>But you proceed to tell us, <hi>that the Bishops, not
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:59845:251"/>
excepting the Bishope of</hi> Rome, <hi>were named, at least their
elections approven by the</hi> Emperours. And what then?
For my part, if the Emperour, and all Christian
Princes should agree at once, to reduce them, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
as they advanced them, it should not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an invasion of the Churches power or priviledge.
But, because it is like that these Emperours, you
speak of, did indeed regard them, as true Church-officers,
&amp; nevertheless medled, as is mentioned, in
their elections, I answer further, that the true cause
of Princes their first medling in the elections of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops
was, either the diffidence of the Bishops, as
to that office and title, wherein not being satisfied
from Scripture-warrant, they were inclined to apply
to the Emperour for the supplement of his confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or els their solicitous ambition, which, in
thesearly contests that they had for precedency, did
prompt them, among other artifices, to fortify their
pretensions by the Emperour's favour and suffrage.
However this is very certain, that whether the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
medling was first procured by the Bishops ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,
or did flow from their own proper motive,
had these Church-men contained themselves within
the rules and limits set to them by our Lord, they
had never judged the Emperours confirmation requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the validity of their office and title: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seing the true account of this matter, is, that
the aspiring of Ecclesiasticks did give the first rise unto
this secular medling, whether we take it to be no
usurpation, as being conversant about that, which,
to say the truth, is not Christian, let be Ecclesiastick,
or to be a partaking in the Church-men their usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either of the two do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h equally make void your
argument.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="486" facs="tcp:59845:252"/>After the reasons, which we have heard, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<hi>That Kings their medling in Ecclesiastick affaires,
was never controverted, till the Romane Church swelled
to the hight of tyranny, and since the reformation, it hath
been still stated, as one of the differences betwixt us and
them.</hi> It is answered. If Princes had at first exceeded
and intruded too far in Church-matters, and then
the <hi>Pope</hi> acted by a worse spirit, and no less aspiring,
had risen up against his Masters, and thrust himselfe
into their rooms, what would this make for your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?
Or doth it to either of them conclude a
right? Suppose a Papist debating this question should
argue thus, <hi>that the Pope his headship in Ecclesiastick
affaires in</hi> England <hi>was never controverted, till</hi> Henry
<hi>the Eight, impatient through lust, did arrogate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the Supremacy, and since that time it hath still been
stated as one of the controverted differences,</hi> would you
think this reasoning pungent? Why then is not your
discerning equall to your judgement? But the clear
truth in this matter is, that although the Emperours
of old did, at no time, lay claime to this Supremacy
questioned, yet they and the succeeding Princes,
having too much connived at and countenanced the
Antichristian ambition, working in Prelacy toward
the Papacy, it was from the righteous judgement of
God, that, upon its exaltation, they were blinded
and involved in these contentions, and justly plagued
by the transcendent insolence of an evill, which they
had too much fomented: And therefore your dating
the period of these contests from the setting up of the
Papal tyranny, doth contribute nothing to your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
And where you say, <hi>that since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Supremacy hath still been stated as one of our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
from them,</hi> 'Tis very certain, that it hath been
granted by all the reformed Churches, that Princes
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:59845:252"/>
may and ought to reassume their own power and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
given unto the Beast, in so far as, in the times
of the prevailing of the mystery of iniquity, it was
either by force extorted, or by fraud elicite from
them: But that any King or Prince, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
of recovering his own from the Pope, should
lay claim to all that he hath usurped, either against
our Lord, or over his Church, nay to more then ever
any Pope did arrogate, which is the case and import
of your Supremacy, is that whereunto, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
no true subject of Jesus Christ, and enemy of
Antichrist can judiciously assent: And therefore if in
this we do more solidly &amp; soundly maintain the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
betwixt the Reformed and Popish Churches,
and, while we assert our Lord's prerogative and his
Churches priviledge against the <hi>Pope,</hi> do not betray
them to any other pretender, we hope our differing
from you, aswell as the Papists, in this matter, shall
only witness us to be the more upright defenders
and no deserters of the Protestants plea, and the
truth of God. Now, this is That Supremacie
which as I have very plainly and graphically represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without making use of Scolastick termes or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions,
in my opinion not more frequent then su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>luous
in a matter so palpable; so I am confident
that every one who hath that true understanding of the
fear of God, and the sincere love of our Lord Jesus,
will ever abhorre it with all its wicked effects.</p>
            <p>But you in your crastines do not only make your.
N. C. cede as it were to your reasonings, but in a
manner own the late pretended <hi>Indulgence,</hi> as flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Supremacie, on purpose to fix upon
these few Ministers of ours, who have been thereby
restored, at least, a constructive approbation of this
evill. And thus you move your N. C. to say <hi>that he
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:59845:253"/>
hopes you are so much for the Supremacy, as not to quarrel
at this</hi> Indulgence <hi>lately granted;</hi> and by way of reply
you tell him, <hi>how good Subjects you are not to criticize
upon your Soveraign's pleasure, and how much more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
then we, who would not have received ann.</hi> 1641
<hi>such a proposition from the King in favours of the Doctors
of</hi> Aberdeen; And from this, falling to touch our
opposing the readmission of Malignants to the Army
against the <hi>Englishes,</hi> you exceedinly please your selfe
in your own well-natur'd compliance, and would
have even the jealousy and aversion, which some of
you have for this favour, commend your submission
as the <hi>greater vertue,</hi> because against your inclination.
But, not to lose time in these your trifflings, the weak
shadowings of your vain imagination, to be brieff
and round with you, I differ from your N. C. and
am so much against the Supremacy, that I abominat
the <hi>Indulgence</hi> under this name. That God hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the King, to restore, in any measure, what was
so sinfully taken away, we account it a great blessing,
wishing that he may be in such manner satisfied with
the fruits of this course as may more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him of its righteousness, and encourage him
to its prosecution: But if you or any els do think, by
this poor and scant restitution, to bribe the Lords
People to a consent to the rest of your usurpations,
and a more tame compliance with all the other
wrongs and mischiefs, that you have done and are still
doing, we trust the Lord shall deliver his own from
so fearfull a snare: And that as hitherto our Ministers
have looked upon themselves as such, neither of man
nor only by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the
Father; so they will accordingly acquit themselves,
and in a special manner (as they expect our Lords
presence to be with them) testify for his right and
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:59845:253"/>
ordinance against all invasions, and that so much the
more, as the hard condition of the present times hath
in some sort ingaged them to a seeming allowance, of
which they ought to purge themselves in the first
place.</p>
            <p>As for your <hi>being better subjects to the King then we
are;</hi> we know indeed that many, if not all, of you,
either principally designing, or els simply deluded
by outward peace and ease, do, in order to this end,
not only acknowledge the King as Supreme, but in
effect adore and revere him as the most high, and for
the freedome of your persons and fortunes, really
enslave your consciences to his dictates: But, as this
is a subjection no more stable and fixed, then the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability
of that interest, whereon it depends; so it is
a measure thereof, for which we do neither envy
you, nor for the want thereof fear to be less accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either with God or man. Only let me tell you,
that I take your not criticizing upon the late Licence,
a thing, though very hardly resolved upon, and no
better digested by your evill natures and foolish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice;
yet, in it selfe, most conducible, and in its
effect very advantagious to your ends, to be so much
the concernment of your interest, as scarce to be a
mark of just and ordinary subjection, let be to furn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
a complement to your slavish flattery.</p>
            <p>But you talk to us also of <hi>your greater moderation:</hi>
O the impudence! The Prelates having raged several
years in persecution and violence against persons, only
chargeable with a simple not-countenancing of their
evill courses, to the ruining of a part, and distressing
of the whole Countrey, and to the manifest hazard
of turning all to Confusion, a few of our Rulers more
wise (foreseeing the consequences) are at length
perswaded to a small relenting, and in hope thereby
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:59845:254"/>
more assuredly to compass their end of suppressing and
extinguishing the party by them feared, they resolve
rather to allay and break them, by pretended favour
and seeming indulgence: And this having succeeded
more happily, then either reason or sense can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the ever-jealous and cruel Prelatick Clergie,
you would have us so stupid as to applaud you for
your moderation, as exceeding any thing by us prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised.
But to convince you, by the retortion of your
own instance, Will you or any knowing man affirme,
that if there had been no more of necessity and interest
to plead for us, then appeared in the behalfe of the
Doctors of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> we had notwithstanding have
attained to this favour? For my part, I think it may
be demonstrate, that had that freedome been used by
us in open disputing and opposing, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
nay allowed to the Doctors, instead of
Answers, and Answers to Replyes, as they are term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we had certainly got Prisons and Gibbets. And
yet for all your calumnious alleageance, <hi>that they and
other worthy persons</hi> (whom nevertheless you wisely
forbear either to name or number) <hi>were by us driven
away by tumults and not by laws,</hi> It is known that all
they suffered was, after desperate obstinacy, to be
removed either by Law or Ecclesiastick-censure.</p>
            <p>The next thing whereby you go about to make out
your charge of rigor against us, is, that <hi>we purged our
Armies.</hi> And wherefore not? That evill men do not
by reason of sin forfeit their rights, and consequently
may lawfully defend them, is not denyed: But that
the Lord, having then so lately testified his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against the Malignant courses of the 1648.
And we having thereupon so solemnly vowed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
thereof, and a non-conjunction with all their
bettors, there was just reason, when the necessity
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:59845:254"/>
was not such as to leave no place for election, in the
fear of the Lord's displeasure, to preferre his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 23. v. 9. and our own ingagements unto
the then contrary pretensions; and to keep us from
every wicked thing, can not rationally be disproved.
However these things being now past, I love not to
rake in them, my hearts desire is, that the things
which have since befallen us, and seem to have so
clear a dependence upon the unstedfastness, insinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
mockery, heats and contentions of these bygone
transactions, may at length lead every serious fearer
and seeker of the Lord, unto a single and through
discovery, and the repentance which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>As for the advantage you would draw from this
objection, I have already told you that necessity and
interest do too visibly influence all your pretended
moderation, to leave you any matter of boasting in
your late abatements. But he who pleaseth to turne
his eye upon the other side, and there, with your
former Ecclesiastick rigors, behold your other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodes,
in appointing the <hi>Declaration,</hi> as an indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
condition of State-trusts, and in your manifest
discountenancing all of a different perswasion, will
certainly admire to find you so much exceed, even in
these very evills, which you would appeare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne.</p>
            <p>Now to your <hi>stiffling of jealousies,</hi> which vexe some
of your more weak and malicious Modells. We know
too well their selfish and cowardly dispositions, to
impute their not whispering to any true respect to
authority, more then the compliance of others to
your alledged moderation. To obey God more then
man, and therefore to suffer affliction <hi>cross to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,</hi>
is indeed a faire accession to the praise of
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:59845:255"/>
the grace of God in this <hi>greater vertue</hi> you vaunt of,
and wherein we desire to be found: But as for your
submission against certain blind perswasions, and
peevish fears (which you call your <hi>inclination</hi>) to that
absolute overswaying devotion, which we know you
bear to Peace and Ease, many of you have so notour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
already basely renounced, not only your God, but
your King (for whom you do more highly pretend)
for this interest, that you must pardon us, neither to
applaud your obedience nor submission from such
suggestions. And so indeed you insinuat more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly
then you are awar; for you say, that if <hi>we abuse
not this liberty we have got, you shall never complaine of it:</hi>
which according to the construction of abuses, held
out by your lawes and practices, doth so plainly sound,
if you neither offer to reclaime the people from their
rebellion against, and backsliding from the Lord, nor
to warne and testify against the courses, and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of an antichristian Supremacy and profane Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
that the benefite and security, which you would
obtain by the performance of this condition, doth
render your pretended acquiescence almost ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
            <p>But you go on to adde, <hi>Nay, you would rejoice to
finde it produce the effects, for which it is designed, viz.
to bring us to a more peaceable temper.</hi> And who either
doubteth this in your sense, or refuseth it in a just
sense? could we exchange a good conscience for
Court-compliance, or prefer Peace to Truth, which
do plainly appear to be the termes of difference,
wherein we stand, there is no question of your victory
and our agreement: But seing this may not be, and
your designe is at best preposterous, I hope, I shall
more easily obtaine your concurrence in my wish,
that the Gospel and godliness being by this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:59845:255"/>
advanced, true peaceableness and peace may
thence ensue.</p>
            <p>The second effect of this <hi>Indulgence</hi> by you intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Is to make us value and love more one of the noblest and
most generous Princes that ever ruled.</hi> Sir, you just now
commended your selfe for a better Subject, then to
criticize upon your Soveraign's pleasure, and, I think,
I should at least be so civill, as not to controvert his
praise; but as I do heartily pray that the Lord would
make it a hundred times so much truly greater then it
is; So, let me tell you, that to state your superlatives
of Nobility, and Generosity, upon the grant of this
Licence, a very mean and scant act of justice, elicit
by a visible State-conveniency, if not necessity, and
many degrees inferior to the liberty granted either by
the King of <hi>France,</hi> to his Protestants, or the great
<hi>Turk</hi> to his Christian Subjects, is rather to betray
then advance your Prince his reputation. I say not
this to diminish the just acknowledgement of his
Majesties justice, that every good subject ought on
every occasion to express; but this your artifice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to baffle our consciencious non-compliance with
your remaining corruptions, as ingratitude, or to
stop the procedure of the King's goodness, as being
already in the next degree to an excess, must not go
unnoticed.</p>
            <p>Your third effect designed, <hi>is to dispose us to a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
accomodation with you,</hi> Which you say, <hi>the
Fathers of the Church are readie to offer, on such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
as refused will declare us to be schismatical.</hi> But
seing all along you would have this licence to be a
free favour, and would thence plead its obliga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
toward a brotherly Accommodation, as I
have hitherto told you, that I cannot regard it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that character; so, I hope, the insinuation that
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:59845:256"/>
this pretense may import, shall be of no moment to
byass any to an Accomodation, in the termes of so
stated an opposition. Sir, mistake me not, it is not,
that I love division or studie faction; union and peace
in the Lord are the earnest desire and prayer of my
soul, and that not more for the manifestation of the
glorious power of the grace of God, in turning you
from your evill wayes, then for that beautie, joy
and strength, wherewith it is accompanied, and
whereby the pleasure of the Lord might be so effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
promoted: But while you continue impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
yea obstinat in your perjury and rebellion,
whereby you have overturned the Lord's work, with
the Ministrie and Government of His House, and do
own that idol of Jealousie and root of wickedness,
the <hi>Supremacie,</hi> and its dependent Prelacy, wherby
under the pretense of peace and order, the Kingdome
of our Lord, aswell over Consciences, as in his
Church, is borne down, prophanity, popery, nay
Atheisme and all wickedness connived at, and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
become more odious and persecute, then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
acknowledgement of the most High, not
prostitute to mens lusts &amp; devices; While, I say, you
are still such, what fellowship hath righteousness with
unrighteousness? &amp; what communion hath light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darkness?
And what concord hath Christ with Belial?
Or what part hath he that keepeth Covenant with
him that avowedly breaketh it? If these be schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
insinuations, we are very willing to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
such, and do heartily imbrace the reproach: nay,
if I should tell you, that such are the nature and
circumstances of the present defection, that it doth
not only enjoyne a necessarie separation from your
pretended and corrupt Ecclesiastick Courts, for evit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sin that attends a conjunction; but also a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:59845:256"/>
&amp; withdrawing to testify against backsliders, I
might as easily evince it both from Scripture-precept
and example. But, may be I am too prompt; if the
termes that you are about to offer be as fair as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
that is, <hi>as can be demanded by any rational per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
no doubt they will satisfie all our scruples.</p>
            <p>And therefore wishing that the event may redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
this apparent anticipation, I goe on to your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
promise, viz. <hi>to give your N. C. at next meeting
a full prospect of the state of the ancient Church, and you
doubt not to convince him that their frame was better suted
for promoting the ends of Religion, then ever Prebyterie
could be.</hi> Sir, your performance is expected, and for
your encouragement, I am free to tell you, that
though the improbabilitie of the undertaking may
possibly give the world a disappointment, yet it will
be no surprise. It is not the first promise that you
have failed in, upon more unaccountable reasons: <hi>Mean
while,</hi> you forbid us, <hi>to abuse our Soveraign's royal
goodnesse, nor the tendernesse of these he sets over us.</hi> But
this, in my opinion, is a superfluous caution; the
Prelats have taken a surer course to prevent your fears;
for such hath been their care to secure this goodnesse
and tendernesse from our abuse, that hitherto they
have thought fit to keep it without our reach. I
know this will appear a hard reflection to some of
your party, who would have even the common air
estemed his Majesties, and us to breath it by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence:
But a flattering mouth worketh ruine, and
the <hi>Lord shall cut off all flattering lips.</hi> We despise not
his Majesties favour, nay, we desire and long for it
that it may come down like raine upon the <hi>mowen
grasse:</hi> But while there is so great a short-coming in
the things, which are right in the eyes of the Lord,
and righteous toward his servants, why should flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
deceive?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="496" facs="tcp:59845:257"/>And thus we are come to your Conclusion of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for and exhortation to <hi>peace, love, and charity;</hi> a
very expedient one to so bad a cause, so badly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
your rebellion against God, your usurpation
against our Lord Jesus Christ, the wrongs done to his
Church and People, by which your Prelats have got
into the chair, and in compliance wherewith you
your self do at least find ease, If they cannot be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by reason, yet may in a manner be secured by
peace. And, no doubt, the love and charity, which
you crave would go a great length. I will not say
with <hi>Iehu, what have you to do with peace?</hi> But <hi>there is no
peace to the wicked, saith my God;</hi> And that ought to
be unto you of more moment, then if <hi>Iehu,</hi> with
all his fury and forces, were at your heels. But you
are of that number, who would have peace though
you walk in the imagination of your own hearts;
nay, you seduce this people, and heal their hurt
slightly, by saying peace, where there is no peace:
But if <hi>you had stood in the counsel of the Lord, and had
caused his people to hear his words, then you should have
turned them from their evill way, and from the evill of
their doings: am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and
not a God a far off. Can any hide himselfe in secret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that I shall not see him, saith the Lord, do not I fill
heaven and earth, saith the Lord. I have heard what the
Prophets said who Prophesie lyes in my name, and do
cause my people to erre by their lightnesse, yet I sent them
not, nor commanded them, therefore they shall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
this people at all, saith the Lord.</hi> As for the <hi>love</hi>
that you desire; should we love them that hate the
Lord: you know whose profession it was, <hi>do not I
hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? And am not I
grieved with these that rise up against the? I hate them
with perfect hatred, I count them mine enemies.</hi> Neither
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:59845:257"/>
are these the words of one only under the old dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
which elswhere you are pleased to terme, <hi>more
carnal and fierie.</hi> He who wished that they were even
cut off, who troubled the Church, appeareth to be
of the same Spirit. Nay, God who is love, and
perfect in goodnesse to all his creatures, is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
a consuming fire unto his adversaries. And our
Lord Jesus, who came in lowlinesse and meeknesse to
seek sinners and dye for enemies, enjoyning love as
a badge, and legating peace as his proper blessing
to all his followers, doth notwithstanding pronounce
many a sad wo unto the hypocritical, proud, covetous
&amp; in a word (if as shamlessly irreligious) Prelatick Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee.
Let us therefore, above all things, in the first
place contend for the love of God, and to be
found, and to abide therein: This once purging our
hearts from dividing and distracting lusts, will only
happily cement us by its own bond. But if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
your opposition against God, perversion of his
righteous wayes, and persecution of his Saints, you
do in vain pretend to that peace, which is the Saints
their priviledge, and without which, outward peace
is no better then one of these snares that the Lord rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon the wicked.</p>
            <p>Your next wish <hi>is for charity,</hi> and O! that it might
be both your and our blessing, in its full extent; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
not rejoycing in iniquity, but rejoycing in the
truth, would quickly produce a desireable Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
but this is not the charity which you study;
'tis like a charity <hi>thinking no evill</hi> of your evil doings,
<hi>beleeving all</hi> your imposings, <hi>enduring all</hi> your usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations,
and <hi>bearing all</hi> your rigours, would please
you well. And at this rate the most violent irreligious
persecutor would become your concurrent. But we
have not so learned Christ. It is a very easie and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:59845:258"/>
thing, to men possest of their desires to wish
for security in the peace, love, and charity even of
their adversaries. And yet we are not so short of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance
as to believe that this was alwayes, the
language of your partie. At first it was, <hi>make a chaine
the land is full of bloodie crimes, and the city is full of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,</hi>
and your cry was, <hi>rase it, rase it, even to the
foundation.</hi> And when after much crueltie and blood
your Prelats would scarce by the restraint of more
safe counsel be taken off their eager pursuites, how
hardly are they prevailed upon, even by their
own interest, to teach this doctrine of peace? It is
not many weeks since the chief of your Fathers, as
you terme them, preaching before the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner
and many members of Parliament on that
Text, <hi>Let us therefore follow after the things which make
for peace,</hi> told his hearers, in the very entrie, that the
particular rules of mutual for bearance and tendernesse,
given in that Scripture by the Apostle, were only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the then state of that Church wanting a
Christian Magistrate: But now there being a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Magistrat, his authoritie should quiet all scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and might not be demurred by these pretenses:
and going on to show that the only way to peace, is
to allow to the King not only an outward coercive
power, but also an inward, directive, architeckto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,
uncontrollable power (O fear the Lord all ye
his Saints) over conscience, in the matters of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
with much ado, as eye and ear witnesses do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
he stammered through a part of the first chapter
of a new Piece, entituled a <hi>Discours of Ecclesiastical
policie.</hi> And thus, he delivered to us the very same
doctrine of peace, which, in several places of your
Dialogues, you do very plainly hold out. Whether
or not then it be in the same principle, and for the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:59845:258"/>
same end, that ye do here pray for peace, love and
charity, let men judge. For our part, your power, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and dignities (in themselves, to say the truth,
the very meenest of these trifles) are by us neither
coveted nor envied. Our souls desire and earnest pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to God, both in your and our own behalfe, is
that God would open our eyes, turne back our hearts,
heal our backslidings, and restore unto us his Gospel
and blessed Ordinances in power and purity. <hi>O turne
us again Lord God of hosts, cause thy face to shine and we
shall be saved,</hi> then shall Glory dwell <hi>in our Land,
mercy and truth meet, and righteousnesse and truth kisse
each other,</hi> then should the work of the Lord appear
unto his servants, and the beauty of the Lord our
God, even peace, unity and love be upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for these Scriptures wherewith you second your
wish for peace, Were I not more tender in opposing
Scripture to Scripture, then you are in abusing it to
your own designe, it were easie for me to repay your
admonition to love, by a more seasonable exhortation
to you of repentance: But since the very consideration
of the words, by you cited, may rectify your misappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
my single desire is, that you had pondered or
could yet ponder them.</hi> If there be therefore any consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the
Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, let us fulfil the Lords
joy, <hi>that we be first of a</hi> sound minde, <hi>&amp; then</hi> like min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>having the</hi> same love, <hi>being of</hi> one accord, <hi>of</hi>
one minde, Let nothing be done, through strife or vain
glory (<hi>a short discharge of all the pride, persecution
and pompe of your prelatick order</hi>) but, in lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of minde, let each esteeme others better then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

and every evill work. But the wisdome that is from above
is first pure, then peaceable (<hi>not first peaceable and

easie to be entreated, full of mercie and good fruits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
partiality, and without hypocrisie (<hi>O desirable

humblenesse of minde, meeknesse, long-suffering,
forbearing one another and forgiving one another, if any
man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave us,
so let us do; and above all things put on charity which
is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule
in our hearts, to the which also we are called in one body,
and let us be thankfull. Let the word of Christ dwell in us
richly, in all wisdome, teaching and admonishing one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

of the Lord to be mentioned</hi>) Giving thanks to God
and the Eather by him. <hi>In all this I wish we were
sincerily agreed.</hi> And that these words were more deeply
infixed in our mindes, for I confesse I am wearie of vain
janglings, <hi>as much as you are, and do long for truth
and peace, as much as you do for your much courted
peace; and indeed there is nothing that doth so much
portend the Lords displeasure and imminent wrath as
that not any pleadeth for truth;</hi> they trust in vanity and
speak lies, they conceive mischief, and bring forth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
they hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the spiders
web, he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which
is crushed breaketh out into a viper; their works are
works of iniquitie, and the act of violence is in their
hand; they do much love outward peace, <hi>but</hi> the way of
peace they know not, and there is no judgement in their
goings, they have made them crooked Pathes, whosoever
goeth therein shall not know peace. Therefore is judgement
far from us, and justice doth not overtake us; we waite
for light, but behold obscurity, for brightness, bot we
walk in darkness; for our transgressions are multiplied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, and our sins testifie against us; for our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
are with us, and as for our iniquities we know
them, in transgressing and lying against the Lord and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
away from our God, speaking oppression and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
conceiving and uttering from the heart words of fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and judgement is turned away backward, and jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street,
and equity cannot enter, yea truth faileth, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
from evill maketh himself a prey. <hi>Whether you
or your N. C. account</hi> these words <hi>to proceed from
a</hi> fretted minde, <hi>or not, I know not; sure I am
there is that truth in them that though</hi> David's <hi>wished
for wings may better suit your desire of rest, yet</hi> Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah's
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:59845:260"/>
               <hi>waterie head, and weeping eyes, with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
to a wildernesse, would be the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
wish to our condition. But our relieff is, that
the Lord seeth, and who knowes, but he is displeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that there is no intercessor, and that therefore his
arme may bring salvation, when he shall put on
righteousnesse as a breast-plate, and an helmet of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
upon his head, when he shall put on the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of vengeance for clothing, and cloath himself
with zeal (even that zeal which you go about to
maligne) as with a clock. However this is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that the Redeemer</hi> is come to Zion <hi>and unto
them that turne from transgression in Jacob, saith the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your. N. C. recals me and tells us, <hi>that the
further he seeth in the great businesse of Religion, he is the
the more coovinced of a serene and placide temper,
which so qalisies the soul for Divine converse.</hi> And
these words do <hi>ravish and unite your heart to him in
such</hi> a manner, that, for a conclusion to these your
roving <hi>Dialogues,</hi> you do very agreeably evanish in a
fancied transport. And really Sir, I do as little ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the further a man seeth, and is seriously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in the great businesse of Religion, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be therby rendered of a more serene and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
temper. <hi>The statutes of the Lord are indeed right
rejoyceing the heart, the commandement of the Lord is pure
enlightning the eyes;</hi> the divine light doth certainly
give pure joy, and pure joy no doubt doth elevat above
all carnall perturbations, and drossie pleasures: there
is a vertue in Religion, that, powerfully rebuking not
only the windes of our tempestuous passions, and the
tossings of our vaine desires, but the dreadful tempest
of Gods anger, doth make a great calme, which
bringeth unto Jesus Christ for refuge, unto God for
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:59845:260"/>
our rest, and blesseth us with his peace that passeth
understanding, and filleth us with all joy in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But your insinuation, as if a serene and placid
temper not flowing from, but previously disposing
unto, Religion and fellowship with God, were of
special influence as to divine converse, is at best but
a continuation of your delusion, I shall not say de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
suited to your great designe of preferring peace, to
truth, and fraiming Religion to your own accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.
And truly in order to that end, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of a serene indifferencie and placide compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
resolving all difficulties by the conveniencie
of ease, and not striving in any case against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and commands of such, on whom our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace depends, can not be denyed. But seing
it is the great work of Religion, first to <hi>open the eyes,
and to turne from darkness unto light, and from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Satan unto God, that</hi> we <hi>may receive forgivenesse
of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified
by faith,</hi> and in these excellent graces true peace and
full joy, let him who would have a minde truly serene,
and not only a placide temper, but a tranquill and
joyful conscience, studie and walk in this light, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
and abhorring every evill way, and by purity
and faithfulnesse, even in that which is least,
make sure his peace, and so shall he not only be
qualified for, but certainly attaine unto divine
converse. Serenity and tranquillity of minde, when
flowing from that wisdome from above, which is first
pure then peaceable, and is the product of pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and undefiled, is no doubt, no other then that
light wherein God dwells, and that calmness and
weakness of Spirit, wherein he delights. But as for
your serene and placid Temper, whith you exhibite
to us, rather as preparatory, then subsequent to
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:59845:261"/>
Religion, I must again tell you my feares that I
find it so little agreeable to Religion's genuine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode,
and so very suitable to your carnal designes,
that I greatly apprehend, that, instead of advancing
you to <hi>true divine converse,</hi> it only seduce you into
a fools paradise of your own dreams and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Whether your ensuing raptures do thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
I leave it to others to judge. But, sure I am,
were you as earnest to pray, <hi>Deliver my soul, O Lord,
from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue,</hi> as you
would appear serious in the following regrete <hi>of
having too long dwelt among them that hate peace:</hi> You
had rather choosed <hi>to suffer affliction with the people,
of God, esteeming the reproach of Christ</hi> (even
treason and sedition) <hi>great riches;</hi> and respecting and
looking for the recompense of the reward, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
love and peace of God, then to have taken the
compendious, way of a sinful compliance, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
this worlds ease and quiet. Which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that holy man, whose words you usurpe,
would have abhorred at the rate.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>thick fogs and mists of contention,</hi> which
you complaine of, if this life were indeed to you <hi>a
valley of tears,</hi> as you give it out, while all light and
purity is almost destroyed by the lust and ignorance of
your prelatick party, it would have been to these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
vapors, and clouds of smok, by which our
Sun and air are darkned, and not to the just and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
opposition of a small faithful remnant against
your apostacy, that you had ascribed the <hi>noisomness</hi>
which you mention. But, behold the nimblenesse,
aswell as the delusion, of the mans fancy; he hath
for outward ease cast away a good conscience, and
preferred all along peace unto truth: All the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
he mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth with, is the dissent of a few faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:59845:261"/>
unto God, and stedfast in his Covenant; whom
he and his party do therefore persecute: This small
innocent non-complyance he complaineth of, as if
he were the most refined and tender Saint, grieving
for the wicked and rageful persecution of the ungodly,
from which imaginary and feigned distresse, with
the same artifice and facility, he pretendeth <hi>that his
relieff is in divine contemplation, whither, as to the
mountaine of God, he flieth,</hi> forsooth, <hi>for Sanctuary that
he may take rest.</hi> But this triumphing of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
shall be but short, <hi>the joy of the hyhocrite is
but for a moment, though his excellency reach up to the
heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; yet he shall
perish for ever, like his own dung, they which have seen
him shall say, where is he, he shall fly away as a dream,
and be chased away as a vision of the night: for who, Lord,
shall dwell in thy holy hill, and who shall ascend unto the
hill of the Lord, and who shall stand in his holy place?
he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousnesse,
and speaketh the truth in his heart; he that backbiteth not
with his tongue, nor doth evill to his neighbour, nor taketh
up a reproach against his neighbour, in whose eyes a vile
person is contemned, but he honoureth them that fear the
Lord, he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not;
he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart, who hath not
lift vp his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully, he shall
receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousnesse from
the God of his Salvation.</hi> If therefore your pretensions
be such as you professe, you must not overlooke the
way that God himselfe hath designed, but walk in it
with fear. Your vain phantastick soarings will not
carry you, either over, or by it. Nay in the end they will
prove a lie, and tumble you into destruction: For
what is the hope of the Hypocrite when he hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when God taketh away his soul?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="506" facs="tcp:59845:262"/>Think not that these things are from ill nature,
and spoken in bitterness; Nay, Sir, I may very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
protest, that when I reflect on your laxe and
unsound principles, not only in the matters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Worship, but even in the head of <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
and several other parts, that you have given
me occasion to touch, with your enmity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
against the work of God, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Ministry and Ordinances of our Lord Iesus
Christ, and how, on the other hand, you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to shreud your self under the high pretenses of
peace, love, charity, and devotion, wholly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
I can scarce refrain from trembling, in the
thoughts of such deep and abusive hypocrisie. And
therefore though you should scorn my compassion,
yet will I not forbear to give you my best advice. You
seem to have the forme of knowledge, and of the
truth in the word. Nay thou makest thy boast of
God, and divine contemplation, the secret of Gods
presence, and the refreshfull shades of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
where joy unspeakable, and the most pure sola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
flow, appear to be your familiar retreat. But as
it is too too evident that neither your principles nor
practice are very suitable to this profession, nay,
that there is no noise heard of this profession, while
you are bussied in serving mens designs, and your
own fancies: And that it is only after you have
striven to the outmost in perswading or contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that you seek to evade or delude by these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions;
So my earnest request is that in place of
fancie, that evaporats all your knowledge into ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
faith and love may suck down the truth
into your heart, to convert you indeed unto God,
and reveal in you with power his Son Iesus Christ,
that you may love the Lord with all your soul and
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:59845:262"/>
strength, and trust in him alwayes, have respect unto
all his Commandements, and observe all his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
then should you walk in the way safely,
and the Lord should be your confidence. And though
you should be exercised with the same perverse
disputings of men of corrupt mindes, the same strife
of tongues and persecution of adversaries, whereof
we have so large an experiment; yet amidst all these
boisterous windes and tossing waves, God would be
your Rock, light, joy, strength, and salvation for
ever. Sir, this is our faith and also our victory, for
which, when you shall as seriously contend, as you
do vainly pretend to outward peace and mans favour,
then shall true peace, even that peace, which the
World neither gives nor can take, abound unto you
to establish you unto the end. Let us therefore <hi>fight
the good fight, keep the faith and lay hold on eternal
life,</hi> that we may finish our course with joy, so shall
we receive that <hi>Crown of Righteousnesse which the
righteous Iudge shall give unto us at that day, and not
unto us only, but unto all them also, that love his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Even so come Lord</hi> JESUS.</p>
