            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OUR Nation, which long since hath lost the <hi>Lustre</hi> and <hi>well-being,</hi> now at last strugleth for the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> thereof. Our many [<hi>temporal</hi>] miseries are reducible to two principal heads.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:109890:3"/>Daily
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Decrease</hi> of <hi>Trading.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Increase</hi> of <hi>Taxes</hi>: So that every hour the <hi>Burden</hi> groweth <hi>weightier,</hi> and the <hi>Back</hi> of our Nation weaker to support it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis sad to see, in Cloathing Countreys, what swarms there are of poor people, the true objects of Charity; if any were as <hi>able</hi> to <hi>give,</hi> as they <hi>worthy</hi> to receive <hi>reliefe</hi>: for they <hi>would</hi> worke, and <hi>can</hi> worke, yet <hi>cannot</hi> worke, because there are none to imploy them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for the <hi>Sea</hi> (which is the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Port-Towns,</hi>) it returneth small benefit; for since <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was ours, (more to the <hi>credit</hi> than <hi>profit</hi> of our Nation) the fire of <hi>Sea-robheries</hi> is removed out of the <hi>Chimney,</hi> and scattered about the <hi>House,</hi> not lesse <hi>destructive,</hi> but more <hi>diffusive</hi>: So that our Merchants could better guard themselves against that <hi>Single staple of Pirates,</hi> than many lesser ones sprung since every where, the cause why rich men will not (as poor cannot) adventure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our second <hi>misery</hi> is, <hi>increase,</hi> yea, <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetation</hi> of Taxes, so long as so numerous an Army is maintained: For though some of their Soldiers will preach <hi>gratis,</hi> (conscientious to tahe nothing for that which they know is worth nothing) yet none will fight at so cheap a rate.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:109890:3"/>5. Some will say, That what the Soldier receiveth with one hand he returneth with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, expending his pay in Victuals, Cloathes, &amp;c. whereby Coin, by <hi>circulation,</hi> is continued in our Countrey. This I deny; for some Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, greatned by the Times, have made their Moneyes over in <hi>Banks</hi> beyond the Seas, which are put into <hi>MORTMAIN,</hi> or a <hi>Dead hand,</hi> whereby no profit accreweth to our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Others having gotten the Estates of <hi>Lords,</hi> live after the rate of <hi>Yeomen,</hi> whose discretion therein is to be commended, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning their expences (for fear of <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps</hi>) rather according to their original, than present condition.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The increase of <hi>Taxes</hi> must inevitably cause the ruine of our Nation: For though still there be wealthy men left (as they shew it in their <hi>cowardise,</hi> and fear to engage for the general good) yet they grow thinner every day, whilst such as are left no root of their own, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they will <hi>wither,</hi> will turn <hi>Suckers</hi> on the <hi>Stock</hi> of others. So that the greatest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse rich men can promise to themselves, is only to be <hi>last</hi> devoured, though the comfort of the latenesse will not countervail the sadness for the certainty of their destruction. Indeed it is miraculous, that our Nation hath subsisted so long, and few there are that would believe that the whole <hi>Candle</hi> of our English wealth could last so long, as we have beheld it <hi>burning</hi> in the <hi>Socket,</hi> but now giving the last blaze,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109890:4"/>
if God be not mercifull, and men discreet to prevent it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Passe we from the sad Malady, to the sole Remedy thereof, I say <hi>sole,</hi> not exclusively of divine miraculous power, but according to humane apprehension, and this is a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>full Parliament.</hi> Indeed <hi>Free-Parliament</hi> is a <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologie,</hi> like a <hi>Reasonable man,</hi> who, if not <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> is no <hi>man</hi>; as the other, if not <hi>free,</hi> no <hi>Parliament.</hi> But the late frequent forces put on <hi>Partiaments</hi> hath made the <hi>needlesse Epethite</hi> become <hi>necessary,</hi> to expresse what kinde of Parliaments we desire. Not such in which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word must be spoken under <hi>correction of the sword,</hi> but wherein every Member, without feare of violence (to interrupt or dissolve them) may follow the dictates of their owne judgement and conscience.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Nor ought a <hi>Parliament</hi> only be <hi>free</hi> from force, but also from any <hi>Abjurations,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Engagements. Let them take heed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing any thing, save what is simply sinfull in it selfe, as the forsaking of the <hi>World, Flesh, and Divel,</hi> as was solemnly promised for them in their Baptism. But it is bad to be busie with other <hi>Ab-renunciations,</hi> especially of the <hi>Royall Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Look backward and we may say with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, The Vows of the Lord are upon us</hi>; I mean on so many of us as are of fifty years of age. The Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> (not to mention the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>) is the eldest Brother, to whom the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109890:4"/>
of our Consciences doth belong.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Look forwards, it <hi>limiteth Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> which is an hainous offence; we know not what a day, month, year, &amp;c. may bring forth. This Age hath the least reason of any to meddle with the edge-tools of such Oathes which in a <hi>short</hi> (but <hi>thick</hi>) time hath seen so many <hi>strange things,</hi> that now nothing is <hi>strange</hi> unto us. Have we not seen <hi>O. Cromwell</hi> from a private Gentleman <hi>gradatim</hi> ascend to be Protector of three Nations, and (by his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Wisdome without any right) a more absolute power was possessed by, and larger Tribute paid unto him than to any King of <hi>England.</hi> His Son and Successor (counted bad by many for his goodnesse and mild spirit) for eight months was congratulated by the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Persons of our Nation. Now if some twenty years since an Oath had been tendred unto us to abjure the Family of <hi>Cromwels</hi> from ever having the Supream Magistracy in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; such an Oath would have seemed <hi>safe,</hi> but yet it was not <hi>lawfull</hi> to take it, because none knew what was in the <hi>Womb</hi> of <hi>Teeming Time,</hi> though utterly improbable to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Besides, the Imposers of this Oath may miss the mark they propound to themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> assurance of their own, and discovery of the opposite Party; for many now pass not for the taking or breaking of any Oath, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of such is hard in keeping, and indeed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109890:5"/>
not worth the having. Other will behold the Oath as temporary, and expiring with the power of the Imposers. As for the conscientious indeed, Eefusing it out of pure principles of piety, it is a barbarous act for persons in power, to turn Executioners to strangle tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, whose cordial fear of an Oath should be encouraged.</p>
            <p n="12">12. As the <hi>Parliament</hi> must be <hi>free,</hi> no <hi>Vassal,</hi> but enfranchised from the Sword, so must it be <hi>full,</hi> no <hi>Cripple,</hi> but entire and compleat in all the Members thereof. Our Land hath lately groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the most grievous <hi>Monopoly</hi> as ever was or can be, when a handfull of men have grasped to themselvs the <hi>representing</hi> of a whole (not to say 3) Nation, most of them being but <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses,</hi> who, though equal in <hi>Votes,</hi> are not equal in their <hi>representation</hi> with the Knights of the Shires. If they presume that the rest <hi>excluded</hi> by them (far more considerable for Birth, Estates, Number, Love of the People, and what not?) are virtually <hi>included</hi> in them, it is an intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable PRESUMPTION. That what pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all should be handled by all, is a Truth so clear and strong, that they must offer a <hi>Rape</hi> to their owne <hi>Reason</hi> that deny it. Such also is this Maxim, <hi>Vnrepresented, unconcluded:</hi> So that if so few have in them <hi>the notion</hi> of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it is a bare <hi>Notion</hi> indeed, especially seeing this handfull of men were (say the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers) <hi>dissolved</hi> by the death of the King; <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved</hi> (said <hi>Cromwell</hi>) by his Sword; <hi>dissolved</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:109890:5"/>
(say some <hi>Great ones</hi>) by an Act of their owne (entred into the <hi>Iournall</hi> Book of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) <hi>dissolved</hi> must their own <hi>Consciences</hi> say, by their voluntary accepting of Elections in later <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Now the Members of a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>full Parliament</hi> (the onely Hope of Humane help) ought thus to be qualified:
<list>
                  <item>1. Let them be <hi>Godly and well-affected</hi> indeed, and not in the <hi>canting lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> of the Times.</item>
                  <item>2. Men of Estates, who will be tender in taxing others, as striking them thorough themselves, whilst such who <hi>bear</hi> nothing care not how much they burthen others, as if paying were as easie as voting, and Money as free as words.</item>
                  <item>3. Men of spirits, no dull Souls, all the sparks of whose activity are quenched in their own flegm.</item>
                  <item>4. No Gainers by the continuance of the Army. <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-Smith was no foole (what ever else he was) so sticking for the shrine of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109890:6"/>
                     <hi>Diana,</hi> by which Craft he <hi>got his Gain.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. Men of moderation, a quality not opposed to <hi>Diligence,</hi> but to <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>; not unactiving men, but regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating their Activity.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. This their moderation must appear in considering all <hi>Interests,</hi> seeing there be no two <hi>Interests</hi> in the Nation so <hi>contemptible,</hi> which if united, and twisting their discontents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, cannot draw trouble on all the rest. Especially the <hi>Sectarian,</hi> (though presented I believe by their party, through a multiplying Glasse) are considerable on a politick score of their numbers and pious account of their conscience; for, though many of them carry the later in their <hi>purses,</hi>, who when they finde the <hi>moisture</hi> of Profit to fail them, will fall off like <hi>leaves</hi> in <hi>Autumn</hi>; yet can I not be so uncharitable, but to believe that many of them (having the <hi>heat</hi> of their <hi>affections</hi> above the <hi>light</hi> of their <hi>judgements</hi>) follow erroneous Consciences; Besides, having gone loose so long, they must needs <hi>swell,</hi> if hardly <hi>girded</hi>

            </p>

The Story is wel known of the old Woman who having but a small parcel of Wood, would leasurably roast her Goose stick by stick, till her wood was all burnt, aud her Goose still raw. If the severall Counties singly engage one after another, all will be overthrown, and nothing effected as to our releife.
