         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

cannot dedicate, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can neither prefix your

Booke. I appeale to you here, not as an
indulgent Patron, but a learned Iudge:
Of ſuch you have the two requiſites, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:19097:3"/>
and <hi>Commodity.</hi> The firſt is
within you, an acute and ſolid Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
the latter, without you, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Library, which <hi>Chryſologus</hi>
ſtiles the onely Paradiſe of this world.
You ſit every day moſt happily incircled
with the moſt famous Writers of all kinds.
Thus environ'd, the pooreſt Schollar
thinkes himſelfe majeſtically enthron'd,
and ſecurely guarded. There is not a
quotation in this Treatiſe, which you
cannot readily bring to the Teſt, and
therefore I chooſe you as a moſt fit Trier
of the Authors Integrity, in whoſe praiſe
when I have ſpoken much, it wil appeare
in a diſcerning eye too little. His Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
is ſuch, that ſometime I reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him to one who makes an exact
ſurveigh of an Immenſe Kingdome in
a moment; ſometimes to the Sunne
<pb facs="tcp:19097:3"/>
himſelfe, who compaſſeth the world in
a naturall day. For the ſame proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
holds this ſhort Diſcourſe with vaſt
Antiquitie. I dare maintaine that in
farre greater <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olumes of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
(as <hi>Medulla patrum, Favus
patrum, Flores patrum</hi>) you ſhall not
finde ſo accurate a judgement of the
Fathers, neither delivered with ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
a faith, and ſo cleane a ſifting of
the Meale from the branne, of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
from their errors.</p>
            <p>More Sentences, it may be, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and the more the worſe; For thoſe
wretched Summularies, or Floriſts are
the very Bane of Learning, who in
ſtead of culling out the choyceſt flowres,
doe, indeed, nothing but weed Authours:
They leave the pure wine behinde, and
give their thirſtie Readers the unſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

alleageth the cauſe to be his feare, leſt the

in time collect, and ſacrifice them all to
<hi>Vulcan.</hi> I thinke this little worke is of
as great value, and merits no leſſe care,
eſpecially ſince it is already become ſo
rare, that it is hardly by prayer, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to be purchaſed Of its dignity this
is no obſcure Argument, that the learned
ſonne of our <hi>Toſſanus</hi> thought it
worthy the Dedication to <hi>Iacobus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi>
who roſe with as great a
luſtre as any light of the Moderne
Church, though it was his evill Deſtiny
to ſet in a Cloud. For the Tranſlation
<pb facs="tcp:19097:4"/>
I ſay little, both becauſe it is mine owne,
as alſo that books of this nature admit no
flouriſhes, nor Elegancy of phraſe. I am
confident I have not altered the ſenſe,
and that is as much as the moſt ſevere
Criticke can require at my hands. The
love to Knowledge, and her Profeſſors,
is yours by Inheritance, who derive it
from your truly great Father, on whoſe

AVTHORS
PREFACE,
VVHICH TOGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Treatiſe it ſelfe
was delivered by way of
Lecture.</head>
            <p>MY Courteous Auditors, I
have oftentimes called to
mind the ſaying of that
moſt excellent, and grave Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
<pb facs="tcp:19097:6"/>
               <hi>Seneca, Magnam eſſe dementiam
intanta Temporis egeſtate ſupervacua
diſcere:</hi> It is great madneſſe, ſaith
hee, in ſo great want of time to
learne things ſuperfluous. For that
firſt Aphoriſme of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the
Prince of Phyſicians, is moſt true,
<hi>Vita brevis eſt, Ars longa:</hi> Life is
ſhort, Art long. Though this bee
moſt true, yet can I not aſſent unto
them, who thinke it enough for a
Student in Divinity to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
verſed in the ſacred Scriptures,
and that hee need learne and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
nothing elſe; that the immenſe
Volumes of the Fathers, and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Doctors, as a vaſt and fadome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
Sea are to be avoyded, becauſe
they bring greater doubt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity,
than light and ſcience to
<pb facs="tcp:19097:6"/>
the minde; eſpecially if a man will
dwell upon the manifold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
of the late Doctors,
whom we call Schoolemen. Theſe
Aſſertions (though they may at firſt
ſight appeare faire and goodly) yet
ſavour too much of Arrogancy.
Farre bee it from any Divine to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
that Neſtorian Pride, who,
as the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
relying on the volubility of his
owne Tongue, arrogantly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Writings of the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Interpreters. I confeſſe, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures are able to render a
man abundantly wiſe, as ſaith Saint
<hi>Paul, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. and to inſtruct him
in all things pertaining to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the faith which is in Ieſus
Chriſt. I confeſſe alſo ſome men
<pb facs="tcp:19097:7"/>
have not the underſtanding right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to judge of ſo many Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of the Ancients; others have
not the leiſure to read them, and
not a few want meanes to procure
them. Yet in theſe a Divine ought
not to bee altogether a ſtranger.
<hi>Neſoire quid antequam natus ſis accide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ideſt ſemper eſſe puerum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
in his Oratory. To be ignorant
altogether of what happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou wert borne, is alwayes
to bee a childe: and the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
of Antiquity, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of examples, gives not onely
delight, but authority and credit to
an Oration. It was an ancient and
laudable cuſtome, as witneſſeth
<hi>Irenaeus, lib. 3. cap.</hi> 4. that if any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
were diſputed, the judgement
<pb facs="tcp:19097:7"/>
and conſent of the moſt ancient
Churches wherein the Apoſtles
were converſant, ſhould bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into, and fully knowne.</p>
            <p>But here certaine Cautions are
neceſſary, which being not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Papiſts, they have erred
many wayes in reading of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and have proved not ſo much
<hi>Theologi,</hi> as <hi>Patrologi,</hi> and <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologi:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Caution is, that none
reade the Fathers except they bee
well exerciſed in the Scriptures,
which neglected, they ſhall grope
like one blinde in the darke, and
ſaile in a wide Sea without either
North-Starre or Compaſſe. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:19097:8"/>
Caution ought to bee, that
though the authority and conſent
of the Fathers in the Truth, doe
much confirme and comfort, yet
Faith is onely to bee builded upon
the Apoſtolicall and Propheticall
Scriptures, as a foundation moſt
firme. For the Scripture, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Queene and Empreſſe (as <hi>Luther</hi>
is uſed to ſay) ought to have the
ſoveraigne Command. The third
Caution is, that in reading the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wee doe not imitate thoſe
flatterers of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ioniſius Siculu,</hi> who
licking up the Tyrants ſpittle, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it to bee ſweeter than Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctar.
To theſe I may liken ſuch as
without any exception embrace
and magnifie indifferently all the
Writings and Sayings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb facs="tcp:19097:8"/>
Theſe are the points about
which at this day we combat the
Ieſuites, the ſtouteſt Champions
the Pope hath; and not (as they
labour to perſwade the vulgar) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Fathers themſelves, or
reverent Antiquity, as if wee did
plainely reiect them, and after the
Athenian manner were delighted
with the novelties of Newes-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.
For firſt, wee recall them to
true Antiquity, which is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the ancient of dayes,
and his revelations, that ſo wee
may refuſe and condemne as new
whatſoever Chriſt hath not taught
us, as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> adviſeth us, <hi>lib.</hi>
1. <hi>Officior.</hi> Next wee diſtinguiſh

            <p>Moreover, when wee enquire

Doſt thou thinke, ſaith
hee, that to be the people of Rome
which conſiſteth of thoſe that are
mercenary; who are ready to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
violence to Magiſtrates, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
daily with a deſperate fury, fire,
rapes, and ſlaughter: Othe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dignity of the Roman people,
whom Kings, forreigne Nations,
and the moſt remote inhabitants
of the earth doe feare. Wee doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
much eſteeme that Roman
Church whoſe faith is preached
through the whole world, we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
reverence thoſe Fathers and
Biſhops which are not commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to us by the onely authority
and Canonization of Popes, but by
their owne purity of Doctrine, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
<pb facs="tcp:19097:10"/>
of life, and conſtancy in
Martyrdome. But it is well the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
ſo diſtruſt their owne cauſe,
that they dare not ſtand to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of the ſacred Scriptures, nor
of the Fathers themſelves, except
they bee mutilated, and altered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their will, and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with many ſuppoſitious
bookes. Their Impudency this way
clearely appeareth in their <hi>Index
Expurgatorius</hi> not long ſince here
publiſhed; out of all which wee
may eaſily collect that they retaine
neither ſhame, faith, nor conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
nor any thing authenticke ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Scriptures, or Fathers,
but onely what is appropriated to
their ſuperſtition, and will-worſhip

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19097:10"/>
Now, moſt loving Auditors,
becauſe it is much materiall to the
Students in Divinity (though all
have not the meanes and faculty of
reading the Fathers) at leaſt to know
what is to be iudged and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of them in generall, and which
were the moſt famous Fathers, and
Scholaſticall Authors, as alſo with
what iudgment &amp; choyce they are
to be read, I thinke it wil neither be
a ſervice unacceptable, nor unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
if in the end of theſe dogge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
and before the Mart now at

the Tripartite Hiſtory. <hi>Euſebius</hi> wrote
alſo a Chronicle which is yet extant; and
a booke of Evangelicall demonſtration,
and preparation; in which he compares
the Evangelicall Doctrine with Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,

no Doctrine to be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

                  <p>He was ſuſpected,<note place="margin">His blemiſhes</note> indeed, by ſome to

for him is extant in <hi>Socrates, lib.</hi> 2.

Hiſtory, <hi>Socrates</hi> doth not diſſemble this

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19097:34"/>
                     <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> which is comprehended in
foure bookes, he lightly blamed the deeds
of <hi>Arius;</hi> and that hee predicated the
vertues of that Emperour, concealing his
vices; and that he ſtudied more to render
his Oration illuſtrious (wherein he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
praiſed him) and to adorne it with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſticall
words, than diligently to explaine
the things done. He had another blemiſh
common with him and many Greeke Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
which <hi>Bodin,</hi> not undeſervedly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
to him in his method of Hiſtory;
which is, that (retaining ſomewhat of the
Grecian vanity) hee relates not a few fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
things, which have little, or no
appearance of Truth: As, of an Epiſtle
of <hi>Aglarus,</hi> King of the Ediſſeni, to Chriſt,
and of Chriſts anſwer to him: of Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle, and a certaine young man
by him recalled from the ſociety of
Theeves: alſo of the finding out of the
Woodden Croſſe, and of its vertue: of
Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who deſired a certaine kinde
of death, <hi>to wit,</hi> Crucifying; and governd
the Roman Church 25. yeares, which how

died under <hi>Valentinianus</hi> in the yeare 379)
<hi>Hilarius</hi> is rightly placed. He was Biſhop

time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
the Great; and his life extended even to
the reigne of <hi>Valentinian.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>
preferres him before other Doctors of
the Church, and, although younger, was
his familiar friend. His ſtile is ſuch (as
rightly warnes <hi>Eraſmus</hi>) that it is hard to
be underſtood, eaſie to be deprav'd: yet
Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> calls him the Trumpet of the
Latine tongue; perhaps becauſe hee was
the firſt that confuted the Arians in that
Language. His workes are extant, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
at Baſil, <hi>anno</hi> 70. by <hi>Euſebius Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:19097:35"/>
and are partly controverſiall, partly
expoſitory. He wrote 12. bookes of the
Trinity againſt the Arians; alſo an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
againſt <hi>Conſtantine</hi> being then dead,
who was the chiefe favourer of the Arian
Faction; and againſt <hi>Auxentius</hi> the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laniſt,
a fautor of the Arian party, as alſo
of divers Synods againſt the Arians;
which booke hee tranſlated for the moſt
part out of Greeke from the Synodicall
decrees. His expoſitory bookes are a
Commentary upon <hi>Matthew,</hi> but a ſhort
one, as alſo upon many Pſalmes, all which
are comprehended in one Tome.</p>
                  <p>Hee hath many faults: For, firſt, hee
hath many hard,<note place="margin">His blemiſhes</note> and unuſuall words; as
<hi>disfrocit</hi> for <hi>degenerate; Zabolus</hi> for <hi>Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
and many more of the like kind. Next
he affirmes the holy Ghoſt to be from the
Father by the Sonne, <hi>lib. 10. de Trinit.</hi> and
upon the 8. Pſalme, he attributes a ſoule,
and a body to Chriſt, not ſubject to any
moleſting affections, and averres, that
thirſt and hunger were not natural in him.
He ſeemes to maintaine the body of Chriſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19097:35"/>
to bee borne, and brought forth by the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> not to be made of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

                  </p>
                  <p>Next <hi>Hilarius</hi> wee may rightly place

                  <p>The writings of Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> extant,<note place="margin">His writings.</note>
are divided into foure Tomes, and are
partly morall, as the three bookes of the

Yet is it remarkeable againſt the Papiſts,
that in his booke of Sacraments hee onely
acknowledgeth two, <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and <hi>the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Lord.</hi> And when, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
how the bread is made the body of
the Lord, hee ſpeaketh nothing at all of
Tranſubſtantiation, but hee confeſſeth,
that there ſeemeth to be a ſimilitude one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not true fleſh and blood, and that wee
muſt beleeve the operatory word of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19097:38"/>
Chriſt, that is, the efficacious; that the
Sacrament is taken outwardly, Grace and
Vertue inwardly. Hee plainely diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth

Stridonenſis Pannonius</hi> lived in part
of the time of Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and Saint <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil.</hi>
He was brought up at Rome, and was
famous in the yeare 390. He travelled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the greateſt part of Europe to conferre
with learned men, and at length choſe
himſelfe a place of abode in Iudaea, in the
fields of Bethlem, where he wrote many
of thoſe things which at this day wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.
Hee is painted with a Cardinals Hat,
whereas hee rather led a Monaſticke life,
and thoſe red Hats were given in ages long
after to ſome certaine Prieſts of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the ſecond, <hi>ann.</hi>
1460. as <hi>Platina</hi> teſtifieth. The ſtile of
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> is elegant; for he was learned,
and a great Linguiſt. Hee wrote many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19097:40"/>
things, whereof ſome are Expoſitions
upon the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and upon the greater and
the leſſer Prophets: alſo upon Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
and ſome Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> as
to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Epheſians.</hi> For the
Commentary (which goes under his
name) upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
too much of Pelagianiſme, which
hee ever oppoſed. Other of his writings
are Controverſiall and Apologeticall: as
againſt <hi>Helvidius;</hi> concerning the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Virginity of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Iovinianus</hi> and <hi>Vigilantius:</hi> Alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

<hi>Ruffinus.</hi> Some againe are Paraene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,
or inſtructive; as of the life of
Clergy men, and concerning the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a mother of the Family.</p>
                  <p>Hee ſeemeth to have a wit ſomewhat
Arrogant and fiery;<note place="margin">His errours.</note> which appeareth not
onely by his ſharpe writings and Epiſtles
againſt Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but alſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hee accuſeth the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
himſelfe of rudeneſſe of ſtile, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the Greeke tongue. <hi>Beza</hi> often
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19097:41"/>
complaines of his wreſting the Scriptures,
eſpecially againſt Wedlocke. See the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations
of <hi>Beza</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 1 Tim.</hi> 3.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>But it is remarkeable, that although
hee was an enemy to Wedlocke, yet in his
Age both Biſhops and Prieſts were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for ſo he writeth in <hi>cap. 6. ad Epheſ.
Legant haec Epiſcopi, et Presbyteri, qui filios
ſuos ſaecularibus libris erudiunt:</hi> Let thoſe
Biſhops, and Prieſts, ſaith hee, read theſe
things, who inſtruct their children in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
bookes. But he often with too much
bitterneſſe inveighes againſt <hi>Vigilantius,</hi>
and <hi>Iovinianus,</hi> for contending with him,
that Wedlocke, and ſingle Life were of
equall merit; as alſo that the Rewards of
the Juſt were alike in that life; and that no
choyce was to be made of Meats, if they
were received with thankeſ-giving; that
the aſhes of Martyrs were not to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
nor the Veſpers to bee celebrated at
their Scpulchers; that the Saints decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
pray not for us. Hee contended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably
with Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> concerning
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19097:41"/>
Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that he never erred, and that
hee was reprehended by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> not
ſeriouſly, but in jeſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>How much the ſtate of the Church was
diſturb'd in thoſe Times, appeares by that
Learned booke of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> Biſhop of
Cyprus, which he wrote againſt 80 He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,
which worke is worthy the peruſall
for the variety of ſtory contained in it.
Then alſo lived <hi>Theodoret,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theodoretus.</note> Biſhop of the
City Cyrus in Perſia, who wrote five
bookes of the hiſtory of the Church; and
Polymorphum, where in three Dialogues
moſt worthy the reading, he defends the
truth of both Natures in Chriſt againſt
the Hereticks of his time.</p>
                  <p>In the time of <hi>Arcadius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chryſoſtomus.</note> and <hi>Honorius,</hi>
Emperours, lived <hi>Iohannes Chryſoſtomus,</hi>
whoſe Eloquence and Zeale farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his knowledge in the Scriptures.
Wherefore he excels more in morals than
in Doctrines and Expoſitions: For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
hee philoſophizeth too ſubtilly.
Yet is hee often cited by our Divines in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19097:42"/>
the interpretation of Greeke words, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul. Vulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus

                  <p>It was reprehenſible in Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
that hee was too chollericke,<note place="margin">The errors of S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>

of his owne life in his Confeſſions. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
being often admoniſhed by Saint

the abundant teares and prayers of his

ſucceeded <hi>Valerius,</hi> Biſhop of Hippona in
Africa, about the yeare 390. He ſuſtained
many ſharpe Conflicts with the Maniches,
Arians, Donatiſts, and Pelagians, whom
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19097:42"/>
he confuted by learned writings; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally,

Philoſophicall, and of no great moment;
as of Grammar, Rhetoricke, Logicke,
Muſicke; of Order; of the quantity of
the ſoule. In his bookes of Confeſſions,
wherein he deſcribes his owne life, hee
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19097:43"/>
often uſeth too much ſimplicity and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
yet may they be read curſorily.
But the Students in Divinity meaning to
read Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ought to beginne at
his Doctrinals; and firſt at his foure books
of Chriſtian Doctrin, in which he inſtructs
a future Divine. Next, hee muſt read his
Enchiridion to <hi>Laurentius,</hi> and the booke
of Faith to <hi>Peter;</hi> of the ſpirit, and the
letter, and of the Eccleſiaſticall opinions.
The Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and the
bookes of the City of God, are of a mixt
kind, partly. Doctrinall, partly Hiſtoricall,
but full of various learning. Thence let
him proceed to his Polemicall, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſiall,
which hee wrote againſt the
Maniches, the Arians, Donatiſts, &amp;c. His
expoſitory bookes, as upon the Pſalmes,
and Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell, containe more
piety than ſolid Interpretation; partly by
reaſon of his ſmall inſight in the Hebrew
and Greeke Tongues; partly becauſe in
thoſe Interpretations hee accommodated
his writing to thoſe times, as alſo that
ſometimes he makes digreſſions; but his
Commentary on Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> is excellent
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19097:43"/>
above the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Palmary, or Maſter-peece of Saint
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> was, that above all the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and almoſt alone, being provoked
by the Pelagians, hee diſcuſſeth diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Doctrine of Originall ſinne, and
Predeſtination.</p>
                  <p>But as in Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> it is very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that he only of all the Ancients,<note place="margin">His errors.</note> wrote
bookes of Retractations (for in his ſeventh
Epiſtle hee profeſſeth himſelfe to bee of
their number who write by profiting, and
profit by writing) ſo there remaine ſome
things which require a cenſure. Yet is
there no doubt but many things are inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his workes, of which hee is not the
Author. For he being yet alive, ſixteene
Articles were falſly father'd on him, to
which hee replyed. But chiefly this was
his errour, that as hee wrote much, ſo hee
often varies, nor is alwayes conſonant to
himſelfe. Hee hath alſo many Acurolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia's,
as <hi>Danaeus,</hi> a moſt learned Divine,
obſerves in his Annotations upon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiridion
of Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Then he erred,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19097:44"/>
in that he preciſely included the ſalvation
of Infants in the ſacrament of Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But whereas in ſome places hee cals the
Euchariſt a Sacrifice, hee thus interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
himſelfe, <hi>lib. 10. Civit. Dei cap.</hi> 20.
that it is the Sacrament of the Sacrifice of
Chriſt. In another place hee ſeemes to
affirme, that the pious ſoules of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
are helped by the Almes and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the living, but without the warrant
of the Word of God; eſpecially in his
