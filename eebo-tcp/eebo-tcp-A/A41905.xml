            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Leave her to Providence, for you muſt go</l>
               <l>A long with me, whether you will or no.</l>
               <l>I, Death, command Kings to leave their Crowns,</l>
               <l>And at my Feet they lay their Sceptres down.</l>
               <l>If unto Kings this Favour I not give,</l>
               <l>But cut them off, can you expect to live</l>
               <l>Beyond the Limit of your Time and Space</l>

               <l>I give the fatal Wound, my Dart is ſure,</l>
               <l>'I is far beyond the Doctor's Skill to cure.</l>
               <l>How freely can you let your Riches fly.</l>
               <l>To purchaſe Death, rather than yield to die.</l>
               <l>But while you flouriſh'd here in all your Store,</l>
               <l>You would not give one Penny to the Poor,</l>
               <l>Tho' in God's Name they Suit to you did make,</l>
               <l>You would not ſpare one Penny for his Sake.</l>
               <l>My Lord beheld wherein you did amiſs,</l>

               <l>Oh, heavy News! muſt I no longer ſtay?</l>
               <l>How ſhall I ſtand in the great Judgment Day?</l>
               <l>Down from her Eyes the cryſtal Tears did flow.</l>
               <l>She ſaid, None knows what I do undergo.</l>
               <l>Upon a Bed of Sorrow here I lie,</l>
               <l>My carnal Life makes me afraid to die.</l>
               <l>My Sins, alas! are many, groſs, and ſoul.</l>
               <l>Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> have Mercy on my Soul.</l>
               <l>And tho' I do deſerve thy righteous Frown,</l>
               <l>Yet pardon, Lord, and pour a Bleſſing down.</l>
               <l>Then with a dying Sigh her Heart did break,</l>
               <l>And did the Pleaſures of this World forſake.</l>
               <l>Thus may we ſee the High and Mighty fall.</l>
               <l>For cruel Death ſhews no Reſpect at all,</l>
               <l>To any one of high or low Degree.</l>
               <l>Great Men ſubmit to Death as well as we.</l>
               <l>Tho' they are gay, their Lives are but a Span.</l>
