            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of King <hi>Alphonſo's</hi> Reſignation of his Crown, and the Advancement of the Prince <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to the Regency of the Kingdom; being never till now publiſhed, or made known among our Country men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Portugal</hi> then is part of the Continent of <hi>Europe,</hi> being the moſt Weſterly part of it, waſh'd with the <hi>Atlantick</hi> or <hi>Weſtern-Ocean:</hi> The atmoſt Bounds of the known World till the famous Diſcoveries of the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> It was formerly accounted a third part of <hi>Spain,</hi> and called <hi>Luſitania,</hi> as the Ancients would have it, from <hi>Luſo</hi> and <hi>Lyſa,</hi> the fabulous Companions of <hi>Bacchus:</hi> now called <hi>Portugal,</hi> from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Gallorum,</hi> a great Fiſhing place of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> called <hi>Cale,</hi> now <hi>Caja,</hi> being ſcituate at the Mouth of the River <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi> It is in Length, from North to South, four hundred miles: The Breadth, from Eaſt to Weſt, is, in the broadeſt place, not exceeding one hundred miles, and in the narroweſt about eighty. The whole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference about eight hundred ſeventy nine miles; conteining about fourteen hundred and ſixty odd Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>It is Bounded on the North with the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Antinio</hi> and <hi>Avia,</hi> which part it from <hi>Galicia:</hi> On the South with the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58785:5"/>
Kingdom of <hi>Algarve:</hi> On the Weſt with the <hi>Atlantick Ocean,</hi> and on the Eaſt, with the two <hi>Caſtiles,</hi> and <hi>Eſtrama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dura.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Country it ſelf, it is Hilly and not very Fruitful, yet what Corn and other things of the growth thereof they have, are very excellent and good, eſpecially Fruits, which they have in abundance, and thoſe very delicious. It hath enough to maintain it ſelf, and to ſupply others with Hony, Salt, Wine, Oyl, Alumn, Fiſh, Fruits, Marble. It hath alſo ſeveral Mines. The Air is wholſome, ſubject to Heats, yet tollerable, eſpecially to the Natives, who are of a plain and ſimple behaviour to the reſt of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and have a great Antipathy to them for their Oppreſſion, but have of late years bore up bravely. They have been and ſtill are great Navigators by reaſon of their Vicinity to the Sea, and have thereby encreaſed the Dominion and Riches of the Nation by Conqueſt and Traffick abroad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much; being famous for their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries and Acquiſts in the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its chief Rivers are the <hi>Tagus,</hi> famous for its Golden Sands. <hi>Minius</hi> full of Red-Lead, whence it had the Name of <hi>Minium,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58785:5"/>
               <hi>Lethes</hi> or <hi>Lavada, Muliadas</hi> or <hi>Munde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go:</hi> The <hi>Duero</hi> and <hi>Anas.</hi> None of them Navigable but for a little ſpace, being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Swift and Narrow.</p>
            <p>The chief Cities are <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the Kings Chamber, a great Mart, of Old called <hi>Oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippo,</hi> or <hi>Uliſippo;</hi> Built, as they then held, by <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in his Peregrinations. It is in <hi>10</hi> Degrees of Longitude, <hi>38</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <hi>North,</hi> about ſeven miles Compaſs, and contains about <hi>20000</hi> Houſes, divided into <hi>30</hi> odd Pariſhes. <hi>Santaren</hi> or <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Irene,</hi> ſcituate alſo on the <hi>Tagus. Conimbra,</hi> ſeated on the River <hi>Monde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> a Biſhops See and Univerſity. <hi>Braga,</hi> an Archbiſhops See. <hi>Porto,</hi> or <hi>Porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> at the mouth of the <hi>Duero. Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> a Biſhops Sea. <hi>Braganza,</hi> whoſe Dukes are now Kings of <hi>Portugal. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bora,</hi> an Archbiſhops See. <hi>Portolegre,</hi> a Biſhops See. <hi>Olivenza,</hi> a City ſeated on the <hi>Guadiana. Beja,</hi> anciently <hi>Pax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulia</hi> now <hi>Mean, an ancient Colony of the</hi> Romans.</p>
            <p>As for the Language 'tis a Subdialect of the <hi>Latine</hi> mixed with <hi>Moriſco;</hi> the <hi>Moores</hi> having ſetled in <hi>Spain, 700</hi> Years: A time ſufficient to implant their Language: But more immediately a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue: Being <hi>Spaniſh</hi> more curtly and quicker pronounced: The <hi>Caſtilians</hi> affecting long trained words, agreeing with their ſuperb Gravity.</p>
            <p>But beſides this Dominion, there belongs to the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> many other large Territories, won to the Crown by Warlike and renowned Princes of that Nation, both in <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> But South of <hi>Portugal</hi> lyes the Kingdom of <hi>Algarve,</hi> won from the <hi>Moores,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Crown by <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the Third. This <hi>Regnum Algarbiorum</hi> had its Name as its ſuppoſed from its Weſterly ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; for ſo <hi>Algarve</hi> ſignifies in the <hi>Arabick.</hi> It reaches as far as <hi>St. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents Cape,</hi> or the <hi>Southern Cape,</hi> as the Mariners call it. The chiefeſt places in it are <hi>Niebla,</hi> once the Seat of their Kings. <hi>Sylvia,</hi> an In-land City, a Biſhops Seat. <hi>Villa Maona,</hi> ſcituate beyond the Cape. <hi>Tavila, Faro, Lagos,</hi> all Haven Towns.</p>
            <p>Beſides this there belongs to the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> certain Iſlands called the <hi>Azores,</hi> ſeated in the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick Ocean,</hi> directly oppoſite to <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> and diſtant from the Land about <hi>250</hi> Leagues, found out and ſubdued by Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> Son of King <hi>John</hi> the firſt From
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58785:6"/>
hence they reckon the firſt Longitude, as formerly from the <hi>Canaries,</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted more exact. They are called <hi>Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> from the multitude of <hi>Goſh-hawks</hi> found in them when they were firſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Azor</hi> ſignifying a <hi>Goſh hawk</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh Tongue</hi> They are Nine in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the chief of them is the <hi>Tercera,</hi> the place of Reſidence of <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the ſixth, ſince his Reſignation of the Crown. The reſt are <hi>St. Maries, St. Michaels, Fayal. Gratioſa, St. Georges, Duo, Flores, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,</hi> from the abundance of <hi>Crows</hi> therein. In <hi>Aſia</hi> the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> have very large Poſſeſſions, with many Forts and Places of Strength. The chief and richeſt is the City of <hi>Goa</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> one of the Keys of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> Here the <hi>Portugals</hi> have their <hi>Arſenals,</hi> with an Harbour for their Fleet.

againſt the ſeventh Pretender, and the moſt potent <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who employed the beſt wits in Christendom to make his pretences good, ſaying, <hi>That the Infant</hi> Don Edward <hi>being deceaſed before his Brother</hi> Henry <hi>was King, he could have no Right in himſelf, and therefore could derive none to his poſterity, for</hi> Nemo dat quod in ſe non habet: With theſe and many other niceties the Lawyers troubled themſelves to give a colour able Right to <hi>Philip,</hi> who was reſolv'd to carry it againſt them all, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the laſt and indubitable pretender, <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therine</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> the youngeſt Daughter to the Infant <hi>Don Edward,</hi> who beſides <hi>jure haereditatis,</hi> being of the better Line, had the fundamental Law on her ſide, which excluded the other Daughters, and was formerly put in execution againſt <hi>Beatrice</hi> Daughter of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the ninth; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no Arguments could confute or annull her indubitable Right, which was clear to the whole world: both by her deſcent and the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws of the Nation.

            <p>
               <hi>Eighteenthly, Philip</hi> the 2d, <hi>K.</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> obtained the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58785:20"/>
the eighteenth King thereof. For he had no ſooner heard the news of <hi>Henry's</hi> death, but he ſent an Army, having one ready for that purpoſe, under <hi>Ferdinand de Toledo,</hi> Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> who were at the Walls of <hi>Lisbon</hi> before they were aware, and ſo ſurprized them that they were not able to make any great reſiſtance: But they were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him for their King: who coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf in perſon was ſworn to ſeveral Articles, which ſeemed pleaſing and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and which it is thought he never intended to keep, neither did he.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That all Offices of the Church and State, and the Government of Towns and Places ſhould be conferred on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and not upon Strangers.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>And thus he obtained the Crown of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> making the Emperors Son <hi>Albertus,</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and his Nephew Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, keeping it in quiet poſſeſſion till he dyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nineteenthly, Philip</hi> the 3d, K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſucceeded his Father to that Crown, and alſo to this of <hi>Portugal,</hi> being the <hi>18th</hi> King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> In his Reign <hi>Antonio</hi> the Baſtard being entertained by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and bountifully releived, acknowledging him her Kinſman, deſcended of the Blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of <hi>England,</hi> and Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained here till the Wars broke out between King <hi>Philip,</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when ſhe ſent <hi>Antonio</hi> with a Fleet under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> (with whom alſo went the Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex)</hi> into <hi>Portugal,</hi> where they landed, and came before <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but finding none ready to joyn with them, as <hi>Antonio</hi> had made them believe, after ſome exploits they were forced to return, <hi>re infecta.</hi> Thus he kept his Grown, making the <hi>Portugals,</hi> for fear and awe of his Power more than out of good will, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58785:21"/>
the ſmother'd fire broke forth into a flame, upon the <hi>1</hi> of <hi>Feb.

They ſoon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, ſecuring the Governeſs, and killing the Secretary <hi>Vaſconſellos,</hi> with ſome few more that made reſiſtance, ſhewing a great deſpight to the Secretary, whom the common people cut all to pieces, uſing his body in a moſt vile manner, to ſatisfie their implacable rage. This done, they proclaim the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> King. And thus the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> loſt the whole Dominion of <hi>Portugal;</hi> all the reſt of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, both abroad and at home, in a few months returned wholly into the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal's</hi> hands, and ſo have continu'd to this day, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> keeping only the Town of <hi>Cexta</hi> in <hi>Affrica</hi> of all that juſtly belonged to the <hi>Portugal;</hi> ſo great, ſo full, and ſo quick a change was hardly to be paralleld in paſt Ages, and all through the natural hatred the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguize</hi> bore to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:58785:22"/>
thus came to the Crown, who was the Grandſon of <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bragance,</hi> and <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> the right and indubitable Heir of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> He was married to <hi>Lonyſa,</hi> Siſter to the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a noble, heroick and maſculine Spirit, and whoſe prudence and courage was no ſmall furtherance of the Dukes obtaining his Right, ſaying, <hi>That 'twas better nobly to dy in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing for the Crown, than to be made a ſlave by the</hi> Spaniſh Tyranny, <hi>and to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in fear of his Enemies.</hi> They were both Crowned at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with great pomp and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; and as they had obtained the Crown with much prudence and magnanimity, ſo they kept it with courage and policy, God bleſſing their Armys with victory and ſucceſs all their days.</p>

Having, according to the Laws of the Realm, called together the <hi>States General,</hi> to declare the Infante <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> Prince, ſome of them had thoughts of preferring to him <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> but that motion was not followed, either becauſe they feared leſt they might fall into the like diſorders as happened in the time of the Infante's <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> and <hi>Don Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> or elſe that the Cuſtom of the Realm carryed it againſt all other reaſon. <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> was no ſooner declared Prince, and preſumptive Heir to the Realm of the King his Father, but he began to regard no more the advice of his Tutor, nor the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of the King and the Queen.</p>

But the King in theſe laſt moments of his Life, made appear his Piety by his religious thoughts, and his Wiſdom, by the good Order which he took in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Realm, in chooſing the Queen Tutoreſs of her Children, and Regent of the State; for he perſwaded himſelf with very much reaſon, that ſhe who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited him with ſo much courage to take the Scepter, would be capable to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, during the minority of the Prince.</p>

broken in a thouſand publick places, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient Cuſtom; the Prince <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> was ſhown to the People, and declared King in the ordinary forms. The ſame day the Queen took the quality <note place="margin">

She had no ſooner ordered the Affairs of the State (which ſhe did with ſo much prudence, as if ſhe had all her life time governed Kingdoms) but ſhe named (according to the will of the late King) for Governour of <hi>Alphonſo, Don Franciſco de Faro,</hi> Count of <hi>Odemira.</hi> But this Prince, abuſing the authority which the Crown gave him, quickly ſcorn'd the advice of his Governour, as he had alſo before that of his Tutor; ſince when no Remonſtrance, no Addreſs was able to reſtrain the Impetuoſity of his Deſires.</p>

Among theſe petty Merchants,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58785:25"/>
who were lodged in the Porches, there was one whoſe name was <hi>Antony de Conti Vintimiglia,</hi> a Native of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally of <hi>Vintimiglia,</hi> a Town in the Country of <hi>Gennes:</hi> The King perceiving this Youth ordinarily to take the party for which he had the moſt Inclination, he let him know how much it pleaſed him, ſo that oftentimes he came down to the Door to entertain him; This favour ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Conti</hi> hardy enough to make preſents to the King of ſilken Slings, gilded Knives, and other Toys proportionable to his Age. The Queen ſeeing that this familiarity paſſed too far, and that there might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſome trouble therefrom, ordered <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> to come no more to the Palace; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did not obey, but did it more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly.</p>
            <p>The King vexed at this, endeavoured to ſee <hi>Conti</hi> with more earneſtneſs than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo that they were fain to permit him to ſee him, thinking that their endeavours to hinder it did but the more provoke him to deſire it, and that this permiſſion would weaken his deſire. But this Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion coſt the Realm of <hi>Portugal</hi> very dear, and was a Spark which afterwards produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a great Flame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58785:25"/>
The King being now of Age to ride the <note place="margin">1657.</note> Great Horſe, the weakneſs of his Arm not being ſo much, as to hinder him from managing the Bridle, nor that of his Leg but that he could ſtay himſelf in his Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops; they reſolved then to put the Reins into his hands, which they did with the aid of <hi>Don Franciſco de Souſa,</hi> Count <hi>de Prado,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe, and of <hi>Antony Galvao D' Andrade,</hi> the chief Querry; but this exerciſe inſtead of putting him off from <hi>Conti,</hi> did but tye him cloſer to him.</p>
            <p>There was in the Court of <hi>Lion,</hi> which they had choſen for him to ride the great Horſe in, a Gate in a low Gallery, through which they brought the Horſes for him to ride. The King was accuſtomed that way to let in at thoſe extraordinary hours not only <hi>Antony de Conti,</hi> but alſo <hi>John de Conti</hi> his Brother, with other young Boys, both <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Negroes,</hi> who in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence uſed all ſorts of violent exerciſes. He was not content with this, but he mingled himſelf among them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times among thoſe who flung the Bar, and ſometimes among thoſe who flung Dirt, and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe who fell to fiſty Cuffs,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58785:26"/>
without conſidering that Princes ought not to receive for Companions in their ſports any, but ſuch perſons, who are illuſtrious either by their Birth, or by their Merit.</p>
            <p>Theſe Teſtimonies which the King gave of a mean ſpirit, and of a violent nature, gave to the Queen an exceſſive trouble. The Count <hi>D' Odemira</hi> was ſenſibly touched, knowing that they ordinarily impute the faults of Princes to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, as it happened to <hi>Don John Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> D' <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> who was charged with the cruel Actions of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> The Count reſolved then to withdraw the King, at what price ſoever he did it, from this ſhameful converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Having one day found in the Court of <hi>Lion,</hi> the King environ'd by <hi>Conti,</hi> and all that Gang, he chaſed them away, he forbad entrance to <hi>Conti,</hi> with menaces to chaſtiſe him if ever he durſt return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again: The King more troubled than <hi>Conti</hi> at this Prohibition and Menace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired himſelf into his Appartment with exceſſive trouble.</p>
            <p>Some of thoſe who were about him had no ſooner known that he was diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his Governour, and that he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58785:26"/>
had an Affection for <hi>Conti,</hi> but they let him underſtand, that to ſubject his own Inclinations to the Sentiments of another, was to conſent to the ruine of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This had ſuch power on the mind of the King, that after this he rejected whatever advice they would give him; he grew obſtinate, even to rage, that he would learn no Leſſon, nor eat, nor drink, till they had brought back <hi>Conti</hi> to him, ſo that they were obliged to bring him to him.</p>
            <p>In the Court of <hi>Lyon,</hi> they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for his diverſion had Dog-fighting, which Combats were at firſt private, but at laſt they became publick. Theſe Maſtiffs were kept in the great Court of the Palace, where being all ſorts of Dogs, and unty'd, they very often fell upon thoſe they found in their way. The diverſion of Bough-fighting was brought alſo from the Court of the Chappel to the ſame place, and at laſt became ſo common in the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> that what was formerly the ſport only of little children, became in a ſhort ſpace to be a bloody Combat. In all theſe Diverſions, thoſe wherein the moſt Blood was ſhed, pleaſed the Kingmoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:58785:27"/>
Theſe Diſorders being come to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, his Governour thought that it was beſt for him to find out diverſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his humour, but that they might not be ſo publick, ſo that if any thing ſhould happen that might be any blemiſh, it might be the leſs taken notice of. They reſolved then to teach him the uſe of Weapons, and they gave him for his Maſter therein <hi>Diego Gomes de Figue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo;</hi> but they found it impoſſible to make him follow any Method; for he would not learn to do any thing skilfully, as he ſhould do, but was all for downright blows. This exerciſe, handſom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent enough, became however very deadly and criminal, through the ill uſe that he made of it.</p>
            <p>That they might cauſe an emulation in the King, they permitted to enter the Palace certain young men, who under pretext of making a flouriſh in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, brought with them all ſorts of Weapons, every one having a deſign to let him ſee his force and skill. But in theſe exerciſes there happened almoſt every day one or other ill accident, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when they darted certain Knives purpoſely made, which many times ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

This Example was the cauſe that thoſe Crimes, from which they had abſtained before for fear of Juſtice, were now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with Aſſurance; ſo that the King hereby drew upon himſelf the ill-will of all the People, not only by his own Actions, but alſo by thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>They had lodged the Infante <hi>Don Pedro</hi> in the Queens Apartment, that his Union with the King might thereby become the more ſtrong, and eaſy to be compaſſed, and therefore they had given to them both one Tutor, that they might likewiſe learn together: But this did no good to the King, and was a notable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Infante; for when they ſhould have followed their Books, the King would diſturb them, and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt his Tutor, in reciting his ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Divertiſements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:58785:28"/>
The King and the Infante had often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times differences between them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded but on ſlight matters quickly ceaſed: However the malice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites fomented theſe petty miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, in ſuch ſort that the King put himſelf to oppoſe the <hi>Infante</hi> on every occaſion.</p>
            <p>It was at this time, that the Favour of <hi>Conti</hi> with the King, who was now ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, began to ſpread abroad; certain Courtiers perſwading themſelves that he had perfectly eſtabliſhed himſelf in the Heart of the Prince, for that he had wholly deſtroy'd his Governour, they grew ſo ſhameleſs, as to make him the object of their reſpects. After which he had the boldneſs to vaunt himſelf to be deſcended from a Branch of <hi>Vintimiglia,</hi> an Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Family in the Realm of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and this was maintained by the teſtimony of ſome Flatterers.</p>
            <p>For the moſt part the perſons that came near the King were debauch'd in their ſpeeches, and it was no wonder to hear him ſpeak diſhoneſt words even before the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>Some of his Councellors offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, advis'd the Queen that he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58785:28"/>
into the new Apartment, called the <hi>Fort,</hi> where thoſe Perſons who Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his Manners, ſhould not have ſo much liberty to come. To this end, the Queen ordered he ſhould be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there by <hi>Don John de Silva,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Govea,</hi> grand Maſter of the Houſe, <hi>Garcia de Mello,</hi> grand Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, the Count <hi>de Padro,,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe, <hi>Don John de Almeida,</hi> Maſter of the Wardrobe, and by <hi>Lewis de Mello,</hi> Captain of his Guards. The Count <hi>de Padro,</hi> being gone to Command the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; in his abſence, the Charge of firſt Gentleman of his Chamber, and that of Maſter of the Horſe, were given to <hi>Don Diego de Lima,</hi> Vicount <hi>de Villanova de Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veira;</hi> they gave alſo the Charge of Chief Gentleman of the Chamber, to <hi>Lewis de Vaſconcelos,</hi> and <hi>Souſa</hi> Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe Officers were to ſerve Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to lie in the Palace, and to the end that ſome of them might always be about the King; thoſe before mentioned, were to be Relieved in the Day-time by <hi>Don Vaſco Maſcarenhas,</hi> Count of <hi>Obidos, Nuno de Mendoſa,</hi> Count <hi>de Valdereis, Lewis de Silva Tello,</hi> Count <hi>de Aveiras,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:58785:29"/>
and <hi>Franciſco de Sonſa Coutinho,</hi> Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of State. All theſe Lords having Keys, to enter in at all times when they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The Queen ordered this Project to be kept ſecret, and that they ſhould keep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Door, which gave way for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between her Apartment, and that of the King's. But he ſoon fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all theſe Deſigns. The Count <hi>de Odemira,</hi> his Governour, having told him, That the quarter through which he ſhould go out, was made up: He anſwered him briskly, that he would then go thorow the Hall of the <hi>Almane</hi> Guards. The Count having told him that there was a great many People in that Hall: He replied, it was no matter, ſince it could be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>By theſe Anſwers of the King, they judg'd, that all things would be well, and they councelled him to paſs by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber of the Queen, to ſhew himſelf to the Nobles, and by the Hall of the <hi>Almane</hi> Guards, to be ſeen by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This unuſual thing made them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he would ſoon have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and every one conceived ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope or fear, according to the ſtate of their Fortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:58785:29"/>
And now, ſince there were none near the King but thoſe Perſons, whoſe Merits begat them Reſpect, he for ſome time ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from ſeeing <hi>Conti,</hi> and thoſe of his Cabal; but this did not laſt long, for he quickly found ways to bring them to him. The King continued his Exerciſes, but without any Progreſs, becauſe he neglected the Leſſons of his Maſters. He uſed his Weapons with ſo much fury, as if he had been in Combat, and he forced his Horſe in ſuch a manner, as if he would kill him, or make him break his Neck; chooſing always the moſt furious, and that which had the hardeſt Mouth.</p>
            <p>One Day when he was at <hi>Alcantara,</hi> a <note place="margin">

He Encountred upon the way a Bull, which he irritated in ſuch ſort, that his Horſe having been wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Animal, fell into that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and violence, that he flung him to the Ground without ſenſe. His Servants running to his ſuccour, found him cold.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58785:30"/>
He was five times let Blood for that fall. They made him divers Remonſtrances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Accident, but it was with very much Modeſty, becauſe thoſe they had formerly made him were received with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment. Thoſe who had the moſt Zeal for the Service of the King, contented themſelves not to approve of thoſe Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which they had not power to hinder.</p>
            <p>He did not only let Beaſts feel his Fury, but he alſo would eſſay it upon Men. One Night as he was returning from <hi>Palha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam,</hi> where he had been, he got looſe from thoſe who followed him, to take up his ſtand. And having perceived two Men of a good Preſence, he put on his Horſe with might and main to Ride over them, but his Stirrop being entangled in the Belt of one of them, he could not bring about his Deſign. Being vext he was not known, he turned about and drew his Sword to kill him. When this Man ſaw his Sword in his Hand, he alſo drew his, ſo that he was ready to Repulſe the King; when the Grand Maſter of the Game came in, and putting himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, he told the King it was not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that his Majeſty ſhould kill his Subjects. At the word Majeſty, this Man
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58785:30"/>
underſtanding he had drawn his Sword againſt his King, with a Reſpect mingled with Confuſion and Fear, withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf behind a Wall, whither the King had purſued him, if that Obſtacle had not hindred him. After this, he ſtopp'd in the middle of the Field to Recount this Action, which he praiſed as one moſt Heroick.</p>
            <p>This Adventure was followed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, much more dangerous. The King paſſing before the <hi>Noviciat</hi> of the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, they put him in mind that over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it there were ſome luſty brave Courſers, which he preſently alighted to ſee. In the mean time while he waited for ſome Torches, ſome-body told him that there were great Maſtiffs in the Cloſe of the <hi>Noviciate;</hi> upon this, forgetting the Horſes, he Commanded they ſhould open the Gate. But when he ſaw it was not very readily done, he fell into a Paſſion, and gave Order that they ſhould break it open. But as they began to do it, they opened it; and the King negligently entring, got from thoſe that followed him with one Foot-Man, only on Foot.</p>
            <p>He had not gone many Paces, but he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58785:31"/>
Encountered with three Men, and he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briskly took his Sword into his Hand, they did the like. The King who was Booted, had entangled himſelf in ſuch a manner, that at the firſt Thruſt he fell backwards with a Blow he received at the ſame time. His Gentlemen being come in at the claſhing of Swords, and at the Cry of the King, who at firſt, cry'd out, <hi>I am Kill'd;</hi> and a little after, <hi>I am Wounded.</hi> He was preſently carried to his Palace in a Coach, but his Wound was not very dangerous. Two of the Men fled, the third was taken, but the Maſter of the Game hindered them from killing him. When the King had Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it, and was ſomething better, the Councel of State Ordered (with the Queens conſent) that they ſhould go in a Body together, to make him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance for the preſervation of his Perſon. <hi>Don Nuno Alvares Pereira,</hi> Duke <hi>de Cadaval,</hi> ſpeaking for the reſt, told him:</p>
            <p>That the Councel of State, who were all there preſent, to ſatisfie their Zeal, and the Order that they had received from the Queen his Mother, from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante his Brother, and from the Infanta

his Siſter, and generally from the whole Realm; they were come to Supplicate his Majeſty, that he would change that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living, which every day expoſed his Life to Danger, and put the State in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hazard of a deplorable Ruine. That it was not Reaſonable that his Majeſty ſhould be ſo careleſs of his Life, nor Juſt, that without Cauſe he ſhould take away the Life of his Subjects, which would Alienate the Love they have for him, in which principally conſiſts the Art of Reigning. That his Majeſty would be pleaſed now to think of himſelf, and of all his Subjects, who were ready to pour forth their Blood for his Service. That this was the only way to eſtabliſh Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility in the Realm.</p>
            <p>The King was Diverted from this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, by thoſe who foreſaw that the Face of their Fortune would be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if he ſhould change his Life. They had ſo well Confirm'd him in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there was nothing like the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing what one would; that the Counſel of theſe Great and Illuſtrious Miniſters, was unprofitable.</p>
            <p>His Favourites were not contented to have rendred his Humour violent, but

would further, that he ſhould give himſelf to naughty Women, hoping that that Paſſion would render him the more capable to Reſiſt ſtoutly all thoſe who ſhould go about to Condemn his Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. And indeed, they had ti'd him to it in ſuch ſort, that he obſerved no meaſure, inſomuch that he would not ſo much as be thought Chaſt. He had a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that always lay in his Anti-chamber, who never went to Supper until he was in Bed. In the mean time this Gentleman was abſent, the King often times aroſe, and Arming himſelf as if to fight a Battle, he went out of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by a Ladder of Ropes, followed by <hi>Antony,</hi> and <hi>John de Conti,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Braves, all Armed as well as he, who ſeemed to breath nothing but Blood, and Slaughter.

There was never a Night that they went out thus, but on the Morning were recounted a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Tragick Stories: In fine, he was

feared every where, as a Wild Beaſt. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſaw theſe Proſtitute Women at their Houſes, yet they did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to bring them into the Palace to him. He vaunted himſelf to have to do with them in ſuch Exceſs, that as it was above all likelihood, ſo, no Body believed any thing of it.</p>
            <p>One Day being put in mind, that he was to meet with a certain fair Goſſip, in the Church of our Lady <hi>de Rocher;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one a Clock he went into his Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with <hi>John de Conti,</hi> and <hi>Francis de Sequeira,</hi> the Groom of his Wardrobe, to ſee for her there, but miſſing of her, ſhe being gone to the Church of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> he Commanded them to carry him thither; paſſing through the narrow Street of St. <hi>Peter de Alfama,</hi> they met the Coach of <hi>Martin Correa de Sa</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cout <hi>de Aſſeca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being in great haſt, the Conductors of his Litter cried out to the <hi>Vicounts</hi> People, to get out of the way with ſuch Injurious words, that they not being able to take it, drew, the others doing the like; and the Combat grew ſo hot, that the <hi>Vicount</hi> was forced to leave his Coach to help his People, alſo <hi>Francis</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:58785:33"/>
               <hi>de Sequeira</hi> did the like from that of the Kings, to help the others. The King might with one word, have made all this Diſorder have ceaſed, but however he would not; but on the contrary, being himſelf come forth of his Litter with <hi>John Conti,</hi> he ſet a Piſtol to the Throat of the <hi>Vicount,</hi> who was already Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had certainly kill'd him, if the Piſtol had taken fire. So ſoon as the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> knew the King, he kiſs'd his Sword, and falling upon his knees demanded Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; but neither this Submiſſion, nor the Innocency of this Gentleman, could hinder the King from giving him many outragious Speeches. All the People were ſurpriſed to ſee the King was come abroad with ſo ſmall a Company, and that he would have kill'd one of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects without any Cauſe, and a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man brought up with him in the Palace, at Noon-day, and in a publick place, ſo that they perceived he took Pleaſure to intermingle with theſe Quarrels, and to Foment them; which made every Body to fear the Danger to be general, and every one to begin to be afraid for himſelf.</p>
            <p>As the King increaſed in Age, the more he was corrupted, and the diſorder
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58785:33"/>
came to that paſs, that by his example the more vertuous began to grow looſe, they began to quit virtue, to embrace vice, by example and emulation. The Queen was obliged to have recourſe to the Protection of Heaven, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remedy, ſhe was capable of, for theſe misfortunes with which the Realm was threatned: However ſhe would try one human way more, perſwading her ſelf, if ſhe could bring the King to the publick Audiences, which ſhe gave twice a week to the Subjects, to the Councel, and to Buſineſs, he might be brought to be capable of governing the Realm; but all was in vain, for he was not able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to it for his pleaſures.</p>
            <p>They had perſwaded him, that he was not truly a King, who parted with the Government to another, and ſo long as the Queen hindred his Liberalities to thoſe he loved, the people believed that it was ſhe who reigned and not he; that he was now of age enough to govern the State himſelf, for King <hi>Dennis</hi> had done it at the age of ſixteen years, and the Kings, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> at fifteen, and <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> at fourteen; and that it was inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they ſhould refuſe the King a thing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58785:34"/>
that he had power to take himſelf. By ſuch diſcourſes they filled the mind of the King with troubleſom ſuſpitions againſt the Queen.</p>
            <p>The King was no ſooner out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment they had given him, but he let them know, by what he did, the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had for <hi>Conti;</hi> for he was not contented to have given him a Command, a Houſe in the Country, and a right of Peerage, but he alſo made him Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Houſe, Knight of Chriſt, and Groom of the Wardrobe, Honours that were never granted but to perſons that were illuſtrious, by Birth, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>He added at the ſame time to all theſe Favours, an Apartment in the Palace, that he might have communication with himſelf, and the Arch-deaconry <hi>de Sobre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dello,</hi> for <hi>John de Conti</hi> his Brother.</p>
            <p>After this, the Courtiers ran in heaps to render homage to <hi>Conti,</hi> as a new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite; and every one began to ſeek his Protection, and to commend their moſt important Affairs to him. The Queen her ſelf was obliged to have recourſe to his Credit in ſome Buſineſſes, which ſhe was not able to effect of her ſelf, which was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58785:34"/>
the only way to maintain him in that height, to which Fortune had exalted him, for this way he was able to manage the mind of that perſon, who gave him moſt jealouſy.</p>
            <p>As the King was every day ſenſible of thoſe infirmities, which his ſickneſſes had cauſed, the Phyſicians were of opinion that he ſhould go again to the Baths of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidus;</hi> But he inſtead of bathing himſelf there, did nothing but divert himſelf, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo much trouble and damage to all the Country about, and committing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuch cruel actions, that the people were fain to ſhut themſelves up in their houſes, or elſe to fly and leave them, that they might ſhun meeting him; ſo much hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had they for him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Queen falling ſick, and the Favorites and the King by ſome diſcourſes having cauſed a ſuſpition that he would take the Government, they were afraid that this ſickneſs would ſerve for a pretext to that deſign; but inſtead of that he applyed himſelf to combat a Lion againſt a Bull, but the Lion being ſo obſtinate as not to be forced out of his Cage, he made them bring ſo much wood and fire, that they choak'd him with the ſmoak.</p>

In the beginning of the Year 1661, the <note place="margin">1661.</note> Count of <hi>Odemira,</hi> his Governour dyed, who was very much bewailed by all the people, for the King after his death abandoned himſelf to all manner of evil Inclinations more than before; although he was not Maſter of the Kings Spirit, yet his Merit, and his Addreſs made thoſe to ſtand in aw of him, who had the moſt power over him.</p>
            <p>They had about this time begun to treat of the Marriage of the moſt ſerene Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta <hi>Catherine,</hi> with his Majeſty, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, King of <hi>England,</hi> not long before eſtabliſhed in the Throne of his Anceſtors. <hi>Franciſco de Mello de Torres,</hi> Embaſſadour Extraordinary in <hi>England,</hi> was charged with this Negotiation, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> endeavoured to hinder what they could.</p>
            <p>The Queen deſired ardently to ſee this Marriage accompliſhed, the Infante declared Prince, and the Government of the State in the hands of the King, to the end, that ſhe might looſe her ſelf from all Affairs of the World, and to retire her ſelf to a Covent, that ſhe might there be at leiſure to give her ſelf up to Prayer and Contemplation. For this end ſhe wrote
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58785:35"/>
with her own hand in her Natural Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the Reaſons which made her take this Reſolution. This ſhe ſhewed to one of her Miniſters, to know his Opinion of her Deſign.</p>
            <p>And for that, this Writing refutes the Calumnies which the Enemies of that Princeſs made uſe of to ſullie her Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in publiſhing ſhe would have taken away the Crown from the King, to have given it to the Infante; I have judged it neceſſary to Report it here.</p>

               <note place="margin">This <hi>Dona Maria</hi> is a natural Daughter of the late King Don <hi>John.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>into that of</hi> Carnide: <hi>It is not that I could not live in the Houſe where ſhe is, without any Repugnancy, but as the manner of Life I would chooſe, will not ſuffer me to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with any Body; if I ſhould be in the Houſe where ſhe is, I could not civily diſpence with my ſelf from anſwering the Reſpects which ſhe would pay me. If by chance I ſhould be Melancholy, as it may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well happen, ſhe might be perſwaded ſhe was the cauſe of it, at leaſt I ſhould do to my ſelf ſome Violence to diſſemble it, which would render me unhappy. So that it is eaſie to judg by this, I ſhould not live in this Houſe with all the Freedom I would. As to that of the</hi> Carmelites <hi>of St.</hi> Albert, <hi>I there find this difficulty, the fewneſs of the Lodgings which they have; for it ſeems to</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58785:37"/>
               <hi>me, to make a good choice of a Retreat in which one intends to end their days, or wholly to ſhut themſelves up within the Walls of the Palace, according to the Cuſtome of the Country, one ſhould make Election of a ſpacious and pleaſant Place, and one that had a Proſpect towards the Sea, would pleaſe me extreamly. If inſtead of St.</hi> Tereſa, <hi>I ſhould have recourſe to St.</hi> Dominie, <hi>whom I revere as an unfortunate Relation, I find the Covent</hi> of Good Succeſs <hi>of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which is moſt Commodious, both becauſe of its fair Situation, and large Extent. Nevertheleſs it hath an Inconvenience, for as it ſtands at the Mouth of a River, it will be the firſt Covent, that will be expoſed to the Violences of War. All things well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I think, that I had better be at</hi> Lisborn, <hi>than in any other place, becauſe it is a City in which there is no want of any Commodity, without ſpeaking of the great number of the Religious, Virtuous, and Learned Men, which are there to be found for the eaſe of ones Conſcience. In the Lands of my Apanage, there is no Place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for my Deſign: And as for my Building a Covent, I have not patience enough for ſuch an Enterpriſe; beſides, as I hope that my Retreat will be happy, and finding my</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:58785:37"/>
               <hi>ſtrength decaying, I would very ſuddenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute my Reſolution. Having therefore no further care, than about the manner of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Deſign: I ask not Counſel about it, becauſe I am aſſured that it will not be Approved, and that very many will deſire me not to Abandon the State and the King; though the moſt part of them will wiſh the contrary in their Souls. Being certain that they are capable of ſuch Diſguiſements, I may fear every day leſt they ſhould order me to withdraw; and in this fear, I think it would be much better for me to do it by my own Motion. There is nothing but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of my Children could have kept me in the World, which now will be well enough; my Daughter being Married, it remains that I ſee the Infante declared Prince, which is a thing I have long deſired, it being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary to Aſſemble the States for that Cauſe. But I muſt yet wait nevertheleſs, maugre my Impatience till the departure of the Queen of</hi> England; <hi>then I ſhall give Order about it. As for the Peace with</hi> Spain, <hi>I have no hope I ſhall be able to conclude it before my Retirement; however I ſhall do all my endeavours to bring it to paſs. Beſides, after the departure of the Queen of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>there will be Speech of nothing but</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:58785:38"/>
               <hi>War, the report of which, will not penetrate my Retirement; but if I ſhould defer any long time to quit the World, they would have Reaſon to reproach me, for leaving the State embroiled. They may perhaps Object to me, That I ought to ſtay, that I may have the Pleaſure of having ended all theſe Affairs of which I ſpeak: But I anſwer to that, That I ſhall reliſh them more ſweetly in my Retreat. And if they ſhould pretend, that I may be neceſſary to the State, and that whatſoever Inquietude, and whatſoever Pain it ſhould coſt me, I ought not to Abandon it. I further anſwer, If all the People were reſolved to Die to benefit the State, I would willingly Die with them, but that I ſhould only bear the whole Burthen of all Affairs for the Eaſe of others, is the thing that I would not do. Would they could find another Remedy, or that God would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide one; and as I have all my Confidence in him, I am ſure he will be fauourable to my Intentions. It ſeems to me that they will have hence-forward ſufficient Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For want of Time, and through abundance of Affairs, I have not Time to declare my ſelf ſo fully by word of Mouth; Therefore I have wrote theſe lines, to the end they may be the more leiſurely Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:58785:38"/>
               <hi>that I may receive good Counſel, in order to my Retreat. If I ſhould Retire ſecretly, they would believe that I flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; if I ſhould do it openly, they would imagine, perhaps, that I endeavour to be hindered, and there will be enough found, who will think they are obliged to hinder me. Once again I demand of you ſincere Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of all theſe things, and I pray Heaven, he will inlighten the Mind of thoſe who are to give it to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, while they were conſidering of theſe things, all things were diſpoſed for the Embarquement of the new Queen; and on the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1662. thoſe Veſſels in which ſhe was to go into <hi>England,</hi> ſet Sail under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Franciſco de Melle de Torres,</hi> ſince made Marqueſs of <hi>Sande.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aſſoon as ſhe was gone, the Queen Regent reſolved to ſeparate the Infante from the King, it not being reaſonable he ſhould be without Education, eſpecially in a Time in which the King appeared incapable of Governing the Realm. And as it was the Cuſtome to give to the Princes, and to the Infantes, a Houſe fit for their Quality, ſhe had a mind
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58785:39"/>
the Infante <hi>Don Pedro</hi> ſhould have one of his own.</p>
            <p>When the Queen had begun to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what Officers ſhe would have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for him, the Order they ſhould keep, and that ſhe had ſought out for him a Governor; they perſwaded the King ſhe had grand Deſigns againſt him, and that the Governor ſhe would give to his Brother, was a ſign ſhe intended to make him King, ſince they uſed to be given only to Kings: They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured farther to inſinuate into him, he had the Right of chooſing thoſe who were to ſerve the Infante, and not the Queen.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this, they prepared for him the Houſe of <hi>Chriſtopher de Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> Morqueſs of <hi>Caſtlerodrigo,</hi> ſituate in a place called <hi>Cortreul;</hi> and nominated for Gentlemen of his Chamber, <hi>Martin Alfonſe de Mello,</hi> Count of St. <hi>Laurence, Don John de Acoſta,</hi> Count <hi>de Soure, Ruy de Moura Telles, Don Rodrigo de Meneſſes, George de Mello, John Nunes de Achuna,</hi> Count of St. <hi>Vincent;</hi> for his Almoner, <hi>Rodrigo D' Acunha de Saldanha,</hi> Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Cathedral Church in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or Secretary, <hi>Antony de Tavares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:58785:39"/>
This Change gave a Jealouſie to the King, as if his Mother and his Brother had a Deſign to have taken away his Crown. For they made him believe, that never any Infante of <hi>Portugal</hi> had had ſo great a Houſe, nor had ever been ſerv'd by Officers ſo conſiderable. The diſtruſt of the King was increaſed the more, by the number of thoſe who continually ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their reſpects to the Infante, he found to himſelf very few, and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace almoſt a Deſert. But the Infante for all that, was not wanting in his Duty, but on the contrary, waited on the King with more diligence than before, in all publick places, and into the Country when he went thither to Divert himſelf: As he did not imitate his Debauches, his Modeſty paſſed for a Crime in the minds of thoſe who feared that all his good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were but reproaches againſt the King. They endeavoured to perſwade him, that the Infante covered much Pride under that ſeeming Modeſty; and all he did was but to make believe, he was more worthy of the Crown than he.</p>
            <p>The King becoming every day more diſordered, the Queen reſolved to execute the Deſign which ſhe had to quit the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58785:40"/>
ordering for that end <hi>Pedro Vieira de Silva,</hi> Secretary of State, to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all thoſe Diſpaches neceſſary for it. But that Miniſter full of Zeal, did remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to her, that this Affair did very well merit a ſerious Reflection, and that he ought to propoſe it to the Councel of State; which being done, they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>That it was true, the Age of the King gave him a Right to the Government of the State, but the Malady which he had received when young, had rendered him uncapable. That he did no ways bridle himſelf at theſe Years, but ſhewed only the evil qualities of his Mind, and thoſe Maxims ſo contrary to thoſe which are neceſſary for Princes, who will Rule well. That to leave to him the Rule of the Kingdom, would be to Abandon all to the imprudence of his Favorites, for he would infallibly diſcharge it by them. That if ſhe ſhould execute her reſolution, and leave her Son in the midſt of the Tempeſt, ſhe would render unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable all the Precautions of the late King, and would not anſwer that which all the World expected from her Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and her Zeal. When the King
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58785:40"/>
himſelf ſhould be of more Age, and have more Experience, and more noble Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, than he hath, at laſt, when he ſhall be capable of reigning, he would ſtill have need of her Councel; and more eſpecialiy then, when he wants all theſe things, ſhe ſhould not quit the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if ſhe would not have that Curſe fall upon the Realm, which the Scripture mentions of a young King.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons were far from ſhaking the Queens Reſolutions, and did the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm them, for they did not a little contribute to the fear ſhe had, to ſee her Credit diminiſhed; ſo ſhe thought this Retreat, which would ſave her from a Diſcontent, from giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the King, and a ſcandal to the State, could not be blamed by Perſons of good ſenſe. Upon this the Miniſters conjure her,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That ſince ſhe would not change her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, yet at leaſt to defer the Execution of it, until they had taken away from about the King, thoſe who corrupted his Mind, and fomented his Debauches, becauſe ſo long as he ſhould hearken to the Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe People, his Irregularities would</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:58785:41"/>
               <hi>never ceaſe. That ſhe ſhould conſider, if they troubled the Government of a Queen, the Mother and Tutreſs of the King, and Regent of the Realm, ſhe had much reaſon to believe, they would oppoſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe Miniſters, who ſhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obey the King as Subjects. If her Majeſty ſhould retire, for fear beſt the King ſhould fail to pay that reſpect which he ows her, how could the Miniſters hope to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Authority? That her Majeſty ſhould before hand remove from the King thoſe that were about him, and fill up their places with others more capable; that this was the only Remedy to correct his evil Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. But if this ſhould not produce the wiſhed for Effect, and Heaven ſhould not ſecond her good Intentions, her Majeſty having (at leaſt) let all the World ſee, it was not her fault that things would be no better, ſhe might after this execute, with more honour, the Reſolution, which her Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thoſe other Conſiderations had made her to undertake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen approved of this Councel, as profitable to the King, and to the State, and her Reſolution gave place to that which they had taken of calling the States,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58785:41"/>
to ſee what Remedy they could find for theſe preſent Diſorders, which might have a very ill Sequel; for the Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Miniſters of State, the Advice of a Governour, and of a Tutor, had not made any Impreſſion on the mind of the King, and thoſe cruel miſchances, the diſgraces which had happened to him at the running at the Bulls, the Perils that he had eſcaped in a thouſand Rencounters, had not rendred him more circumſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In ſine,</hi> That this was not to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any part of Duty to the King, ſince it was the only means to bring him to himſelf; that in extream and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate evils violent Remedies are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be uſed; and as they had heretofore laboured with ſo much ſucceſs for the recovery of the publick Liberty, they ought ſtill to go on with the ſame vigour, to ſave the State from the Ruin, with which it was threatned. But as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Eſtates General would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a long time, and their Aſſembling would be retarded by thoſe who feared it, they judged, inſtead of that it might be ſupplied by the Aſſembly of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, and Courts of Juſtice, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58785:42"/>
by a Convocation of the Gentry, and of the Commonalty of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to be done in preſſing neceſſities.</p>
            <p>It was then reſolved, that they ſhould have recourſe to this Remedy, and whilſt the King ſhould be buſie in diſpatches with the Queeen, they ſhould arreſt thoſe whom they ſhould think fit, and all the Aſſembly ſhould preſently go to render an Accompt of it to the King, and to conjure him to approve of the thing, as done for the Service of his Majeſty, and the Good of his Realm.</p>
            <p>This Project was communicated to the Duke <hi>de Cadaval,</hi> to the Marqueſs of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea,</hi> to <hi>Don Antony de Meneſes,</hi> Marqueſs <hi>de Marialva,</hi> to <hi>Don Franciſco ſoto Mayor,</hi> Biſhop <hi>de Targa,</hi> to the Count of St. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> to the Count of <hi>Soure, Don Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue de Meneſes, George de Mello,</hi> Doctor <hi>Nioholas Monteiro,</hi> to the Secretary <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro Vieira de Sylva,</hi> to Father <hi>Antony Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eira,</hi> the Jeſuit, and to many other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antony de Conti</hi> was altogether Maſter of the Kings Mind, and in ſuch ſort, that he meddled with the greateſt Affairs. <hi>Gaſpar de Faria,</hi> private Secretary, by order of the King, put into his hands of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58785:42"/>
papers of: greateſt Concerns; and they attributed to his direction the Preparatives, that were made for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> which <hi>Edward Montague,</hi> Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador for his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and Admiral of the Fleet which was to convey the Queen, ſeeing, he made no difficulty to communicate to him Affairs of the greateſt Importance, as to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State, and to treat him magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently aboard his Veſſel.</p>
            <p>But whether that <hi>Conti</hi> had received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advice of what they were contriving againſt him, or that he miſtruſted it, he began never to leave the Palace, unleſs it were with the King, or with thoſe of whom he was very well aſſured. This way he ſometime averted the deſign they had upon his perſon: For to arreſt him in the City, they could not find the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, neither was that very eaſie; and to arreſt him in the Palace, there it was yet much more difficult, for beſides that good manners would not permit it, they knew it would too much provoke the King. Nevertheleſs they paſſed over all theſe ſcruples, and it was reſolved, that he ſhould be arreſted in the Palace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:58785:43"/>
To facilitate the Execution of this Enterpriſe, the Queen kept the King with her in the Chamber of Diſpatches, one <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> Morning, being the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1662. and whilſt they were there toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Duke <hi>de Cadaval, Lewis de Mello,</hi> Captain of the Port, and his Son <hi>Emanuel de Mello,</hi> followed by <hi>Edward Vas de Orta Oſorio,</hi> one of the Grand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts of the Court, came into the lower Apartment of the King.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Duke ſtayed there to put Guards at the Door, and gave Orders that none might go either in or out, <hi>Lewis de Mello,</hi> and his Son went up ſtairs. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as they were come to the Door, by which they entered into the two Anti-Chambers of the King, they perceived <hi>Conti</hi> in that next to them. But <hi>Lewis de Mello</hi> ſeeing the Duke <hi>de Cadaval</hi> was not with thoſe that followed him, he asked aloud where he was. <hi>Conti</hi> having by this, diſcovered what he before had ſuſpected, flung himſelf into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Anti-Chamber, where he ſhut himſelf in. At the ſame inſtant the Duke arrived, and would have opened the Door with his ſeoret key, but he could not do it; for <hi>Conti</hi> had on his ſide put his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58785:43"/>
into the key-hole: So that the Duke and <hi>Lewis de Mello</hi> having puſh'd ſoftly, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him to open the Door, but he would not anſwer.</p>
            <p>As they were afraid leſt <hi>Conti</hi> ſhould gain the Queens Appartment, by the Door which gave Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Apartments, <hi>Emanuel de Mello</hi> ran with all ſpeed and poſſeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of that. In the mean time the Duke was got into the <hi>Tarraſs,</hi> which overlookt the Chamber of the <hi>Indies,</hi> for fear <hi>Conti</hi> ſhould ſave himſelf that way, where finding him putting forth his head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Bars of the Window, he ſeiz'd him by the Hair. <hi>Conti</hi> ſeeing himſelf laid hold on, asked, Wherefore they did that violence to him? The Duke anſwered him, That the <hi>King</hi> had given him order to Arreſt him, and that he would do well to open the Door. <hi>Conti</hi> demanded, if he would kill him? To which the Duke replied, No. Whereupon <hi>Conti</hi> pray'd him to let him go, and he would open the Door; to which the Duke yielded.</p>
            <p>But ſo ſoon as he ſaw himſelf at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, he changed his mind: The Duke and <hi>Lewis de Mello,</hi> knowing the leaſt Retardment was capable of ruining their,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58785:44"/>
Project, they ordered <hi>Andrea de Leiria,</hi> the keeper of the Kings Tapeſtry, to fetch an Ax.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Count <hi>de Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melhor</hi> having had an inkling of it, either out of deſign to acquire the Friendſhip of <hi>Conti,</hi> or to flatter the King, he would have entered into the Chamber of Diſpatches to have given him notice of what had paſſed.</p>
            <p>But that Door according to cuſtome being faſt, he went by the Clock-Houſe, which was upon the <hi>Tarraſs;</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found the Duke, he highly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Enterpriſe, telling him he had loſt all reſpect to the King, whoſe Palace ought to be a ſacred and inviolable Sanctuary; and went ſo far, as to give the Duke very outragious words. But ſeeing they had ſeized on both Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, he returned the ſame way he came, and went to try if he could get in through the Queens Apartment, but he found that alſo faſt; ſo that with all the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he had, it was impoſſible for him to ſpeak with the King.</p>
            <p>An Ax being brought, the Duke told <hi>Conti,</hi> that if they were compelled to break open the Kings Doors, there was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58785:44"/>
no hopes of Life for him; but if he would open them, they would do him no hurt; at this Threat he rendred himſelf, and as he came out of the Chamber, with a grave Countenance, the Grand Provoſt arreſted him, who alſo preſently after took <hi>Baltaſar Rodrigue de Matos,</hi> Groom of the Wardrobe, who exerciſed the Charge of Lievtenant of the Guard, for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law, <hi>Diego Botelho de Sande,</hi> and led them both through the <hi>Taraſs,</hi> to the place where they build Ships, and there they made them enter a Shallop, to be carried aboard a Ship, that was ready to ſet ſail for <hi>Braſil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John de Matos,</hi> and <hi>Franciſco Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Taveira,</hi> were alſo arreſted; the firſt had been a Groom in the Kings Stable, the ſecond a Clerk to the Covent of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> both of them having gotten into the favour of the King, the one as a brave and skilful Runner at the Bulls, the other for ſerving him in his ſecret pleaſures. <hi>John de Conti</hi> was alſo arreſted. Of theſe five Priſoners, who, according to the order they had given, ſhould have been carried to <hi>Brazile,</hi> only <hi>Antony de Conti, John de Conti,</hi> and <hi>John de Mattos</hi> went; for <hi>Baltaſar Rodrigue de</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:58785:45"/>
               <hi>Matos,</hi> was brought again to Shore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they found he was not ſo guilty; and as for <hi>Franciſco Bernardo Taviera,</hi> he flung himſelf from his Priſon upon the Rocks, where he was taken up ſo very much bruiſed, that it was impoſſible to Embarque him.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who waited with great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience the news of this Execution, which ſhe had no ſooner heard, but ſent word to the Councellors of State, to the Tribunals, to the Councel of the City, and the Chamber of the Four and Twenty, to the Grandees and Gentry, who were before Aſſembled, that they ſhould come into the Chamber where the King and ſhe were, to underſtand what follows; which Speech was made to them by the Secretary of State.</p>
            <q>The Obedience, the Queen our Princeſs owed to the Orders of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed <note place="margin">This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was addreſt to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> King, the kindneſs ſhe had for the King her Son, and the deſire ſhe had to be a Comfort to her Subjects, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging thoſe great Services which ſhe had received from them, were the Motives that obliged her, maugre the great need ſhe had of Repoſe, to take upon her the Government. If ſhe hath
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58785:45"/>
not acquitted her ſelf to the content of all, it is not that ſhe hath ſpar'd her ſelf, nor that ſhe has ſhun'd any Cares, or Troubles.</q>
            <q>This Princeſs extremely touch'd with the Diſorders which trouble this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and with the Complaints of the People, did believe it was moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to call together to this Place, in this abſence of the States General, all thoſe Tribunals which repreſent them, to the end ſhe might declare to the King in their preſence, the Remedy which ſhe hath endeavoured to bring to them, and to receive from them what Counſel ſhe ſhall need therein; if what ſhe hath done for the good of the State be not ſufficient, aſſuring them that ſhe has no other intention then to follow their Counſels.</q>
            <q>All the People complain that Juſtice, which is a thing that Kings ought to love more than their Eyes, is not Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred: As the Queen does not alone Adminiſter it, but there are Judges who take Cogniſance of Affairs, Civil and Criminal; ſhe hath reſolved to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all the Tribunals, to the end if any one among them, hath given

Cauſe of Complaint to the People, they might receive the Chaſtiſement their Fault merits, and the People the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they ought to have.</q>
            <q>It is a very great Regret to the Queen our Soveraign, that there is heard mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring among the People, who complain that the King our Lord, although he be of Age to take into his own Hand the Government of the State, of which the Queen ſo vehemently deſires to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her ſelf, doth not apply himſelf however to any Affairs neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but on the contrary, lets himſelf be carried away by his Courage, in which Exerciſes of Violence, he hath Expoſed his Life ſo many times to evident Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, hazarding to leave the Kingdom without a Succeſſor; inſtead of giving himſelf wholly to other Exerciſes, which ſhould draw upon him the Bleſſings of Heaven, the Love of his Subjects, and the Eſteem of Strangers.</q>
            <q>And ſince we are all here preſent, the Queen would have us, that we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the King to think of himſelf, and of us; which is the true way to render a King as commendable by his Merits, as he was before by his Birth: He owes

this Conſolation to his Subjects, who are aſſuredly the beſt Subjects that ever King had, ſince without thinking of the loſs of their Children, which are for the moſt part Dead in the War; nor of their Goods, which are almoſt all conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they yet expoſe continually all that remains with their Lives, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name of Faithful Subjects to his Majeſty.</q>

this falſe Zeal, they abuſe this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, trouble the Order of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of Juſtice, and committing Night and Day thoſe Crimes, which no Body is ignorant of; they cauſe ſo much Scandal, that if our Lord the King ſhould have a true knowledg thereof, he would without doubt Chaſtiſe them moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly; for without any reſpect for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they are ſo Audacious, to make Attempts and Quarrels, even in Sacred Places, and to maintain thereupon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes ſo Inſolent, that one cannot think on them without Horror.</q>

            <p>When this Diſcourſe was finiſhed, all thoſe who were preſent according to the Cuſtome of the Country, kiſs'd the Hand of the King and Queen, and then went forth of the Chamber; but before their Majeſties were withdrawn, <hi>Lewis de Mello,</hi> having acquainted the Secretary it was convenient to hinder the Count of <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melhor,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi> from encountring, becauſe of the words they had had between them; he advertiſed the Queen, who reconciled them. It being the Counts Week, he continued in the Palace, and came in the inſtant that the Grand <hi>Venere</hi> had opened the Door to the King, of whom he demanded as if he had underſtood nothing of all which had been ſaid, if that Concourſe of the People
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58785:49"/>
was an Aſſembly of the States? The Grand <hi>Veneur</hi> anſwered him, that ſo ſoon as his Majeſty was alone, he would inform him of all things, and being entred his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he told him,</p>
            <p>
               <q>For to ſatisfy the Complaints, that all the People had made againſt <hi>Antony de Conti,</hi> and all thoſe who had diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Authority in expoſing every day his Life; the Queen had ordered they ſhould ſeiſe on their Perſons, and ſhould be carried away far from his Majeſty, which thing had been executed by the Councel of his moſt zealous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and that ſhe had rendred him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it by that Writing, which he had heard read in the preſence of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King had no ſooner comprehended the ſenſe of this Diſcourſe, but he aroſe from his Seat, wholly tranſported with Choler, and went to ſearch for <hi>Conti</hi> in the withdrawing Chamber, and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him there, ſwore he would find him, in what place ſoever he were: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Grand <hi>Veneur</hi> told him, <hi>That his Majeſty ought not to be angry for what was</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:58785:49"/>
               <hi>done, and ſo far from thinking ill of the Queen, and his Miniſters, that he ought them thanks, ſince with ſo commendable a zeal, they had taken from about his perſon thoſe men, who were not tyed to him, but for their own Intereſt, and that their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would make him loſe the Love of all his other Subjects; that if he would be beloved, and rever'd as Father of his Children, there was an indiſpenſable Neceſſity, this Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be made; it was for that end they had embarqued</hi> Conti <hi>in a Veſſel, that had ſet Sail for</hi> Brazil.</p>
            <p>Upon this the King, ſtopping for ſome time as if he had been forbid, ſent to find out <hi>Emanuel Autunes,</hi> an intimate Friend, and Confident of <hi>Conti</hi>'s: At the ſame time he entred the Kings Chamber at the back-door, the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at the other, as if it had been by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and not by Chance. Aſſoon as the Grand <hi>Veneur</hi> ſaw them with the King, he withdrew, after which they had a grand Conference, which laſted till Dinner. And though he diſſembled his Diſcontent, as much as he could, all the while he was at the Table, yet they could not but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in his Countenance, which was more clowdy than uſual, nevertheleſs at
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58785:50"/>
night he failed not to go into the Garden, to ride his Horſes.</p>
            <p>After this Conference, he had another the ſame day with a Lady about the Queen, in which they condemned, as they had done in the former, that which the Queen had acted, and counſelled the King to be revenged for that affront, whatever came of it. The next day he appeared more calm, ſo that it was believed he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got all that had paſſed. Almoſt every one praiſed what the Queen had done, and even ſome of <hi>Conti</hi>'s Partiſans alſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodating themſelves to the Time, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to approve it, and there one was heard to ſay, <hi>That he ſhould have been of the ſame mind with others, if they had asked his Advice, but ſince they had no Confidence in him, he ſhould not approve of this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This day, being the laſt of Count <hi>Caſtelmelhors</hi> waiting Week, the King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to wait another. On <hi>Monday</hi> the King went (as he was wont) to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantara,</hi> but with more Pomp, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants than ordinary, being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the <hi>Infante,</hi> and the greateſt part of the nobility; this day every one ſtood upon his Guard at the Palace, for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58785:50"/>
they ſaw the Count to wait two Weeks one after another, and becauſe he Wrote to the Secretary of State in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious terms, the King would know if they had given order that <hi>Conti</hi> ſhould be put to Death aſſoon as he was out of the Haven, or that <hi>Emanuel Autunes</hi> ſhould be Impriſoned. The King was no ſooner returned, but he went to ſee the Queen, without ſhewing any diſcontent either in word or actions. <hi>Tueſday</hi> paſſed without any extraordinary thing happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> about Noon, the King in his Litter with the Count <hi>de Caſtlemel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor,</hi> went together ſecretly to <hi>Alcantara,</hi> without letting any Body know of it but <hi>Don Hieronimo de Ataide,</hi> Count <hi>de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouguia,</hi> whom they found there; from whence all three ſent to find out <hi>Sebaſtine Ceſar de Meneſes,</hi> Councellor of State, not long ſince releaſed out of Priſon, where he had been put by King <hi>John,</hi> and to fetch the Guard of Archers. The King Wrote at the ſame time to thoſe Perſons in whom he had the moſt Confidence, to call together the Nobility, and to give Advice to the Governours of Places and Provinces, that he had taken the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Government of the State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:58785:51"/>
The Queen being advertiſed of what had paſſed, called her Miniſters of State for their Counſel, where it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſhe ſhould write to the King to pray him to return to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to the end ſhe might put the Government into his Hands, and the Biſhop of <hi>Targu</hi> ſhould carry this Letter; but before it was ſent, it was Ordered for ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reaſons, that <hi>Emanuel Pacheco de Mello,</hi> Lieutenant to the Camp-Maſter General, ſhould go and Poſt himſelf near to <hi>La Croix,</hi> by which place they muſt paſs, who would go to the King at <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara,</hi> to tell them from the Queen, that for the good of the State, they ſhould come firſt to receive her Orders. All they who were advertiſed of it exactly obeyed her, except <hi>Alvaro Pires de Caſtro,,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Caſcaes,</hi> and <hi>Antony de Sonſa de Macedo.</hi> The firſt ſaid he would go thither to give the Queen an account of all things that paſſed there, which he did; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the ſtay'd with the King, in recompence of which, he held him in the Quality of Miniſter.</p>
            <p>When Night approached, and the King ſaw he was leſs Accompanied than his Favourites thought, having no other
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58785:51"/>
Militia but the Guard of Archers, ſome of them were of opinion the King ſhould retire to the Fortreſs of St. <hi>Julian,</hi> Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate at the Mouth of the <hi>Tagus,</hi> where he might be in Security; but this Counſel was not followed, becauſe there came a great many Gentlemen to waite on the King, beſides thoſe who attended him, which reaſſured the Favourites.</p>
            <p>The Queen judging, if ſhe ſhould go in this condition ſhe was in without Troops to the King, ſhe ſhould expoſe her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and if ſhe ſhould carry them with her, they would accuſe her that ſhe had a mind to Retain the Government. She conſidered of it, and Wrote to the King this Letter, which was carried by the Biſhop of <hi>Targu.</hi>

Do it for a Mothers ſake, who hath brought you up with much Affection; and who deſires nothing ſo much as to ſee you Govern the State happily, which I hope to ſee by the Mercy of God: And to the end that God may aſſiſt your Majeſty, you ought to be perſwaded, that what I have ſaid in my other Letter, and what I ſay in this, is that which is moſt convenient for you. Moſt High and moſt Puiſſant Prince,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The King returned no Anſwer to this Letter, but ſent to the Secretary of State to come to him the next Day; of which he advertiſed the Queen, believing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58785:54"/>
it was his duty not to obey the King in this occaſion, without adviſing with her; ſhe approved of his going to preſent himſelf to the King, to receive his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> went alſo the ſame Day to ſee the Queen, who thought it fit he ſhould go to the King, although he had not ſent him Permiſſion, to Intreat him that he would ſubmit to her will. But although the King was very Civil to him, and they Dined together, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Councel; his Prayers were of no effect. The Secretary was no ſooner preſented to the King, but he told him he had created ſix Councellors of State, and ordered him preſently to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite all Proviſions thereunto, for he would have their Advice in Councel that Day: Upon which the Secretary beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he would ſurceaſe that Creation of Councellors of State, becauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the Gentlemen he had Choſen were worthy of that Employment, the time was not proper for it; beſides, the number would make them be the leſs eſteemed. That whereas his Father, the late King, had employed ſix years in chooſing one Councellor of State, his Majeſty had
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58785:55"/>
Created ſix in one Night; the thing being done with precipitation, without his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's conferring with the Queen, in whoſe Hands the Government yet was, and by conſequence the Nomination of theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, they would ſay, it was but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Choice. It was to be feared, the Honour that his Majeſty would do thoſe Gentlemen, would draw upon them De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, by a Circumſtance which would render the thing Ridiculous, which was Reaſonable of it ſelf: That it would then pleaſe his Majeſty to return to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who would Remit into his Hands with the ordinary Ceremonies, that which he went about to obtain, by unjuſt and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means. It was not Congruous or fit for his Majeſty to take that as it were by Force, which was his own by Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Succeſſion. This manner of Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would make People ſee, that this Precipitation was by the Council given him, and cauſe a Suſpition, as if the Queen through Ambition, had no mind to part with the Government, although ſhe deſired nothing more, of which his Majeſty ought to be aſſured, ſince ſhe had Wrote ſo to him. For as the Word of a Soveraign is ſacred, ſhe could no ways
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58785:55"/>
fail in that, without doing wrong to her ſelf.</p>
            <p>The King was as little touched with this Remonſtrance, as if he had never heard it. One of the new Counſellors of State ſeeing he anſwered nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſpeak for him, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to anſwer all which the Secretary had touched upon, and as the King had more truſt in that Councellor, than in the Secretary, he followed his Opinion, ordering the Secretary to make all things ready thereto, according to his place. He had hardly taken the Pen into his hand, when there entred into the Kings Chamber another Miniſter of State, who asked the Secretary, <hi>What he thought of that Affair?</hi> Who anſwered him, <hi>He thought very ill of it,</hi> to which he replied, <hi>He was of the ſame opinion. But what Remedy can you give for it?</hi> ſaid the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State: Upon which the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary gave him a Recital, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Government ought to be remittted to the King, adding, <hi>He would maintain it true in full Councel, if called thereunto, That what the King was about to do, was contrary to the Cuſtom, always obſerved in</hi> Portugal. Upon this, the ancient and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58785:56"/>
new Councellors of State being met, this Miniſter told the King, <hi>His Majeſty ſhould hearken to the advice of the Secretary of State, before others delivered theirs, becauſe after he had inſtructed them in the ordinary Uſage, they would be able to ſpeak with more Solidity.</hi> He followed the Councel of this Miniſter, and the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſaid,</p>
            <q>However Kings claim their Realms by Right of Succeſſion, they do not take upon themſelves the Government, but according to the ancient Laws and Ceremonies of each Nation, by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Act: For the Power is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Succeſſor, until that Act be performed, which gives equally a Title, both in regard of the Preſent, and of Poſterity. That by Virtue of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of the King, the States had given the Government to the Queen, and had put into her hands the Seals, to which is tyed the Royal Power, which if his Majeſty ſhould exerciſe without them, he would do Violence to the Laws, and Juſtice. That thoſe who ſhould yield him Obedience, would do it rather for fear, than by reaſon, becauſe although
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58785:56"/>
the Crown did belong unto his Majeſty, the Queen his Mother, nevertheleſs, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, had the Royal Power in her hands, ſo that if they owe an equal reſpect to both their Majeſty's, they owed only their Obedience to the Queen. That he would not chang a Cuſtom, which had been always inviolably obſerved. It was not reaſonable his Majeſty ſhould take the Government by force, ſince the Queen deſired with ſo much paſſion to ſurrender it to him; that beſides the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, ſo contrary to the good hopes they had conceived of his Reign, it would leſſen his Reputation; not only in his own Kingdom, but with Strangers. If his Majeſty doubted of the Sincerity of the Queen, he ſhould ſend one of his Gentlemen, to look in the Cabinet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Secretary, where he might ſee all the Orders, neceſſary for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of that Ceremony. And ſince theſe Orders did manifeſtly make known the Queeens Intention, his Majeſty ought to follow his Councel, and to return to the Palace, where the Buſineſs ſhould be done, not only with all neceſſary Congruity, but alſo with an univerſal Applauſe. That that manner of acting
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58785:57"/>
will be beneficial to all the people, and eſpecially to thoſe who are neareſt to his Majeſties Royal Perſon, who were obliged above all the reſt to give good Councel to his Majeſty, which he hoped from all thoſe who were preſent.</q>
            <p>The Miniſters of State, touched with the force of theſe Reaſons, all of them became of the Secretaries Opinion, and omitting what they had before ſaid to the contrary, thought of another thing, <hi>That the King ſhould ſend to demand the Seals by the Secretary himſelf, and having them once in his hands, he might continue his Government, and no body be able to ſay any thing againſt it.</hi> Upon this the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary replied,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he had not Authority enough to demand them, and the Queen ought not to render them, unleſs it ſhould be to the King himſelf, without the interpoſition of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miniſter. That his Majeſty ought not to undertake any thing againſt Juſtice, and good Order, he ſhould not (at leaſt) do it, if he would follow his Councel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it was not the King, who did decide theſe things, he would not determine for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58785:57"/>
either ſide, but told the Secretary, he ſhould attend, and within a while he ſhould receive an Anſwer, upon which the Councel broke up. But after that, the King asked the Secretary in private, <hi>If he would aſſure him, that the Queen would in good earneſt reſign up the Government?</hi> To which the Secretary anſwered, <hi>That indeed it was impoſſible for him to make ſuch a Promiſe, ſince he was not able to anſwer, but for his own proper Actions, however he was perſwaded, the Queen would execute what ſhe had promiſed, provided his Majeſty would return to the Palace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Favourites did not hold themſelves ſatisfied with what the Secretary had ſaid. The King once again ſent for him back, and ordered him, he ſhould go to the Palace, and aſſoon as he ſhould come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſhould write a Letter, ſigned by the Queen, which ſhould in expreſs terms ſignify, <hi>That ſhe would, the firſt day he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, remit to him the Government,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, ſo ſoon as he had received that Letter, he would return to the Palace, as the Queen did deſire.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as the Aſſembly was finiſhed, the <hi>Infante</hi> took leave of the King, and went to the Queen, to whom he rendred
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58785:58"/>
an Accompt of that which paſſed in his preſence. The Secretary alſo having told her the order he had received from the King, ſhe was reſolved to execute it: After which he retired home, to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſome Affairs, and did not return to his Office till night, to write that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which was demanded; He had hardly begun to write, when the Count <hi>de Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beiro</hi> arrived from <hi>Alcantara,</hi> with order to know the Queens mind from her own mouth: Being entred into the Secretaries Room, he told him, <hi>That the King and Councel doubted the ſucceſs of that Affair, becauſe of the delay of the Letter, which he had made them hope for, and which they had waited for with much impatience, that all that which he had ſaid was but an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to engage the King, by his return to the Palace, to perpetuate the Regency of the Queen: That it was abſolutely neceſſary, ſpeedily to carry a Remedy to that Suſpition, to put ſome ſtop to the Violence of the King, which was almoſt upon breaking forth.</hi> But the Secretary having told him the Reaſons, which cauſed the delay of the Letter, which he complained of, he made an end of writing it, which being ſigned by the Queen, he put it into the hands of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58785:58"/>
the Count, who carried it to <hi>Alcantara,</hi> where being opened, they found theſe Words.</p>

            <p>So ſoon as this Letter was ſent, the Queen gave order for all Preparatives neceſſary, and ſent to advertiſe all thoſe who ought to aſſiſt at this Ceremony, to the end ſhe might do it with all the Authority, and Demonſtration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that ſo conſiderable an Action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. The Reading of that Letter calmed the Spirits a little at <hi>Alcantara,</hi> and it was reſolved by the King, that he would be with the Queen at the time appointed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1662. the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within a Month of Nineteen Years
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58785:59"/>
of Age, came from <hi>Alcantara</hi> to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> accompanied with all the Nobles, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a great Concourſe of People. The <hi>Infante</hi> was yet in his Palace, for he had not got ready his Coach ſoon enough, which obliged him to ſend to tell the King as he paſſed by, that his People were he cauſe he could not come ſooner to him; which he pray'd him to excuſe, and not ſtay, for he would follow him. The King having conſulted thereupon thoſe who were about him, ordered that they ſhould paſs before the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Palace; which he ſeeing from the Window, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went down to the King, and going into his Coach, they went ſtrait to the Palace by the New-Street, that they might make their entry by the great Place; where being arrived, they went up into the Chamber where the Queen was, and and then being placed, the King at her right, and the <hi>Infante</hi> at her left Hand; all the Tribunals aſſembled, with the <note place="margin">Theſe were the Lords of the Realm.</note> Miniſters of State, the Titulares, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, Governors of Caſtles, the Lords of the Realm, Gentlemen, the Eccleſiaſticks, and the chief of the Orders; which being done, the Grand Maſter of the Wardrobe placed before the King, a little Table of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58785:59"/>
Crimſon Velvet with a Cuſhion of the ſame; and the Secretary of State put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cuſhion a Purſe, in which were the Seals; ſome time after, having taken them up, he put them into the Queens Hands, and ſhe into the Kings, ſaying to him theſe Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>See here the Seals with which I have been Charged by the States of the Realm, by virtue of the Teſtament of the King my Lord, who is now with God; I remit them into the Hands of your Majeſty, and at the ſame time the Government, which I have received with them of the ſame States. God grant that all things may be Proſperous under the Government, as I deſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King taking them, put them at the ſame time into the hands of the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; after which, all the People came to kiſs the Hands of theſe three Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſo the Aſſembly broke up.</p>
            <p>The Queen ſeeing her ſelf Diſcharged of the Burthen of the Monarchy, had now no other thought, but to execute the Reſolution ſhe had taken to Retire, and her ſelf to found a Religious Covent, of the Order of St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Being willing to begin to Build, ſhe ordered Doctor <hi>Belchoir de Andrade,</hi> in the time he was
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58785:60"/>
her Secretary, to viſit divers Places, but they raiſed a thouſand difficulties to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her, ſo that ſhe found no fit Place: Whereupon her Enemies publiſhed, ſhe had hidden Deſigns, and feigning to ſeek for a place to Build a Covent, ſhe had no mind the leave the Palace. She had no ſooner begun to make a paſſage of Communication from the <hi>Quinte</hi> to the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Houſes of Pleaſure are called</hi> Quintes <hi>in</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</note> Covent of <hi>Religious,</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Dominic,</hi> being ſituated near it; but they ſaid, the Queen had choſen this Houſe, that ſhe might flie away when ſhe pleaſed. Theſe malicious Reports, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Queen to execute her Enterpriſe. Having remembred her ſelf one day, that the Marqueſs of <hi>Sandy</hi> had offered her a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Queen had rendred the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the King, the Courtiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to change their Diſcourſe, and many of them, who before were ſtill ſpeaking o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtancy, they proteſted the King was become another Man, and ſpake of his Change as of a Miracle; but this added nothing of belief in the Caſe, for his Reaſon being hurt by his Maladies, it rendred him incapable to conceive either that which they made him ſay, or that which they ſaid to him. When he was to ſay ſomething in Publick, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him before hand as well as they were able, what he ſhould ſay; but as they could not inſtruct him to anſwer to things that would be ſpoke on the ſudden, he was then mute, or elſe anſwered far from the purpoſe; and if on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions it happened that he ſpake ſomething of good ſenſe, theſe Flatterers would ſay more by half than the King had ſaid. But in his good Intervals, if he had made ſome liberal Diſcourſe, his Favourites <note place="margin">Becauſe of the Palſie that had enfeebled one ſide.</note> would be ſure to Preach on it; but this did but ſerve to render him Ridiculous, for they would render thoſe things which came from him by chance to appear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and that his ordinary Diſcourſe was not the ſame.</p>
            <p>Before the King had taken Poſſeſſion of the Government, the Earls of <hi>Atouguia,</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:58785:61"/>
and <hi>Caſtlemelhor,</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtian Ceſar de Meneſſes,</hi> had taken poſſeſſion of him. As in policy theſe three Favourites did praiſe one another before the King, he was perſwaded they were filled with rare Qualities, ſo that he Repoſed on them all the Affairs of State. But at the firſt, they judged it beſt for the King, to aſſiſt in all Publick Affairs; and though there was nothing more contrary to his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, yet they ſo brought it about, that he gave Audience, went to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, diſpatched Buſineſſes, but this Application laſted not long; whether it were that the King was weary of it, or ſome of them had perſwaded him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the Counſel of thoſe who Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him. But it is thus, that Favourites inſpiring Idleneſs into Princes, invade their Authority under the pretext of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging them of the Care of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>There is yet another ordinary Artifice of ſuch Favourites to maintain their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and to hinder any from doing any thing againſt them, to Baniſh from Court all thoſe who were not tied to their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, and to introduce in their places, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Creatures or their Friends.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58785:61"/>
The Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor,</hi> and his two favoured Companions very admirably practiſed this Maxim, as we ſhall ſee in a little time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry Auriquez de Miranda</hi> began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time to put himſelf near the King, by the Services which he had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him in his Pleaſures, and within a while entred into ſo much Truſt, and had ſo great a ſhare in his moſt ſecret Thoughts, that if the Count <hi>de Caſtlemel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi> had more of Authority about the King than <hi>Don Henry Auriquez,</hi> yet it might be ſaid, that <hi>Don Henry Auriquez de Miranda</hi> had more of his Heart, than the Count <hi>Caſtlemelhor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This new Favourite according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, ought to have given ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the favour of the Count, however it happened quite contrary, and he ſo well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anaged the Spirit of that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and of the Kings, that he made that a ſupport to his Fortune, which it was thought might have ruin'd him. And indeed, after this he became the moſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant of the three Favourites, by the conſent of his Competitors, having more Facility than the Count <hi>de Atouguia,</hi> who did not profit by the occaſion which was
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58785:62"/>
preſented him either by Moderation, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor</hi> being in <hi>Italy,</hi> whither he had withdrawn himſelf becauſe of the death of <hi>Don Lewis</hi> of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> Count <hi>de Vimioſo,</hi> who was there; vaunted, that one Day he would return into that Realm, as its Governour. From theſe happy beginnings he conceived ſo much hope, that his Propheſie ſhould not be in vain, he was therefore reſolved to puſh on his Fortune as far as he was able.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as he had found he was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Kings Affections, he took the liberty to Lodg in the Apartment of the late Prince <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> as he enterpriſed to have himſelf the whole Favour, this was not ill aimed at, to find a means to render himſelf inſeparable to the Perſon of the King; But it was not enough to eſtabliſh himſelf near the King, he muſt have ſome Charge which might ſerve to make his Credit ſeen and valued. There was then nothing at Court with which he could Accomodate himſelf, but that of <hi>Eſcrivaon de Puridade,</hi> which had not been exerciſed by any Perſons of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſince <hi>Pedro de Alcacova Carneiro,</hi> Count
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58785:62"/>
               <hi>de Idayna.</hi> He then would have this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and having gotten a grant of it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the King it was neceſſary for his Eaſe, and to maintain his Authority, and all things ready to the ſealing of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the King ordered the Secretary to Expedite thoſe Letters for that Charge to the Count; but the Secretary ſeeing the thing regarded the Publick Intereſt more than his own particular, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the King his Father had united that Charge to that of the Secretary of State, and that he had the Letters Patents for it. That his Majeſty ought not at the entrance into his Government, deſtroy that which the late King his Father had done, a moſt Wiſe and moſt Experienced Prince, but rather ſhould follow his Examples and Ways, that he might not fall into thoſe Wandrings and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties which ordinarily fling down young Princes, and particularly ſuch who deceive through their fair appearances; and that his Majeſty ought not with Juſtice to augment the Fortune of one particular Man to the prejudice of another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King having none of his Council about him, anſwered nothing to the Secretary. On the Morrow, he ordered
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58785:63"/>
him again to haſten the Counts Patent, which was made ready according to his Command, and therein all thoſe Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Prerogatives he would have. Some time after, they publickly diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on this Charge, and would have it thought, that in this was compriſed all others, and it was ever poſſeſſed by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites.</p>
            <p>There yet was wanting to the Count, the Title of Councellor of State, but ſo ſoon as they had told the King it was Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to his new Employment, he gave it him. Almoſt at the ſame time, the King gave to <hi>Henry Auriquez de Miranda,</hi> the Charge of Lieutenant General of the Artillery, vacant by the Death of <hi>Ruy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">This Charge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to that of Maſter of the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note>

            <p>The King granted, beſides many other <note place="margin">This Charge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to that of Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of the Sea Affairs.</note> Graces, to the Friends of theſe three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites; to <hi>Chriſtopher de Mello,</hi> who was Governour and Captain General of the Magazine in <hi>Africa,</hi> the Reverſion of Captain of the <hi>Port,</hi> and to <hi>Emanuel de Mello,</hi> his Brother, the Reverſion of Captain of the Guards, which was
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58785:63"/>
then poſſeſſed by <hi>Lewis de Mello</hi> their Father.</p>
            <p>As it was for their Intereſt, that none but their Creatures ſhould come near the King, they caſt out, and baniſhed from his Perſon, the Gentlemen of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: They were diſpenced with at firſt from the Service of their Charge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being hindred the entrance into the Palace, which they did the better to hide their Deſign, which they inſenſibly brought about. They ordered it in ſuch a manner, that they could not entertain the King, nor give him any Advice. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by little and little, they took away the Communication which the King had with the Officers of his Houſe, bringing him to Eat in his Chamber; he was ſerved by thoſe whom they met with by chance, wholly Abrogating thoſe Ancient Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies with which the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> uſed to be ſerved, and confounded the Order they uſed to keep in all things; for no Body exerciſed his Charge, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body exerciſed all Charges.</p>
            <p>The Favourites perſwaded themſelves, it was for their Intereſt, that thoſe who were not their Friends ſhould be Baniſhed the Court; ſo when they wanted a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58785:64"/>
they made no ſcruple to awaken thoſe things which ſhould not have been ſpoken of; imputing Crimes to thoſe People on whom the <hi>King</hi> beſtowed any Favours; they accounting it nothing to have taken the Government from the Queen, if they did not give the <hi>King</hi> an Averſion to all thoſe who had been of her Party. For this end, they maintained that the Remonſtrance which they had made was Inſolent, and brought it under a ſentence of Condemnation; as if it had not been the Cuſtom of all Nations to make Remonſtrances to Kings, when they let themſelves be carried away with their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. As it was done to <hi>Don Alphonſo,</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> becauſe he loved Hunting with ſo great Ardor, that he quite neglected all Affairs of State: He at firſt grew into Choler, but being come to himſelf, afterwards praiſed that for Zeal, which he would have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as a Crime, and moderated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Paſſion that he had for the Chaſe.</p>
            <p>They began the Exilement with that of Father <hi>Antony Vicira,</hi> which was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that of the Secretary of State, the Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> the Grand <hi>Veneur,</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:58785:64"/>
               <hi>Emanuel de Mello,</hi> the Count <hi>de Soure,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Pomlerio;</hi> and they ſent word to the Captain of the <hi>Port,</hi> that he ſhould abſtain from coming to the Palace. See the Crimes they imputed to them, That Father <hi>Antony Vieria</hi> had wrote that Remonſtrance that had offended the King; that the Secretary had promoted it, and that the reſt had Dictated it and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. Theſe only were Baniſhed as Culpable, though there were many others beſides them. Some of them did avoid their Exilement, by Reconciling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Favourites; and none durſt ſpeak to another, becauſe they were afraid one of another.</p>
            <p>Somtime after, the Marqueſs <hi>de Gouvea,</hi> Grand Maſter of the Kings Houſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Leave to retire himſelf to <hi>Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea;</hi> the Reaſon was, becauſe they had made him loſe a great part of the Rights and Preheminences belonging to his Charge, as much by the Revocations they had made therein, as by the too great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theſe Favourites. But when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of all the Oppoſitions of the Court, he would Proſecute his deſign; they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to keep himſelf at <hi>Gouvea,</hi> with a Prohibition not to return to Court,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58785:65"/>
without an eſpecial Order from the King; ſo his Retreat which he would have made voluntary, became forc'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicholas Monteiro,</hi> Tutor to the King, retired himſelf alſo to his Priory of <hi>Cedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feila,</hi> under pretext of the Indiſpoſition of his great Age, but in truth, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not able to endure their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Acting at Court. A little after the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor,</hi> propoſed for Confeſſor to the King and the <hi>Infante, Don Pedro de Souſa,</hi> his Unkle by the Fathers ſide, a <hi>Religious</hi> of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> nominated Biſhop of <hi>Angra;</hi> which was agreed to.</p>
            <p>They named for Secretary of State in the place of <hi>Pedro Vieira de Silva,</hi> who was Baniſhed, <hi>Antony de Souſa de Macedo.</hi> So ſoon as the King had got the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his own Hands, he ſhewed to the Queen, an unequal and capricious Air in all his Actings. Every time he came from <hi>Alcantara,</hi> he went to render her a Viſit, and acquitted himſelf of all other Devoires which conſiſted in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; he did alſo the like to the Prince, but he Communicated no part of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs neither to the one, nor the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:58785:65"/>
Theſe Favourites having it in their Heads, to bring the Prince to the Palace, they alledged for Reaſons, that the King and the preſumptive Heir to the Crown, ſhould not live apart: That there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more proper to cauſe their Amity, a thing ſo neceſſary for the State, than the Union of their Perſons: That if he Lived in his Palace with little Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he would have much Content in the King. Beſides, That it was too great a Charge to the State, which wanted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to maintain the War.</p>
            <p>As this Motion was oppoſite to thoſe which they had made formerly to appear, it was not very difficult to penetrate into the thoughts of the Favourites, which was, that by this means they might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves Maſters of the mind of the <hi>Infante,</hi> as well as they had of the Kings; but the <hi>Infante,</hi> who diſcovered their Cunning, anſwered, <hi>That he was well enough in his Palace, as deſerted as it was.</hi> So that deſpairing to be able to make him change his Lodging, they treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prince ruggedly, and accuſed him, that he did not love the King as he ought. But that which troubled them moſt, was, That he would not be looſed from the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58785:66"/>
Queens Intereſts, who was every day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring her ſelf to retire, and that ſhe would prevent their Diſ-union, which theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites ſo paſſionately deſired.</p>
            <p>Although they had received ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes from the <hi>Infante,</hi> they did not leave to continue their endeavours to draw him to their Party, hoping they ſhould be able to do that by Importunity, which they could not do with their Reaſons. Whilſt they were at <hi>Alcantara,</hi> the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Country ſerved them to make ſome progreſs on his Spirit, chiefly by <hi>Henry Auriques.</hi> But as much as they gained the Favour of the <hi>Infante,</hi> they took away from the King the evil Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they had given him concerning him, in ſo much, that the King began to make him dine with him, and to take him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with him in his Coach, and to give him the divertiſement of Fiſhing in his Pleaſure-Boat, which they made by night with lighted Torches; they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to <hi>Alcantara,</hi> to ſee the Courſing of the Bulls, and the King obliged him to lye at his Country-Houſe, to ſee theſe Divertiſements. All theſe things gave birth to a Hope in the Breaſts of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites; that he ſhould not be able to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58785:66"/>
eſcape them any more for the time to come: They vaunting already, that they had made peace between the two Brothers, every one of them attributing to himſelf the Glory to have been the Mediator, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>Henry Anriques de Miranda,</hi> for which Conſideration, he pretended to have the greateſt part in his Favour, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the moſt zeal for his Service, above all others.</p>
            <p>At this Time, moſt of the Officers which the Queen had given him, had left him: The Count of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> had quitted him, to exerciſe his Charge of Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of the Finances; The Count <hi>de Soure</hi> was baniſhed to the <hi>Algarves; Ruy de Moura Telles</hi> had retired himſelf; <hi>John Nunes de Acuna</hi> was with the Army in the Province between <hi>Douro</hi> and <hi>Minho,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was ſent the handſomer to hide his Exilement. In the place of theſe Officers, they had put, <hi>Don Fernando de Meneſes,</hi> Count <hi>de Ericeira, Pedro Geſar de Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Ruy Fernando de Almada, Ruy de Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueredo D' Alarcaon, Antonio de Miranda Anriquez,</hi> and <hi>Don Diego de Meneſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As all theſe new Officers about the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> were of Kin to the three Favourites, this Change was a very grand help to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58785:67"/>
them; but this would not ſuffice, unleſs they could be able to break the Union, which was between the <hi>Infante</hi> and the Queen, which was very difficult for them to do. They were willing the Queen ſhould have retired of her ſelf, and after that manner the Separation ſhould have been, becauſe then none could have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it to them; but their impatience was too great to ſtay for that. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Artifices which they uſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance this Separation, there was one, which would ſcarce be credited, if the Writing had not been found in the hands of one of thoſe Miniſters at that time, of which this is a moſt faithful Copy. It ſhewed,</p>
            <q>That there were two ways to oblige the Queen to quit the Court.</q>
            <q>The Firſt is to cauſe her Diſpleaſure in all thoſe things, of which ſhe would be moſt ſenſible; As to order <hi>Donna I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabella de Caſtro,</hi> to go into her Covent <note place="margin">The Queen loved theſe two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and to cauſe <hi>Donna Maria Franciſca</hi> to go home to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs her Mother, and to prohibit all thoſe Officers of her Houſe, in whom ſhe had moſt Confidence, to enter the Palace.</q>
            <q>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:58785:67"/>
The Diſcontent ſhe will receive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, will oblige her to retire of her ſelf, or elſe cauſe her to make her Complaints to our Maſter with more heat; this will oblige him to declare to her, that a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Retreat will be moſt handſom for her, to the end ſhe might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to do it after another manner. This way hath more than one Step, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if ſhe ſhall ſhew her ſelf obſtinate, and ſhall not be willing to follow the Councel of the King, ſhe then will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her ſelf worthy of Chaſtiſement.</q>
            <q>The Second way is to have it told her, by her Confeſſor, or by ſome other Perſon of Authority, That it is neceſſary for her Glory, ſhe ſhould retire her ſelf to the Town of <hi>Allenquer,</hi> or into that of <hi>Cintra,</hi> becauſe of the Report ſhe had cauſed to be ſpread abroad of her Retiring, and for other Reaſons that may be made known to her, and they judged that our Maſter deſired the thing might be executed with all poſſible ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that other ways might be avoided, which might any ways give him a Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            <q>That if ſhe ſhould anſwer, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhe will, that ſhe had changed her
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58785:68"/>
Mind, and would know the Reaſons which had obliged the King to take that Reſolution; they ſhould in that caſe put preſently into her hands a Billet, which ſhould let her underſtand, that it was to revenge himſelf of that inſolent Remonſtrance, which ſhe had cauſed to be made to him, in which we may under a Colour bring ſome Reaſons, for our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Juſtification.</q>
            <p>Below this Memorial, there was the Billet for the Queen, wrote in the ſame hand, in which were theſe Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſhall ſay to the Queen my Mother,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">This is the manner of writing ſuch Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</note> 
               <hi>that having regard to the Intention, ſhe hath had of retiring into a Covent, and to the Reaſons ſhe hath given for it, I find my ſelf obliged to tell her, (maugre the ſatisfaction which I have to ſee you neer me in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace) that for the Intereſt of her Repoſe, and of her Piety, ſhe ought to execute that Deſign. If ſhe will then follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of many other Princeſſes, who have done the ſame thing, ſhe might chuſe what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſhe pleaſed out of the City, where ſhe may live only for her ſelf, and for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the late King, my Lord and Father,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:58785:68"/>
               <hi>who is with God. I do promiſe my ſelf from her great Wiſdom, that ſhe will take care that the World believe this Reſolution comes from herſelf, and not from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe filled with ſuch hard and inhumane Sentiments, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to thoſe which they always had of the Queen, even in preſence of the King; for he ſuffered them not only to attribute to Fortune all the good Succeſs, but they imputed to her, all the evils which had happened in her Government; and they took pleaſure to ſpeak of all her Actions before her, with little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>Theſe Indignities which they made the Queen to ſuffer, either by the Order of the King, or by his Conſent, went much farther. For ſome Perſons aſſembling themſelves in the Night below under her Windows, at what time they were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſhe uſed to go to her Prayers, broke her Windows, and ſaid ſo many bitter and injurious Speeches, that no Pen is able to Write them.</p>
            <p>To theſe Miſuſages which the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Night hid in ſome ſort, they added others more openly, and more ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58785:69"/>
The Day of the Conception of the Virgin, the King according to his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, being deſcended into the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Palace, where the Solemnity of the Feaſt had drawn all the Court, paſſed before the Queen who was in her Seat, without giving her the ordinary Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; this Action which ſurpriſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body, let them know very well how much the King was diſpleaſed with his Mother, ſince he failed of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect publickly, which he owed her; ſo that her Maternal Love made her reſolve, to take away the Occaſions that he might not commit the like Fault, not to return any more into that Seat, but to make uſe of another.</p>
            <p>Upon this, ſhe formed a Deſign to go and paſs away ſome Days in the Palace of <hi>Xabregas,</hi> and there to cauſe a Gallery to be made, to enter the Covent of the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> in the ſame place where formerly Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> had made one when ſhe ſtay'd there. To this end ſhe ſent her Secretary to tell the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor,</hi> that for very juſt Cauſes ſhe would no more aſſiſt at the Service in the Chappel of the Palace, and that ſhe had demanded of <hi>Donna Franciſca de Tavora,</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:58785:69"/>
Counteſs of <hi>Ungnaon,</hi> the Palace of <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bregas,</hi> where ſhe had reſolved to ſtay, until that which ſhe was Building ſhould be in a condition for her to Lodg in, and that he ſhould take care to let the King her Son, underſtand her Intentions. Two Days after, the Count <hi>de Antouguia,</hi> the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor, Sebaſtian Ceſar de Meneſes,</hi> came to the Secretary's Houſe, to whom they told for Anſwer, That the King thought it ſtrange, the Queen would leave his Houſe to go into that of anothers; and that ſhe ſhould be very welcome in the Palace, till that which ſhe was Building was finiſhed. It was not three Days ſince they had a mind to chaſe the Queen from the Palace, and now they ſeem as if they would not have her go forth, ſo that none could divine the Reaſon of this Inconſtancy.</p>
            <p>The Day which the King had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd every Year to go to <hi>Salvaterre,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, he carried thither the <hi>Infante</hi> with him. During that Journey, the Favourites took occaſion to tell him, that the Queen had a mind to make him King: He anſwered, <hi>That if ſhe had ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, he ſhould not conſent to it.</hi> The Favorites raviſhed to have ſome occaſion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58785:70"/>
to Calumniate the Queen, extoll'd the <hi>Infante</hi> for that anſwer.</p>
            <p>He was as yet at that time under the Tutelage of the Queen, <hi>Henry Auriquez de Miranda</hi> told him, That he was now of Age enough to Govern his own Houſe, and that he ſhould make <hi>Antony Cavide</hi> his Secretary, in the place of <hi>Antony de Souſa de Taveres;</hi> ſo that he came back Emancipated from <hi>Salvaterre.</hi> After this, they went about to exalt the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal which he had made, and to ſpeak of what Advantages the State received by his Emancipation. As they had taken the Government from the King to Reign with him, they had Emancipated the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> to Govern him the more eaſily, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it to be for their Intereſt, that he ſhould not depend at all upon the Queen.</p>
            <p>The return of the King from <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre,</hi> was in the beginning of <hi>Lent,</hi> and according to his Cuſtome, he continued his Communication with his Mother, but not ſo regularly as formerly. For ſo ſoon as he had made his Complements, he Treated her with much indifference, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the humours of his Favourites. It happened at that time, that the King
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58785:70"/>
was let Blood, for a fall from his Horſe, and the Queen going to viſit him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his being advertiſed thereof, ſo as to have time to be inſtructed in the Civility which he ſhould ſhew, one might perceive how Nature would carry it away from the Artificers of his Favourites, and thoſe evil Impreſſions they had given him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, gave place to the ſtrength of Blood; for he received her with ſo much tenderneſs, that when ſhe was about to go away, and to take leave of him, he pray'd her to ſtay, to hear ſome Muſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Sing: She would at firſt have excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelf, but the King ſitting down Embraced her, and Detained her.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as the Favourites had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the King had received his Mother after that ſort, they concluded abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeparate them, to hinder their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union. The ſame Perſons, whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel a little before, had cauſed him to ſend word to the Queen, that ſhe ſhould not go forth of the Palace; ſeeing that ſhe obeyed, obliged him now to ſend her word, that ſhe ſhould leave it within a few Days.</p>
            <p>The Queen without the leaſt Reſiſtance in the World to the Kings Order, ſent on
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58785:71"/>
the Morning of the <hi>Vigil</hi> of <hi>Palm Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> to tell the Count of <hi>Caſtlemelhor</hi> by her Secretary, that ſhe would depart af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner, that the King ſhould let her know in what manner, provided it was in her Mourning Coach. It was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her on the part of the King, That he would go in his own Coach, ſhe in any ſhe would deſire, and the <hi>Infante</hi> in that of the Kings.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1663. The Queen waited for the King and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> in her Chamber, where they being arrived, the King putting himſelf on her Right-hand, and the <hi>Infante</hi> on her Left, they accompanied her after that manner to the Court of the Chappel, where they went into their Coaches as it had been agreed. It is from the Palace to the <hi>Quinte,</hi> about a Quarter of a League, all which ſpace was filled with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Concourſe of People of all ſorts, who were Aſſembled to ſee this Spectacle worthy of Compaſſion; they being perſwaded this Retreat was to a Priſon, where the King would ſecure his Mother. But yet the Serenity in the Countenance of that Princeſs, teſtified the contrary, and the Joy which they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58785:71"/>
ſaw in that of the Kings, made it belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo alſo.</p>
            <p>Being arrived at the <hi>Quinte,</hi> they went up Stairs in the ſame order they had come from the Palace, the King and the <hi>Infante</hi> leaving the Queen at the Door of the firſt Chamber, in which all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility attended; returned without ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring her any Civility, or teſtifying any Tenderneſs towards her, which did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily ſurpriſe every Body: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the <hi>Infante</hi> is not to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it, but the King only, or rather his Favourites.</p>
            <p>After that the Queen had taken her place under a Canopy, all thoſe about her came to kiſs her Hand; ſome of them being ſenſibly touched with her Retreat, and the other feigning to be ſo. As for the King, he returned that Night on Horſe-back, with a great deal of Gaity, approaching the Litters and Coaches which he met, ſpeaking to the Ladies diſhoneſt and licentious Speeches; which let the People know, that he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Queen rather to Secure her Perſon, than to do her Honour; and that his Favourites had taken theſe Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for fear the People ſhould Mutiny.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58785:72"/>
And indeed, although ſhe had Retired voluntarily, yet every one was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe was a Priſoner; for Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Fanſhaw,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſador, before he returned for <hi>London,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Sande,</hi> who was going to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Marriage between the King and the moſt Serene <hi>Marie Frances Iſabelle de Savoy,</hi> Dutcheſs <hi>de Aumel,</hi> and Princeſs <hi>de Nemoars,</hi> and <hi>Mounſieur Fouche,</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> did not dare to go ſee her, without the permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the King.</p>
            <p>As the Preſence of the Queen did a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſtrain the King, aſſoon as ſhe was Retired, he took no more regard to his Carriage. He had firſt made two Troops, one of Foot, the other of Horſe, which he called his high and low Watchmen, which were compoſed of the moſt wicked Perſons of the Realm, which paſſed with him for the moſt brave.</p>
            <p>With theſe Troops he went out every Night, and ſet upon indifferently all thoſe they met; the Peril being equal for the King as for them, becauſe they would not have him to be known amongſt them, he very freely expoſed himſelf with the reſt. Thoſe who accompanied him ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58785:72"/>
carried their Swords without Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, that they might be the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to execute his Orders, and that they might the better Surpriſe the People they found in the Dark, they blacked them, leſt their Glittering ſhould diſcover their Intentions. Thoſe who brought theirs back the moſt Bloody, received the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt praiſes from the King.</p>
            <p>The Watch which made the Round in the City, were not exempt from the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of theſe People, which troubled the whole Tranquility of the City; and the more, for the Judges durſt not make Search after thoſe who were Culpable. Nay, they were forced, having for this Buſineſs drawn ſo much Hatred on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not only to abſtain for a long time from the Execution of their Charges, but alſo to hide the very Marks of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy.</p>
            <p>The King being perſwaded one Day, that the Marqueſs <hi>de Fontes,</hi> his great Chamberlain, had offended him, he ſought all about to kill him; but not finding him any where, he gave order to his Braves to do it. They having met him in his Litter, ſhot thorow it in ſeveral places with their Muſquets; the marks they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58785:73"/>
found in divers places, ſhewed the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he had been in.</p>
            <p>Another time he made them fall upon the Coach of the Count of <hi>Ericeira,</hi> where were with him his Wife, his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his Brother, but it was without effect, becauſe they, to whom he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the execution of that Commiſſion, had no mind to execute it.</p>
            <p>One of his Diverſions was to go in the Night to the Gibbet, to ſee thoſe that were executed, and having taken them down, to obſerve what wry mouths they made when they expired.</p>
            <p>The Night on which every year they made a ſolemn Proceſſion from our Lady <hi>de Grace,</hi> to Saint <hi>Roch,</hi> and in which they repreſented the Paſſion, the King was reſolved to go thither in his Coach with his Braves: Some of his Gentlemen indeavoured to divert him from it, telling him, the Place and the Ceremony would render the Action too remarkable, but he deſpiſed this Advice. He went thither, and ordered two of his Braves to box ſome of the men as they paſſed along with their Wives, but they did but juſtle them, the King obſerving they did not follow his Orders, commanded them ſo often, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58785:73"/>
one of them drew his Sword to fall upon them, they did the like to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Aſſoon as the King ſaw that, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring no better, he went out of his Coach, his preſence put all into diſorder, and ſo much troubled the Proceſſion, that it was broken, and the ſacred Images, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Paſſion, flung down.</p>
            <p>This Hurly burly being appeaſed, the King perceiving that he wanted a pair of his Piſtols, and thinking it a point of diſhonour, to leave his Arms behind him, gave order they ſhould ſearch among the Croud for them, and in the Confuſion of the people, but his Braves demanding briskly the news of them of the firſt they incountred, the Combat was renewed, and the people were driven tumultuouſly, as far as the Gate of the Court, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Marqueſs <hi>de Niſa,</hi> and even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Hall, if the Noblemen who were within had not oppoſed them, becauſe the King was preſent, who at laſt retired himſelf, leaving very many wounded. This Action, which was againſt all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Divine Laws, caſt all the Court into an extraordinary conſternation.</p>
            <p>The night following, <hi>Pedro Severim Norogna,</hi> Secretary of the Grants, paſſing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58785:74"/>
under the Vaut, called the <hi>Golden Arch,</hi> incountring the Kings Litter, which was invironed with his low Patrovils, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to make him way a little, but theſe people being thereat offended, they fell upon him, and beat him off his horſe, in ſuch a manner that they left him mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded: As this was not far from the Palace, the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor</hi> hearing the noiſe, ran thither, where he found him wounded, and in ſo ill a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he was not able to be carried to his Houſe, ſo that he was fain to be put into one of the Chambers of the Kings Apartment, where he died within a few days after. The King was ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at it, that inſtead of chaſtiſing theſe murtherers, he hindred any from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming againſt them.</p>
            <p>About this time there appeared a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, the King having heard ſay, that it preſaged the death of Kings, or a change in their States, he got above in his Tarraſs, and there uſed to it a thouſand injurious ſpeeches, and called it a thouſand infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous names, and ſhot off his Piſtols at it, His Favourites knew not any better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for this paſſion of his, than to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, he was a greater King than
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58785:74"/>
his Father, or any of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
            <p>His Debauches kept the ſame pace with his Emportments, for he did not only haunt the Houſes of Women of ill Life, but they brought them alſo to an Houſe in the Country, neer to <hi>Alcantara,</hi> and his Favourites humoured this Inclination in him, thereby to endeavour to diſſipate the Report which ran of his inability. But when they ſaw this would not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently convince the people, they thought of a thing in the mean time, which decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very many perſons. They bred up in the Palace a little Girl, under the name of <hi>Infanta,</hi> publiſhing the King to be her Father. And to render the thing more likely, they made the Mother of the Child to be cruelly whipt, under pretext of infidelity, and a man to be aſſaſſinated as one that had cauſed a Jealouſy in the King. He did not leave in the mean time going to her houſe, or elſe cauſing her to be brought to the Palace, and carried her into publick Aſſemblies, and indeed in appearance he ſeemed to be deſperately in love with her. This Intrigue had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the moſt wary, if the Woman, who knew the Truth better than any body, had
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58785:75"/>
not ſpoyl'd all by Confeſſing; That all that which the King ſhewed towards her was but feigned, and that he was not the Father of that Infant.</p>
            <p>He began alſo to make his Gallantries to the <hi>Religious,</hi> and to bring about more eaſily his wicked Deſign, he made them open their Churches that he might repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Comedies in them, making the Quire ſerve for the Theatre, and the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry the place for the Tyring Room; but when he ſaw all theſe Attempts were in vain, he Scandaliſed them in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. He had ſo little reſpect for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that when there was no need for it, ſhe made Maſs to be ſaid at the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary times in his Chamber, whilſt that he was in Bed, or all Undreſſed. He would never go likewiſe on Feaſtival Days into his Seat in the Chappel till after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which was the cauſe that Maſs was not finiſhed there, till the Hour that Veſpers were ſaid in other Churches. Since he was not able abſolutely to forbear hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sermons, he ordered the Preachers that they ſhould ſhorten their Sermons; and ſome of them were Baniſhed, becauſe they did not obey this Order, and others forbore to Preach at all. There were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58785:75"/>
ſome who had the boldneſs to Cry out againſt theſe Diſorders, but without any effect; for others by the Flatteries with which they compoſed their Sermons, rendred their Zeal unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the three Favourites, by the means of the Subordination between them, had Liv'd with good Intelligence; but the Count <hi>Caſtlemelhor</hi> perceiving that it was eaſie for him to Ruine the Favour of the two others, he ſought for an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to facilitate his Enterpriſe, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd againſt them the ſame Artificers, which all three had uſed againſt thoſe they had in Suſpition: He chaſed firſt all their Friends from the Palace, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards themſelves: For they had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er loſt his Amity, than they had loſt the Favour of the King.</p>
            <p>It happened one Day, that the Count <hi>de Atouguya</hi> drew his Sword at the back Stairs of the Palace, for which the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor</hi> ſought with all diligence poſſible to Arreſt him, and to have made him ſuffer the Puniſhment that is ordained in that Caſe.</p>
            <p>Some time after the ſame Count <hi>de Atouguya,</hi> went to anſwer a Challenge
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58785:76"/>
that was ſent him, which the Count of <hi>Caſtlemelhor</hi> made a matter of very ill Conſequence; although it was in a time wherein if Duels were not permitted, at leaſt they were not Puniſhed.</p>
            <p>The King at the perſwaſion of ſome Body, or of his own mind (for it was ſometimes very difficult to penetrate into the ſecret of his Heart) wrote a Letter to <hi>Conti,</hi> with an Order for his being brought back from <hi>Brazile;</hi> the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor</hi> quickly ſuſpected <hi>Sebaſtine Ceſar de Meneſes</hi> to have writ it. Upon this, he reviv'd againſt him the ancient Buſineſſes, and ſtirred up new ones, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he received Orders to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf two Leagues from the Court.</p>
            <p>As none knew the true Cauſes of theſe Diſgraces, the Publick Good and Juſtice being made only the pretext, theſe things rendred the Count extremely odious, eſpecially that of the Count <hi>de Atouguya,</hi> by whom he had made his Fortune: But at Court the ſentiment of Ambition, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily blots out thoſe of Acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>A little time after, <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>John de Conti,</hi> arrived from <hi>Brazile,</hi> and were received with the Noiſe of the Artillery,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58785:76"/>
and the Sound of Trumpets. But they had Order ſent them to retire to a Houſe they had in the Country, at the Mouth of the <hi>Tagus,</hi> with a Prohibition not to go from thence. There was ſomething ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in this Order, for at the ſame time there was ſent them Preſents from the King; to the one a very conſiderable Charge in his Houſe, and five and twenty hundred Livers of Rent; and to the other the Treaſureſhip of St. <hi>Michael de Freixo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not without Reaſon that the Count, who knew the firſt impreſſions of Friendſhip as well as thoſe of Love, are never to be altogether Effaced, neither by Time nor Abſence, ſhould be afraid of the Interview of the King and <hi>Conti,</hi> and that he ſhould oppoſe it as much as poſſibly he could; but in ſpite of all his care, he could not hinder him from doing it. If <hi>Conti</hi> did not come to the King, the King did not fail to go to find him out. He ſaw him one Day in an Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and at another time in the middle of a Field. Some would have perſwaded <hi>Conti</hi> to have followed the King, and to have come back to Court, but he would not, or elſe he durſt not do it.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſecret Interviews gave a ſuſpition
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58785:77"/>
to the Count, that they were Hatching ſomething againſt him; and as it is the cuſtome of Favourites to intereſt their Maſters in their Conſervation, he made the King believe, they went about to take from him his Crown: And at the ſame time there went a Report, that he had diſcovered this Conſpiracy by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. He accuſed the Queen, who was in her Retirement, the Duke <hi>de Cadaval,</hi> who was at <hi>Tentugal,</hi> the Count <hi>de Atouguia,</hi> who was diſgraced; <hi>Sebaſtine Ceſar de Meneſes,</hi> who was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and <hi>Antony de Conti,</hi> who was Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>It was then reſolved, that they ſhould take the Informations of this pretended Conſpiracy, and a Commiſſion was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>John Gabriel de Barros,</hi> and to the Regiſter <hi>Franciſco de Fonſeca Sinel,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Chamber Criminal; it was <hi>Lewis Correa de Torres,</hi> who gave in the firſt Depoſition, being Interrogated by the King, who had his naked Sword in his Hand: After this, they extended it to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many other Perſons of great Quality.</p>
            <p>The Regiſter was charged with a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conſultation to give to the Secretary <hi>Belchior de Andrade,</hi> with a Superſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed often demanded to ſee what they were accuſed of; but they would never deliver them any Copy of their Charges. And that Information which ought to have been Cancell'd, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nothing of Proof againſt the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, was Conſerved by the credit of the Favourites, as an armed Hand ready to diſcharge its Blow on ſome other Occaſion, on the Heads of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</p>
            <p>After this ſucceſs, which let all the World ſee, that the Credit of the Court was not to be Limited; he was not afraid to leave the Apartment he had in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and to take one more Splendid, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58785:79"/>
anſwerable to the glory of his Fortune: his Anti-chamber being thronged with Courtiers, whilſt the King's was naked and empty.</p>
            <p>By theſe ways, and by others yet leſs Legitimate, the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor</hi> had acquired ſo much power in the Realm, that he lived no longer as a Subject; ſo that the King who had formerly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the Regency of the Queen, <hi>He was but a Statue, of which ſhe was the Organ;</hi> might with much more Reaſon ſay the ſame thing of the Count.</p>
            <p>About this time, <hi>Simon de Vasconcellos,</hi> and <hi>Souſa,</hi> the Favourites Brother, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ſo well about the <hi>Infante,</hi> that when the Prince fell Sick in the <hi>Autumn</hi> following, he performed about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Functions of all the Gentlemen of his Chamber, which made them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him reſpected before them, to Retire under divers pretexts; but the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor,</hi> made the King recal them all, except the Count <hi>de Ericeira;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was the moſt worthy to have been recalled, becauſe of his high Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and the greatneſs of his Wit. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Re-eſtabliſhment, <hi>Simon de Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concellos</hi> was alſo made Gentleman of the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58785:80"/>
Chamber to the <hi>Infante,</hi> and had alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, a Brief for Superintendant of the Houſe of the ſame <hi>Infante.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometime after, <hi>Pedro Ceſar de Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, George de Mello, Ruy de Figueredo de Alarcon,</hi> and <hi>Antony de Miranda Anri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez,</hi> retired themſelves, As for <hi>Don Diego de Meneſes,</hi> he took leave publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which was thought ſo ſtrange of by the Favourite, that he menaced him with a Chaſtiſement, although he had for his excuſe the Count <hi>de Ericeira,</hi> who a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before had taken leave after the ſame manner. And the Chaſtiſement had ſoon followed the Menace, had not an Affair happened, which ſuſpended the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had taken thereupon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruy Fernandes de Almada,</hi> was retired to execute his Charge of Preſident of the Court in the City, leaving in his place his Son <hi>Chriſtopher de Almada, Antony Cavide,</hi> Secretary, having alſo left the Service of the <hi>Infante; John de Roxas de Azevedo,</hi> who was at that time Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Inqueſts, exerciſed his Charge.</p>
            <p>Things being at this paſs, the Marqueſs <hi>de Sande,</hi> arrived from <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1665. where he had been,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58785:80"/>
having paſſed out of <hi>England</hi> thither with the Articles of the Marriage of the King, with the moſt Serene Princeſs <hi>de Nemours,</hi> and an Order to Treat of a Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Infante</hi> and <hi>Mademoiſselle de Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illen,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Bouillen.</hi> As this laſt was but as it were in Agitation, upon a Letter which that Prince had wrote to the Marqueſs of <hi>Sande,</hi> by the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Favourites; he declared he did not deſire that Negotiation ſhould be continued, which did extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſe them. To make him conſent to the Marriage they told him, that this Rupture would trouble the Repoſe of the Publick; and that the Treaty which had been begun by virtue of his procuration, could not be left off, without breaking off the Kings alſo, which would be a great prejudice to the State. But the Prince in his own behalf, told them, That the Eſſence of Marriage conſiſted in the Conſent of the Parties, and that he had never given his to that: And moreover, he had not given his poſitive Word, as they had made People believe; but if it had been ſo, before the Treaty ſhould be concluded, he ſhould have the power to break it off. Since there was not any
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58785:81"/>
Realm in the World, but could ſhew Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the ſame thing. That in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> the King <hi>Emanuel</hi> had Eſpouſed Madam <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom his Son <hi>John</hi> had thought to have Married; that the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Donna Beatrice,</hi> Daughter to the King <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> after ſhe had agreed with <hi>Frederick,</hi> Duke <hi>de Benevent,</hi> as alſo with <hi>Duarte,</hi> ſon of <hi>D' Aimond,</hi> Count <hi>de Cambridg,</hi> and promiſed to the <hi>Infanta John</hi> her Unkle: after that to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Son of <hi>John</hi> the Firſt, King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was notwithſtanding all this Eſpouſed to the laſt. That all the World knew that <hi>Mary</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Bourgoyn,</hi> who had been promiſed to <hi>John,</hi> and to <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, Dukes of <hi>Anjou;</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Guinne,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to <hi>Frederick,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tarente,</hi> Eſpouſed <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and Emperor: That they could not after all, maintain with any Reaſon, that to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate the Marriage of the King, he muſt neceſſarily be Eſpouſed to <hi>Madomoiſelle de Bouillen.</hi> But the Favourites ſeeing they were not able to change the mind of the Prince, they made him be ſpoken to about it by the King, determining with him the time and place for him to do it.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58785:81"/>
They two being together in their Seat, on <hi>Good Friday,</hi> though it was no place conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, nor which they had pitched on; the King after he had entertained the <hi>Infante</hi> of many Indifferent things, ſpake to him of this Marriage, and reproached him, that he had been willing the King ſhould make the Match, and that the Queen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo had uſed her endeavours for it; but the <hi>Infante</hi> lookt upon this Accuſation but as a Calumny, and juſtified both himſelf and the Queen. As to that of his Marriage, ſince it was not pleaſing to God he ſhould Marry contrary to his Affection, his Majeſty could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him to it, without offending him; but the King not being able to ſuffer this reſiſtance of the Prince, told him, that he would put him in the Tower: To which he told him, As he was King, he might do it, but yet although he had an abſolute power over him, ought not to make uſe of it, to force his will, or to do him out-rage.</p>
            <p>On the next morning, the <hi>Infante</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to the Seat, the King made new Efforts to perſwade him: But ſeeing he endeavoured it in vain, he made the Secretary of State to tell <hi>Rodrigue de</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:58785:82"/>
               <hi>Meneſes, Simon de Vaſconſellos,</hi> and <hi>Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue de Acunha,</hi> that their Services ſhould be no longer acceptable to him, if they did not make his Brother change his Mind. <hi>Rodrigue de Meneſes</hi> would have made a Tryal on the <hi>Infante,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him an Accompt of what had paſſed, but inſtead of hearing him, he told him, <hi>That the King might cut off his Head, as well as of the meaneſt of his Subjects; but he had not power enough to change his Heart. That they ſhould never make him to reſolve upon that Marriage, that not being the way to do it; for in matters of Love, the whole Soul becomes firm againſt Violence, and the moſt ſweet Spirits are provoked, when they go about to force their Inclinations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Sande,</hi> before he went back into <hi>France</hi> to conclude the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the King, ſpake to the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor,</hi> about the report of his Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but the Count told him it was an Impoſture, whether he was ſo perſwaded indeed, or whether he ſpake for his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt againſt his Conſcience, is uncertain.</p>
            <p>Whilſt every one expected the good ſucceſs of this Marriage, that was nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, and began before hand to taſt the Joy of it, there chanced a Subject
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58785:82"/>
of Affliction, which troubled that Joy, by the death of the Queen. Every one was preparing their Habits, to celebrate the Reception of the new Queen, but were forced to turn them into mourning, to honour the Funerals of the old. She fell ſick the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1666, of a Diſeaſe, that at firſt put her into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Danger, taking from her the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Breathing. She no ſooner knew the eſtate ſhe was in, but ſhe diſpoſed, like a moſt Chriſtian, and moſt Pious Princeſs, of all things that concerned her: after which ſhe wrote to her two Children, who were at <hi>Salvater,</hi> in theſe Terms.</p>

            <p>When the <hi>Infante</hi> heard theſe ſad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, he could not but by tears expreſs his Greif, but the King was very far from being touched with it, and rallied his Brother for his tenderneſs, and oppoſed his deſign of going away poſt. Both of them anſwered the Letters of the Queen, and ſent her Word that they would come ſpeedily to kiſs her hand. The Grand Maſter of the Kings Houſe, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Intendant of the <hi>Infante</hi>'s, carried their Anſwers.</p>
            <p>The King made this Voyage with a great deal of delay, going in his Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, he made many turns and returns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Water, to ſpeak words of Railery to the Boats and Barques he met with, ſo that he arrived at the <hi>Quinte,</hi> not till <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday,</hi> the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1666, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight a clock, and it was not to be
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58785:84"/>
doubted, but that this delay was a thing deſigned.</p>
            <p>The King and the <hi>Infante,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Favourite and his Brother, found the Queen upon the point of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring her laſt Breath. The King asked her Benediction, but the <hi>Infante</hi> was not able to ſay any thing, having both his Heart and his Voice ſeized, and all he could do was to burſt into tears. <hi>Iſabel de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro</hi> uncovered the Queens Hand; which the King and the <hi>Infante</hi> kiſſed, and the Favourite having told the King, it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, he went out, ſaying, <hi>Adieu, Adieu,</hi> and an hour after the Queen expired.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Munday</hi> was her Funeral, the King and the <hi>Infante</hi> caſting the holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon her Corps, which they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied to her Litter, in which they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to a Covent of Barefoot <hi>White-Friars,</hi> to be there Depoſited, till that of <hi>Religious</hi> Women of the ſame Order, of which ſhe was the Foundreſs, was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where ſhe had a mind to be Buried.</p>
            <p>As this Princeſs had been in her Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, ſo ſhe will be after her Death, a perfect Model for all Princeſſes. She was no ſooner Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganſa,</hi> but her Addreſs, and her Reſolution, put the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58785:84"/>
Crown upon the Head of her Husband; who had ſuch Confidence in her, that he Communicated the moſt Important <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the State to her, which had ſuch great Succeſs, that the greateſt Politians admired her Conduct. When ſhe was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, ſhe yet better manifeſted the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſhe had to Manage the State; for as ſhe was aſſiſted by no Body, and that the Burthen of the Kingdom lay upon her, ſhe expreſſed an Indefatigable ſtrength both of Body and Mind, and conſerved by her Prudence, what ſhe had Conquered by her Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>age. So ſoon as ſhe was undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Vanity of the things of this World, ſhe had a mind to Diſcharge her ſelf of the Care of thoſe Affairs: If ſhe did not do it, it was becauſe of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which ſhe found in the executing of her Deſign; beſides, ſome made it to her a ſcruple of Conſcience. Moreover, as ſhe had always a great deal of Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in her Proſperity, ſo ſhe ſupported all thoſe Diſgraces which Heaven ſent her with much Conſtancy.</p>
            <p>They remarked (as a thing rare in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex, when they have the ſoveraign Authority in their Hands) that ſhe had ſo little Reſentment for the Perſecutions
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58785:85"/>
they had made her ſuffer, ſhe ſeemed to take a pleaſure in them, ſo much ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to oppoſe Religion.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Infante</hi> had not ſo much Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for he would not Pardon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, whom he accuſed to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them, which irritated them in ſuch ſort that they confounded all things with the King. They again raiſed up the ancient Reports, which they had before ſpread abroad; That he had no affection for the King, and that he aſpired to the Crown. They enquired into his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, into his Exerciſes, and into the Perſons that came to him, to endeavour to gain ſome pretext to cenſure his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. The King witneſſed his hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who Complemented him, and an affection for them who Eſtranged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from him, and forbid at the ſame time very many from coming into his Palace, and teſtified to many others, that their Affairs were not Expedited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they went thither. What did they not do to take off <hi>Don Rodrigue de Meneſes</hi> firſt Preſident of the Parliament, from the <hi>Infante?</hi> How often did they try to enforce on him Impreſſions againſt him? How often by offers enough to have ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58785:85"/>
any Man, but he, did they attempt it? All the Preſidents of the other Tribunals <note place="margin">

               </gap>ly was refuſed that Grace: They would then have ſent him in Quality of <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>y</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> but he found too many Charms in the Perſon of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> to go to exerciſe that Charge, which was given to <hi>John Nunes de Acuntia,</hi> who was alſo ty'd to the Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Rodrigue de Meneſes, Simon de Vaſconcellos,</hi> and <hi>Souſa,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher de Abnada,</hi> were all the Gentlemen that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to him: But as he had not enough to appear at the Entry of the Queen, he went and demanded of the King permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to augment their Number; to which he yielded, and told him by <hi>Henry Anri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez de Miranda,</hi> that he gave him power to name them himſelf. The <hi>Infante</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently named <hi>Lewis de Silveira,</hi> Count <hi>de Sarſedas, Don Vaſco Labo</hi> Baron <hi>de Alvito, Michael Carlos de Tavora,</hi> General of the Artillery in the Province <hi>Tras os Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and <hi>Lawrence de Lencaſtre;</hi> but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Palace to thank the King, he found he had changed his mind. In the mean time he heard the Queen had left <hi>France,</hi> and he thought to ſerve
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58785:86"/>
himſelf with the occaſion of the good News, to ask of the King theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which he had choſen by his permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the King would not yield to it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, the <hi>Infante</hi> having ſaid, That he he was aſtoniſhed to ſee his Majeſty would not approve of the Choice which he had made by his Permiſſion. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>That his Ancient Officers had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him, becauſe they were not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his ill Humour.</hi> So the <hi>Infante</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf Obliged to let the King ſee, that they did not Retire for any Cauſe, but for their own particular Affairs: He would have ſhewn the King a Billet left by <hi>Antony de Miranda Anriquez,</hi> when he retired, but he would not ſee it. It is one of the Injuſtices of thoſe who are in Authority over others, that they would not have the Truth made manifeſt to them, when it is not for their Advantage, for fear their Falſity ſhould not continue with them.</p>
            <p>But it was ſuppoſed, that the King did this becauſe he was conſtant to his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, who would have the <hi>Infante</hi> to have taken again his Ancient Gentlemen, who had quitted him becauſe they were their Creatures, nor would they yield to let
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58785:86"/>
him have the other, becauſe they were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. At this time the <hi>Infante</hi> came ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feldom to Councel, the Favourite how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fail'd not to give him an account of the Affairs of the Realm, but not in truth to ask his Advice, but only to tell him what had been reſolved on in Council: But he had oftentimes that from common Report, which they come to communicate to him from the King as a Secret.</p>
            <p>The King and the <hi>Infante</hi> lived together after this manner, when they had advice that that Navy which brought the Queen, appeared at the Cape <hi>Rogue,</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1666. The Admiral on which ſhe was aboard, caſt Anchor a little above <hi>Betlehem,</hi> and in the Evening ſhe came to Land in the preſence of all the People, who were raviſh'd with her Beau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty, and her good Grace. The King was the only Perſon who was not in haſt to ſee her, and in lieu of going to receive her from on Board, he ſtay'd to do his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Exerciſes.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Ruvigny,</hi> General of the Naval Forces which had conveyed the Queen, went to ſalute the <hi>Infante,</hi> whom he found accompanied with none but <hi>Don Rodrigue de Meneſes,</hi> for
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58785:87"/>
               <hi>Simon de Vaſconcellos, Souſa,</hi> and <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher de Almada,</hi> were at <hi>Lisbon.</hi> The Prince took an occaſion thereupon, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand again thoſe Gentlemen which they had refuſed him, and ſent to let the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite know by his Secretary, that he ſhould advertiſe the King, it was for his Honour, whilſt the Court was full of Strangers, he ſhould have a Train anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Birth and Quality. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite return'd an anſwer ſo drily to the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Secretary, that he was obliged to tell him, it would be well for him to pacifie him; but he deſpiſed that advice.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>Infante</hi> had known the Kings Anſwer, they met by chance in the great Place, called <hi>Campo Grandee,</hi> the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourding him ſaid, <hi>Since he had been wilful, he would take his turn to be ſo to,</hi> The <hi>Infante</hi> anſwered him. <hi>That his Majeſty ought to be as good as his Word, and if he had any reaſon, wherefore he ſhould not grant him thoſe Gentlemen he had demanded, he ought not to hide it from him, ſince they were all worthy of the approbation of his Majeſty: he had reaſon to believe, that he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to deprive him of the ſtisfaction of being neer him.</hi> After this, ſeeing things look ſo ſcurvily at the Court, he demanded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58785:87"/>
of the King to retire. The King told him, That he might do it of his own proper motion, if he pleaſed, but he ſhould not order it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> took leave of the King, and kiſſing his Hand, he added to what he had ſaid, That from that moment he ſhould retire himſelf from the Court, but he believed he ought in good Manners to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the King, until he had made his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into <hi>Lisbon</hi> with the Queen. He went notwithſtanding every Day to the Court, where the King Rallying with him, ask'd him why he was not yet gone from Court? He anſwered, That he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to accompany his Majeſty in his Entry, and after that he would finally retire. Among theſe Rudeneſſes which the King ſhewed to his Brother, he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled ſome Sweetneſſes and Careſſes; ſome were perſwaded that this Refuſal came but from ſome Counſel, that had been given the King.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> one Day, ſaid to <hi>Don Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigue de Meneſes,</hi> and to <hi>Simon de Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concellos,</hi> that he knew well enough, ſome Body did render him ill Offices about the King, and had diverted him from the Deſign he had to have kept his word:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58785:88"/>
He added, That he ſuſpected the Count of <hi>Caſtlemelhor,</hi> and if he ſhould find it to be ſo, he ſhould have a Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as rigorous as his Crime was enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. <hi>Simon de Vaſconcellos</hi> anſwered, That if he continued to do ſuch Injuſtice to his Brother, he ſhould retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his Service: And he ſpoke it with ſo much Paſſion, the <hi>Infante</hi> was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to tell him, That he ſhould have a care of what he ſaid, for he would not always find him diſpoſed to receive his Excuſes, as he had often done; ſince he had carried things to that Extremity, and put him beſides all Patience, he would make him think of what he had to do, and that he ſhould leave the Palace. <hi>Simon de Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concellos,</hi> not being to be found about the <hi>Infante</hi> when he was going forth, and that by his Order they had ſearched for him on all ſides without finding him, he came juſt as the <hi>Infante</hi> went into his Coach, who commanded him to take his Place, but he denied it; and the more he was preſſed, the more obſtinately he refuſed it, ſo that the <hi>Infante</hi> was fain to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. This Obſtinacy at one blow, broke the Line which ty'd him to the Prince, and ſince that time, he could never
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58785:88"/>
obtain the Grace he had refuſed.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor</hi> having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that the <hi>Infante</hi> was angry with him, and his Brother had loſt his favour, endeavoured to get for him thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he deſired, but he could not bring it about. But having a mind to juſtify himſelf however with the <hi>Infante,</hi> he came to his Palace, to make him great Proteſtations of his Service, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him the great Endeavours he had uſed with the King to render him Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, exaggerating the trouble he had had to have a particular Audience of the King, and that he could not obtain it, but under pretext of letting him ſee ſome papers of other Concernment. <q>But the <hi>Infante</hi> anſwered him, That he had no faith in thoſe Words, if they were not followed by Effects, and he ſhould by that beſt judge of them; adding that the evil Treatment he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the King came from the Counſels that were given him; that as he knew not certainly who they were that gave it him, he had not taken from them their Lives; that for his own particular, if he would juſtify himſelf to him, he had nothing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58785:89"/>
to do but to procure him the good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the King, upon whoſe Spirit he had an abſolute power, and that would be the only mark he could give him of his innocency.</q> The Favourite returned worſe ſatisfied than before with this Diſcourſe; for he was perſwaded that this Contempt, which the Prince ſhewed he had for him, if he ſhould not revenge himſelf for it, would draw on him that of all the people.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> diſpos'd himſelf every day to retire, and great quantity of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Gentlemen of the Kingdom kept themſelves about his Perſon, which gave great Terror to the Favourite, and forced him to ſtand upon his Guard; for he was not ignorant that they imputed the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of the <hi>Infante</hi> to none but him, and that they had ſaid publickly, he would not retire, but becauſe they two were incompatible. This was eaſily believed by the Intereſt, that Favourites have to eſtrange from the Court thoſe, whoſe birth might give them Authority, or for the Hatred they bear to Favourites, which interprets all they do in an evil ſence.</p>

would become much more violent.</p>
            <p>The trouble which this Retreat of the <hi>Infante</hi> cauſed in the Court, gave great hopes to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer the Realm of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Fame always adding to the Truth, made ſimple appearances paſs for realities, and publiſh'd in Countries at a diſtance, that the <hi>Infante</hi> had taken Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King. That which gave a jealouſie to the Favourites chiefly, was their underſtanding the <hi>Infante</hi> had order'd to prepare for him a Houſe at <hi>Almada,</hi> to paſs away the Winter <note place="margin">A Town on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the <hi>Tagus,</hi> over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi>
               </note> in. The Favourites ſeeing the Love of the People to encreaſe for the <hi>Infante,</hi> through the compaſſion which they had for his diſgraces, went about to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite his return.</p>
            <p>At this time the Queen found her ſelf indiſpoſed, and the Prince who who came often to enquire after her health, gave her viſits by night; but by the perſwaſions of the Favourites ſhe was removed to <hi>Lisbon</hi> during her illneſs, it being a place better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated it may be to her contentment, for remedy for her grief. The <hi>Infante</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:58785:91"/>
let himſelf be perſwaded by the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Queen, and return'd to his Palace, yet without bringing his Equipage from <hi>Quelus,</hi> becauſe his deſign was to return thither again, in caſe he were not ſatisfied, and to paſs from thence to <hi>Almada.</hi> The greateſt favour they could force from the King was, that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he ſhould take ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but as for thoſe he had choſen, the more they urg'd, the more he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd it, and they could never ſoften a heart which had ſo harden'd it ſelf; ſo that all they could obtain of the King was, that he ſhould renounce his firſt election, and chuſe any whom he would, one only excepted.</p>
            <p>As they had fail'd of the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe they had given to the <hi>Infante,</hi> he would not trouble himſelf again: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, after he had made reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereon, that his Complaint would be the more legitimate, and more talk'd on, if the King ſhould break it a ſecond time, as he believ'd he would, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of this offer, and named <hi>Lewis de Silva Tello</hi> Count <hi>d' Aveiras, Dou John Maſcarenhas</hi> Count <hi>de la Torc,</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:58785:92"/>
               <hi>Lewis Alvares de Tavora</hi> Count <hi>de St. John,</hi> and <hi>Emanuel Telles de Silva</hi> Count <hi>de Vilarmayor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Favourites had heard this news, they deliberated at firſt if they ſhould approve of the choice; all theſe Gentlemen being ſuſpected to be too conſiderable; but yet in the end they feign'd to think well of it. After this the <hi>Infante</hi> came back to Court, when <hi>Chriſtopher d'Almada</hi> demanded leave of the King to retire, which was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, with ſome demonſtration of acknowledgment for his Services.</p>
            <p>The King every moment exerciſed ſo much the Patience of his Brother, that all the world believ'd his hate was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable; inſomuch that it was not in the power of thoſe who ſeem'd to be Maſter of his Spirit to ſweeten him in the leaſt; at leaſt it was ſo thought by ſome, who were perſwaded that it was the intereſt of the Favourites ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to oblige the Prince than to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate him. But others judg'd to the contrary, that all this was but feign'd by the Favourites, who deſpairing ever to be truly reconciled to the <hi>Infante,</hi> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the hatred that the King bore him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:58785:92"/>
The averſion of the King to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> running thus into exceſs, he did nothing but what render'd him Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the mind of the King. One day there hapning a difference between the Marchioneſs of <hi>Caſtlemelhor,</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Honour to the Queen, and <hi>Don John Maſcorenhas</hi> Count <hi>de St. Croix,</hi> Grand Maſter of his Houſe, about the Functions of their Charges, the King ſaid, he would accommodate the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and govern his Houſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the <hi>Infante</hi> thinking to Court him, added, that he ought not only to govern his Houſe, but alſo the Realm, which would give joy to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and make all the Complaints of his Subjects ceaſe. But the King imagining the <hi>Infante</hi> ſaid this in hatred to the Marchioneſs, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in fury, that he ſhould not meddle with giving him Councel; and his paſſion paſs'd ſo far, that he had ſtruck him if the Queen had not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him. Another time the King, Queen, and the <hi>Infante</hi> being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Caroch, ſeeing the Tilting <note place="margin">This is one kind of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſes.</note> in the which the Marqueſs of <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alva</hi> and the <hi>Count de Caſtlemelhor</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:58785:93"/>
were the Chiefs of the Squadrons; the <hi>Infante</hi> prais'd the good Grace of the Marquis and his Brother, to <hi>Don Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigue de Meneſes,</hi> who rod by him; the King imagining that theſe praiſes which he had given to the Marquiſs <hi>de Marialva,</hi> did wrong to the Count <hi>de Caſtlemelhor,</hi> he told him, if that the Queen had not been preſent, he would have thruſt his Sword into his Guts. The <hi>Infante</hi> anſwered, they meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe praiſes, and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ought to have equal ſatisfaction for them all, ſince they had no other deſign but to divert him. Beſides, he was perſwaded that his Majeſty would not ſhed that Blood which he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pour forth for his ſervice. The Queen try'd to appeaſe the wrath of the one, and the reſentment of the other; but the firſt ſhe could not effect. But that which was moſt ſurpriſing in this was, becauſe this Marquiſs was one of thoſe who had moſt contributed to the re-eſtabliſhment of the State, and one of thoſe who did yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. And although he had won Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, <note place="margin">Which were <hi>Monte Claros</hi> &amp; <hi>Evota.</hi>
               </note> and had recovered places of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and that the Count had not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58785:93"/>
done any ſervices like theſe; yet he be ſo well perſwaded the King, that it was he that did all things in the State, and that others did but execute his Reſolutions, that he carried away all the Rewards; and the better to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this ingratitude, he rob'd them of a part of their Glory, and debaſed their fair Actions. So that whilſt the great Captains vanquiſhed their Enemies in the Field and on the Frontiers, the Count triumph'd for it in the Court and in the Cabinet.</p>
            <p>The King was alſo ſo perſwaded, his Brother did not love him, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd he ſaw marks of his averſion in all his Diſcourſes and in all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo much that he took all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects he render'd him for Offences. So that it was enough to make the King mortally hate any man, if the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> teſtified to him any amity; as it happen'd to <hi>Joſeph de Fonſeca,</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to the King, and Almoner to the <hi>Infante,</hi> who had order to withdraw himſelf; for which the <hi>Infante</hi> was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly touch'd, but diſſembled his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> having named <hi>Don Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſimo</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:58785:94"/>
               <hi>de Lancaſtre</hi> to fulfil the charge of drawing the Screen before the King, by a permiſſion granted him by the King, it being vacant by the Death of <hi>Don Rodrigue de Acuntia;</hi> they made him acquainted with that choice by the Favourite; but the anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, that the King had already him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf choſen one to ſerve in that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. The <hi>Infante</hi> ſeeing he would not ceaſe from giving of him theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts, he knew now better remedy to ſhun them, than to withdraw himſelf from the Court. To effect this, he ſent the King word by his Secretary, that being Conſtable of the Realm, he ought to permit him to go into the Province of <hi>Alentejo,</hi> to exerciſe there the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his Charge, which obliged him to defend the State; that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Queen, had given him where he was under Age, the Charge of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General, and made the Marqueſs of <hi>Marialva</hi> his Lieutenant; that he did not deſire that employment, but to ſhun the Reproaches of Forreign Princes, who might accuſe him of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unprofitable to the State in a time when he might render it good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58785:94"/>
and to draw him out of that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing idleneſs in which he liv'd. This Propoſition made thoſe who Govern'd the King to tremble, and oblig'd them more than ever to look after their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. They perſwaded the King, that the Charge of Conſtable was the ſtep whereby the <hi>Infante</hi> would mount the Throne; that to put Arms into his Hand, was to put all things under his Diſcretion; and under the pretence of uſing them to defend the State againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he would ſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with them to conquer <hi>Portugal</hi> for himſelf. For this cauſe they reſolved, the King ſhould not yeild the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> this requeſt; yet however not declaring it ſo ſoon, that they might weary his patience. It was alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, the King ſhould conſult up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſubject with every one of his Councellors in particular; which was done with ſo much leiſure, that the <hi>Infante</hi> taking this retardment for a denial, was ſenſibly touch'd; for they had promiſed him at another time what they refuſed him now, ſo that he could not reſolve to ſtand with his Arms a-croſs, whilſt he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58785:95"/>
heard every-where the rumour of War.</p>
            <p>In this time two of the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Gentlemen were gone from him, the Count <hi>de la Torre</hi> and the Count <hi>de St. John,</hi> under pretence of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Charges they had in the Army; but indeed it was becauſe they were fear'd by the Favourite. Order was given to the firſt, to go levy Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the Province of <hi>Eſtremadura,</hi> and the other to command the Army in <hi>Tras os Montes.</hi> As this Order was given in the heart of Winter, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> knew it was done to croſs him; however he ſent the King word, that he was very joyful theſe two Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were employ'd in his ſervice. Theſe two Counts parting, the <hi>Infante</hi> ſtay'd with the King, continuing to render him an extraordinary ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>The time came in which the King was accuſtomed to go every year to <hi>Salvaterre,</hi> and the <hi>Infante</hi> demanded of him permiſſion to take with him thither ſome Gentlemen beſides his own; but the King would not grant it. As in the time of the late King the Prince <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had the ſame liberty,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58785:95"/>
this refuſal was very plain, and had almoſt made him to ſhew his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de la Torre,</hi> who was executing his Orders at <hi>Santarem,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſo near to <hi>Salvaterre,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it was his duty to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well to render an account of his Commiſſion, as to kiſs the hand of the King and the <hi>Infante.</hi> Thoſe who had removed him from the Court, under the pretence aforeſaid, were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd to ſee him there, and quickly ſent him an Order to return to his Employment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſay better, to his Exile; although that day, by reaſon of ill weather, the River was difficult and dangerous to be paſs'd.</p>
            <p>The Levies being made at <hi>Santarem,</hi> he did not receive any Orders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Court; but on the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was ſtayed there, that he might be ſent to the <hi>Algarves</hi> to govern that Realm; and if he would not accept <note place="margin">A little Village at the mouth of the <hi>Guadi,</hi> and in the uttermoſt parts of <hi>Algarves.</hi>
               </note> that Employ, they had ordered him to be ſent into Exile to <hi>Caſtromarins.</hi> The King would they ſhould have given him this Employ as a Puniſhment, but the Favourites remonſtrated to him,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58785:96"/>
that it were better to give it him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of a Recompence; but the Count <hi>d' Aveiras</hi> did avert this project, at the entreaty of the <hi>Infante.</hi> So that the Count <hi>de la Torre</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to return to <hi>Lisbon.</hi> So ſoon as he came thither, he went to kiſs the Kings Hand; and in their Diſcourſe it chanc'd that in ſpeaking of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante,</hi> he nam'd him Prince; the King told him, that his Brother was not Prince, only <hi>Infante;</hi> the Count ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">The younger Sons of the Kings of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> are not Princes but by Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> alleadged ſome reaſon to excuſe himſelf, could not however ſatisfie him. As it was put into his Head, that his Brother aſpir'd to the Crown, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that this quality was too near approaching his own, and that it was in ſome ſort to proclaim him King to name him Prince. This apprehenſion, although it were ill grounded, was the reaſon the <hi>Infante</hi> was not ſo ſoon declared as he ought. For with leſs reaſon they had done it to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante Ferdinand</hi> in the time of King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the Fifth, and they had done the like to <hi>Don Jamie</hi> Duke of <hi>Bragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> in the time of the King <hi>Don Emanuel</hi> and the Queen <hi>Iſabella,</hi> when they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58785:96"/>
went for <hi>Spain</hi> to be declared Princes and Heirs of that Crown.</p>
            <p>The Queen going ſome days after the King to <hi>Salvaterre,</hi> found his humour more fierce than formerly; as if the rudeneſs and ſavageneſs of that Country had conttibuted to it. He treated her with ſo much inhumanity, that he made not only her burſt forth into tears, but alſo all thoſe that were preſent. All the time the King was at <hi>Salvaterre,</hi> he went but one time to the Chaſe; which was the more taken notice of, becauſe of the great preparation that was made for that deſign. His ordinary occupation, or to ſay better continual, was to go to the Quarters of his <hi>Patrovilles,</hi> where he paſs'd the moſt part of the days and nights, in Muſick, Collations, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divertiſements according to his humour.</p>
            <p>Theſe Exceſſes which he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this place, and the evil treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Queen there received from him, cauſed ſuch a general diſlike with all the people, that there was no body that would take the pains to juſtifie him. But that which moſt of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58785:97"/>
all alarm'd the Favourites at this time was, that very many people began to render their ſervices to the Queen and to the <hi>Infante,</hi> and to take their parts. To prevent beforehand the miſchiefs they ſaw to menace them, according to the Maxim they had ſo well practis'd, they order'd <hi>Lewis de Souza</hi> to go into the Biſhoprick of <hi>Porto,</hi> of which he was Governour, and <hi>Don Lewis de Meneſes</hi> to go raiſe Troops in the Country of <hi>Feira.</hi> He having demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what had been appointed for him, for his Charge of General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, which he had exerciſed, they refus'd it him, and he could not touch five and twenty hundred Livres which they had conſign'd him for that end.</p>
            <p>The evil intelligence which they ſaw between the King and the Queen <note place="margin">The true cauſe which they da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not yet to ſpeak of, was the Impuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the King.</note> made them loſe all hope of ſeeing Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and made them very preſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demand, that without any delay they ſhould endeavour to marry the <hi>Infante,</hi> which could not but be moſt profitable for the State. The Marqueſſes <hi>de Nizu</hi> and <hi>Sande</hi> repreſented ſo well the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this marriage, that the Favourites preſſed with the force of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58785:97"/>
their Reaſons, perſwaded the King that it was neceſſary; whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, that the Confeſſor of theſe two Princes went to the <hi>Infante,</hi> and told him as from the King, that although God might give him Children, yet it was moſt profitable to increaſe as much as was poſſible the Royal Family, that for this reaſon he would act with him as a Father and as a King, and deſired ardently therefore to ſee him married. That if he had not hitherto been able to accompliſh that deſire, he believed that from his prudence and his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the good of the Kingdom, this propoſition would be very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him; that therefore he ſhould inform himſelf of the Princeſſes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and fix his choice upon her for whom he found the greateſt inclination; and alſo that he ſhould caſt his eyes upon thoſe perſons which he ſhould judg moſt capable of that Negotiation; and as for his part, that all which depended upon him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Concluſion of ſuch a Treaty, ſhould be perform'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> having conſider'd this Affair according to the importance of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58785:98"/>
it, ſent his anſwer in writing by the ſame Confeſſor to the King; in which he thank'd him for the propoſition his Goodneſs had made unto him; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelf intirely to his will; to follow the order which his Majeſty had thereupon made known to him, he ſhould declare his mind, not as a Rule that he ſhould follow, but only as a mark of that Obedience which he would teſtifie on all occaſions. He then made mention of all the Princeſſes of <hi>Europe,</hi> repreſenting to him all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances both of Alliance and Love; telling him alſo, that the Confidence and Veneration which had united his Majeſty with the King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> required, that firſt of all he ſhould ſend to their Majeſties ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ask their Advice and Conſent thereupon; and (having received all neceſſary inſtructions) he ſhould paſs into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> to negotiate that Affair; adding, ſince his Majeſty among the cares of his publick Affairs, would be pleaſed to think of his own particular, he was obliged to let him know, it was impoſſible after a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that nature, but he
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58785:98"/>
would appoint him ſome Revenues, whereby he might be able to maintain the Expences which that condition would charge him with; hoping his Majeſty, without prejudicing the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which ought to be preferr'd to all things, would act with him according to his ordinary Generoſity, which he had made proof of ſo often: In the end propoſing <hi>John de Roxas d' Azevedo</hi> his Secretary, as a perſon who was moſt capable of managing that affair: the King approved of all theſe ſentiments of the <hi>Infante,</hi> giving him hope that he would ſatisfy all his deſires. But the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed for his Majeſty's Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and that of the <hi>Infante</hi> to confer about this buſineſs, there hapned in the mean time accidents which hindred this Conference, and embroiled all the Court.</p>
            <p>A <hi>French-man,</hi> an Officer of the Queens, returning from the Province of <hi>Alemtejo,</hi> was killed by a Carrier, who was purſued and taken in the City of <hi>Canimbre,</hi> and carried to the <hi>Limoriro</hi> 
               <note place="margin">That is the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> in <hi>Liſbon;</hi> but being he was taken out of a Church, (which are Sanctuaries in <hi>Portugal</hi> for all Criminals,) it was for a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58785:99"/>
while diſputed whether it ſhould be a Sanctuary for his life, which was the occaſion that his Proceſs was delayed; and the ſolitude of the place where the Murther was committed, rendred the proofs difficult. At the ſame time there hapned between the Count <hi>de St. Croix</hi> grand Maſter of the Queen's Houſe, and <hi>Pedro d' Almeyda</hi> her Secretary, a difference about their Charges: both of them wrot their Reaſons, and put them into the hands of the Queen, who ordered the Secretary of State to have them examined by two Maſters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; but he waving that order, after he had ſhewed them to all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, carried them to the Council of State, without rendring any account of it to her. Some time after the Queen ask'd the Secretary what was done in thoſe two Affairs? he replied, that as to the firſt, there muſt be ſome clearer proof before the accuſed could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and to the other, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council of State, adviſing her to ſpeak with the Count <hi>de Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melhor</hi> about it. The Queen ſurprized with this anſwer, told him he had not executed her Orders, and that ſhe did
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58785:99"/>
not approve of his councel to ſpeak to the Count <hi>de Caſtle-melhor,</hi> having made a reſolution, by Oath, never in her life to ſpeak to him about any Affair. That he was always againſt her, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd her to ſo miſerable a condition, that it might be called poverty; that for this eight months paſt ſhe had not ſo much as to give an Alms; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, he had the credit of acting for her Intereſts. That they had not conſign'd to her the fifty thouſand Livres which the King had granted her. That beſides, being ſhe was not willing, by reaſon of the neceſſity of the Realm, to require preſently all thoſe things which ſhe might lay claim to by the Contract of Marriage; they ought not at leaſt to fail of paying her that Sum. That this Refuſal would not ſo ſenſibly move her, if it were done for the good of the State, and the eaſe of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it not being juſt, that whilſt many perſons at the Court overflowed with Riches, they ſhould refuſe her the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of that Conſignation; and yet they paid not the Souldiers, retaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly from the <hi>Religious,</hi> the Orphans, the Widows, and the Nobles, their
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58785:100"/>
dues, feoadal Rents, and Penſions; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from her all that paſſed in the State, as if ſhe had not the moſt intereſt next the King: adding further, that they could not but know very well ſhe ſhould have had joy in the Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi> at the Court, ſince they had ſeen her ſolicit it; but they acted in ſecret, ſo that her ſpeaking in the favour of any (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were with the greateſt Juſtice in the World,) was ſufficient cauſe to beget obſtacles, and oppoſitions againſt them: That if ſhe teſtified a deſire to any thing, they made it preſently ſeem a thing impoſſible to be obtained, though before that it had been very eaſy: that likewiſe it ſeem'd as if they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to let all the World know ſhe had no part in the Government. That, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though good manners ſhould teach them otherwiſe, they had neither reſpect or regard as they ought to have for her; and that it was ſo far from being ſo, that ſome perſons were ſo forgetful of themſelves, as not to forbear the giving her affronts, and treating her with ſo much contempt, as ſhe could not but think, by their actions, they would
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58785:100"/>
have her to underſtand ſhe came to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> rather to be their Slave than Queen.</p>
            <p>The Secretary (to excuſe his boldneſs for ſhewing the Conſultation to the Grand Chamber, and carrying it to the Council of State) urged that the Count of <hi>Caſtlemelhor</hi> and his Friends had no other deſign than to ſerve her Majeſty. As to the poverty which ſhe complain'd of, he was not at all the cauſe, that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs not concerning him: that her Majeſty had a Revenue, and according to that ſhe ſhould regulate her Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: that, being the method of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning was a new thing, they would in the beginning find ſome difficulty. He being netled at what the Queen ſaid about the Conſignation, and of the Opulency and great Riches of ſome Perſons, he very imprudently ſaid aloud, that She was deceived by ſome about her, who ſhould communicate to her things of Importance; but having none; they tell her nothing but trifles, which they ought not to do; and for that the Court was full of unreaſonable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, they might fear they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the protection of her Majeſty.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58785:101"/>
As for the Return of the Duke, he was not able to render any account, becauſe that was an Affair that the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had the Conduct of: That though they had not the art of Pleaſing, they had that which was ſufficient to make them render to the utmoſt all thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and Services they were capable of: That they had treated her with ſo much Veneration, as no Queen ever had the Authority that ſhe had, and ſhe was abuſed by whoever told her the contrary: and that ſhe ought to be ſo far from believing ſuch diſcourſes, as rather to puniſh thoſe who ſhould make them. But when he anſwered to the Queen's Complaint, that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her to ſlavery, leaving ſpeaking <hi>French,</hi> which he had done hitherto; he ſaid in paſſion, in his own natural Language, That he was aſſured her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had Flatterers about her, by whom ſhe was deceived; ſhe having no cauſe to complain of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> by whom ſhe was reſpected even to Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Queen replied, that ſhe knew very well how to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals;</hi> for as there were ſome of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58785:101"/>
whom ſhe had cauſe to complain, ſo there were others from whom ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great Conſolation, and that there were not above three or four with whom ſhe was diſſatisfied. That ſhe ſhould willingly take direction about her Revenue, without conſidering that ſome perſons who poſſeſs a part of the Apanage of the Queens of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and who at preſent draw more profit from their Charges, did not do this in the preceding time of other Queens; and that of late it was a crime to ſpeak to her, her eſteem being the cauſe of perſecutions: That by this ſhe did beſt know the intentions of thoſe who treated her ill. That ſhe knew how to diſcern between the good and the ill; that even as ſhe never requeſted any thing contrary to Juſtice, ſo ſhe never oppoſed thoſe favours which they had a mind to obtain for any. After this the Queen commanding the Secretary to ſpeak ſoftly, he anſwered, that if he ſpoke aloud, it was that all the World might hear; upon which the Queen bid him hold his peace, and retire; which he not doing, the Queen ſaw it was not for her Dignity to hearken to him any
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58785:102"/>
longer, and aroſe up to go away, but he took her by the Robe to ſtay her; upon which ſhe (turning towards her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Maids of Honour, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other perſons who were in the Anti-Chamber) ſent forth a Cry with all her force, and ſaid that this was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known thing, and without Example, no King ever treating his Subjects after ſuch a ſort: the King coming, ſhe ſpake to him of it, who promiſed that for her ſatisfaction the Secretary ſhould be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Although the Queen, as we have ſaid, had commanded the Secretary of State to ſhew thoſe Papers concerning the Count <hi>de St. Croix</hi> to two of the Councellors of the Parliament only, they were ſeen by the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and afterwards carried to the Council of State: not contented with this, they would have perſwaded her to have ſpoken of it to the Favourite; but ſhe thought that a baſeneſs unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of her ſelf. Beſides, it was not for want of that they refuſed her the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation which ſhe demanded, for theſe Favourites were abſolute Maſters of all Affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:58785:102"/>
The Queen ſeeing that the King broke his word which he had given her to chaſtiſe the Secretary, was troubled at it to as high a degree as ſuch injuſtice did deſerve. The Common Councel of the City of <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> had a Cuſtom every year to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Feaſt of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> their Patron, by giving the People the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of running at the Bulls. The Queen deſiring to diſſemble that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which ſhe could not hinder from appearing if ſhe ſhould aſſiſt at that Spectacle, thought it better to deprive her ſelf of that divertiſement. The firſt Courſes were already paſt, and they were preparing to bring forth other Bulls when word was brought that the Queen would not come. For this cauſe they feign'd an indiſpoſition in the King to put off the Courſe till the morrow. The next day, and the third day, the Queen not being willing to be there, they were fain to continue the Kings feign'd indiſpoſition. The next day the Queen not being able any longer to endure that her ill treatment by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary ſhould paſs unpuniſhed, ask'd of the King that he might abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58785:103"/>
from Court, with ſo much brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he was not able to refuſe her. This Buſineſs being canvaſſed in the Council of State, it was there reſolved the Secretary ſhould abſent himſelf the Court for ſome days, after which he ſhould be recalled. By this means things were in Peace for a little time, they flattering themſelves with ſweet hopes for the time to come, if Heaven had not chang'd theſe ſeeming fair diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>

                  <p>For on the ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> 1667, the Count de <hi>Castelmelhor</hi> doubled the Guards within and without the Palace, ordering the Cavalry to be lodged neer, and placing the Braves or Foot Patrovils in the Royal Garden, making all the Officers who were there that night arm themſelves, and attend neer the Perſon of the King, and poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Friends from the King's Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even to the Court of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, he ſo well ordered and diſpoſed all things that the Count <hi>de Villa Flor,</hi> and <hi>Lewis de Mendoca</hi> ſhould no ſooner alight to enter the Palace, but they might be fallen upon, and deſtroyed.

He conſidered on the other ſide, if he ſhould any longer endure the injuſtice of theſe Favourites, his Honour was likely to ſuffer thereby; and it might be thought the effect ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his cowardice than modeſty; for they already began to murmur againſt him, as if he were not touch'd either with the publick Intereſt, the Kings, or his own, ſince he ſuffered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to groan under the tyranny of the Favourites, who had uſurp'd the Sovereign Authority.</p>

In this perplexity the <hi>Infante</hi> knew not which way to take, but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to try all fair means, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to put himſelf upon his guard ſomewhat more than he was accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having had advice a little before that they would impriſon him; beſides, the Count <hi>de Caſtelmelhors</hi> Partiſans had ſaid publickly, that if they believed any thing that was violent would be acted againſt the perſon of the Count, it would do well to prevent it, on any one that ſhould entertain ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>

            <p>The Secretary had no ſooner put this Letter into the King's hands, but it was by him put into thoſe of the Count, who upon reading it put all the Palace once again into Arms; not only enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the ordinary Guard, adding to them ſome of the Citizens, cauſing all thoſe in whom he had moſt confidence, to repair to him.</p>
            <p>The Council of State was likewiſe aſſembled by the King's Order, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted there himſelf: and after the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi>'s Letter had been read, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors of State were of two contrary opinions how to find out an expedient to ſatisfy both the Princes, but they were not able to do it, Juſtice being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together on the one ſide, and Authority on the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi>'s Gentlemen whom he had ſent home to their Houſes, being

advertiſed of what paſſed at the Palace, came back in haſte to him, juſt as he had underſtood that the Council of State were ſeparated without having concluded any thing: but he had ſo much confidence in the juſtice of his Cauſe, and Courage, that he diſmiſſed them home again, except the Count <hi>de Vilarmayor,</hi> whoſe week it was.

            <p>The Tueſday following paſt without any anſwer from the King, only at night he ſent the Marqueſs <hi>de Marial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> to tell his Brother, that for very juſt reaſons he had cauſed the Guards of the Palace to be redoubled, with order to ask him, (as from himſelf,) if it would pleaſe him that the Count ſhould come to caſt himſelf at his feet, and kiſs his hands.</p>

As the <hi>Infante</hi> made no anſwer all that day, his remiſneſs raiſed in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite a belief that he was ſatisfied: divers reflections were made on this Buſineſs.

Others were of the opinion that the <hi>Infante</hi> could not forego his pretention, which ſeemed lawful to all the World, that is the Retreat of the Favourite: it being the Propoſition he had firſt made, he ſhould ſtand to it to the end; leſt otherwiſe the Favourite ſhould draw an advantage from ſuch
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58785:106"/>
an impunity, and all the people an evil conſequence of his little ſtoutneſs againſt him, and that they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps believe he himſelf had complained without cauſe, which would much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh his Reputation and Honour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> then not being able to reſiſt the motion of his Courage, ſent word to the King that the Count had put in Arms all the Palace, under a ſeigned pretence of his coming to kill him in his Apartment, which he hoped from his juſtice he would not let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be perſwaded that he ever had ſuch a thought, that he would proceed againſt the Count; as an Impoſtor of that Quality deſerved, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the injury he had done to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. They took time to anſwer this ſecond Complaint as they had done the former.</p>
            <p>The Favourite grown Inſolent to ſee the King took his part ſo highly againſt the <hi>Infante,</hi> reſolved in a Conference which he had with his Friends, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the King to go in Perſon at the Head of all his Councellors of State, Gentlemen, and Officers of the Army to Arreſt him in his Palace, with all
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58785:107"/>
thoſe of his Houſe; and to declare that they were more guilty than he was; that upon this pretence they might make the Proceſs againſt them, to the end that the <hi>Infante</hi> ſeeing himſelf without Followers, might quickly leave off his purſuit.</p>
            <p>The day following the Marqueſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, with an Order in Writing from the King, which contain'd the ſame thing with the former, only he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he hoped by this ſecond ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction things would be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that the <hi>Infante</hi> would find he moſt paſſionately deſired it. But this Billet did not yet ſatisfy the <hi>Infante,</hi> becauſe it let him underſtand that they would bury his Complaint in ſilence; which obliged him to anſwer the next day by another Billet, which the ſame Marqueſs rendered to the King; the ſubſtance of which was;</p>
            <p>That as nothing was more evident than that thoſe Arms wherewith he had filled the Palace, were not introduced but upon ſome ſecret deſign of the Count's, he was content however to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this was done by order of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ſince he would have it ſo; that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58785:107"/>
however he could not pardon the Count, for having called all his Friends to ſecure the Perſon of his Majeſty, he had forgot him, although he well knew he was every way more intereſſed than they were in his conſervation. That to ſee the Count proſtrate at his Feet, was not a ſatisfaction proportionate to his Complaint, ſince at other times the Count cauſed to be made moſt exact ſearch, and had exiled thereupon very Illuſtrious Perſons, upon the only ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition that they had conſpired againſt his favour. It was not juſt, that for the offence had been done againſt him, there ſhould not be the ſame Inquiſitions, and the ſame Puniſhments; and that an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante,</hi> againſt whoſe life they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd, ſhould be worſe treated than the Count, who had only had a ſimple thought that they would have oppoſed his favour. That to give liberty to thoſe that would inform of the Count's Crime, they ought to interdict him from the Functions of his Charges, and remove him from Court, with all the ſecurity poſſible for his Perſon and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, againſt whom he had no deſign, but only to ſecure himſelf. Beſides,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58785:108"/>
that he was not able to go to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to caſt himſelf at the Feet of his Majeſty as he had deſired, to ſee that the tye of Blood which he had in the quality of his Brother, had leſs power over his Spirit than the Amity which he had for a ſimple Subject who was his Miniſter.</p>
            <p>When this Billet was ſent, the City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> was in a great trouble, and alarm, to ſee the Regiments embattell'd in the Grand place of the Palace, the Guards redoubled, the Rounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enforc'd, and the reſt of the Troops in ſuch an eſtate, that it ſeem'd a War was already begun. The <hi>Infante</hi> in the mean time not knowing whether all theſe preparations were made to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright the people, or make an aſſault upon him, under the pretext of hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from executing his pretended Reſolution, was in his own Palace with as much tranquility, as if there had been nothing exrraordinary in that of the King's, truſting to his own Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the Affection of the people.</p>
            <p>But fearing nevertheleſs that his Complaint ſhould be ill interpreted by any, he reſolved to communicate it to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58785:108"/>
all the Tribunals; to the Court of the City, and that of the Four and Twenty; writing to them upon this ſubject, and ſending them a Copy of his Letter and Billet which he had ſent to the King. At the ſame time he ſent to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors of State, to the Grandees, and Gentlemen of the Realm, that they ſhould repair to him; after all which he ſo well inſtructed them in the Cauſes of his Complaints, that even the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans of the Count ſaid, they would themſelves be the Executioners of the Counts Chaſtiſement, ſhould he happen to forget that reſpect which he owed to his Highneſs.</p>
            <p>The juſtice of the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints by this means became ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that there was not one who did not blame the Favourite, in not being willing to juſtifie himſelf; and the King for hindring any from informing againſt him. At laſt the King anſwer'd the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi>'s Billet with another, and ſent it him by the Marqueſs <hi>de Marialva,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Sande,</hi> and <hi>Ruy de Monra Tilles;</hi> the ſubſtance of which Anſwer was:</p>
            <p>That he deſired to know the perſon
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58785:109"/>
by whom he was informed of the Counts intention to kill him; to the end that the Count might be puniſh'd, if they were able to prove he had fail'd in his duty; if not, that the Informer might. Deſiring alſo, that he would have the <hi>Infante</hi> underſtand, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the conſervation of the State and People, that they two ſhould live together in good correſpondence.</p>
            <p>To which the <hi>Infante</hi> anſwered:</p>
            <p>That it had pleas'd his Majeſty to order him to name the perſon from whom he had underſtood the deſign of the Count againſt him; but that he was not able to do that, or to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make it clear, until he ſhould be interdicted of his Charges, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Court ſo long as it ſhould be judged fit, becauſe whilſt he ſhould exerciſe them, &amp; be at Court, it was impoſſible they ſhould be able freely to do any thing againſt him.</p>
            <p>This Billet having been read, the King aſſembled the Councellors of State, the Great Chancellor, the Councellors of Parliament, two Miniſters of each of of the other Tribunals, The Judges of the Crown, the Procurator of the Crown,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58785:109"/>
and that of the Finances, to the end that he might examine with them all the propoſition of the <hi>Infante;</hi> but the night before they aſſembled, they made moſt powerful ſolicitations for the Count, and he himſelf entertained the Judges before they entred into the Council; at which the Miniſters were offended, inſomuch that they would not deliberate before him of his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but only in the preſence of the King, where this Propoſition was read:</p>
            <p>My Lord, the <hi>Infante</hi> having wrot to his Majeſty a Letter, in which he complain'd, that he had not been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of the redoublement of the Guards which they had made in the Palace, and that the Count <hi>de Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melhor</hi> had conſpired againſt his Life, although ineffectually; whereupon he had demanded of his Majeſty, that he would remove the Count from his perſon and ſervice. His Majeſty had declared to my Lord the <hi>Infante,</hi> upon his firſt Complaint, that it was by his Order they had armed the Palace. And as to the ſecond, that he was ready to cauſe the Count to be chaſtiſed as he deſerved for ſo deteſtable a Crime, a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58785:110"/>
greater than which none could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; but nevertheleſs it was firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have proofs againſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and for that end he ſhould name the perſon from whom he had received that advice. The Lord the <hi>Infante</hi> did reſt ſatisfied with what his Majeſty had ſaid in reference to his firſt Complaint; but that did not hinder him from main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what he had urged before in reference to the other; that it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary the Count ſhould be interdicted his Charge, becauſe of the power it gives him, and that he ought to be removed from Court ſo long as it ſhould be judged fit, to the end that all the people might have liberty to examine that affair.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty deſired that they would tell him upon his Complaint, if he may with Juſtice exile the Count, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend him from his Charge, and not rather conſider a more honeſt part of ſatisfaction, which may be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for my Lord the <hi>Infante</hi> from a ſubject of that conſequence: On the other ſide, if there be any likelihood in the accuſation againſt the Count, examining his ſervices, his fidelity, his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58785:110"/>
zeal, and the injury that this may do to his Honour, and to the Honour of his Family, to the end that no man might ſay his Majeſty hath neglected that Juſtice and Prudence with which he ought to act in ſuch affairs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they ſhould conſider, if the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs have received any damage, as well as the Authority of the King; and alſo of what conſequence this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty might be to Strangers, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Enemies of the Crown. And in fine, if this be not enough to take away the fear that the preſence of the Count might give to the Witneſſes, that this affair be examined in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Majtſty, who hop'd from the zeal of his Miniſters, who ought to conſider on this buſineſs, that they would do it with ſuch care as they owed to his Service, to the publick Repoſe, to the adminiſtration of his Juſtice, and to his Glory.</p>
            <p>The great regard that this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſhew'd for the Count, in exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the particular inconveniences of his Baniſhment, without ſpeaking of thoſe which attended the Refuſal of that ſatisfaction demanded by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante,</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:58785:111"/>
let them ſee plain enough, that this Propoſition was deviſed by the Counts Friends. But that which was ſtranger was, that the King who ſhould have at leaſt been indifferent in this affair, appear'd too much intereſted for the Count againſt his Brother. In an affair which concerns the Life of a Prince, one ought to proceed againſt the accuſed upon his Complaint only, eſpecially when he is a Prince of known integrity; and they ought to baniſh a Miniſter, how, conſiderable ſoever he ſhould be, when without it they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be able to manifeſt the Truth; As it hath been always uſed in every Realm: So in our time, for much leſs cauſe, ſome Eccleſiaſticks in <hi>Portugal</hi> were ordered to retire themſelves into certain places, before that any thing could be verified againſt them, not regarding any thing that might exempt them from exile. Beſides, it was not the intention of the <hi>Infante,</hi> to have the Favourite exiled, but only abſent for ſome days.</p>
            <p>They then gave their opinions upon this Propoſition; ſome of the Miniſters ſaid, that the <hi>Infante</hi> was not a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince, and that therefore by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58785:111"/>
his Affirmation was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Proof. That the Retreat and the Suſpenſion which he demanded, was not only a ſhameful Chaſtiſement to the Count and his Kindred, but unjuſt, ſince his Crime was not yet proved. That it ought not to be ſuffer'd it ſhould be ſaid in the World, that the Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Realm ſhould conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perſon of the <hi>Infante,</hi> and by that give our Enemies and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-Nations abroad, cauſe to think there is a diviſion among the <hi>Portugals.</hi> That the King ought himſelf in perſon to enquire into this affair, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Inqueſt proceed againſt the Count. Others judg'd it could never fall into their imagina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> that there ſhould be any <hi>Portugal</hi> capable of a Crime ſo hainous as that was of which the Count was queſtioned. That the Complaint of the <hi>Infante</hi> was aſſuredly made on a diſtruſt ill grounded, which might be remedied by admitting him to the Government and to Council.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Martin Alfonſo de Mello,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of the Inquiſition, <hi>Pedro Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandes Monteiro</hi> Councellor of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>John de Roxas d'Aſevedo,</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:58785:112"/>
were of opinion, the Favourite ought to be removed; by reaſon that ſo long as he ſhould have the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Favourite, no one could have the free liberty of acting againſt him. If he ſhould be found guilty of the Crime of which he was accuſed, he ought to be chaſtiſed; and if he ſhould be innocent, be forthwith ſent for, and re-eſtabliſhed into his Charges with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. But the King leaned to the other opinion, under colour that it had the greateſt number of Voices.</p>
            <p>The Concluſion was drawn in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that it might be ſigned by the Miniſters, but ſome of them refuſed it, this not being ſuch an affair where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the Judges ought to ſign the Concluſion; ſo that there ought to be another Aſſembly, in which every one ſhould ſeparately give his opinion in writing, Thoſe who did this, were <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon Rodrigues Pacheco,</hi> nominated to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Elvas; Franciſco de Miranda Anriquez,</hi> Councellor Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick of the Grand Chamber, <hi>Pedro Fernandes Monteiro, Martin Alphonſo Mello, Matheus Melinho,</hi> Procurator of the Crown, and <hi>John Roxas d'Aſevedo,</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:58785:112"/>
who were followed by <hi>Duarte Vas d' Oſorio,</hi> Councellor of the Finances. <hi>Domingo Autunes Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph de Souſa de Caſtelbrancha,</hi> all three Councellors of the Inqueſts.</p>
            <p>The King ſent this Concluſion to the <hi>Infante</hi> by the ſame Councellors of State, with order to tell him, That to conform himſelf thereunto, he ought not to baniſh the Count from his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time he made the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men about the <hi>Infante</hi> be ſent for, with all the Nobles, and Chiefs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Orders, to whom he ſaid, that the Miniſters of State, and the higheſt of them, had given him Councel not to remove the Count, as the <hi>Infante</hi> demanded of him, and that this affair was not the Counts, but his own; and in order to this which had been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in Council, he expreſly forbid ſome Gentlemen's going to the Palace of the <hi>Infante</hi> without his leave; and to others in covert words, fearing left they ſhould ſay he would not permit the Noblemen to frequent his Houſe. By which he left them in doubt what to do; if they went to the <hi>Infante</hi>'s
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58785:113"/>
Palace, he had wherewitnall to accuſe them, if they went not, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he had forbid them. Some of them deſired of the King to know the cauſe of this prohibition, but he not having been inſtructed for ſuch a queſtion, made no direct anſwer, only ſaying he would have them near his perſon. The Gentlemen of the <hi>Infante,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who were preſent, anſwer'd, they knew very well, that the buſineſs in which they acted, was truly the affair of his Majeſty, in being that of the <hi>Infante</hi>'s, and that the zeal which they both had for the publick, made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in their intereſts; but the King ſaid, that was not the reaſon which made that affair to be his own.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe differences the King had ſent for the Judg and Recorder of the People, and although they had already wrot in favour of the Favourite, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain commanded them to uſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, with menaces in caſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted his Order. After which he ſent Couriers into all the Provinces, advertiſing the Governours, that the buſineſs of the <hi>Infante</hi> was not ſo much for his advantage as they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58785:113"/>
publiſh in their Quarters: To the Navies, an Order to withdraw from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and wrot to the Count <hi>St. John,</hi> that neither he nor any other whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould go out of his Province without order. This perſwaded the <hi>Infante,</hi> that the deſign was laid to make war upon him both by Land and Sea; ſo that having known by all theſe ſigns there was no more hopes for him of Juſtice againſt the Count: He preſented a new Requeſt to the King, ſupplicating him, that he would once more give order to examine this Affair, which was expreſſed in theſe Terms.</p>
            <p>It hath pleaſed your Majeſty to let me know by the Councellors of State, the Marqueſs <hi>de Marialva,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Sande,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ruy de Moura Telles;</hi> that you have reſolved never to conſent to the removal of the Count <hi>de Caſtelmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor,</hi> which I demanded to facilitate the juſtification of my Complaint; and this Reſolution is grounded upon the advice of Noble perſons, whom it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your Majeſty to conſult. Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty deſires, that I determine and make my Anſwer preſently, becauſe the State
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58785:114"/>
may not continue in the trouble it is. Although I ought to conform my ſelf to whatever it hath pleaſed your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to reſolve upon (as I have not been wanting to do in all my actions), there remains nevertheleſs Liberty to demand of your Majeſty, that it will pleaſe you to examine my requeſt a ſecond time for good and all, ſince this hath been done in affairs of leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there is more reaſon it ſhould be permitted in this, the conſequence of which is the loſs of an <hi>Infante,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Brother to your Majeſty, and your Majeſty's moſt faithful Servant.</p>
            <p>I infer Sir, from this Reſolution, that the Count will not clear himſelf but with Arms in his hand, and without depriving himſelf of that Authority which your Majeſty hath given him leave to take, appearing to day with greater luſtre than ever he had done before, deſigning by it to caſt a terror on the ſpirits of the people, &amp; to decide by violence a civil affair; for he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an aſſembly to be where they might collect their opinions by the noiſe of Drums, and ſo little attention, that ſome did not ſo much as underſtand
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58785:114"/>
the Propoſition that was made to them, as it is eaſie to be remarked in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations that they made. Thoſe alſo who gave their opinion in favour of the Count, did it on foundations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the end and motive of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, becauſe I did not demand that the Count ſhould either retreat or be exiled without ſecurity; but only a ſuſpenſion from his great power, to the end, that if during that time he be found guilty, he might loſe both his Honour and Life; and on the contrary, if he juſtifies himſelf, he may conſerve both the one and the other, with all his Charges. This proceeding, Sir, lets us ſee with what precipitancy they have acted, who examined the grounds of this affair; there having been more of ſolidity in the opinions of <hi>Martin Alfonſas de Mello, John de Roxas d'Aſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedo,</hi> and <hi>Pedro Ferdinand Monteiro;</hi> theſe laſt named having ſeen by the experience of twenty-ſeven years, a great many Crimes which they have examined of high Treaſon, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by very intelligent in that matter. Doth not <hi>Franciſco de Lucena</hi> furniſh us with an example, againſt whom the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58785:115"/>
only of ſome particular Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was found ſufficient to put him into Priſon; and yet they will not allow mine to be ſufficient to gain an Order for the Count to retire for ſome days, although he ſhould leave for his defence his Kindred, his Friends, his Creatures, and your Majeſty himſelf. He thinking it better to ſuffer this blot upon his Honour and Reputation, than to expoſe himſelf to the danger of the Iſſue, and engage you to declare that the cauſe was your own, than to ſtand to the trial of the truth. By this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution your Majeſty hath let us ſee the Intereſts of the Count are inſeparable to the Crown, to the prejudice of the only <hi>Infante,</hi> and the only Succeſſor your Majeſty hath at this day, or that you ſhall have until thoſe ſhall be born which I expect ſhall break that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. As if the Intereſts of an <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> ſhould be different from thoſe of the Crown, when he meddles with thoſe of a Favourite, whoſe boldneſs is gone ſo far, as to perſwade your Majeſty to order all thoſe Gentlemen whom I uſe to ſee at my Palace, to come there no more, becauſe there runs a report, that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58785:115"/>
I have made my complaint to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But this pretence which he hath taken, the better to hide his pernicious intentions, is taken away, and ceaſes by the obedience of theſe Gentlemen. He would have it believ'd, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty cannot be a King, if he ſhould be at any time removed from about your Majeſty, although it were but for ſome days; believing this the beſt way to leſſen my Glory, and that of all the Nobles of the Realm; Arming againſt me, as he at preſent doth, Horſe and Foot, doth it not juſtifie my former complaint? And although your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty believes, that what hath paſs'd was for another cauſe, the event will let you know, that it was only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by which he abuſes your Majeſty. For in fine, it muſt needs be, that I am the object of all this Tumult, or they have not diſtinguiſh'd me from thoſe againſt whom they Arm. If it be the firſt, is there any thing more offenſive? If the other, it muſt be, that they have not counted me in the number of thoſe whom they meant to defend; elſe wherefore did they not advertiſe me to think of my ſecurity? wherefore did they ſend none
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58785:116"/>
to defend my Palace? wherefore never did they impart to me the cauſe for which they took up Arms? And laſtly, why this precaution of redoubling the Guards? It is againſt the <hi>Infante,</hi> Sir, it is againſt the <hi>Infante</hi> that the Count <hi>de Caſtelmelhor</hi> takes Arms in the eyes of all the Nobles, and of all the people of the Realm; raiſing trouble in the State, and terror in every ſpirit, ſo that none may have liberty to do any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But however it is not Arms that can diſmay the <hi>Infante Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro;</hi> for if they ſhould have the power to affright him, he would tear open his Veins to let out that Blood which was not anſwering to his Birth, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Kings his Predeceſſors. I ſay this, Sir, for fear that any ſhould believe, if I ſhould retire, I go to look for ſuccour. The Count hath put this buſineſs in ſuch terms, that both of us cannot be ſafe; and it muſt be, that I periſh, or he be removed. That which gives me a moſt mortal grief is, I too plainly ſee your Majeſty would rather conſent to the loſs of me than the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the Count; ſacrificing to his Violence, my Life, my Officers,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58785:116"/>
and all thoſe that take my part; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing me by this preſſing neceſſity (which I have forſeen without being able to ſhun) to go ſeek for a Retreat, ſeeing well that this is the only means to reſtore tranquillity to the publick; for which I would ſacrifice all my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and my own Life if need be; this way the State will be deliver'd from the noiſe of War, and the Count enjoy in repoſe, without apprehending the diſturbance of that felicity which makes him ſo inſolent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> had no ſooner ſent this Letter to the King, but he began to think he ſhould execute the deſign of his Retreat, &amp; being deſirous to ſerve the State and the Realm in giving proof of his Courage, even when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to abandon it wholly, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to depart for the Province of <hi>Tras os montes,</hi> which he judged moſt proper to his deſign; becauſe the Count <hi>de St. John,</hi> firſt Gentleman of his Chamber was Governour there, and his two brothers <hi>Michael Carlo de Tavora,</hi> and <hi>Franciſco de Tavora,</hi> were the one of them General of the Artillery, and the other Serjeant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58785:117"/>
of the Field. But fearing equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaſt the violence of the King, and the zeal of the People ſhould bring any obſtacle to his Voyage, he reſolved to go away ſecretly.</p>
            <p>The King let paſs two days without making any anſwer to the <hi>Infante,</hi> and then ſent him this.</p>
            <q>My moſt honoured and moſt beloved Brother, I the King ſend to ſalute you, as him whom I very much love and eſteem; I have ſeen the Letter which which you have wrought to me the <hi>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of this Month, which lets me know, that I am obliged to you for confirming your ſentiments to mine; this informs me, that you are not ignorant that all the Reſolutions I take are advantagious, both for me and you. I love you as my ſon: and if I ſhould have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, that were enough to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me to a thouſand good wiſhes for you; as to the particular buſineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which you wrote, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſent to let you know, that I was ready to do you Juſtice, ſo ſoon as I ſhall be inſtructed which way to do it; as to your deſign of retiring, I would have you change it, and come to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58785:117"/>
me; I ſhall always have my Arms open to receive you with that love which I ought to have for a Brother, upon whom I look as upon my Friend, my Son, and my Succeſſor in the Realm, ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe God to give me no other; in which caſe I ſhall take much Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation if God permit you to ſucceed to my Crown, and that when-ever it ſhall pleaſe his Divine Majeſty.</q>
            <p>This Letter as full of diſſimulation as of tenderneſs increaſed the <hi>Infante's</hi> diſtruſt, and the more, becauſe it was not the Kings manner to act thus with him, and obliged him to make this Anſwer:</p>
            <q>Not having the power to obtain of your Majeſty, that they ſhould examine my complaint anew, and that upon better informations than the former; although it be of ſuch conſequence, that it is not unknown to your Majeſty, or to any in the Realm; I conclude from that Reſolution of your Majeſty, that you would bury in forgetfulneſs the demand which I have made to you; taking from me, by this means, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ever parting from it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I render my moſt humble thanks
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58785:118"/>
to your Majeſty, for the Goodneſs which you have expreſſed towards me in the laſt Letter which you were pleaſed to write me. If I do not go in perſon to do it, I have for it an excuſe ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that I hope your Majeſty doth judg it ſo, ſince your Majeſty hath given ſuch Authority in your Palace to a man who is not only accuſed to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured the taking away my Life, but who hath made himſelf guilty in oppoſing the clearing himſelf from that accuſation. After this, can there be any ſecurity for me, although I am the only <hi>Infante,</hi> and your Majeſty's Brother? But I conjure your Majeſty, to give credit to the ſincerity of my heart, when I aſſure you, that in whatever place I go, I ſhall always reſpect your Majeſty as my Father, and ſerve you as my King and Lord. God conſerve your Royal Perſon, and give to you long and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py years.</q>
            <p>Many of the Miniſters, among whom ſome were Friends to the Favourite, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try all their force to keep the <hi>Infante.</hi> The Queen deſiring the ſame thing, ſent to know of him by her Confeſſor, Father <hi>Francis de Ville,</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:58785:118"/>
if he deſired ſhe ſhould be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatrix between the King and him; and if he thought good to defer his departure, whilſt they ſhould labour for ſome accommodation. The <hi>Infante</hi> accepted her offer, and ſent to thank her for the Favour ſhe had done him; ſaying, he would not depart, ſince ſhe had order'd it ſo. After this anſwer of the <hi>Infante,</hi> which was but by word of mouth, the Queen ſent a Billet by <hi>Pedro Fernandes Monteiro,</hi> which was:</p>
            <p>
               <q>That ſhe was very much obliged to him for accepting her Mediation, and deferring his Voyage. In caſe the King yeilded the Count ſhould go away from the Court, after what manner his Higeneſs would have it done, what place of retreat, and what ſecurity ſhould be given to him. And as the <hi>Infante</hi> ſaid, that after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the Count, he would remit his intereſts into their hands, ſhe deſired that he would better explain himſelf upon that point. To which the <hi>Infante</hi> anſwer'd:</q>
            </p>
            <q>That he hop'd by the reſpect was due to Royal Authority, ſhe would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what he had ſo often aim'd at that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58785:119"/>
he asked to come only to that point ſhe was arrived at. That his Majeſty might chuſe a place for retreat of the Count where he pleaſed, provided it were at a diſtance, as it ought to be on ſuch occaſions; and that he was wholly ready to execute all that which her Majeſty ſhould ordain, in reſpect of aſſuring to them the perſon of the Count, ſubmitting himſelf alſo ſo ſoon as he ſhall be gone from the Court, to all that it ſhall pleaſe her Majeſty.</q>
            <p>As the Queen deſired to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date this buſineſs, ſhe had no ſooner received the Anſwer of the <hi>Infante,</hi> but ſhe wrot to him.</p>
            <q>That the Reſolution of his conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſentiments, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable to her; that ſhe demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him an aſſurance ſigned by him for the perſon, and for the honour of the Count, ſo ſoon as he ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from Court; and that he would never more ſpeak of his complaint. They promiſing him on their ſide, that the Count ſhould go away as ſoon as they ſhould have this aſſurance; for he deſired nothing more than his Favour. And beſides, that he might
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58785:119"/>
quit the Court with the leſs embroile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the would of himſelf lay down the charge of <hi>Eſcrivaon de Puridade.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>To this Billet, which they judged to be dictated by the Favourite, the <hi>Infante</hi> made this Anſwer:</p>
            <q>That proſtrate at the feet of her Majeſty, he rendred her a Thouſand moſt humble Thanks for the Honour and the Favour which ſhe had done him, in employing her Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the accommodating that affair; that he had ſent her the Aſſurance in the form it had pleaſed her Majeſty to ordain him: That in reſpect to what her Majeſty had declared to him in her laſt Billet, he hoped ſhe would act after that manner ſhe ſhould judg moſt fit for the ſervice of the King her Lord, the conſervation of the State, and the repoſe of his Subjects.</q>
            <p>This Billet was accompanied with that of the Aſſurance, which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the Queen in theſe terms:</p>
            <q>So ſoon as your Majeſty was pleaſed to take notice of this affair, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me ſtraitly to execute all that you ſhould be pleaſed to preſcribe; and to ſatisfie you of that which your
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58785:120"/>
Majeſty demands of me, as to the Aſſurance for the Perſon and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Count, I do engage my Faith to your Majeſty that I will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize nothing neither againſt the one or the other. And to the end the Count may know what the Mediation of your Majeſty is able to do, I am willing to bury my Complaint in perpetual ſilence, as if it had never been thought on. God preſerve your Majeſty, and grant you many happy years.</q>
            <p>In the mean time the Favourite made an attempr to carry the King into <hi>Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tejo,</hi> where the Army was; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition pleas'd him at firſt, but when it came to the execution, he found the King chang'd, he not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to his divertiſements, which ty'd him to <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was very late at night when the <hi>Infante</hi> ſent to the Queen the Billet with the Aſſurance for the Count, which he no ſooner had receiv'd, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, accompanied with the Cavalry, into a Religious Covent in the Province of <hi>Arabida,</hi> ſeven Leagues from <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi> After this Retreat it ſeem'd that all things would be at peace; but it
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58785:120"/>
it did not happen ſo, becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite did ſtill govern the King; which appeared chiefly in that the King did not receive the <hi>Infante</hi> as he had hoped he would, and as he had made him believe, for he did not ſo much as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one word to all his civilities, nor to all his acknowledgments. It was agreed, they ſhould not ſpeak of that which was paſs'd, the King did ſomething more, he would not ſo much as ſpeak of any other thing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> having demanded of him permiſſion to render his Duty to the Queen, he was contented only to make him a ſign with his Head.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Infante</hi> propoſed to himſelf the going often to the Palace, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get by his aſſiduity the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the King. Thoſe whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt it was he ſhould not come there at all, broke his meaſures; ſo that the Queen (knowing the averſion which the King had for the <hi>Infante)</hi> ſent him word, that he ſhould not preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the King, fearing leſt there ſhould happen any broil between them.</p>
            <p>After this the <hi>Infante</hi> was eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that they had fram'd ſome dedly
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58785:121"/>
deſign againſt him, eſpecially when he ſaw that the Souldiers which they had made to come to the Palace, were not ſent away, and that they had poſted ſome Companies of Foot near his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. The Company of the <hi>Patrovils</hi> belonging to the King alſo ſaying, that one morning they ſhould ſee the Heads of thoſe cut off, whom they ſhould arreſt over night; made him judg they intended to do ſo to thoſe who were of his Party, and ty'd to his Intereſts.</p>
            <p>There ran alſo at that time a report, that there had hapned a very unlucky Accident to <hi>Henry Anriquez de Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> of which he was very ill. Some ſaid he himſelf had cauſed this report to be ſpread; however whether this ſickneſs was true or feigned, for ſome days the King went every night to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with him of all things, as with him that had taken the place of the Count; this made them believe it was he who did ill offices betwixt the King and the <hi>Infante,</hi> making the King ſo bitter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and being told, ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ſo tranſported with choler againſt him, that they were gone to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58785:121"/>
ſearch for him, intending his death. The King would have had him come to the Palace, but he thought it better to retire himſelf and quit the Court, leaving the King in the hands of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio de Souſa de Macedo,</hi> and of <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel Autunes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two Favourites finding it fit for their purpoſe to cauſe the <hi>Infante</hi> to come to the Palace, made their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions known to all the Court, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting the King be ſeen in it. To this end they ſent to tell him, as from the Queen, by the Count <hi>de St. Croix,</hi> Grand Maſter of her Houſe, that the Council was to aſſemble at ſuch a day, and the Queen would be very glad if he would be there. But as he thought upon the Advice which the Queen had given him, this Order which was brought to him in her behalf by the Count, was ſuſpected; he therefore thought beſt to write to the Queen a Billet, which was carried by the ſame Count <hi>de St. Croix;</hi> of which this was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</p>
            <p>
               <q>That on the <hi>22th</hi> of the ſame Month of <hi>September</hi> ſhe had ſent to him by the Count <hi>de St. Croix,</hi> an Order to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58785:122"/>
from coming to the Palace, to the end that there might not arrive any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to diſpleaſe the King, which might cauſe an unhappy difference betwixt the King and him. That this Order which was not brought to him but with the Kings conſent, had moſt ſenſibly touch'd him, ſeeing that preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had granted him the honour to come and caſt himſelf at his feet, he had forbid him to preſent himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majeſty, which was to him a moſt rigorous puniſhment, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving committed any fault that ſhould merit it, except the incertitude where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was, not knowing after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſhould act to pleaſe the King, might be called one. That things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe terms, he did ſupplicate her, that ſhe would pleaſe, whilſt there was yet time to examine the danger to which he expoſed himſelf, if he ſhould not give ſatisfaction to the King, ſince that the laſt Order which ſhe had ſent him did not diſengage him from the former, which was general, and of which the cauſe was not yet ceas'd; at leaſt that he had no intention to treat him as a Councellor of State,</q> which he could
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58785:122"/>
not comprehend, ſince that a Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of State could not give Councel to a King, he having an averſion for him that gives it. That he hop'd ſhe would ſeriouſly conſider the two Orders of their Majeſties, and that ſhe would not blame his irreſolution, which aroſe from the profound reſpect he had for them; and that in the end ſhe would know it was neceſſary the King ſhould give him liberty of going to the Palace, to the end he might be always near their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, which was the only thing that he deſired, to be ever in a condition of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, as his Duty engaged him.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they waited for the <hi>Infante</hi>'s anſwer, they ſent to him ſeveral times ſome of the Pages of the Chamber, to let him know that he ſhould come to the Councel; but as they came not from the King, nor with the ordinary Formalities, he would not go. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites ſeeing this Artifice was unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to them, they made uſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they made the King write a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Infante,</hi> which they ſent him by <hi>Antony de Mendoſa</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> containing theſe words:</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:58785:123"/>
Moſt honoured <hi>Infante,</hi> my moſt beloved and moſt eſteemed Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I the King wiſh you health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have judg'd it convenient to order you by this Letter to come to ſpeak with me this day; and I ſhall be glad that it be preſently, becauſe I would teſtifie to you publickly (as being a thing that is but juſt that all the world ſhould know) that I have your perſon in that eſteem which I ought, as your King, your Brother, and your Father, whoſe place I hold. Alſo you may act near me, after the manner that you have demanded by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of the Queen, whom I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour above all Queens, as my moſt beloved and moſt eſteemed Wife.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> having reflected on this Letter, doubted yet whether he ſhould go to the Palace, although the King had ſo order'd him; but having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that after he had declared he did not go to the Council becauſe he was forbid, if he ſhould not now go at this time when he was recall'd with honour, they would ſay it was his mind to be ſeparated from the King. To hinder this, he went thither, but
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58785:123"/>
was received with the ſame coldneſs as formerly.</p>
            <p>But even in the middle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt that was raiſed againſt the <hi>Infante,</hi> there was ſtirr'd up another more furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt the Queen. <hi>Antoniy de Souſa de Macedo,</hi> Secretary of State, ſolicited his re-eſtabliſhment, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt that he might be permitted to appear in the Palace, where all the world knew he was hid. The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already made for that ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the Queen let him know that it ſtood not with her Honour he ſhould return ſo ſoon; upon this they would not at this time preſs the matter any further.</p>
            <p>Sometime after he ſpake again of it to the Queen, which made her to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, that he might by his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power cauſe him to return, but it ſhould never be by her conſent; ſo that they were obliged to approve of the Repeal of the Secretary by the ſame Council of State who had order'd his Exile. This was no ſooner done, but they ſent this Concluſion to the Queen, which ſeem'd to have been dictated by the Secretary, the diſcourſe being the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58785:124"/>
ſame with that of the conteſtation he had with her. And as all that which hapned afterwards in the State, drew its original from the Complaint of the Queen, it is very convenient to render publick the Concluſion; which was in theſe terms:</p>
            <p>
               <q>The conteſtation that the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Antony de Souſa de Macedo</hi> hath had with the Queen our Soveraign; having been propoſed to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſcribing Miniſters, conforming to that which he hath repreſented, and the Princeſs remonſtiated to us, in that he did forget the Reſpect he owed to her, it hath ſeemed to us (altho the Secretary hath juſtified himſelf that he had no ill intention to the Queen our Soveraign, and that his intention was but to perſwade her Majeſty, that the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation had no other intention than to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her Majeſty, and not to treat her as ſhe had complain'd) that the King our Lord, ought to order the Secretary of State to retire himſelf from Court for ten or twelve days, and that during that time <hi>Antonio de Cavide</hi> exerciſe his charge, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58785:124"/>
remonſtrate to the Queen our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign that he doth this only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her, on condition however that ſhe henceforward never engage her ſelf in the like conteſtations, becauſe of the evil ſequels which may happen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in the State, as affairs ſtand; and that this advice may ſerve as well for the preſent as for the time to come.</q> At <hi>Lisbon, Aug.</hi> 31. 1667.</p>
            <p>This Decree was no ſooner ſeen by the Queen, but for anſwer ſhe ſent this Letter to the King, who was at the Council, by <hi>Emanuel de Souſa de Silva,</hi> Superintendant of her Houſe.</p>
            <q>I have not been able to repreſent to your Majeſty and the Council of State, the juſt ſubject of my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no more than the ſtrange mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of my complaint, becauſe that even to this preſent they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly concealed from me the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that had been made upon this ſubject; but having in the end ſeen it, that which it contains hath caſt me into an extraordinary aſtoniſhment; had I had ſooner notice of it, I had at firſt repreſented to your Majeſty the injury my Honour hath thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58785:125"/>
in remonſtrating the juſtice of my Complaint. But aſſoon as I knew what the Councel has determined, notwithſtanding all the aſſurance that I may have as Queen, I complain to your Majeſty with all the humility of a Subject; demanding of you that Juſtice which might be expected by any particular perſon, againſt the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity which <hi>Anthony de Souſa de Macedo</hi> hath calumniated me with, in aſſuring moſt maliciouſly the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of State, that in the Conteſtation which he had with me, I ſhould ſpeak againſt the whole. Nation of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugues;</hi> although he knows very well, as I do alſo declare unto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who ought to believe the Faith and Word of a Queen, that I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak to him but moſt obligeingly of the Sentiments and Intereſts of the Nation: and that it was only againſt the proceeding of <hi>Anthony de Souſa</hi> and two or three of his Friends, who had treated me unworthily, that I ſhewed any reſentment: For, in fine, can any one behold a thing more aſtoniſhing, than the boldneſs of this man, who dares upon a ſuppoſition
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58785:125"/>
that has not the leaſt likelihood of Truth; and upon a groſs lie, fill'd with Calumny, ſolicit and obtain ſecretly a concluſion of the Councel of State ſo injurious to a Queen; ſince it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that my Heart hath not been touch'd with any thing more, than with the marks of Love, Reſpect, and Compaſſion, which on all occaſions have been paid to me by all the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> whom I eſteem and love as my Children; and that it is only the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and cruelty of two or three who oblige me by their Inſolencies to treat them as my Capital Enemies. After all this, my Lord, after I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and proteſted, as I do again, that I ſhall never for the time to come, be able to ſee a man who hath by arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and under colour of a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, obtained againſt me a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſo odious, and from which they have framed an Act ſo ſcandalous, full of reprehenſions and menaces, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly proſtrate at the feet of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, I do demand of you reparation and ſatisfaction upon my Complaint, and that you will be pleaſed to ordain <hi>Anthony de Souſa de Macedo</hi> adjudg'd
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58785:126"/>
and puniſh'd according to the Rigour of the Laws eſtabliſhed againſt thoſe guilty of High-Treaſon; and that above all things, that he declare, that what he hath remonſtrated to the Councel, is falſe, and demand pardon; ſince he hath therein offended God, your Majeſty, and Me, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, whom he hath alſo deceived, as well as Juſtice, which he hath abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with divers lies, and malicious ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; and that there may be an Act made of this beginning of Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and that it be inſerted in the place of that deteſtable Concluſion in the Regiſtry of the Councel of State.</q>

to retire from about his Perſon; ſo that on the 5th. of <hi>October</hi> 1667 the <hi>Infante</hi> went to the Palace, followed by the moſt part of the Nobility, and by a grand concourſe of the People.</p>
                  <p>The King was yet in his Chamber, which obliged the <hi>Infante</hi> to attend with ſome Councellors of State, with whom being entred, he ſpake to the King with very much vehemency; nevertheleſs without loſing the Reſpect which he owed him; but the King fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a rage, cry'd out in a fury that they ſhould give him his Sword; the <hi>Infante</hi> had no ſooner heard that, but he drew his half way out of his Belt, and preſenting the Guard to him ſaid, my Lord, if it is againſt me that your Majeſty asks for a Sword, diſpoſe of mine; if it be againſt any other, ſuffer me to defend your Majeſty. But the King would not take it, only continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his cries.</p>
                  <p>The Queen, who knew nothing of this enterprize, ran to the Chamber of the King trying to appeaſe him, by reaſons and prayers; but ſhe was not able to gain any thing upon him, being perſwaded they had killed the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58785:127"/>
Secretary, (although they did aſſure him he was not ſlain) ſaying he would not believe it unleſs he ſaw him, which obliged the Duke <hi>de Cadaval</hi> to go fetch him from the Chamber where he had ſhut himſelf up, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might ſatisfie the King that they had done him no violence; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had much a-do to keep him ſafe, for bringing him to the Kings Chamber through the crowd of people, they had kill'd him, if the Duke turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf about to thoſe who had that deſign, had not ſaid to them with an angry countenance and imperious tone, that he was his Conductor.</p>
                  <p>The preſence of the Secretary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a little appeaſed the King, the Queen retired, and alſo the <hi>Infante.</hi> Upon this there was heard a Voice that cry'd oftentimes, <hi>that all would be well.</hi> The ſame Voice having called on the Queen and the <hi>Infante,</hi> the King went out of his Antichamber with them, having the Secretary by his ſide, going to a window which looks into the grand Place of the Palace, where the people ſeeing him, cry'd out oftentimes, God ſave the King. After this the King
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58785:128"/>
withdrew thorow the people, who had fill'd the Antichambers, thoſe who went before him ſaying, he pardon'd all the people, which offended them ſo much (thinking that they had committed no fault) that <hi>John Maſcarenhas</hi> Count of <hi>Sabugal</hi> was fain to tell the King, that they would not have a Pardon but Thanks. The King who did not well hear thoſe laſt words, repented he granted them Pardon; but having at laſt comprehended that the Count refuſed it, and that he asked of him only his Thanks, he replied, he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both the one and the other. But that which moſt of all aſtoniſh'd the people was, to ſee him in the midſt of this trouble and importment fall to playing upon a Flagelet, it very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſo grave a perſon to do ſo. This boyiſh divertiſement and his cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out were remark'd as an unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing in the mind of a King, and imputed to the default of his Organs.</p>
                  <p>This ſucceſs, ſo different from what they had imagined, made them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch an indignation againſt the King, that they ſaid aloud, they ought to take from him the Crown, and give
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58785:128"/>
it to the <hi>Infante:</hi> inſomuch that one pronounc'd theſe words, <hi>Either take it your ſelf, or we will take it for you;</hi> but the <hi>Infante</hi> growing angry, made him hold his tongue with his look. As it was the deſign of the <hi>Infante</hi> to make the Secretary leave the Palace, he reſolv'd to lie there that night to finiſh the Work he had begun; but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary fearing it would be fatal for him, ſent to tell the <hi>Infante,</hi> that if he did not leave the Palace that very moment, it was becauſe he could not do it in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and that he would not fail to depart aſſoon as it was night; for which <hi>Laurence de Souſa de Meneſes,</hi> Count <hi>de Santiago &amp; Don Pedro D'Almeida</hi> Admiral of the Realm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Sureties. <hi>Emanuel Autunes</hi> ſent at that time to demand the ſame Grace, which was likewiſe granted him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had merited a more ſevere Chaſtiſement. This man, who had been the Son of a Sexton to the Church of <hi>Miſerecorde de Vilavicioſa,</hi> had paſſed from the Charge of the Repoſtery to that of Groom of the Chamber; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, the King had granted him the Order of St. <hi>Jaques,</hi> and ſeveral
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58785:129"/>
other Favours; it was he that made the ſecret diſpence, but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the profuſion of it, had rendred this private expence too publick. The near acceſs that he had with the King, came from the ſervice that he rendred him in his ſecret pleaſures, his boldneſs was ſuch, that at all times he intermedled with the Affairs of the <hi>Infante</hi> and the King. Upon theſe aſſurances the <hi>Infante</hi> withdrew to his own Palace, followed by the greateſt part of the Nobility, and an innumerable concourſe of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>The King the next day ſeeing neither the Secretary nor <hi>Emanuel Autunes,</hi> judged well that they were gone away; upon which he demanded to have them chaſtiſed, for going away without his conſent; ſending an Order to all the Superiors of the Covents in the City, to let him know, if they were retired into any of them, and making all the places near to be ſearch'd by <hi>Gonſalo de Coſta de Menoſe,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph de Souſa Cid,</hi> but they could be no where found. But at laſt, having heard that <hi>Emanuel Autunes</hi> was gone into <hi>Alemtejo,</hi> he ſent <hi>Diego Lewis Ribeira Soares</hi> with
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58785:129"/>
an Order to <hi>Dennis de Mello de Caſtro,</hi> Maſter of the Camp, General of that Province, that he ſhould find him out, and having found him, to remit him into his hands. So ſoon as <hi>Soares</hi> was return'd, the King briskly ordered him back again to ſearch again, ſaying he was reſolved to put off the Feaſt of the <hi>Bulls</hi> until he returned; ſo that thoſe Animals ſtaid many days, and the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridos</hi> ſtood many Months in the great Place of the Palace, not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable loſs: the Souldiers that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd there either burning or break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as they had need of them, or as their fancy took them.</p>
                  <p>The King was not only in a rage againſt the Secretary and <hi>Emanuel Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> for going away, but alſo againſt all thoſe who contributed to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and particularly againſt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante;</hi> upon which, having advice, he abſtained from going to the Palace. In the mean time the <hi>Infante,</hi> and the moſt zealous for the publick good, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's Exchequer emptied by ſo many profuſions, and exceſſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; and that the raiſing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions were very difficult, and that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58785:130"/>
through all this expedition of the Wat was hindred, they were afraid the return of theſe Favourites, which the King ſo obſtinately deſired, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Realm a Prey to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. To avoid this therefore, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to call together the three Eſtates of the Realm. The Winter-ſeaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſt for this purpoſe, becauſe of the ceaſing of the War, they judged it not amiſs forthwith to cauſe the Councels of the Cities to act it. That of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as it was the moſt conſiderable of all others, preſented to the King the firſt Remonſtrance; in which, after they had moſt amply ſhown their Reaſons for aſſembling the States, they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him their Convocation. As the Name of the States gave an offence to the King, he took this Remonſtrance without communicating it to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, publiſhing that he would not have them called together; for he knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well wherefore they would have them called, for all along they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him that the Aſſembly of the People was ſome leſſening the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Kings: and if the three Eſtates ſhould joyn with his Brother againſt
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58785:130"/>
him, how could he be able to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? And if they ſhould enterprize any thing againſt his perſon, how could he avoid it? Foreſeeing this, he would give no anſwer to the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the City, however preſſing they were; and for the moſt part he would not ſo much as hear them. And if he had appointed them a time to come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his reſolution, he would very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomly hold his peace. Sometimes he would have the States called, and ſometimes he would not; ſo that the Common Council of the City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> diſpairing to obtain any anſwer from the King, wrote to all the others, and to all the Chapters of the Realm, to give them an account of that which had paſſed; and repreſented to them, that it was very convenient for the publick good, to demand from the King the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the States: But they could do no more with him than they, and the more preſſing they were in perſwading, the more inflexible he became.</p>
                  <p>The Council of State being aſſembled, the King, Queen, and <hi>Infante</hi> being there, it was unanimouſly agreed, that without aſſembling the States General, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58785:131"/>
of the Kingdom could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied. But the King took this for a Conſpiracy againſt him, and would not yeild to a Remedy that ſhould give him ſo much fear; and gave ill words and injurious ſpeeches to thoſe who would have given him that Council, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd very much of his Authority.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Sande</hi> preſented a Memorial to the Council of State, in which he did remonſtrate to the King, that he ought to treat with more love and reſpect than he had hitherto done ſo illuſtrious a Princeſs as his Queen was; and the <hi>Infante</hi> with that civility and regard, which the Quality of an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Brother to a King required. That he ſhould ſuffer them to be near him, who might jointly govern the State with him, and not as he had hitherto done, put it into the hands of a Favourite. That it would be more glorious for him and all the <hi>Portugals,</hi> that he gouern with the help of Royal Perſons, who had as well as his Majeſty all qualities neceſſary for it, than to ſuffer a Subject to do it, who had not only rais'd himſelf above all other Subjects, but who would yet raiſe himſelf above him. That by conſequence
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58785:131"/>
there was an indiſpenſable neceſſity the Eſtates of the Realm be Convocated, ſince they were obliged to give ſome remedy, how violent ſoever it might be, being he would not give them any other.</p>
                  <p>The Councellors of State approv'd this Remonſtrance, and having ſign'd it to authorize it, they carried it to the King; but he inſtead of taking notice of their good will, condemn'd it as cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, and conceiv'd a mortal hate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Author. But the Miniſters of the State ſacrificing all their reſentments to their Countries good, they had ſo much patience that they brought it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout notwithſtanding the wilfulneſs of the King, who conſented at laſt to aſſemble the States, on condition it ſhould not be till his return from <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre,</hi> whither he was reſolved to go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to cuſtom, on the <hi>19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     </hi> of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> the year following, and to return on the <hi>14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     </hi> of <hi>February.</hi> Without this they had loſt the opportunity of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying an evil that would admit of no delay. At the ſame time it was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King deſign'd to leave the City with his Braves of his <hi>Pratroville,</hi> and to join himſelf with his Favourites and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58785:132"/>
their Partiſans. This was confirmed by the advice they had, that he had diſtributed Horſes to his Querries, and ſtop'd many Barques which were in the Harbour before the great place of the Palace, and at a place called <hi>Grilo;</hi> which gave a ſuſpicion that he had a deſign to paſs into the Province of <hi>Alemteijo.</hi> But all theſe projects va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, either through the care of the <hi>Infante,</hi> or by the negligence of the King.</p>
                  <p>As they had been forc'd to come to a kind of Battel with the King, to make him conſent to the Convocation of the States, ſo it was not without much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Miniſters had obtained from him it ſhould begin on the firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1668. But then when the Commiſſioners were expedited for the Council of the City, he would not ſign them, although he had ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Queen ſeeing they took no conſideration of her Complaints, took a generous reſolution not to ſuffer any longer ſuch contempt. So long as they did not loſe the reſpect they ow'd to her perſon, ſhe knew how
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58785:132"/>
to diſſemble; but ſo ſoon as ſhe was perſwaded the King did not love her as his Spouſe, nor conſider her as a Queen, and by his Example the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites deſpiſed her; ſhe then had ſo much reſentment, that ſhe reſolved to let all the world know that which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſhe had hid with prudence and moderation.</p>
                  <p>The Queen uſed oftentimes to viſit the Nunneries in the City, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of <hi>Eſperance</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> in which were many Ladies of great Quality. The <hi>21th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1667, ſhe left the Palace with her ordinary Train to go to this Covent. So ſoon as ſhe was entred there the firſt thing ſhe did, was to write this following Billet to the King, which was carried to him by the Count of S. <hi>Croix.</hi>

ſhe had to them, and the paſſion they had teſtified for her, in being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of her misfortune. This reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution extreamly ſurpriz'd theſe Ladies, and they could by no means be made to leave her, ſtaying there all that night, and a good part of the next day. At laſt there ſtay'd none in the Covent to wait on her but <hi>Dona Antonia de Silva,</hi> her Lady of Honour, and <hi>Dona Antonia Mauricia de Silva,</hi> and <hi>Dona Iſabella Franciſca de Silva,</hi> her Maids of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The Ladies however viſited her in the Covent, with the ſame exactneſs and aſſiduity as they had done when ſhe was at the Palace.</p>
                  <p>The King had no ſooner heard the Billet read which was ſent by the Queen, but he deſcended from the Palace, and mounting briskly into his Coach, cauſed them to carry him immediately to the Covent, accompanied with all thoſe who were to go with him on hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for he was going to the Chaſe when he received this Letter from the Queen. He made them knock at the Gate with fury, when the <hi>Infante</hi> came thither with ſome Gentlemen to hinder any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. The Queen was mightily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58785:134"/>
at the innumerable crowd of all ſorts of people who were got together; and when ſhe heard that he called for Harchets to break open the Gates, ſhe fell into a ſwound. And the King had without doubt broke them open, if the <hi>Infante,</hi> with ſome Councellors of State and ſome Gentlemen, had not divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him.</p>
                  <p>The King was ſo little concerned at all this, that he forgot it when it was night; for in the morning when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, he ask'd as if there had not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd any thing extraordinary, whether they had given Provendor to the Bulls, which he always kept in the grand place of the Palace for ſport. The Queen the next day after her retreat, ſent to deſire the <hi>Infante</hi> to come to her, which he did with the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Having her ſelf told him her reſolution, he anſwer'd her with all the tenderneſs that her Quality and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Condition which ſhe was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to, required: After finding the King, he ſaw he was extreamly anger'd at the motion of her retreat, and he would maintain with much paſſion, and in very diſhoneſt terms, that he was
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:58785:134"/>
more a man than they thought for.</p>
                  <p>The Queen having at the ſame time cauſed the Councellors of State, and the moſt conſiderable Officers of the Crown to be called, ſhe declared to them the cauſe of her retreat into that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and the reſolution ſhe had taken to return into <hi>France,</hi> after that ſhe had made her Marriage to be declared null by the care of the Duke <hi>de Cadaval</hi> her Procurator; then ſhe wrot to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Cathedral Church in <hi>Lisbon</hi> this, which follows.</p>

                  <p>The Queen ſent into <hi>France</hi> to give notice of the eſtate of Affairs by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicur Verjus</hi> Envoy in the Court of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> on the part of the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> a Gentleman very much eſteemed for his Worth, and for his rare Accompliſhments. So ſoon as this Proceſs was begun to be framed, and the King's inability became to be publickly talk'd on, and of which no body doubted, the people began to wiſh that the <hi>Infante</hi> might Eſpouſe the Queen. And this deſire was grounded vpon very many Reaſons, but chiefly on the Virtue and the prudent Conduct of this Princeſs, which had gained her
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58785:136"/>
the Eſteem of all the People. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this Marriage was not without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſince that in <hi>Poland, John Caſimir</hi> had ſucceeded to the Crown, and to the Wife of <hi>Sigiſmond Caſimir</hi> his Brother, <note place="margin">Lewiſa Marie de Gonzague.</note> and the City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that the Queen <hi>Dona Eleanor</hi> Widdow of the King <hi>Don Emanuel</hi> ſhould be Married to King <hi>Joh.</hi> the <hi>13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                  <p>Although the King had knowledg of all theſe Negotiations, they were not able to make him conſider with himſelf: But on the contrary, he acted, and ſpake with ſo much indiſcretion, that there was no body who did not believe they ought to employ theſe laſt remedies againſt his ill Conduct.</p>
                  <p>This ſo urgent a neceſſity obliged the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:58785:136"/>
Councellors of Eſtate, the Nobility and People of <hi>Lisbon</hi> to conjure the <hi>Infante</hi> that he would take upon him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, becauſe the Kingdom was in War, and full of Troubles, the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to govern, and the Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into a Nunnery; and therefore there was great reaſon to ſubſtitute the <hi>Infante</hi> in the place of the King.</p>
                  <p>The Common Council of the City and of the Four and twenty, having ſent their Deputies to the <hi>Infante</hi> to demand of him permiſſion to proclaim him Regent in the Palace; and if he would not yield to it, they would do it againſt his mind; he anſwered them, that they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate whether it would be convenient they ſhould accompany him to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Caſcars</hi> thruſt on by his Zeal and his Age, went the next morning to the King; when he was in his Antichamber, the Grooms of the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe told him he was yet in Bed; but approaching to him, told him it was time for him to awake, and if he did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leave that Lethargy, out of which he had awaked him, he would in a very little time loſe a Kingdom which he had
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58785:137"/>
already ruined by his negligence and incapacity: that it were better to do that of his own motion, which he would be made to do by force. That he ſhould ſend to ſeek for the <hi>Infante</hi> his Brother, and to put into his hands the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was the only way he had to conſerve the Crown.</p>
                  <p>This Remonſtrance was immediately followed by that of the Counſellors of State, who made theirs publickly to him, and repreſented to him, that after he had left the Government of the State to his Favourites who had ruin'd it, he at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent had abandoned it altogether, there being none that would intermeddle with it, unleſs he himſelf would act in it. But he was nothing moved neither with the one nor the other: which obliged the Duke <hi>de Cadaval</hi> to preſs the <hi>Infante</hi> on the part of the Counſellors of State, to go to the Palace to begin his Regency.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 23. 1667, the <hi>Infante</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Common Council of the City, the Chamber of the Four and Twenty, the Nobility, and an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of people, entred into the Gallery of the Palace; and from thence he entred with the Counſellors
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:58785:137"/>
of State into the Antichamber of the King; where, after a ſhort Conference had together, they Arreſted the King in his Chamber, by making faſt the doors, without touching him any other way.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> preſently named for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State Dr. <hi>Pedro Vieira de Sylva,</hi> who had been Secretary to the King <hi>Don John,</hi> and to the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who having taken his place, the Motives of this change were read, and approv'd of in the firſt Aſſembly of the Council of State. The next thing agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated was, in what place they ſhould put the King, and after what manner he ſhould be ſerved: It was then conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he ſhould be kept in his Apartment, and ſerv'd by thoſe perſons who ſhould be moſt agreeable to him; and that he ſhould want nothing either for his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or pleaſure, or the Dignity of his Character. But he treated with ſo much cruelty thoſe who ſerv'd him, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Gentlemen came to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Employment.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt the <hi>Infante</hi> was yet in the Council of State, <hi>Antonio Cavide</hi> brought to him this, which was wrote in his own hand, and ſigned by the King.</p>

The <hi>Infant</hi> having granted to the King all that he demanded, they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited the Diſpatches neceſſary for it; but he would not accept the Crown, of which the King would have made a Ceſſion. As they had judg'd it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that the King ſhould not go out of the Palace, the <hi>Infante</hi> reſolved to ſtay there alſo, with thoſe Councellors of State, and a great part of the Nobility and People, who would not leave him. The King as he lay in his Bed, ſent to <hi>John dos Caes</hi> to have a care of his Dogs, which was his ordinary employ, and which griev'd him in ſuch ſort, that he could not refrain from Tears. We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this, though but little conſiderable, that you may thereby judge the better of the Spirit of the King, and whether he was capable to govern the State.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Infante</hi> had made known to all the Realm that which had hapned, he ſigned the Letters which were writ in the King's Name, to call together the States on the firſt of <hi>January.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Act which the King, ſince he was arreſted, had ſent to the <hi>Infante,</hi> gave him power to take upon him the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of King, which the greateſt part of

Theſe Miniſters aſſembled themſelves according to the <hi>Infante</hi>'s Order, and ſome days after they wrote their Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. When it was read in the Preſence of the <hi>Infante,</hi> of his Gentlemen, and ſome other Perſons of Quality, whom he had moſt Confidence in, they found that the greateſt part of the Voices were, That he ſhould not make uſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, and that he ſhould not take upon him the Title nor the Quality of King; which gave him a very great Contentment, becauſe this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was according to his Deſires; and moreover, this delivered him from the Importunities, which he ſuffer'd under every day, upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>The Procurators of the Chapters, and thoſe of the Greater and Leſſer Cities of the Realm being arrived, the three Eſtates aſſembled themſelves in the Great Hall of the Guards, where the <hi>Infante</hi> was ſolemnly declared Prince, by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Authentick Act, conceived in theſe Terms:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We Swear, and Declare upon the Holy Evangeliſts, which we touch with our Hands, That we do acknowledge and receive for our</hi>

And that we will obey thorowly and wholly all his Orders and Judgements, Soveraign and others, making for him War, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Peace with his Allies; and that we will not obey any other King, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any other than Him. And all this which is above ſaid, we ſwear and proteſt to God, and to this Holy Croſs, and to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evangelists, upon which we lay our hands, we will obſerve and keep fully and wholly;</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:58785:141"/>
               <hi>and in ſign of our Obedience, and of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of this Royal Soveraignty, we Kiſs the Hand of his Highneſs here preſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Oath had been made to the Prince, every one of the three Eſtates began to aſſemble themſelves in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: That of the Nobles, in the Colledg of St. <hi>Roch;</hi> that of the Commons, in the Covent of the <hi>Religious</hi> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>Francis;</hi> and that of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, in the Covent of St. <hi>Dominick.</hi> The firſt day of their Aſſembling, the Prince ſent to each of the States the ſubſtance of this Act, with the Diſmiſſion of the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I deſire that you may ſee in the Aſſembly of the People, the diſmiſſion of the King, where'tis inſerted, and that it ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by you, as well what hath been paſs'd, when I took upon me the Government, as the Reaſons that mov'd me to do it, and to take upon me the Quality of Curator of my Lord the King, and that of Regent of theſe Realms, by vertue of which I have cauſed his Royal Perſon to be arreſted. And becauſe theſe two things might be juſtified by</hi>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:58785:141"/>
               <hi>this Act, I pray this Aſſembly to approve them, and to Declare whether I ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Government with this Title, or whether you think good that I ſhould take any other; and in that Caſe what it ought to be. If your Concluſion be found conformable to that of the other Aſſemblies, as I hope it will, I ſhall after that ſwear to maintain the Laws and the Priviledges of the Realm, in the accuſtomed manner; after which alſo you ſhall make to me an Oath of Fidelity and Obedience, during the time I ſhall have the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Body of the Nobleſs is compoſed of Thirty Great Lords, Councellors of the King, Lords of Caſtles, Lands and Territories, the chiefeſt of their Rank. That of the People, is of Two Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Burgeſſes, from every City of the Realm, who have a deliberative Voice, which they call definitive; and that of the Eccleſiaſticks, of the Biſhops, and Prelates of the Realm: And in default of thoſe who fail at ſuch a time, of the Procurators or Deputies of their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:58785:142"/>
The Decree of the Prince was read in all the Chambers of the States. In that of the People, almoſt all the Deputies declar'd him King; in that of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and that of the Eccleſiaſticks, there was nothing Concluded. But when theſe two laſt were aſſembled a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, after they had examined the Concluſion of the People, which had been carried to them by the Marqueſs of <hi>Marialva,</hi> and <hi>Pedro Monteiro Fernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> Proctors for the City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> they approved of the Regency in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Eccleſiaſtick, conformable to the Decree; and they demurred upon it in that of the Nobility, for that they would conſider it, and it being not only an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of State, but alſo a Matter of Right, they would firſt of all hear the Opinion of thoſe that were better vers'd in the Law, before they ſhould be capable to reſolve. That which was carried to the other two Chambers, by the Duke of <hi>Cadaval,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Prado,</hi> were both caſt out; but it being done at firſt tumultuarily by that of the People, they preſently proclaimed <hi>Don Pedro</hi> King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:58785:142"/>
The Prince having underſtood the Concluſion of the Aſſembly of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and that the Learned Perſons who were to be Conſulted with about it, were Father <hi>Nuno de Acunha</hi> the Jeſuit, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Valerius de St. Raymond,</hi> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Preaching Friars, Father <hi>Francis Ferdinand Sueiro,</hi> of the ſame Order, Friar <hi>John de Mello,</hi> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Hermites</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial of that Order, <hi>John Vello Baretto,</hi> Grand Chancellor of the Realm, <hi>Emanuel Delgado de Matos,</hi> Doctor in Law, <hi>Lewis Gomes de Baſto,</hi> and <hi>Duarte vas a'orta Oſorio,</hi> Councellors of the Finances, and <hi>Chriſtopher Pinto de Paira:</hi> He ſent to tell them by <hi>Franciſco Correa de la Cerda,</hi> his Tutor, That it was not his Intention to be King, but only that he might give ſome Comfort to the Realm, which he did believe he might do with the Title only of Regent; that they ſhould give their Opinions upon that Queſtion, with all the Liberty that an Affair of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence demanded.</p>
            <p>All but <hi>Emanuel de Matos,</hi> and <hi>Duar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te d'Oſorio,</hi> who could not be there to give their Opinions, becauſe they were
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:58785:143"/>
ſick; and the Great Chancellor, whoſe Opinion was, that Don <hi>Pedro</hi> ſhould be declared King, gave their Opinions, that he ſhould let alone the Title of King to Don <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſo long as he ſhould Live.</p>
            <p>After that theſe Learned Perſons had declared their Opinions, the three Eſtates deliberated apart; and it was Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Aſſembly of the Eccleſiaſticks, &amp; in that of the Nobility, that the Prince ſhould not take the Quality of King: But that of the People Concluded, that he ſhould take it, not only for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it, but alſo for the Security of the State.</p>
            <p>The Prince was equally ſatisfied with them Both, and witneſſed to them his Acknowledgments. But the Anſwer of the Prince was not enough to make them ſilent, who adjudg'd to him the Crown; and they maintained their Sentiments ſo much, and oppoſed that of the others, with ſo ſtrong Reaſons, that the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on became very difficult to be decided, by thoſe who ſhould Judg of it without paſſion. The Conteſtation paſs'd ſo far,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:58785:143"/>
that the Prince fearing leſt they ſhould Declare him King by a publick Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was forced to hinder the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of the People when he went abroad, to imploy all the Perſons of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, who accompanied him. Moſt Princes uſe to ſolicit the People to be Kings, but this Prince on the contrary ſolicits them that he may not be one; which is a moderation, which made him be yet more worthy of that Title.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Summer, 1667. there was made a League offenſive and defenſive, between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> againſt <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> by their means aſſuring them of a diverſion in their Favour, enterpriſing a War againſt <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs was very ſurpriſing; and it had been very advantagious, if the Prince's Allies to either Crown, had not put a ſtop to the ſwiftneſs of their Arms. Monſieur <hi>de St. Romain,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigny,</hi> who had been Envoy in <hi>Portugal,</hi> for the negotiating that League, having had Order to let the Prince Regent know of the Accommodation that was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that he ſhould ſend ſome one to

aſſiſt therein, he conſulted his Miniſters of State what was beſt to be done in this Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>They were ready to name for that purpoſe a Plenipotentiary, when the Count <hi>d'Olivares,</hi> who had been Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ever ſince the Battle of <hi>Canal</hi> in the Caſtle of St. <hi>George,</hi> gave notice, That he had power from the Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> to accommodate the differences between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> This was a great Obſtacle to that Negotiation of the League, which was concluded betwixt <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> If Monſieur <hi>de St. Romain</hi> turn'd all his thoughts to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perſwade the <hi>Portugals</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a new Alliance againſt <hi>Spain;</hi> the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> on the other ſide forgot nothing that might hinder it, to the end not to loſe ſo fair an occaſion of making one Peace that might produce another, and render the Conditions more advantagious. So that having obtained by their Importunities, and the new Advantages which they offer'd the <hi>Portugals,</hi> ſo much, that they brought it about, that the King of <hi>England</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd his Mediation, and <hi>Edward Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> his Embaſſadour

Extraordinary in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> paſſed thence into <hi>Portugal.</hi>

            <p>But as in this Incounter there was a neceſſity of one of theſe two things, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to content <hi>France</hi> at the Charge of <hi>Portugal,</hi> or to manage the Intereſts of <hi>Portugal</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>France;</hi> the <hi>Portugals</hi> choſe the laſt. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their repoſe was more ſtrongly preſſing on their minds, than any other thing; and the more, for that the Realm had need of reſt after a diſturbance of five and twenty years. The Three States, the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and that of the Four and Twenty, made their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances to the Prince ſo preſſing, that he could not reſiſt them. He na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then for to act in this Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Duke of <hi>Cadaval, Vaſco Lewis de Gama</hi> Marquis <hi>de Niſa,</hi> the Marqueſſes of <hi>Gonrea</hi> and <hi>Marialva, Henry de Souſa de Tavares de Sylva</hi> Count <hi>de Miranda,</hi> all of them Councellours of State, and <hi>Pedro Vieira de Sylva</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State. All theſe Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, being aſſembled with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>d'Eliche,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> who had power, one of them to make
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58785:145"/>
the Treaty, and the other to be the Mediator; after many Conferences, it was at laſt concluded, the 13 <hi>Febr.</hi> 1668, and publiſhed the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following.</p>
            <p>Although this Peace, ſo glorious for the Prince, had encreaſed the love that the <hi>Portugals</hi> had for him, yet he was not ſeen to grow proud with theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, nor would uſe this occaſion to get the Kingdom, as he might have done. But on the contrary, it was at this time that his modeſty more apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew'd it ſelf; for ſeeing that the People redoubled their importunity to make him accept of the Scepter, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled his reſolution to refuſe it. And indeed, if under the Reign of the King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the <hi>Portugals</hi> had gained a Battle at <hi>Elvas,</hi> another at Mount <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros,</hi> a third at <hi>Canal,</hi> &amp; a fourth at Caſtle <hi>Rodrigo,</hi> all the part that he had in it, was under the Fortune of his Generals; for the Marqueſs of <hi>Marialva,</hi> the Count <hi>de Villaflor,</hi> and <hi>Pedro Jaques de Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes</hi> had all that Glory. But the Peace which was better than all theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, ſince that it rendred to the Realm that Calm it had ſo long breath'd
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58785:145"/>

in the Palace Royal with the King her Spouſe, for the ſpace of ſix Months, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him a Conjugal life; but dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time it appear'd they two having tryed to Conſummate the Marriage, they could not effect it, although they had uſed all their Care and diligence requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite thereto; and this becauſe of the Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Prince, which proceeded from an Infirmity which he had in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and which is at preſent altogether incurable. Which doth more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently juſtifie them, by thoſe means approved of by the Canon Law, ſo that the Impediment is held at leaſt to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſſured, after which there is no need of Inſpection, nor of greater proofs, as that of three years, or of any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Term. All this having been examined, by all the Acts Conformable to the Laws it is Judged, That the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between the ſaid moſt Serene Prince and Princeſs was Contracted in Fact, and not in Law, and that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Nul; and that the ſaid Prince and Princeſs may diſpoſe of their perſons as to them ſhall ſeem good, and make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of their goods according to the form of their Contracts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:58785:147"/>
This Sentence having been pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Saturday</hi> before <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> the Queen ſent to declare to the 3 States the Reſolution ſhe had taken to return into <hi>France,</hi> demanding at the ſame time that they would reſtore to her the dowry ſhe had brought with her. The 3 States having underſtood this News with much trouble, and conſidered that this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for the Rare perfections of Mind and Body, which Heaven had beſtow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, and for other conſiderations was moſt worthy of the Prince <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> each of the States made a Memorial, which they ſent to him repreſenting the Reaſons which made them deſire this Marriage. The Common Councel of the City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> having done the ſame thing the Prince anſwer'd to them all, That, he was ready to do what ſhould be Judg'd beſt for the Intereſt of the Realm.</p>
            <p>After that the ThreeStates had received this Anſwer, they and the Common Councel of the City went to make the ſame Petition to the Queen, that ſince the Nullity of her Marriage, the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals</hi> did deſire ſhe would eſpouſe the Prince, and they hop'd the felicity of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58785:147"/>
this ſecond Marriage would repair the misfortune of the firſt, in giving them Succeſſors to the Crown. This Princeſs being touch'd with the violent paſſion of the People of the Realm, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to reſiſt their preſſing deſires, was willing to Content them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing her own Country. After this the Prince gave Notice of this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Councel of State, who not onely approv'd of the Marriage, but they beſought him that he would inſtantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it. For this end the Marqueſs of <hi>Niſa</hi> and <hi>Don Rodrigo de Meneſes</hi> were named Proctors for the Prince, and the Duke of <hi>Cadaval</hi> and the Marques of <hi>Marialva</hi> for the Princeſs, who drew up the Articles of Contract between them.</p>
            <p>But when this Marriage was divulged, there began to ariſe a doubt, if with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation this Contract might be lawfully and effectually made and conſummated without a diſpenſation. But as they had choſen a great many Learned perſons, to reſolve this Queſtion, Monſieur <hi>Verjus</hi> arrived from <hi>France</hi> with the Brief of Diſpenſe, which took away all doubt and ſcruple that they might have about it. So that the Marqueſs <hi>de Marialva</hi> as Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58785:148"/>
for the Prince, and the Duke <hi>de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daval</hi> as Proctor for the Princeſs, were by vertue of the Brief, and their Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations eſpouſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Targa</hi> in the <hi>Oratory</hi> of the Palace; and on the ſecond of <hi>April,</hi> which was the next day after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> a little after Noon the Prince accompanied with his Grandees, and all the Lords and Noblemen of the Court, went to the Queen in the Covent of <hi>Eſperance,</hi> from whence they went to the Quinte of <hi>Alcantara</hi> followed by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable multitude of People, who witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their good Will to this Marriage, where they received the Nuptial Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction by the hand of the ſame Biſhop.</p>
            <p>After this, thoſe who had been of the Opinion for the Crowning the Prince, made once more an attempt upon him; but he was no more to be ſhaken now than he was at other times, he only let the Three States know, that on the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1668, He would take his Oath to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Laws of the Realm, and he would then receive from them theirs of Fidelity. This day being come, they all Aſſembled in the Great Hall of the Guards, where that Ceremony was done with all the Pomp requiſite thereunto,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58785:148"/>
and the Prince took his Oath in theſe Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do ſwear and promiſe, the Grace of God aſſiſting, to rule and govern well and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, and to adminiſter to you Juſtice in all Caſes, as far as the frailty of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will permit, and to keep and preſerve your good Cuſtomes, Priviledges, Graces, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſes, Liberties, and Franchiſes which hath been given, granted, and Confirmed by the Kings my Predeceſſors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Three States of the Realm took theirs in theſe Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We ſwear upon the holy</hi> Evangeliſts <hi>which we touch with our hands, that we do acknowledge and receive for our Governour and Regent of theſe Realms becauſe of the perpetual Impuiſſance of his Majeſty, as we have adjudg'd, the moſt High and moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince,</hi> Don Pedro, <hi>Legitimate Son of the King</hi> Don John <hi>the Fourth, and of the Queen</hi> Dona Lewyſa <hi>his Wife, Brother and Curator of the moſt high and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent King</hi> Don Alphonſo <hi>the ſixth, and his True and Natural Succeſſor to theſe Realms.

               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:58785:149"/>
               <hi>as we are of the Prince</hi> Don Pedro <hi>we make to him Faith and Homage in the ſame manner as we have made to the King</hi> Don John <hi>the Fourth his Father, and to the King</hi> Don Alphonſo <hi>the Sixth his Brother, (whom we do at this preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive of his Government becauſe of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity) with the ſame Jurisdiction, Power and Authority, that any of the Kings and Lords of this Crown have ever had: and wee will obey fully and wholly all his Orders and Judgments be they high or be they low Juriſdictions, and we will make War with his Enemies for him, and entertain Peace with his Allies as it ſhall pleaſe him, without obeying any other King but him. All this aboveſaid we ſwear to before God, by this Croſs, and by the Holy</hi> Evangeliſts <hi>which we touch with our Hands to obſerve on our parts fully, and wholly. And as a Mark of our Submiſſion and Obedience; and of our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his Royal, &amp; Soveraign Jurisdiction, we kiſs the Hand of his Highneſs here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Oaths being made, all the Diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches began to be expedited in the Name of the Prince as Governour &amp; Regent of the Realm, in the ſame form as had been formerly done when the Infante <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> Count <hi>de Bologn</hi> was made Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernour

            <p>After this Act the Three States conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to deliberate about the Affairs of the Realm until the Firſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1668. when they ſeparated.</p>
            <p>This change was approved of by all the People, excepting ſome perſons who had no reaſon to approve of it, becauſe of their Intereſt. In truth, the depoſing the King <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> was maintained not only by thoſe Reaſons which have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, but for many others which they were willing to have Concealed; beſides, the ſame thing hath happened hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Portugal</hi> in the Perſon of <hi>Don San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> the Second.

                  <q>Having ſeen the <hi>Brief</hi> of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which hath committed to us the Judgment of the Impediment <hi>publicae honeſtatis,</hi> upon the Diſpenſation which it makes mention of, and the Articles of Juſtification, and the proofs which hath been given thereto, as well as all the Inſtructions &amp; Certificates which have been joyntly made thereupon, it appears That, the moſt Serene Lord, Don <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the Sixth, King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:58785:155"/>
and <hi>Algarves,</hi> being married to <hi>Maria Frances Iſabella de Savoy,</hi> the ſaid Princeſs preſs'd in Conſcience, to purſue in Juſtice the Nullity of the ſaid Marriage which ſhe had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Fact with the ſaid moſt Serene King, becauſe of the perpetual Inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which was in his Perſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate the ſaid Marriage, and that indeed he had not conſummated it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Sixteen Months that they had lived together as Man and Wife. Which Cauſe was pleaded before the Vicar-General of the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> and other Judges nominated by the Chapter of the ſaid Archbiſhoprick, before whom it in right lay, in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the ſaid Sea. It appears, that the Cauſe was proſecuted, even to a definitive Sentence, by which the ſaid Marriage contracted between the ſaid King and the ſaid Princeſs was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Null, becauſe of the aforeſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Inability of the ſaid Lord and King Don <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> to conſummate the ſaid Marriage with the ſaid moſt Serene Princeſs <hi>Maria Frances Iſabella de Savoy.</hi> It appears, that this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was publiſh'd, and judiciouſly
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:58785:155"/>
ſignified to the ſaid Lord the King Don <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who declared in Terms, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Regiſter of thoſe Acts, That he was willing it ſhould be executed, and that he did not at all deſire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal; which Declaration hath been ſigned by the King himſelf. It appears, that the three Eſtates of the Realms of <hi>Portugal</hi> and the <hi>Algarves,</hi> who were at that time aſſembled at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> did propoſe to the moſt Serene Prince Don <hi>Pedro</hi> Regent of the Realm, and did ſupplicate him to Eſpouſe the moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Princeſs <hi>Maria Frances Iſabella de Savoy,</hi> to give repoſe to the State, and to ſecure the Royal Succeſſion; and that alſo they did make the ſame Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the ſame Prayer to the ſaid moſt Serene Princeſs. It appears, that for the Impediment <hi>publicae Honeſtatis,</hi> the moſt Serene Prince Don <hi>Pedro</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being able to Contract this Marriage with the ſaid Princeſs, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the moſt eminent Cardinal <hi>de Vendoſme,</hi> Legat <hi>à Latere</hi> to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and of the Holy Apoſtolique Sea with the moſt Chriſtian King of <hi>France,</hi> to the end that he might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:58785:156"/>
with that Impediment <hi>publicae Honeſtatis.</hi> It appears, that this <hi>Brief</hi> of Diſpence was directed to the Vicar-General, or to the Official of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and that it was preſented to the Biſhop of <hi>Targa,</hi> who at that time officiated the Functions of the ſaid Archbiſhoprick; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Power therein given him, and with all the accuſtomed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, did diſpenſe with the ſaid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment <hi>publicae Honeſtatis</hi> of the ſaid Prince &amp; of the ſaid Princeſs. It appears, that by vertue of this Diſpenſation, and with the Truſt and Confidence thereof, the Lord Prince Don <hi>Pedro</hi> was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the Rule of the Holy Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to the ſaid moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Princeſs <hi>Mary Frances Iſabel</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and that they did Conſummate the Marriage, of which there already is born one Daughter. It appears, that the ſaid Prince and the ſaid Princeſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married in good earneſt, and in the face of the Church, and living toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Conjugal Life, for the greater ſecurity of their Conſcience, to the end to deliver it from ſcruple, and the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58785:156"/>
State from trouble, they had recourſe to his Holineſs, that he might approve, confirm and ratifie the ſaid Marriage, and take from them all Scruples that might ariſe; which Grace his Holineſs afforded them, by the Brief above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, recommending this Affair to Judges, who are therein named, to the end that they finding juſt the Requeſt of the ſaid Prince and Princeſs, they might, after they had made full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and all neceſſary Informations, to diſcover the Truth of the Facts, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it was founded, diſpence with the ſaid Impediment <hi>publicae Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtatis,</hi> of the ſaid Prince and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and of all other Impediments that might happen, cancelling, abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating, and declaring null the Tye and Bond of the former Marriage, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted between the moſt Serene Lord, the King Don <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and the ſaid moſt Serene Princeſs, Dona <hi>Maria Frances Iſabella de Savoy.</hi> The whole being ſeen and conſidered, and chiefly in conſideration of the Brief hereunto annexed, by the Apoſtolick Authority to us committed, we do hold our ſelves
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58785:157"/>
bound faithfully, at the Requeſt of the ſaid Prince and Princeſs, to juſtifie them. So that conformable to the ſaid Brief, we do diſpence with the ſaid Prince, and moſt Serene Princeſs, to the end that they may continue and abide in the ſaid Marriage, which they have well and lawfully Contracted, without having regard to the ſaid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment <hi>publicae Honeſtatis,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from the firſt annulled Marriage. And we Declare for Legitimate, and born in lawful Marriage, the <hi>Infanta,</hi> which through the Will of our Lord God, has been born of this ſecond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and for Legitimate, and born in lawful Marriage, all other Children, which ſhall hereafter be born, without any lett or trouble from any Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Apoſtolick Conſtitutions to the contrary.</q>

               <p>THere are Three things to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this Buſineſs of the King and the Queen of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>That which paſſed in the firſt Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the King</hi> Alphonſo.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>The Nullity of that Marriage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>The Queens ſecond Marriage with the Prince</hi> Don Pedro.</p>
               <p>In the Firſt it is to be Conſidered as follows.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Marqueſs of <hi>Sande,</hi> who was ſent Ambaſſador into <hi>France,</hi> to Treat of the Marriage of the King <hi>Don Alphonſo,</hi> his Maſter; having before he went from <hi>Portugal,</hi> told the Count <hi>de</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:58785:163"/>
                  <hi>Caſtlemelhor,</hi> the Chief Miniſter of State, the ſcruple of his Conſcience, and the Politique Conſideration that he had, to go Treat of a Marriage for a Prince, who was commonly ſaid through all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not to be capable ever of having any Children; unleſs that he ſhould have before-hand ſome aſſurance to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he might deceive, ſaid he, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his own Conſcience, nor the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor the Princeſs, who ſhould take his word. The Count anſwered him rudely, in theſe Terms, as the Marqueſs declared ſince, and as it appears by the Depoſitions. I am aſtoniſhed, Sir, ſaid he, at the Doubt that you make, and I am ſurpriſed that you do not know, that the Girl which is bred up at my Houſe, is the Natural Daughter of the King. Which the Marqueſs believed, but it was found to be falſe ſince, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Mother of the Girl, who being called to declare upon Oath in Court; though the ſame Count had done all that he could poſſibly, to oblige her to ſay, that ſhe had that Child by the King: Yet moved by the Truth, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of Conſcience, ſhe declared that it was falſe, and that the Girl was one of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58785:163"/>
his Couſins, whom ſhe named to the Judges. And beſides, in all the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſhe had with the King, ſhe never found that he was capable of doing the <hi>Venereal Act;</hi> and that by Conſequence, he was unable for Marriage, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable ever of having Children.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſeeing the Incapacity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of the King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> the Queen his Mother, who knew the thing well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, having made a secret Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his Phyſitians, (as may be ſeen by the Papers and Depoſitions) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to let the Scepter fall into the hands of the <hi>Infante</hi> her ſecond Son, at this time Prince Regent; to the end, leſt in default of a Succeſſor, it ſhould fall again a ſecond time into the power of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> but this ſhe had not been able to Execute.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> himſelf, when they went about to Treat ſecretly of his Marriage, and to ſend for that end an Ambaſſador into <hi>France,</hi> he was very hardly brought to reſolve upon it, and avowed to his moſt intimate Friends, that he never had any intention to Marry, and ſhould never conſent to it; but becauſe the Count and his Friends had
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58785:164"/>
repreſented to him, that the People ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves deprived of the Hope of ſeeing him ever to have any Lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, would not ſuffer him any long time upon the Throne; and that they would ſoon make the Prince his Brother, to Marry and to Reign in his Place. But although they might attribute this Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which the King had for Marriage, to the Liberty in which he had been brought up, and to the continual Practiſes which he had with the moſt looſe and debauched Women, from whom one might ſay, he would not be obliged to ſeparate, by Eſpouſing ſo Chaſt and Honeſt a Princeſs, as the Queen. It is however much more probable, that it ſhould be attributed to the knowledg he had of his own Impuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and Inability for Marriage, which would make him paſs the reſt of his Days in a continual Repentance, as he hath ſince ſaid to one of his Domeſticks; bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Count and his Friends, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forced him contrary to his Will to Marry, and by conſequence to be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Affront which he hath received, by the Sentence of the Nullity of his Marriage.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:58785:164"/>
4. That the firſt time the King lay with the Queen, which was three or four Days after ſhe arrived in <hi>Portugal,</hi> his Impotence was well known to that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; notwithſtanding her Innocency, and although ſhe was Ignorant of things of that nature, ſo that her Confeſſor who ſaw her extremly Melancholly, and who feared with reaſon, the truth of that which they had talkt of, having taken the liberty to ask her in the time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion with all the Modeſty, and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and Truſt, which his Charge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him, if that which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported had any Ground or Appearance of truth; or if ſhe had any hopes to ſee ſoon any Fruits of her Marriage. She gave him ſuch an Anſwer, as may be ſeen in thoſe Papers, but it was after ſuch a manner, that ſhe let him know, ſhe judged already of the Condition of her Marriage, and of the Inability of the King, to get Children.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That although the Queen, ſince her Arrival in <hi>Portugal,</hi> had been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually Reproached by the King, and his chief Miniſters, and that ſhe had always received very ill Treatments, as all the World knows, and which is not neceſſary
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:58785:165"/>
to be put here in Writing, Her Majeſty nevertheleſs had never made any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and had never witneſſed any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, being on the contrary reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to Live with the King her Spouſe, as if he had been the moſt Accompliſhed, and the beſt Husband in the World; if that ſhe had not believed, for three ſorts of indiſpenſible Neceſſities, that ſhe ought to make a Declaration of it, and to ſeparate her ſelf from his Company. To wit,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For her Conſcience ſake, which without ceaſing, ſtrongly perſwaded her Majeſty, and urged her, that after an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Sixteen Months, which was long enough, and troubleſome enough, ſhe might ſeparate from the King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any greater Trial; her ſelf knowing very well in this time, his incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Inability. And having divers times conſulted with her Confeſſor, that ſhe might Act with the more ſecurity in an Affair of ſo great Importance: The ſame Confeſſor, after he had maturely thought upon it, and conſidered what ſhe ſhould do to ſatisfie her Duty, declared before God, That he knew nothing more, but that her Majeſty ſeeing that which
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:58785:165"/>
had paſſed, ſhould no longer do Violence to her Conſclence, in Inhabiting any longer time with the King.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the neceſſity of the State, and ſafety of the Realm, which otherways was abſolutely Loſt; and which her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as well as the Affection that the Kingdom bore to her, and which ſhe ought to have for the Kingdom, obliged her to provide for, as much as poſſibly ſhe could; ſince that on the one ſide, ſhe was moſt ſtrongly perſwaded of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puiſſance of the King, and that he never could have any Children: And on the other ſide, ſhe knew for certain, by the Kings own Confeſſion, and alſo by the Count of <hi>Caſtlemelhor,</hi> who had intruſted her with it, that although they did ſeem as if they would Marry the Prince to content him and the Realm, who very earneſtly deſired it, and they did feign to find out ways the moſt fit thereto, the King nevertheleſs was reſolved to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it by all ways imaginable, being far from permitting it; Becauſe, as they ſaid, and as it was true enough, it would be his Ruine, and the Power of the Prince would infinitely increaſe, by the conſideration of his Marriage, and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58785:166"/>
of the Children that ſhould proceed therefrom, deſpairing to ſee any from the King, ſo that he would get the Love of all the People, and have all the Realm at his Devotion, to render him Maſter of all, when he had a mind to Revenge himſelf of the Count, without running any Riſque.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the neceſſity of her Repoſe, and of her Honour. Of her Repoſe, becauſe ſhe had never in all thoſe Sixteen Months found it, neither in her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor in her Mind, nor in her Body, neither Day nor Night, although ſhe had tried by her Patience, and by her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Diſſimulation, to do all ſhe could poſſible to get it; and though ſhe ſaw things to go from bad to worſe every day, by the ill Government of the Count, and by the evil Impreſſions that he and his Friends had given, and continually did give the King againſt her, which would infallibly draw upon her a more rude Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, than that which ſhe had hitherto undergone. And that ſhe ſhould put into danger her Honour for the time to come, which was ever infinitely more dear to her than the Crown, or her own Life, and that ſhe ſaw it expoſed to great Dangers, upon great and lawful Grounds; of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58785:166"/>
which what ever neceſſity there is to ſpeak, yet honeſty and modeſty will not permit it here; but by this only, which cannot be abſolutely paſſed over in ſilence, you may judg.</p>
               <p>One is, That the King knowing very well that he was never able to get any Children, he notwithſtanding teſtified an extreme paſſion to have them, by the means of that Opinion to eſtabliſh himſelf upon the Throne, and to make forceleſs the contrary Opinion, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly talked of and known to all the World of his Inability, which tormented him more than the Inability it ſelf. So that the more ſenſible he was of his Inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the more eager he was to ſhew the contrary, abandoning himſelf to all ſorts of Women, and believing by that means to maintain the Crown upon his Head, and to kill with Grief the Prince his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he hated to the death, becauſe he ſaid, and knew for certain, that his Majeſty ſhould never have Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Inability.</p>
               <p>The other is, That the Queen was not ignorant of that which was done private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and which the Judges knew ſince by the declaration of the intereſted Perſons,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:58785:167"/>
which was, That when the King had a mind to ſport himſelf with a certain Maid, and not being able to do it by reaſon of his Inability, he made her lye in his Chamber, with one of his Favourites in his preſence, to provoke him thereto, though in vain, as appeared by the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were made by thoſe Perſons that were preſent, and which they had ſworn to upon the Holy Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p>And what yet gave to the Queen a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fear was, That the King, who had no Government over himſelf, but through his own licentiouſneſs, and that vain thought of feigning himſelf able, without regard either to his Honour or his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſeemed to have ſome deſign upon her, by the continual Sollicitations which he made her, about the end of <hi>April,</hi> 1667, by his moſt intimate Favourites, <hi>Henry Anriquez de Miranda,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Caſtelmelhor,</hi> with the Marchioneſs his Mother, Lady of Honour to the Queen, that ſhe would go paſs a night in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, when there was no difficulty for the King to come to hers to lie with her there, and which was contrary to the ancient and ordinary Cuſtoms of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:58785:167"/>
and without any neceſſity, or the leaſt appearance thereof; And becauſe the Queen excuſed her ſelf divers times, and the moſt ſweetly that poſſibly ſhe could, alledging for reaſons, not that which gave her ſo much apprehenſion in her mind, for ſhe was willing to ſacrifice this new Trouble to the will of the King, by an effect of that ſubmiſſion which that Princeſs always had for him, but that the apprehenſion of modeſty it ſelf was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to hinder all Women of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and more eſpecially a Queen, as ſhe was, to make without any neceſſity ſo extraordinary a Change, which would without doubt make them diſcourſe of her Reputation, and alſo of his Majeſty's. The King fell into ſo much paſſion, and with ſo much Violence, that the very ſame night he would have made her gone out of her Bed, to have followed him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Apartment; but after very many menaces and rude words, holding a Poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard in his hand, he ſaid that he gave her 24 Hours to conſider of it, which paſſed, if ſhe did not the night after what he would have her do, he ſwore he would draw her by force, or make her be drawn by four of his Grooms. This gave the Queen a moſt
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58785:168"/>
ſenſible Grief. Of this ſhe made moſt juſt complaints to the Count on the morrow, by the mouth of her Confeſſor, that he might pray him to remedy it, proteſting that ſhe would ſooner dy, than do that which the King would have her do, or any thing elſe that was unworthy of her.</p>
               <p>This joyned with the fear, which was beſides very ſtrongly impreſſed on the mind of the Queen, was the cauſe, that ſince that time ſhe did not believe her ſelf in any ſecurity, neither ſhould ſhe be, ſo long as ſhe ſhould ſtay there expoſed as ſhe had been, and ſhould be more for the time to come, to a danger that ſhe had once ſo much trouble to get out of ſo happily as ſhe had done, and ſeeing alſo, that ſhe whom her Majeſty ſhould moſt truſt on ſuch occaſions, to wit her Lady of Honour, was ſhe whom ſhe had the moſt reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, becauſe of the Counſel ſhe had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her, becauſe ſhe was Mother to the Count, the Favourite of the King, and who had declared openly, that ſhe was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſionatly deſirous, that the King ſhould have Children by the Queen, after what manner ſoever it might be, by that means to eſtabliſh the Fortune of her Son, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid expreſly to her Confeſſor, in
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:58785:168"/>
a Conference they had together about this Matter, to endeavour to induce him on the Kings part and her own, to make the Queen conſent to the change of her Bed and Apartment, that it ſhould be but for five or ſix nights, after which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that ſhe would cauſe the King to return to the Queen, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as before.</p>
               <p>Things being in theſe terms, and the Queen ſeeing no Remedy for theſe evils, and dangers, to which ſhe expoſed her ſelf more and more every day, believed, that ſhe could no ways ſave her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, her Eſtate, her Repoſe, nor her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but by declaring this, which ſhe had ſo carefully hid hitherto, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king null her Marriage. And this is the Second Point, which I have ſaid is to be conſidered in the Diſſolving of this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, being the manner in which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, which we ſhall clearly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make known by theſe following Articles.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Queen, that ſhe might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw her ſelf out of the fear of thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which I have already ſpoken of, and which were inevitable, ſo long as ſhe ſhould continue in the Palace, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:58785:169"/>
being willing to make her Declaration with the ſecurity of her Liberty and her Life, was reſolved to leave it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire her ſelf into the Covent of St. <hi>Claire,</hi> called <hi>Eſperance,</hi> which is the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and the beſt regulated in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and indeed ſhe did as ſecretly retire her ſelf thither as ſhe could, the 22 <hi>d</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> 1667.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Retreat of the Queen, and the Declaration, which ſhe made the next Morning, of the Motives ſhe had thereto, both to the Clergy, Nobles and People, which her Majeſty had made to be called together for that purpoſe, inſtead of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing them, as one might have imagined, made them to make all at the ſame time one Anſwer, believing very much that ſhe had ſtayed there long enough, and that they had long expected ſuch a Reſolution, and they were not leſs informed than ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at what her Majeſty had ſo long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and had ſo long deferred, that they approved of all ſhe had done, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, that ſhe would declare the Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Marriage, which was ſo import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and ſo neceſſary to the Health of the State; but they would never approve of that which her Majeſty ſpake of at the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:58785:169"/>
ſame time of returning into <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her Perſon and her Aſſiſtance would now be more neceſſary to them, and more profitable than ever for the Realm, and to ſave it from the dangers which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, when ſhe was at Liberty: And that all the City of <hi>Lisbon</hi> would teſtify the ſame general Approbation, which they had given of her Retreat.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Queen, the ſame day of her Retreat, ſent to the King by the Count <hi>de St. Croix,</hi> Maſter of her Houſe, and a little after by the Biſhop of <hi>Targa,</hi> a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Declaration of that which ſhe was obliged in her Conſcience to ſay, which was of the Nullity of her Marriage, and moſt humbly to intreat his Majeſty, to permit that Affair, ſo neceſſary to the Health of their Souls, and to that of the Realm, to be judged according to the Forms and Canons Eccleſiaſtique, to the end, that being free, ſhe might return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> with the good will of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and without loſing his Favour. To which the King anſwered by Writing, ſigned with his own Hand, and confirmed by Oath upon the Evangeliſts, as may be ſeen in the Papers of the Proceſs, after he had conſulted the Doctors and Divines,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:58785:170"/>
whom he had called together for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he would Acquieſs; that by the ſole motive of his Will, and by the duty of his Conſcience, he declared by the Advice of the <hi>Theologiſts,</hi> which were two <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and one <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> that he did believe his Marriage with the Queen was Null; becauſe ſhe being a Virgin, he had never been able to Conſummate the Marriage with her.</p>
               <p>It is very true that the King was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, before he had made his Anſwer and Declaration to that of the Queens; but it ought to be taken notice of,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That he had before done it Verbally, ſome time before his Deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in talking familiarly to one of his Domeſticks, who Depoſed it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That his Majeſty was not yet Arreſted, when the Queen demanded that Declaration; but after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that of the Queens, he took two or three Days time to conſult with the Doctors and Divines, about what he ſhould be obliged by his Conſcience to anſwer: It happened that the Night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing he was Arreſted, by an Arreſt from his own Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:58785:170"/>
Thirdly, That this Detention was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reſolved, nor made upon the Queens Retreat, nor upon her Declaration, no otherwiſe than if that had never been, but for a neceſſity far different and more urgent than that; ſo that the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the King made, ſome Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that of the Queens, and after he had taken time enough to think thereon, and to ſatisfie his Conſcience, and to know the Thoughts and Reſolutions of thoſe Divines, ought not to be reputed Invalid for want of Liberty, or that he was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted for that Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That theſe Divines which his Majeſty had Aſſembled, did declare after they had heard him, that he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in Conſcience, to Anſwer as if he were at full Liberty; and that there was nothing that ſhould oblige him to conceal the truth, as may be ſeen by their Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That ſince that, when they had demanded of the King in divers Meetings, if he Approved, or Diſapproved the Declaration he had made: He always roundly affirmed it, and with an Oath, he Approved and Ratified it, both
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58785:171"/>
for the diſcharge of his own Conſcience, and of the Queens.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, When the Judges Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Chapter to go to his Majeſty, to ſignifie the Sentence which they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and which was pronounced for the Nullity of his Marriage, did demand of him if he would Acquieſs therein, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would Appeal. He anſwered without Heſitation, that he would Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſs, acknowledging they acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Juſtice; as may be ſeen by the Acts of the Proceſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. After ſo univerſal an Approbation given to the Retreat of the Queen, the Council of State attending for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the States of the Realm, which ſhould have been called together a Month before, contrary to the mind of the King, to remedy the Diſorders of the Realm, and of his Government; ſeeing they were not able to Aſſemble ſo ſoon as thoſe Affairs required, and foreſeeing otherwiſe all <hi>Portugal</hi> would be loſt, it they did not apply ſome ſpeedy Remedy. It was ſecretly reſolved, that the King ſhould be Locked up in his Apartment, with all the Civility that could be, and to put the Regency and the Government
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:58785:171"/>
of the Realm into the hands of the Prince, until they ſhould ſee what the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral would reſolve of, which was Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted without any Noiſe at Night, on the <hi>22d,</hi> or <hi>23d;</hi> and the end of this Detention, was to hinder the King from Flying away with the Count to the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teirs, or elſewhere out of the Realm, as they had underſtood he had Premeditated to do a Month before: Or elſe, ſeeing for the ſpace of ſeveral Years, the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government of his Majeſty, and ſince he was Incapable of holding the Reins, being Married to ſo fair and virtuous a Princeſs, he was not Capable of giving them Succeſſors to the Crown, as he had evidently himſelf acknowledged by his own Declaration, and by that of the Queens. And ſeeing him fit neither for the one, or the other, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it was neceſſary very ſuddenly to give a Remedy to theſe Evils. They had permitted it, giving way by the means of this Detention, to make the Proofs as to the preparation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, upon the Nullity of his Marriage, which elſe could not have been done.</p>

had Recourſe to the holy <hi>See,</hi> to have judged of the Nullity of her Marriage, ſhe had undoubtedly done it; ſhe having at divers times declared the ſame thing; And doth yet declare it, that it was her Intention, as much for the grand Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Buſineſs, as for the great Reſpect and infinite Reverence, which ſhe always hath had for the holy <hi>See:</hi> And alſo, becauſe ſhe is fully perſwaded of the Equity and Juſtice of one of the beſt and moſt worthy <hi>Popes,</hi> who hath ever ſat in the Chair of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> but not then being able to do it, to her great Regret, not having ſo eaſily Recourſe thither, for thoſe Cauſes which all the World knows of, and which have made all the Realm of <hi>Portugal</hi> to Groan, for the ſpace of Thirty Years continually, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the power to be able to caſt themſelves at the Feet of the <hi>Popes,</hi> nor to be heard in their greateſt Spiritual Neceſſities; the Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> not being as yet fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, from whence all theſe Obſtacles came. Her Majeſty was obliged to have Recourſe to the Ordinary, and to the neareſt Judge, which was the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> when the <hi>Epiſcopal See</hi> was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:58785:173"/>
6. That in the choice of the Judges, which were Eleven in Number, the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had had all the Liberty, and all the Regard poſſible, to name for that Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the moſt conſiderable of that Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Body, as well for their Quality and their Learning, as their Virtue and their Honeſty.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That in the Judgment, which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than Four Months, there was obſerved all the neceſſary Forms, even as if it had been done for Perſons of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or the meaneſt Condition.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That as to the Proofs in Law, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they had declared the King In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable, and his Marriage Nul, they were ſo ſtrong and evidently manifeſt, and ſo very certain, that the Judges, after they had a long time, and moſt maturely Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined all, declared in their Sentence, that they were not only ſufficient, but more than enough; and there was no need either of Inſpection, nor of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Three Years.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Then when it was made known to the King, the Sentence that the Eleven Judges had pronounced, as aboveſaid, before all the <hi>Chapter of Lisbon,</hi> upon the Nullity of the Marriage; and one
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:58785:174"/>
of the Judges, to wit, the Grand Vicar, signified it to him by the Secretary, of the Relation, being Interrogaeed, whether he would Acquiess therein, or whether he would Appeal? He Answered of his own good will, that he was willing to Acquiess, and that he would not Appeal; and his Majesty signed the same Declaration.</p>
               <p>This is in truth, and in few words, what hath passed about the Nullity of the first Marriage of the Queen; so that there only remains the Third Consideration to be Examined, which is concerning the manner in which she hath made the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, with the most Serene Prince <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> which we shall clearly shew in few words, in these following Articles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Queen having received the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the nullity of her Marriage, and seeing her self free, she thought of nothing but of returning into <hi>France;</hi> and for that end, she would take the Opportunity of the Fleet, which the most Christian King had sent into <hi>Portugal,</hi> to carry back his Troops. Therefore she quickly let the Three States know her Resolution, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them very earnestly to Approve of it, and to Order it so, that she might carry back with her the Portion she brought,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:58785:174"/>
that she returning for <hi>France,</hi> might have wherewithal to maintain her according to her Quality. But the States who had so highly Approved of her Retreat, and witnessed infinite Joy for the Sentence of the Nullity of the Marriage, did strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppose themselves to the Resolution which she had taken of going away; and came all of them in a Body to the Covent, to Supplicate her with Tears in their Eyes, not to abandon the Realm: And having already found some ease by her Declaration, that she would once more yield to their Wishes, in consenting to the Marriage which they would propose to her with their Prince; and the rather, because they were neither able nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to return her Portion. To which, the Queen having Answered what her Modesty, and the Quality of her Birth would permit her on that Occasion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out engaging her self, or denying it. They went at the same instant in a Body to the Prince, to entreat him to save the Realm, by Espousing the Queen; protesting to him, that they would never suffer him (as they said) to think on any other Marriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:58785:175"/>
The Prince who ever had a particular Eſteem for the Queen, becauſe of her rare qualities, and ever ſince they had deſigned to have eſpouſed her to him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, when they deſigned to have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> to <hi>Mademoiſelle de Nemours,</hi> at this time the Dutcheſs Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of <hi>Savoy,</hi> did receive this Petition of the States with very great ſatisfaction, ſaying, <hi>That he moſt willingly conſented to to it, provided, they could bring it about that the Queen would conſent to it likewiſe.</hi> Being returned for this end to her Majeſty, they ſupplicated her divers times, that ſhe would give her conſent thereto, ſo that in the end, being vanquiſhed by the powerful Reaſons, which they alledged concerning the neceſſity of the State, and by thoſe Motives which they urged to make this Marriage ſpeedily, ſhe gave them the Liberty, to do that which they ſhould think moſt convenient for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good. So that this Marriage was ſolemnly concluded, and all things diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſummate it very ſoon, to prevent and diſſipate the practices, which ſome of the Enemies of the publick Repoſe were making with the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> to hinder it, and to conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:58785:175"/>
with the Princeſs of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the ſame Prince, by which they would make him hope for great advantages, to make him conſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The principal Divines and Doctors of the Univerſity of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as well Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars as Seculars, having conſulted upon the neceſſity of a Diſpenſation, for the firſt degree of publick Honeſty, to effect this Marriage; they were all of the ſame Opinion, and of the ſame Sentiment, ſaying unanimouſly that there was no need of having it in the Caſe in Queſtion, and they made divers Writings thereupon: There was alſo more than thirty, who ſigned a Treatiſe, which was expreſly made by one of them, to take away from her Majeſty and the Prince all thoſe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Conſcience, that they might have in marrying without demanding it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they had conſidered the time, and the difficulty, which would be in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> although contrary to the Will of his Holineſs, which might endanger the Repoſe and Health of the State, which could not be able to get out of its forepaſt miſeries, but in putting it ſelf in a Condition to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:58785:176"/>
give Succeſſors to the Crown, which was the only way to do it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding all theſe Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe Doctors, and the politick Inſtances given them by the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſons of the Realm, to oblige the Queen and the Prince to conſent to their will; yet they had nevertheleſs ſo much Reſpect, ſo much Reverence, and ſo much Submiſſion to the Authority of the Holy See, that they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Marriage would neither be fully bleſt, nor approved of by God, if firſt it were not ſo by him who was in his ſtead and place upon Earth; and in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration they employed all their Care, and all their Diligence poſſible, to get with ſpeed a Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is moſt certain that as the Queen had not recourſe to the Holy See the firſt time, that it might judge of the Nullity of the Marriage, for no other reaſon, but that aforeſaid, doubting the way would not be found ſo eaſily open as the Caſe required: So the ſecond time alſo the way ſeemed open, ſince the peace made between <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the Prince and ſhe had a paſſionate Deſire, and full of ſincerity, and they would not
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:58785:176"/>
have failed to have had recourſe then for right, if it might have been ſo eaſily had as the urgent neceſſity required, and the length of the Voyage and the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Factions of thoſe Perſons, who would not have failed to have oppoſed it at <hi>Rome,</hi> as they had tried to do at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> had not made them fear, that it would be too great a Delay, and that the leaſt ill that attended it, would be the putting into danger the Quiet and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the State, which depended upon the ſudden and ſpeedy Conſummation of this Marriage.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is the Reaſon wherefore they had Recourſe to <hi>Mounſieur</hi> the Cardinal <hi>de Vendoſm,</hi> Legat <hi>a Latere</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> believing alſo, beſides the nearneſs of Places, and the facility of Acceſs that in addreſſing themſelves to his Eminency, they had Recourſe to the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf; and not being able to go to Drink at the Fountain Head, it would ſuffice that they Drank at a Stream which they ſaw, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed immediately from its Source.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And ſeeing that the Legat gave them the Diſpenſation which they required,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:58785:177"/>
believing he had Power ſo to do. The Queen and the Prince received it, as not being able to imagine (as they ought not to do) that a Cardinal ſo Illuſtrious and ſo Wiſe, in whom the <hi>Pope</hi> had ſo much Confidence, and whom he Eſteemed ſo much, and who was his Legat <hi>a Latere,</hi> did not know how far his Power extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or what he did in granting their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It followed then, that from this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation ſought for, Received, Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Approved, and Regiſtred by the Official of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to whom it was Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that the Marriage was Made and was Celebrated in the face of the holy Church with all the Formalities requisite, by the Biſhop of <hi>Targa,</hi> in preſence of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of the Palace where it was done, and of Four Gentlemen of the Chamber of the Prince, commonly called Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains; the Duke <hi>de Cadaval</hi>'s Proctor Eſpouſing for the Queen, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Marialva</hi> for the Prince.</p>
               <p n="8">8. All the People alſo Approved of it, by the moſt extraordinary marks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment that ever were ſeen; and the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:58785:177"/>
King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> would ſhew that which he had in particular, by the Complements which he ſent to the Prince his Brother. And Heaven was not backward, to let us plainly ſee, that God did give his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to this Royal Marriage, by the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Pregnancy of the Queen, which was perceived within a Month after; and is now at this time gone half her Time. So that all the People hope, his Holineſs will not refuſe them his; and that he will have the goodneſs to have regard</p>
               <p>Firſt, To the moſt humble Petitions of theſe two Great and Religious Princes, which they make with other Crowned Heads.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To the particular Reſpect, and to the ſincerity of the Reverence which they have had, and which they ſtill have to the holy <hi>See,</hi> in having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To the great Submiſſion which the Realm of <hi>Portugal,</hi> hath Witneſſed at all times to the Will of the <hi>Popes,</hi> and particularly within this Thirty Years, whilſt it hath Laboured under very great
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:58785:178"/>
Calamities, and which hath Laboured ſo much as all the World knows, for the Propagation of the Faith, without ſo much as Eſtranging it ſelf ſo much as in one Point, notwithſtanding all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces it had ſuffered under the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> of his Predeceſſors, with ſo much Patience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To the perfect and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Confidence which it ſtill at preſent hath for him, who hath ſo worthily Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and who doth ſurpaſs them all in Bounty, Juſtice, and Wiſdom; that he will repair all its paſt Loſſes, and will, to render them intirely happy, do them the favour to Eſtabliſh the Repoſe, and the Spiritual and Temporal Peace of theſe poor People, who have Groaned ſo many Years; which depends abſolutely on the Approbation and Benediction, which he ſhall have the goodneſs to give to this Marriage.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And laſtly, To the Immortal glory that his Holineſs, and the holy <hi>See</hi> ſhall receive, after they have by their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and their Paternal Cares, ſo happily extinguiſhed the Fire of a War,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:58785:178"/>
that Conſumed all <hi>Europe,</hi> by the means of the Peace made between the two Crowns, who are as it were the two Poles of it: It ſhall yet pleaſe them to take away the Subject, and the Occaſion, which may be ſoon able to Rekindle it, and to render it more Hot than ever.</p>
