            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of thoſe perſons only, betwixt whom the contract for reſtoring what was left, was made, or whether regard ſhould be likewiſe had to other perſons, whom the buſineſſe doth concern; As for example, A Theef or Robber took away a pack of goods from an honeſt man, called <hi>Titius,</hi> and left the ſame in truſt with <hi>Seius,</hi> who knew nothing of the theft or robbery; whether ought <hi>Seius</hi> afterwards under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the truth, to reſtore the goods to the theef or robber, or to <hi>Titius?</hi> He ſayes, If regard be had to the perſons of him who left, and the other who received the goods in truſt, It ſtands with fair dealing and equity, that he who depoſited the goods ſhould receive the ſame, but that, If Equity that be regarded, which reſults out of the whole buſineſſe, and relates to all the perſons that are concerned therein: they ought to be reſtored to <hi>Titius,</hi> from whom they were wrongfully taken away; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he concludes, That that is beſt juſtice which ſo renders to every man his own, that it be not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from him, who hath a better title thereunto; and addes, That if <hi>Titius</hi> come not to demaund his goods, the evill getting thereof ſhall not hinder, but that he, who left them in truſt, ought again to receive the ſame.</p>

But if the Will and pleaſure of the Emperour, be taken into conſideration, it may be conceived, that his grant was to that effect, only ſo long, as the diſability of the Sonne continued; For if he had given licence to a Father, to ſubſtitute to a Sonne who was then madde, all men would think, that the ſubſtitution ſhould be void, if the Sonne recovered his witts; for if it ſhould hold notwithſtanding, it would prove unjuſt, as depriving a man of good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, of the power to make a Will. And for the ſame reaſon, the Sonne having a Sonne, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ought to be his heyre, the ſubſtitution ought to be held as diſanulled; for it is no difference, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sonne attaine to the ability of making an heyre, or begin to have an heyre whom the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynts.

the mony, as in paying my ſelfe, and other Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; For in that caſe I ought, not only to looſe my fifty pounds, but alſo to make good the reſt, unto the heyre, only deducting the ten pounds, which I laid out.

                  <p>WHen one promiſed, or undertook to give ſomething which was of common uſe, or <hi>Stichus</hi> when he was a Bond-ſervant, he is diſcharged of his obligation, if, without any act of his, that thing becomes dedicated to holy uſes, or that bondman becomes a freeman; yea <hi>Paulus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes farther, That if afterwards by lawfull means, the thing conſecrated became to be in commerce, or of common uſe, or the Bond-man from a Free-man became againe to be a Bond-man, the former obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſhal not be reviv'd; becauſe in this caſe it doth not hold, that the cauſe ceaſing why it could not be given, it may now be given. For although he, who undertook to give a ſhippe being the owner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if he take it in pieces, and out of the ſame timber, and planks, build it againe, begins to be obliged as before; becauſe it is now the ſame ſhip.

to the ſame purpoſe, that concurres which <hi>Pedius</hi> writes, <hi>viz.</hi> If I covenant to have a hundred veſſells of wine, to be delivered unto me out of a certain ground, I have liberty to exſpect, untill that ground may yeeld ſo much; ſo that if the ground yeelding ſo much, without the fault of him who undertook the performance thereof, it periſheth, I may exſpect a gaine untill it yeeld ſufficient, that what was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken may be performed: and that in theſe caſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the alterations of the things, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may ceaſe, and be renued againe. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the caſe propoſed, as of a thing becoming conſecrated, and of a Bond-ſervant being made free, or of a different condition; Inſomuch that to make promiſe of a conſecrated place, when it ſhall prove to be prophane, or of a Free-man when he ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſlave, is not admitted by Law; becauſe in their preſent condition they are not liable to any ſuch obligation, and thoſe things only are ſubject thereunto, which in their own nature may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the preſent: and it ſtands not with civill, nor naturall reſpect, to attend the fall, or misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of a Free-man. For we properly trade and traffique in thoſe things, which are in common uſe, and may inſtantly be reduced under our power. As touching Wines, when they are undertaken to be given, no particular thing, which may faile, but ſomething in generall, which may at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be performed, is undertaken. And for what is inſtanced in a ſhip, which is a particular thing; it is to be underſtood, That if it be taken in pieces, with a purpoſe, that out of the materialls thereof, ſome other thing ſhould be framed, although the purpoſe being changed, it be rebuilt againe, yet the firſt ſhip ceaſes to be, and that which is now built is another ſhip: but if the bords and planks of a ſhip,

were altered; and ſaies, it holds not only in this caſe, That the thing continues the ſame, although the parts be changed, but in many other bodies; For it is held the ſame Legion, or Regiment of Souldiers, although many of the firſt be gone, and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited in their roomes: and the people of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are held the ſame, which it was an hundred years ſince, although none of that time remaine: And it is the ſame ſhip ſtill in reputation, although it hath bin ſo often repair'd, that there is not a plank or a bord left, into the place of which, there hath not been ſome new piece added: Nay, ſaies he, If any ſhould ſuppoſe, That by the alteration of the parts, the whole were not the ſame, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by the ſame reaſon, That we our ſelves ſhould not be the ſame men we were ſome few years ſince; Becauſe as the Philoſophers affirme, The Atoms or inviſible parts of which we are compos'd, doe daily waſt, and ſpend, and others from abroad accrue in their ſteads; and thereupon concludes, that were the ſame ſpecies, or forme continues, the ſame thing or body ſtill remaines.</p>

The ſhip wherein the Merchant took his voyage, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving goods enough to anſwer the whole debt, before the day, and place appointed for paiment thereof, was caſt away. It was queſtioned,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:116040:112"/>
Whether the Uſurer might have recourſe againſt the goods in the other ſhip, in caſe any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained? <hi>Paulus</hi> anſwered, That in other contracts of lending mony, the hazard and loſſe of the thing lent, and what is engaged for it, belongs to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, not to the Creditor. But when monies are lent, upon a Sea voyage, It is intended that the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, cannot demand any thing, unles the ſhip en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, within the time prefixt for payment, arrive ſafely at the Port appointed: and therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition failing in this caſe, the obligation for the principall, and conſequently for the intereſt was determined, although ſome of the goods, which were engaged for payment, were ſaved in other ſhips. But it may be then demanded, In what caſe might the Creditor have been relieved, in reſpect of thoſe goods? It was anſwered, In caſe the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſhip had ſafely arrived, and the goods there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in had proved inſufficient, although that ſhip, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time appointed for paiment, had been caſt away.</p>

It happened, that the eſtate of <hi>Julius Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> was confiſcated to the publique Treaſury: and <hi>Aurelius Palma</hi> dying without heyres, the publique Treaſury likewiſe ſucceeded in his eſtate. <hi>Vranius</hi> being ſued, by the Officers of the Treaſury, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken to <hi>Aurelius Palma,</hi> for the debt, Pleaded, that he was freed from his engagement to <hi>Palma, Pollioes</hi> and his eſtate being confounded in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:116040:119"/>
one. <hi>Paulus</hi> was of opinion, That if there had been but one debtor, to wit, <hi>Julius Pollio,</hi> the plea had been good; there being no doubt, but the ſurety is freed, when the principall debtor cannot be ſued. But when two men are bound ſeverally, for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame mony, and the Creditor becomes heyre to one of them, he ſaith, There is juſt cauſe to doubt, whether the other debtor be freed; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by confuſion of the obligation, the perſon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that debtor, be exempted. And he is of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the Creditor ſucceeding one of the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors his perſon is only freed, and the obligation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines: whereupon he concludes, That the other debtor continues bound, and alſo he that is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on his behalfe. But although an action lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſurety by Law, yet in regard <hi>Vranius,</hi> if he receive prejudice by his engagement, hath liberty to bring his action againſt either of thoſe, for whom he was engaged, If he be ſued, on behalfe of the Treaſury, he may except for ſo much, as <hi>Julius Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> his eſtate was liable to him; and leave the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury to take courſe, againſt the other debtor, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a moyety of the debt, if they were partners therein, otherwiſe the whole.</p>

It was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, Whether <hi>Sempronius</hi> might demand Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt with his mony? <hi>Papinian</hi> anſwered, That it is certain, that an action, for a thing depoſited, did lie in this caſe; becauſe the words, Committing, or Commending to his keeping, doe ſignify nothing elſe, but depoſiting; which is true, if it were done with an intent, that the ſame numericall mony ſhould be reſtored: but if it were agreed, that ſo much in quantity, ſhould be repaid, the buſineſſe doth ſomething differ from the nature of a thing depoſited; and in that caſe, although an action for a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:116040:125"/>
thing depoſited doth not lie, yet it ought eaſily to be yeelded, that intereſt ſhould be due for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He addeth, That it is true, that in a buſineſſe of this kind, the Judge may determine what is fit, as well as if the parties had expreſly agreed thereupon: but he ſaith, It is both againſt the nature of a thing left in truſt, and faire dealing, to require intereſt of him, who doth a curteſy, in keeping what is truſted with him, before he hath made any delay in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof.</p>

He that hath killed a man, if he did it not, with a purpoſe of killing him, may be acquitted, and he who wounded a man, with a mind to kill him, although he killed him not, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as a man-ſlayer, and that it is to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, from the circumſtances of the fact, for if he drew a ſword, and ſtruck a man therewith, it ought not to be doubted, but that it was done with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of killing him, but if he ſtruck him with a key, or with a pike-ſtaffe, albeit with an Iron poynt, it ſhall not be thought, that it was done with a mind to kill him, and his puniſhment ought

                  <p>IT was lawfull ſaith <hi>Pupinian,</hi> for the Father to kill an Adulterer with his daughter, found in the fact in his own houſe, and it was lawfull for the Husband to kill a perſon of baſe condition, found in Adultery with his Wife, and as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, there was more power given to the Father, then to the Husband, to kill the Woman, and the Adulterer without diſtinction. Becauſe the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a Father, will make him more circumſpect in his reſolution, but the heat and raſhneſſe of a Husband, needed to be limited. Yet <hi>Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Commodus</hi> his ſonne being Emperours, and conſulted upon occaſion of the Husbands killing his Wife, returned anſwer, If the Husband tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with indignation and griefe, killed his Wife found in Adultery, he ought not to be puniſht with death, giving for reaſon, that the Emperour <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Pius</hi> ſignified his mind to that purpoſe to <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius;</hi> the puniſhment of death, ſaid he, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, who doth acknowledge that he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Wife, found in Adultery, becauſe it is a moſt difficult thing to overcome a paſſion, juſtly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; yet becauſe in taking his own revenge, he did more then may be juſtified, he ought not to goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſht; and therefore it may ſuffice, if he be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of mean condition, to condemne him to the Mines; if he be one of better quality, to confine him to ſome Iſland.</p>

                  <p>IF the Maſter of a Family were killed in his own houſe, if any of his Bondmen were faulty, in not defending him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was to ſuffer death. It happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that one was Bondman to two partners, in the ſame houſe, both being aſſaulted, he reſcued the one, but not the other; It was queſtioned, whether he ought to ſuffer, for that he did not reſcue both? <hi>Vlpian</hi> ſaid, If it were in his power to have helped both, and he had neglected one, he might juſtly ſuffer; but if, when he could not relieve both, he choſe rather to help one, it were hard to ſay; that he offended, in haſting to help one rather then the other.</p>

For guards, or keepers are appointed for mad men, not only to look that they doe not miſchiefe to themſelves, but alſo that they be not deſtructive to others, which if it be done, it may be well imputed to their fault, who were more negligent then was fit in their imployment.</p>

                  <p>IT is generally obſerved, that for crimes proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the way of publique Judicature, the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or forfeiture of goods, falls not upon the heyres, unleſſe ſentence be given, in the life time of the offendor, But <hi>Modeſtinus</hi> ſaies, It is otherwiſe in Treaſon, which may be proſecuted againſt the heyrs, to make goods confiſcated, although the parties be dead, and that <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours declared, that he that was guilty of that crime, might not alienate any of his goods, after the time of the ſact committed.
