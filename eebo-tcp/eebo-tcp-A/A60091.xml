         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>A SHORT
Relation, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>MErciful hath the Lord been to us of this Iſland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
expreſſion, in ſending his faithful Servants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us time after time, early, yea, and now of
late, preaching deliverance to us who were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and under the region and ſhadow of Death, turning us
from darkneſs to the light, and from Satans power to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God; being as lights ſet on a Hill, publiſhing the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable
year of the Lord, to the penitent, and the day of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of our God on the rebellious, both within and without;
which is now fulfilled and fulfilling in this day of his power,
wherin his people are a willing people, let his will be what
pleaſeth him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here on Earth as it is in Heaven; though there be
them that do murmur at it as in the dayes of old, ſaying to
the Lord, <hi>DEpart from us, we deſire not the knowledge of thy
wayes:</hi> ſtill imagining that <hi>the Lord delays his coming,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his promiſe, which is, <hi>without ſin unto Salvation;</hi> and
are ſtill pleading for the Devils work, which is ſin; although
that is it <hi>which ſeparateth from the Lord,</hi> and hindereth the
<hi>will of the Lord to be done on Earth</hi> (or whilſt they are in this
world) which is, <hi>that they ſhould be ſanctified;</hi> but let ſuch
know, that after this Life, his Will will be juſtly done on
them whether they will or no, though now they may <hi>reſist</hi>
the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as their Fathers did of old; and they which
are not <hi>obedient</hi> to his <hi>call</hi> and <hi>voice</hi> (which his <hi>ſheep</hi> do <hi>hear</hi>
and <hi>follow)</hi> whilſt here, <hi>denying him before men, he alſo will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
them before his Father, and the holy Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not queſtion but that it will be granted, that the <hi>Call
of the Lord is to depart from ſin,</hi> and not to joyn to that which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101794:3"/>
                  <hi>ſeparates from God.</hi> Then if we hold <hi>ſin</hi> the term of Life, we
ſhall find that its <hi>wages will be death. We cannot ſerve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters:</hi>
If we ſerve <hi>Sin,</hi> we are free from <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> neither
is there <hi>fellowſhip between light and darkneſs,</hi> or <hi>Christ and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial;</hi>
for they are contrary and oppoſite in all things, inſomuch
that the fruits of either are clearly deſcerned by the children
of Light, who are not of this <hi>world,</hi> neither of <hi>darkneſs,</hi>
though they once were, but are now <hi>of the Day,</hi> and are
<hi>Light in the Lord,</hi> being turned thereto by his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
ſpeaking by the ſame ſpirit that of old ſaid, <hi>Come ye, Oh
houſe of Iſrael! and let us walk in the Light of the Lord.</hi> This
as my Teſtimony, I write to thoſe that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the <hi>Truth,</hi> declared largely by that Man of God,
<hi>William Simpſon,</hi> who hath beſtowed much labour on us,
that this may ſtand as a <hi>Witneſs against my ſelf,</hi> or <hi>any
that have received the Truth declared by him,</hi> if we depart
from it: which that we may not do, let us all watch,
knowing aſſuredly, that it is only <hi>they that continue to the end
that ſhall be ſaved;</hi> as this faithful Warrior (yea, and more
than a Conqueror) hath done, who is entered into his <hi>rest,</hi>
having <hi>received an immortal Crown of an eternal weight of glory;</hi>
The <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> bears true witneſs <hi>in me</hi> to the truth of
the ſame <hi>this moment.</hi> And for the farther confirmation of
the ſame, I ſhall inſtance ſomething concerning his End (which
was miraculous) I being with him the time that he kept
Houſe in his ſickneſs, and to his Grave.</p>
               <p>On the third day of this inſtant (being the ſixth day of the
week, he powerfully preached the Word of the Lord, and
made effectual ſupplication to him by Prayer) at the Houſe of
<hi>Katherine Norton)</hi> it being the fifth Meeting that he had been
at that week, and laſt publication of the Goſpel of Peace, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
nigh the hour of his death, which was ſo powerfully done,
that it is beyond my utterance, eſpecially conſidering the low
eſtate of his outward man; which confirmeth his laſt Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to be no leſs than a miraculous voice immediately from
Heaven (as indeed it was) that we might then have ſaid,
(and now do) <hi>That he being dead, yet ſpeaketh the wonderful
things of God:</hi> From which Meeting (as aforeſaid at <hi>K. N</hi> s.)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101794:3"/>
he with his yoke-fellow, <hi>John Burneyat,</hi> went to the houſe
where <hi>Richard Clarke</hi> now lives, who kindly received them;
and that night our dear Friend, <hi>William Simpſon</hi> was taken
very ill with a Feaver, ſo that the outward man grew weaker
and fainter every day more than other, and the inward man
was renewed with might (to our great rejoycing) as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by his often making melody to the Lord with rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings;
ſo that though we ſorrow for him, yet <hi>we ſorrow not
as thoſe which have no hope:</hi> being Witneſſes of the <hi>Glory of
the Lord</hi> which did ſurround him to the laſt.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>his care was much over the Flock of which the Lord by
the Holy Ghost had made him an Overſeer,</hi> as appeared by his
words to his (and our) beloved <hi>John Burneyat,</hi> that morning,
who ſignified to him, <hi>That he had freedom to ſtay with him if he
deſired it;</hi> but dear <hi>William</hi> anſwered him, ſaying, <hi>All will
not be well except thou be there</hi> (meaning mens meeting
that day, and the general meeting on the morrow) with other
words to that effect.</p>
               <p>Now for the ſervice of Truth, theſe two faithful Stewards
had ſeparated themſelves (outwardly) but having bemoaned
each other, like <hi>Turtle Doves that miſs their Mates,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in the Will of the Lord to enjoy each others company
ſo much as they could, yet with <hi>Williams</hi> conſent <hi>John</hi> went to
Town that day.</p>
               <p>And on the eighth day of this Month he grew very weak
and faint in Body, and with being removed (according to his
deſire) he fainted away, not ſpeaking nor knowing us, as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
ſaid: And ſeeing us to be ſad, he asked, <hi>If he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us any words in the time of his fainting, that might offend us?</hi>
but we ſatisfied him that he did not, neither did he, for indeed
he was harmleſs in all things, and was <hi>become as a little Child,</hi> for
not one froward or haſty word proceeded from him, neither
was he any thing leſs than a <hi>perfect man, who feared God and
eſchewed evil;</hi> yea, <hi>he walked before the Lord and was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
inſomuch that <hi>the Lord hid not from him that which he hath
accompliſhed on him,</hi> for in the forenoon the Lord ſhewed him
in a Viſion that he would take him away; and giving a ſtart,
he gave us to underſtand the ſame, ſaying, <hi>It lyes very hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101794:4"/>
me, it is fixed in me,</hi> relating the thing that he had ſeen; and
I obſerved, that the pangs of Death ſeized on him at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
which might be about the eleventh hour: and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to keep his bed (becauſe moving of him cauſed him to
faint) he gave us an innocent look, like a Babe (as he was)
lying ſtill ſubmitting to what we ſaid, whoſe innocent looks and
behaviour cauſed tears from ſome, which he beholding was tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
ſpeaking to us tenderly, <hi>that we ſhould not be grieved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And towards evening he grew ſo weak, that he ſpake very
inwardly, ſo that we could ſcarcely hear him; and after that
manner he ſpake much of, and to the Lord, praiſing him won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully,
but with a very low voice. And after a while we
perceived that he did not know us, ſaying, <hi>Friends, be noble, and
do not hinder me in my Paſſage, for I am an innocent man.</hi> And
being asked whither he would go? he ſaid, <hi>I must paſs away.</hi>
And by what elſe he ſpake at that time, we ſurely know <hi>That
his heart was wholly fixed upon the Lord:</hi> For had any evil been
in him, ſomething of it would have ſhewed it ſelf at ſuch a
time, yet this holy Man of God did not, neither ſpake he at any
time <hi>any word unbecoming the Truth,</hi> which he once more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
preached.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Between the ſixth and ſeventh hour he lay very ſtill and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and one came there (who hath been invited to Meetings
but never came) and taking him by the hand, asked him how
he did? who anſwered,</hi> I am a very ſick man. <hi>And looking
towards the man,</hi> William Simpſon <hi>was on a ſuddain endewed
with the</hi> Power and Spirit of the Lord, <hi>by which he marvelouſly
preached the</hi> glorious Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Christ <hi>about a
quarter of an hour, ſweetly praiſing and magnifying the Lord;
which was ſo contrary to our expectations, that it cauſed great
amazement, with trembling and tears; who held forth power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
the Doctrine of</hi> Perfection and freedom from ſin on this ſide
the Grave, <hi>and that</hi> Friends ſhould be valiant for the Truth upon
Earth, <hi>and that</hi> they ſhould not again be entangled with the Yoak
of Bondage <hi>(which brings Imperfections)</hi> but to ſtand fast in
the Liberty wherewith Christ had made us free; that every Bond
and Yoak may be broken, that that which is pure of the Lord God
might go free in all; that God might be glorified and honoured,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101794:4"/>
and we preſerved in the day of tryal which muſt come upon all fleſh;
and ſo to grow from grace to grace, and from ſtrength to ſtrength,
and from one degree of holineſs unto another, that a daily growth
may be witneſſed in all; <hi>(further ſaying)</hi> Oh Friends! It is
the Life that the Lord looks at; for, he that hath the Son hath
Life, and he that hath not the Son hath not Life. Examine your
ſelves; no Son, no Life; without the Son, without Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus he Declared wonderfully and often, glorifying and
prayſing the Lord after this manner;</hi> Oh all that is within me,
praiſe and magnifie the Lord God, who is worthy for ever and ever
of all Glory; and everlasting Prayſes to the God of my Life, who
is only worthy, and lives over all, is above all, God bleſſed for ever.
Amen.</p>
               <p>And after this ſort did he often aſcribe living praiſes to the
God of his Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in his</hi> Declaration <hi>he ſaid,</hi> That what he had ſpoken, was
laid upon his Spirit by the Lord ſo to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Clarke</hi> asked him, If he knew him; and <hi>William</hi> anſwered, <hi>That

Clarke,</hi> the Candle being brought near, <hi>William</hi> wrung him hard

his Body was carried to the <hi>Bridge-Town</hi> (it being General

him, for as he lived, ſo he died, Preaching the Word of the

               <p>THE glorious day of God everlaſting is dawned, and
the light of his excellency hath ſhined by the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his heavenly virtue, through the thick clouds
of darkneſs, which hath long been as a Vail over
the hearts of the people of the Nations; during which time
the world was as a Wilderneſs that was untilled, and brought
forth Thiſtles, Thorns and Briars, in ſtead of Corn, Wine and
Oyl; but ſince it hath been the good pleaſure of the Lord of
the whole earth, to manifeſt the glory of his Spirit of <hi>burning</hi>
by the operation of Life, which appeareth through the Light
to burn up the <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns,</hi> and to ſow his <hi>good Seed.</hi>

               <p>Now thoſe whom the Lord hath been pleaſed ſo to ſend forth
he hath not ſent them <hi>empty,</hi> nor without the enjoyment of his

Lord, and Faithful Follower of the Lamb,</hi> William Simpſon,
<hi>who hath walked in faithfulneſs unto God, and followed the</hi>
Lamb <hi>through</hi> many Tribulations, and waſhed his Robes, and
made them white in his blood, and hath not loved his Life unto
Death, but hath fought the good fight, and by Faith hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;

of the moſt High for ever.</p>
               <p>And truly Friends, I cannot but give Teſtimony that he was
an <hi>Innocent Man</hi> (as himſelf alſo ſaid, when he was near
his laſt breath.) I have ſometimes known him in our native

Country, and then did his Life ſound forth his <hi>Innocency:</hi> and
having been here more than four Months, the ſame ſtate of
<hi>Innocency</hi> was found in him, even unto the day that it pleaſed
the Lord to take him from amongſt us, to reign with him in
Eternity.</p>
               <p>And as the Lord alone had made him a Preacher of his
Word, in the way of Righteouſneſs, in the time of his Life,
(as men of a right underſtanding can ſufficiently evidence) ſo
likewiſe in the ſame hour of his Death, he did wonde<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

was laid upon him from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he ſaid unto thoſe that were with him, <hi>That he was an
Innocent Man,</hi> and deſired them <hi>not to be troubled, but to let him
go.</hi> And now he is entred into everlaſting Reſt, in a Heavenly
habitation, having laid down his Head in Everlaſting Peace in
the glorious State of Eternity, where he doth reſt from his
Labours and his Works do follow him, beyond the reach of all
the Tyrants of the Earth, who can never come there except they
repent: But their day will aſſuredly have an end, and they muſt
come to Judgment before the Lord; and then let the ſtout-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongſt them ſtand up in the might of his ſtrength, and
<hi>gird up his Loyns like a Man, and contend with the Almighty
if he be able to anſwer him, when he calls to an account for the
deeds done in the Body:</hi> And where is he that <hi>knows his latter-end?</hi>
or whether this may be his laſt day here or nay, as the
two aforeſaid faithful Servants of the Lord have many times
reminded all People here, <hi>to remember their latter end, and to
ſtrive to make their Calling and Election ſure with the Lord,</hi> and
not to <hi>grieve the good Spirit of the Lord, by following vanity and

A

            <p>OH Church of <hi>England!</hi> This is unto thee, who liveſt in
oppreſſion and cruelty, pride and covetouſneſs; a day of
miſery is coming upon thee, thy nakedneſs and ſhame is coming
upon thee as an armed man, from which no man can hide thee,
neither Hills nor Mountains ſhall be able to hide thee in this the
Day of the Lord, neither ſhall the Clefts of the Rocks preſerve
thee from the Day of the Lords Controverſy with thee; Thy
nakedneſs and thy ſhame is near to come upon thee, from it
thou ſhalt not fly: Oppreſſion and cruelty hath been as a ſtaff
for thee, but the Lord is ariſen to break thy Staff of Oppreſſion,
and thou ſhalt be left naked, though thou haſt ſeemed to be the
glory of the Nations with thy deceitful covers, but now thou
ſhalt be left Naked, and Nations ſhall be aſhamed of thee.
Howl and weep ye Teachers, for the Lord is gathering his
people from you, and ye ſhall devour his flock no more. The
Day is coming upon you, that none ſhall buy your wares any
more, ye Marchants of <hi>Babylon:</hi> All your Scarlet colour the
Lord our God is coming to take off: Then your Nakedneſs ſhall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101794:8"/>
appear to many Nations, and you ſhall ſit as a Widdow, and
ther ſhall be none to comfort you; Diſtreſs and anguiſh ſhall
take hold upon you, and pain as a woman in travell, and is
not able to bring forth, ſo ſhall your miſery come upon you:
The Decree of the Lord is gone out againſt all unrighteouſneſs,
he will ſurely reward every one according to their works, for
as a troop of Robbers lye in wait for a Man, ſo a company of
Preiſts by conſent lye in wait to murther the Innocent Lambs
of God, and for their ſakes the Lord is riſen in his mighty
power to break the bonds of wickedneſs, and to ſet the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
free, for the Lord hath heard the groaning of his Seed,
and he is riſen to deliver, to bring it out of Captivity, and
from under the taskmaſters, where his Seed hath been long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

but he will reward the oppreſſors double into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms,
and his ſeed he will deliver.</p>
            <p>Oh howl and weep! your day is far ſpent, Night is coming
upon you that you ſhall not have a Viſion, nothing ſhall be left
to cover you: As naked ſhall you be ſpiritually, as my body hath
been temporally naked in many places in <hi>England,</hi> as a ſign
of the nakedneſs and ſhame that is coming upon the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> who liveth in oppreſſion and cruelty, and all who
lift up a weapon for her ſhall fall in the ſhame with her, which
will aſſuredly come to paſs; So all ſober people conſider your
ways, and turn to the light which comes from <hi>Ieſus,</hi> that with
it you may be gathered unto the Lord from the falſe Teachers
to the teachings of the Lord, from the falſe Worſhips to the
worſhip of the Lord in ſpirit and in truth; for a neceſſity was
laid upon me from the Lord God of Life and Power to be a
Sign: But before I was given up to the thing, it was as death to
me, and I had rather, if it had been the Lords will, have died
than gone on in this ſervice; But when the Word of the Lord
came unto me ſaying, <hi>Go on and proſper;</hi> It was ſweet unto me
as the honey and the honey Comb. And <hi>bleſſed,</hi> ſaith Chriſt,
