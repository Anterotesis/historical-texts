         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>To his Gnace <hi>George Buckingham,</hi> &amp;c. of
his miraculous Cure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. BY a Fall from your Horse, my
Lord, you have lost the use of
your right Hand; but by the
Prayers of a Roman Catholick
Priest, with the sign of the Cross, in the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost (when you vowed, and
promised to God, that if he should restore
you to your health again, you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Roman Catholick) you were forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
perfectly Cured. <hi>Confiteantur Domino
misericordiae ejus et mirabilia ejus fillius ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi>
Psal. 106. 9. <hi>Behold thou art made
whole, sin no more,</hi> John 5. 14. Hitherto,
my Lord, you have lived in Heresie and
Sin, henceforth be converted, and godly
given, and delay not, to pay and perform
what you have vowed and promised to
God: for <hi>An unfaithful and foolish promise
displeaseth him,</hi> Eccles. 5. 3. And it were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43239:3"/>
much better for your Lordship not to have
vowed at all, then not to perform after
you have vowed. Pay then your vows, my
Lord, else know that what happened to
you in Body, is but a type or figure of what
hereafter shall happen to your Soul; you
shall be cast off your Horse, that is, your
Soul shall be separated from your Body,
and you shall lose the use of your right
Hand, that is, your hope of everlasting
bliss shall fade, and perish for ever. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
therefore your promise, my Lord,
(which you have confirmed with an Oath,
no less then the holy and terrible Name of
God) <hi>and sin no more, least some worse thing
chance to thee,</hi> John 5. 14.</p>
               <p>2. Sin is the cause of all infirmities, sin
is the cause why some once perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
do fall again into a greater relapse.
<hi>When the unclean spirit departeth out of a Man,
he wandreth through places without water, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rest, and not finding, he saith, I will return
into my House whence I departed, and when he
is come, he findeth it swept with a Besome, and
trimmed; then he goeth, and taketh seven other
spirits worse then himself, and entring in they
dwell there, and the last of that man is made
worse then the first.</hi> Luke 11. so it is with
infirmities, and this is the reason why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who were sometimes cured by the man
of God, are as ill now again, or perhaps
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43239:3"/>
worse, then they were before. Therefore
let such as received benefit by him give
God thanks, pay their vows, and perform
their promise to him, and sin no more;
and so once made whole, they shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and kept whole and sound, as long
as it is to the glory of God, and good of
their souls.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Were not ten made clean, and where are
the nine,</hi> Luke 17. 17. How many tens?
how many thousands ha's been made clean,
and cured by this holy man to God? and
how few of them returned to give glory
and due thanks to God? Give glory then
to God, my Lord, give glory to God and
good example to others; be you this <hi>one</hi>
of the <hi>ten</hi> that returns and give glory and
due thanks to God for his benefits, become
a good and holy Roman Catholick, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your promise, and so God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
and bless your Grace. Amen.</p>
               <p>4. For your scruples in matters of Faith,
if your Grace have any, Read I beseech
you, my Lord, my little Book, entituled
<hi>The Reconciler of Religions;</hi> where I clearly
prove, First, Tha<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Roman Catholick
Church is the onely true way to God, out
of which no man can be saved: Secondly,
That the Protestant or Sectarian Religion
is but a meer cheat, a delusion, an heresie,
an heathenisme: Thirdly, That the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43239:4"/>
Catholick Church is the insallible and
inerrable Judge of all Controversies in
matters of Faith: Fourthly, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
or Sectarian Bible is not the Word
of God more then the Alcaran of the
Turks; and the old vulgar Latin Bible is
defended: Fifthly, That the Protestant
Bishops, Ministers, and Preachers are but
Cheaters and Deluders, false Prophets,
and Priests of <hi>Baal:</hi> Sixthly and lastly, All
our Adversaries objections answered and
confuted, to all which I suppose they will
not answer in haste, otherwise then <hi>thou
lyest Bellarmine,</hi> or some such way, which
shall not be enough for me, nor I believe
for any other sincere and reasonable man.

that the Church of Rome
was once a most excellent
flourishing Mother Church.
This Church could not
cease to be such, but she
must fall either by <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Schism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Apostasie</hi> is not onely
a renouncing of the Faith
of Christ, but the very
name and title to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
No man will ever say
that the Church of Rome
had ever such a fall, or fell
thus.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Heresie</hi> is an adhesion to some private
and singular opinion or errour in Faith,
contrary to the general approved Doctrine
of the Church. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
did ever adhere to any singular or new O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
disagreeable to the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Doctrine of the Christian World, I
pray you satisfie me to these particulars,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. By what general Councels was she
ever condemned? 2. Or which of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43239:5"/>
ever writ against her? 3. Or by what
authority was she otherwise reproved? For
it seems to me to be a thing very incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that so great a Church should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by every one that hath a mind to
condemn her.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Schism</hi> is a departure or division from
the unity of the Church, whereby that
bond and communion held with some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Church is broken and dissolved. If
ever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> divided her self
by Schism from any other Body of faithful
<hi>C</hi>hristians, brake Communion, or went
forth from the society of any elder Church,
I pray satisfie me to these particulars.
1. Whose company did she leave? 2. From
whom did she go? 3. Where was the true
Church that she did forsake? For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
a little strange to me, that a Church
should be counted schismatical, when there
cannot be assigned another Church differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from her (which from age to age hath
continued visible) from whence she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>

                  <p>Why then would you not hear
and obey the Holy Catholick Church, as
Christ and his Father, under pain of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
damnation commands thee? Do you
not know; that the Scripture affirmeth,
<hi>It is not every man that saith, Lord, Lord, to
Christ, shall enter into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
but he that doth the will of his Father,</hi>
Matth. 7. 21. But the Will of the Father is,
that every man hear Christ. <hi>This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son, him hear ye,</hi> Matth. 17 5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
every man, that heareth not Christ,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43239:6"/>
shall not enter into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
But Christ willeth and commandeth,
that every man hear the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17.
<hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that
despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
me, despiseth him that sent.</hi> Luc. 10. 16.
<hi>He that heareth not the Church, let him be unto
thee, as an Heathen and Publican,</hi> Mat. 18. 17.
Therefore every man, that heareth not the
Church, shall not enter into the Kingdome
of Heaven. Why then, I say, would you
not hear and obey the Church; which is
always Holy and Catholick? why would
you not believe all, whatsoever she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
to be believed? why forsake you
her? why follow you the Protestant?</p>

                  <p>Very well; because there is
but one Catholick Church; that is to say,
one Church, which is <hi>universal for time,
place, and believers,</hi> Luk. 1. 33. Mark 16. 15.
which is <hi>the faithfull people dispersed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world.</hi> St <hi>Augustin</hi> in <hi>Psalm</hi> 149.
which is <hi>the Light of the world, and a City
built upon a Mountain, that cannot be hid,</hi>
Matth. 5. 14. and consequently visible, and
known and easily discerned from Turks,
and Jewes, and Heathens, and Hereticks,
even by her name. But this Catholick
Church is the Romane Pontificial: for
Shee alone is the visible and known uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church, for time, place, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
All the rest are not universal for time,
place, nor believers; for they began of
late; they are but in few places; they are
but on handfull in respect of the Catholick
Church. Therefore they are mistaken, that
tell you, She is the Protestant.</p>
                  <p>4. Moreover, if the visible and known
Catholick Church cannot fail, or err in
matters of Faith, She must have alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
since Christs time, to this day,
without interruption, and errour: But the
visible and known Catholick Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fail, or err in matters of Faith; for She
is alwaies Holy: <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghost,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43239:7"/>
the Holy Catholick Church.</hi> (The Apostles
Creed.) She is <hi>the spotless Spouse of Christ,</hi>
Hos. 2. 9. with which <hi>her Head and spouse,
and the Spirit of Truth, abides for ever,</hi> Matth.
28. 20. John 14. 16. <hi>The pillar and firmament
of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. <hi>and the gates of Hell
shall not prevail against her,</hi> Matth. 16. 18.
Therefore She must have alwaies remained
since Christs time to this day, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,
&amp; errour. (Otherwise we could
have nothing sure.) But no <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ther visible

errour, but the Romane Pontificial:
Therefore the Romane Pontificial alone is
the visible and known Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>5. If any can say, that the Romane
Pontificial Church hath not alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
since Christs time to this day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
interruption, and errour, let him tell,
when was the Succession of her Bishops,
Pastours, and Believers interrupted; or
when, and wherein did She err; what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council condemned her; what holy
Father wrote against her. Or that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
any other visible Church on earth,
since Christs time to this day, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,

where is She? what is her name? what

Councils did She hold? what Hereticks
did She condemn? what Academies did
She confirm? what Churches, Monasteries,

                  <p>Sure, the Greek Church, or Churches,
have not alwaies remained, since Christs
time to this day, without interruption;
witness the world: nor yet without er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
for they Heretically deny the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Holy Ghost from the Father
and the Son, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Church
(which they call <hi>Reformed</hi>) is erroneous
and new; for it began with the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

was done by <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> as their

                  <p>But I ask them, that so glory in this

when they first boasted of the Spirit, and
began to reform the Church, were they not
(I say) then to be tryed?</p>

                  <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
                  <p>I know it very well; and though

                  <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
                  <p>They never yet could prove it, nor
ever shall: we defie them; and suppose
their Spirit were from God, yet still they
were to be tryed according to the Scripture.
1 John 4. 1. <hi>Beloved, believe not every Spirit;
but trye the Spirits whether they are of God;
because many false Prophets are gone out into
the world.</hi> Upon which words, even your
own newest Bible, in the Argument of this
Chapter, saith, He warneth them not to
believe all Teachers, who boast of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but to trye them by the Rules of the
Catholick Faith. Therefore they were to
be tryed: and so they were indeed tryed by
the Rules of the Catholick Faith; that is to
say, by a General Council, approved by the
Head, and received by the Body of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, and they were found guilty
of Apostacie &amp; pertinacious error, of going
out of the Catholick Church, and her reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Monasteries, contrary to their Rules
and Sacred Vows, into the world; of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
new Doctrine, prophesying falsely,
and consequently Anathematized and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for Hereticks, they and all their
followers, according to that of the Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
1. 9. <hi>If any Evangelize unto you contrary
to that you have received, be he Anathema.</hi>
Therefore the Reformed, or Protestant
Church is not the Catholick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:43239:8"/>The <hi>Independents,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> the

if they can, let them produce it. But the

                  <p>A <hi>Praeludium</hi> to the Miracles.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. ALL men naturally are moved in
matters of Religion, by Miracles;
nay some are so perverse, that otherwise
they cannot be moved. Whence considering
seriously with my self the perversness and
height of Infidelity the Sectaries and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
of this Nation are come to, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
thought it (as it were) needfull for
their conversion to the true Religion, that
God should send some one thereof that
would work Miracles before their faces.
Neither was I mistaken, as it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;
for God (<hi>who loveth the souls,</hi> Sap.
11. 27. <hi>and willeth that all men be saved, and
come to the knowledg of the truth</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4.)
of his infinite mercy and goodness, was
pleased to send them a Romane Catholick
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43239:10"/>
Priest, who, in confirmation of the holy
Romane Catholick Church, and of her
Tenets and Doctrines, was for the space of
five weeks dayly working Miracles before
their eyes; and would be longer, had not
they repelled him, and as it were judging
themselves unworthy of eternal life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him away; which the Turks or
most barbarous Infidels would not have
done, yet <hi>England</hi> has done this evil.</p>
               <p>2. Mountebanks and Cheaters are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but the man of God must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.
Foxes, that is, cunning Hereticks,
have holes; and Birds of the air, that is,
fantastical, frentick, mad Sectaries have
nests in <hi>England,</hi> but the man of God hath
not whereupon to lay his head. Not this
man (cry the Antichristian Pseudo-Bishops,
the Sons of Iniquity, and Fathers of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief)
not this man, but <hi>Barrabas.</hi> Of the
man of God then what shall be done? Let
him be banished, cry they. Blessed be God,
they did not cry, Take him away, Take him
away, Crucifie him; they were (though
against their nature) so civil, as to conten<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

themselves with his Banishment onely.
<hi>Amaziah</hi> (the Protestant Bishop) <hi>said unto
Amos</hi> (the holy man of God) <hi>O thou the
Seer, go flee thou away into the land of Iudah</hi>
(to <hi>Rome,</hi> or amongst Romane Catholicks)
<hi>and there eat thy bread, and prophesie</hi> (or work
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43239:10"/>
wonders) <hi>there. But prophesie no more at Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel</hi>
(at <hi>London,</hi> or amongst Hereticks) <hi>for it
is the King's Chappel, and it is the King's
Court.</hi> So the Protestant Bible, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 12,
13. But ours hath it somewhat other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and adds: <hi>Amos answered and said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Amasias,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou saist: thou shalt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
upon Israel;</hi> (that is, upon the Tribes
of <hi>Israel</hi> that fell from <hi>Iuda;</hi> that is to
say, upon Schismaticks, Sectaries, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
that fell from the Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church) <hi>and thou shalt not still</hi> upon (or
preach unto) <hi>the House of the Idol;</hi> (in
Hebr. it is <hi>Risus</hi>) that is to say, upon the
Idolatrous and ridiculous Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
See 3 <hi>Regum</hi> 12. 26, &amp;c. <hi>usque ad finem.
For which, thus saith the Lord: Thy Wife,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Amos</hi> 7. 16, 17. He must be banisht then:
and why? What harm has he done? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is contrary to the Protestant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
the rebellious and idolatrous Priests
of <hi>Bethel;</hi> because he is holy, they wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
because he would convert the Nation
to God, they would keep it in flavery to the
Divel; because he works Miracles, they
can work none: He must go therefore; he
is gone then, blessed be God, even while
they were consulting and saying, What
shall we do? for this man doth many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
He is gone even before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred:
if we let him go so, all will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43239:11"/>
believe and be converted by him; and the
Roman Catholick Bishops shall come, and
take both our Place, and our Dignity, which
we have wrongfully kept from them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
this hundred years. He is gone then.</p>
               <p>3. Notwithstanding good God hath
done his work, and his Servant whom he
hath sent, hath also in an high degree fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
his course: for even in the space of
those five weeks he wrought more Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
before their faces, then we read were
ever yet done, at any of the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
of <hi>England;</hi> it remains then, that
now they willingly believe and be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Holy Roman-Catholick Church,

heavy and just judgement of God which
hastens to fall upon them. Wo be to the
Sectaries and Hereticks of <hi>England,</hi> woe
be to them (if now they be not converted)
for if amongst the Turks and Infidels had
been wrought the Miracles, that hath been
done amongst them, they had done penance
in hair-cloth and ashes long ago. They have
seen devils cast out of possessed Bodies, the
Blinde restored to their sight, the Deaf to
their hearing, the Dumb to their speaking,
the Lame to their going: in fine they have
seen all sorts of infirmities cured before
their eyes, by a Member of the Holy Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholick
Church, in confirmation of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43239:11"/>
her Faith and Doctrines, which are the

told his Disciples <hi>should follow them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>

17, 18, &amp;c. so that they have no excuse, and
that such of them as have not seen those
Miracles may also have no excuse. but be
as well satisfied, as they that have. I
thought fit to present before their eyes, the
matter of a dosen (which is enough here)
of the persons upon whom some of those
Miracles were wrought; by whose proper
confession, and Neighbours relation they
may be informed of the truth, which is as
much satisfaction, as in reason they can
expect.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>1. SUch as desire to hear and know more
of those admirable wonders of our
Lord, let them hearken to publick Fame,
and enquire of Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> at the Queens
Chappel, and of Mr. <hi>Digby</hi> in <hi>Queens-Street,</hi>
and others that have taken particular Lists
of many of them, and they may further
inform them, if they please (as they ought;
for the great Mercies and admirable Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of God are not to be concealed, or hid
under a Bnshel.) I said of many of them,
because they could not of all: for this man
of God has wrought innumerable other
Mirac<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es also, in the face of the Church,
and in the view of the World, which are
not written in this little Paper, nor in their
Lists: and these are written that you may
believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick-Church;
and that believing, you
may have life everlasting. Amen.</p>
               <p>2. Here I could and would check all
such as stiff-necked and of uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
hearts and ears, do alwaies resist
the Holy Ghost, had I not stinted my self
to the <hi>August</hi> capacity or inscription of this
little Book, a great volume in <hi>Folio</hi> being
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43239:15"/>
ready to come forth, Entituled <hi>The most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Miracles wrought by the Reverend
Fathhr</hi> J. O. E. wherein all such Backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Murmurers are clearly confuted.</p>
               <p>3. In the mean time to such as say;
First, That he is a Cheater and Deluder,
and that what he does, is but Sorcery and
Witchcraft. Secondly, That many comes
to him, he cannot eure at all. Thirdly, That
to some he gives but little ease, or partly
cures them, not wholly Fourthly and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That others whom he hath cured, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
partly or wholly, do continue so but
a little while, and fall back again into a
relapse, and are afterwards as ill, or worse
then they were before; to all which one
after another I answer.</p>
               <p>4. To the First. The Jews said to Christ,
that in <hi>Beelzebub</hi> Prince of the Devils he
cast out Devils; who then can wonder,
hat Jewish Hereticks should say the like to
the Servant of Christ? If they called
Christ <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> Sedueer and Cheater,
who can think that their Successours the
Hereticks should give better Language to
his Disciple? Let them therefore say what
they will, and think what they please:
what then? they can prove nothing of
what they say, nor yet disprove what is
said and done against them. Certainly if
this holy man of God were a Seducer or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43239:15"/>
Cheater, as indeed he is not, he does not
seduce nor cheat us: for in casting out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and in all his Cures, he useth no
Charms, nor unknown words; but he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Prayers of the Holy Catholick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Church,
the Sign of the Cross, and the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost: so that if he were, I
say, a Deluder, he does not delude us, but
the Church, and Christ, who commands
us to hear and obey her. But Christ and his
Church cannot delude or deceive us,
therefore he is no Deluder nor Deceiver.
We never yet heard nor read, that Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
or Cheaters, or Thieves or Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or Witches or Wizards, or False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
or Priests of Baal, could, or did
work Wonders by the Sign of the Cross,
and in the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost (as he does)
Nay it's impossible they should, as we
proved in the <hi>Reconciler of Religions,</hi> chap 3.
num. 9. and elsewhere. Whence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with the holy Scripture, Iohn 9. 33.
<hi>If this man were not of God, he could not do
any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. To the second, I answer, did those
whom he could not cure at all deserve to
be cured? had they requisite faith to be
cured? was it to the glory of God and good
of their souls that they should be cured?
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43239:16"/>
forsooth you know not, why then do you
murmure? is't because some were cured,
all must be cured? is it because God is
good, you must be nought? cannot God
distribute his gifts as he will, and to whom
he please? why then, say you, does he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to cure all? I answer, you mistake Sir,
he does not pretend nor profess to cure all,
no nor any at all, but through the bowels of
Charity he receiveth all, and refuseth none,
and cures only such as please God. He is
not to the right or left hand of their cure,
but as please God, whence to whom God
please to give little, he gives little; and
to whom God is willing to give much, he
gives much, and that freely and <hi>gratis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. To the third I answer, were they who
received but a little cure, worthy of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
was the faith they had greater then
the cure they received? was it to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God and to the good of their souls
that they should receive more? neither
this do you know! why then do you back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite?
was not the least cure or benefit they
had by him, supernatural; and consequently
miraculous and from God? yes you will
say, why then do you despise or undervalue
it? forsooth because you are envious, or
ignorant, or both. No, say you, but <hi>Gods
works are perfect,</hi> Deut. 32. 4. I answer.
Gods works are perfect indeed (every
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43239:16"/>
work in its own kind) and therefore when
he gives a little ease, its his perfect work as
well as when he gives much, or wholly
cures: otherwise a man that's born blind
should not be the work of God, which to
affirm were absurd. Read <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 1, 3. and
<hi>Mark</hi> 8. 24, 25, 26. and see my former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to such objections in the Epistle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory
of the reconciler of Religions.</p>
               <p>7. To the fourth and last I answer, did
they who were once cured, and afterwards
fall into a relapse, give due thanks and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to God for his benefits bountifully and
<hi>gratis</hi> bestowed on them? did they amend
their life and conversation? did their good
works abound? did their faith continue or
persevere longer then their cure lasted?
did not St. <hi>Peter</hi> walk upon the water
while his faith was strong but when he
staggered, did he not begin to sink? did
he not hear said to him, <hi>you of little faith,
why didst thou doubt?</hi> Let themselves lay
hand on their brest and answer to this; for
your part you know nothing of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you may sit down, hold your peace,
and admire the wonderfull works of the
holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>8. But all such as have received any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by him, let them stand up and bless
God, and before all the world confess unto
him; for whether they have been cured
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43239:17"/>
partly or wholly, God hath shewed them
his mercies according to his good will, and
perhaps also according to their preparation
or merit <hi>de congruo.</hi> And if afterwards any
of them has fallen into a relapse, it was not
Gods fault, nor in any wise to be imputed
to his servant by whom he hath once so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, but either to themselves, or to
their demerits <hi>de condigno;</hi> or may be to
the further mercies and goodness of God
towards them, for his greater glory, and
everlasting good of their souls. <hi>Quis enim

Priest, a Seducer, a Witch, a Cheater, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and therefore we command thee speak no
more of him: for if you tell any man that
he cured thee, we will put thee in prison.
O potent Command! O wise Threatning!
Put me in prison, said he; You may indeed
imprison my body, if you please, but you
cannot imprison, confine, or coarct my
soul. While I have breath in my body, said
he, I shall openly acknowledg and confess
God's admirable Wonders; and respect
