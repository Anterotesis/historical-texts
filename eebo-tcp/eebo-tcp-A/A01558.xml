            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:3097:3"/>
armes are stretched out, and whose arrowes are keene, when he pleaseth to be auenged on his Enemies? Thou wast not thus long suffered but to Gods greater glorie. This said distraction continuing but a while, this caitiue re-assuming his former sences, forgetting all dutie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect vnto his Creator, and reiecting all soule sauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, after no long debatement betweene the Diuell and himself, he couenanted (wofull couenant?) that for the space of fortie yeares he might enioy the full fruition of his detested ambition, in holding the place, prerogatiues, liberties, and honors, of chiefe and principall Confessor, that he might haue power and meanes to know carnally all women or maides whatsoeuer on whom his perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lustfull eyes should but reflect, and that his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming tongue might flow with eloquence, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these, he might be still reputed graue and religious: to these may be added those ensuing Articles of his owne confession, to which the Diuell condescending, This firebrand of perdition gaue himselfe body and soule, together with all things else to him appropriate to the said Diuell from thenceforth for euer, hidiously renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing God his faith, Heauen, and the euer-blessed fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of all the holy Angels and Saints of God: who can reade this, or who can heare it, but their haire must stand on end! their hearts tremble?

Before the discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of these his impudent villanies, he was exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced, and very much respected by the <hi>Marcellian Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> yea in all places wheresoeuer he came, aswell for the religious apparance he carried, as also for the great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was knowne to be in him: for such was his fluence of spéech, that he could so tickle and charme the eares of his Audience, that it contented them perpetually to heare him, so mellifluously did he hony them, who were abused poore soules in their attention, &amp; falsely deluded with his Eloquence: which occasioned that he was then reputed for a most religious and deuout Priest, seruing for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Antidote against the poysonsome infection of sinne, as their shallow vnderstandings belieued for firme truth, who notwithstanding shortly after had knowledge of his diabolicall commerce. He held (notwithstanding he was in the Diuels hereditarie possession) all his Presbiterall functions, so that amongst others, he being one day in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie place, there hapned to come vnto him on Mistresse <hi>Magdalen</hi> of the Marish, requesting him to heare her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession (who was then vtterly ignorant of his fatall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishment of Religion) which at that time was graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her by the abhominable Impostor.</p>
            <p>This poore innocent maide therefore, humbled at the
<pb facs="tcp:3097:4"/>
féete of this Uulture, and requesting his counsell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise for reformation of her former errors and transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, heard no other perswasions to come from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish seducer, but cleane to shake off the zeale and desire that thee had to be reconciled to God; and further inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated vnto her, (with painted and colourable speeches, not fitte to bee once mentioned amongst Christians,) that it shee would liue the rest of her life happily, he would be the meanes that shee should obtaine and enioy whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer pleasure shee could desire or wish for. In this his perswasion, the prophane dogge breathed vpon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of this poore afflicted maide, who in that moment was inchaunted and intangled in the snares of this sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious villaine. Surely Hell it selfe had placed in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of this tyrant, some ghastlie and vncleane spirit, to bee as an Instrument and guide to this accursed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunter.</p>
            <p>Oh Heauens! Is it possible that such a hell-hound should bee permitted to liue amongst men? who inraged with an Infernall Furie, drawes and allures such sillie soules vnto him, as are not well grounded and confirmed in Faith; as we may plainely perceiue in this silly soule: who being catcht by the deceitfull ginnes of this disloyall Apostate, forsaking her God, and giuing credence to the wordes and proferd promises of this accursed Impostor; shée also (as hee formerly had done, and thereto now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded her) giues herselfe soule and bodie to the Diuell, whom at that instant she saw in the forme of a man.</p>
            <p>In which course of his, that they of <hi>Marcelles</hi> could not in so long space, discouer the Tragicall trecheries of this their so wel-beloued flatterer, whose Charmes &amp; inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments procured, that they estéemed him their spirituall minion, was wonderfull: for so excessiue was their bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les affection, that to haue exempted him from legal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they would haue (most of them) parted with all their wealth.

            <p>Now the matter knowne, and he vndertaking to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her pardon, forthwith hastened to <hi>Marcelles</hi> to the Court of Parliament, where giuing aduertisement of what had passed, to the Lord President, &amp; declaring vnto him what words the said <hi>Magdalen</hi> had vsed, inferring how for the seruice he ought to the Kings Maiestie and publike Iustice, considering the wonderful detriment that <hi>France</hi> had sustained in former times, by such trayterous Paracides and blood suckers, as she had brought forth, he was come in that manner.

Upon which her confession a warrant (by the instance of the Kings Atturnie Generall) was sent out for the bodily apprehension of the foresaid <hi>Lewis Gaufredy</hi> Priest, who being accordingly apprehended, was committed to the said common gale of <hi>Aix</hi> in prouince, till such time as it was conuenient for him, to make his open appearance in the said court, whether he was very speedily called, and as exactly examined of the crimes imputed vnto him, both by the foresaid <hi>Magdalen</hi> and Mistres <hi>Victoire Corbier</hi> But herein behold the deceitfull potencie of that old and subtill deceiuer the Diuell, who had fortified this his champion with such seeming Innocencie, and inabled him so much beyond all vulgar exspectation, that the whole Bench were not able to conuince or cast him: which thing being wel considered by one of the most ancient Commissioners, who perceiuing much subtiltie in his answeres moued by a feruent zeale to boult out the truth, he earnestly reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the residun of those Noble Commissioners to ioyne with him in prayer vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> all-searching eye of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, that he for his owne glorie sake would vouchsafe them power and meanes to discouer the falcities and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of this pernitious miscreant.

For the oftner I breathed, the madder she was of my loue and enioyance. I desired that the effect of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscences might come from her.

                        <p>I likewise confesse, that the Diuel said vnto me, that if I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> burnt the said promises, he would make such an horror and
<pb facs="tcp:3097:9"/>
terror, that I should fall downe dead to the ground.</p>
                        <p>I also confesse, that I kept all the said promises in my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> chamber, with the aboue mentioned booke of Magicke, and one day when I came from <hi>Aix,</hi> which was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time that I went thither to speake with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Michaell, Iacobyne,</hi> and <hi>Antonie Capuchin,</hi> when I came backe to my cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, I burnt the said booke of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, not vpon any intention to amend my life, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for feare to be found possest therewith, the Ashes of which booke, are yet in my chamber, for the couenants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was much astonished when I found them not, because the diuell had carried them away, euen as I told those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

                        <p>I further confesse, that I was marked at the Sabbath,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> by my owne consent, and that I also caused <hi>Magdalen</hi> there to be marked. She is marked in the head, in the heart, in the bellie, in the thighes, in the legges, in the feete, and in many other parts of her bodie: she hath also a needle in her thigh that she féeles not, which I sée him put in, and when the needle enters, you would say, that one pierced a péece of parchment.</p>
                        <p>I also confesse, that there are many sorcerers, inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and Magicians, who couer their markes, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they growe againe of themselues, and returne to their ancient forme: for this marke remaines alwaies with them, by reason of their vow of perseuerance, which they make in particular, when they giue themselues to the diuell.</p>

                        <p>I also confesse, that I haue bene often at the Saboth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> with <hi>Magdalen</hi> and cald her to swallow downe Caracters out of a spoone, by the ministration of diuels, and so others for my selfe, the more to enrage her, in my loue.</p>
                        <p>I also confesse, that at Saboth I had knowledge of her,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> and of a Princesse of <hi>Freefeland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:3097:10"/>I confesse, that I haue abused many Maides, whom I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> breathed vpon, out of the Saboth.</p>
                        <p>I confesse also: that the diuell is the true Ape of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> Church, performing at his Sabeth whatsoeuer is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Church.</p>
                        <p>Also I confesse, that they baptise in these Saboths, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> euery sorcerer makes a particular vow, giuing himselfe to the diuell, that he shall cause all his children to be baptised in the Saboth (if it to may be) as also names are imposed on euery one of them, which came to the Saboth, different from their proper names.</p>
                        <p>I further confesse: that at Baptisme they vse water,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> sulphure, &amp; salt, sulphure makes them slaues to the diuell, and salt confirmes their baptisme, to the diuels seruice.</p>
                        <p>I confesse moreouer: that the forme and prescription <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> thereof is, to baptise in the name of Lucifer, Belzebub and other diuels, making the signe of the Crosse, beginning it cleane backward, then prosecuting it by the féete, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the head.</p>
                        <p>I confesse moreouer: that there was twelue Priests at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> the Saboth, and how each one saies Masse, in his turne; the said Priests are set in very high places, as being the principalls of the Saboth: but there was one a notable ignorant, and blockheaded fellow.</p>
                        <p>Also I confesse, that whensoeuer I was at the Saboth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> I haue heard Masse, and vnderstood it well, but when it came to my turne, I caused it to be said by an other Priest of the Saboth.</p>
                        <p>I likewise confesse, that at the beginning of Masse, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> one prostrates himselfe on the ground, and a diuell it is that assists at Masse.</p>
                        <p>I confesse, that the candles which are burnt during <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> Masse, are of powder, and sulphure, and in stead of a torch at the eleuation of that accursed sacrament, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell assistant makes a great light, which stinkes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>

                        <p>I confesse, that the bell which rings to Masse, at the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> 
                           <hi>Sanctus</hi> and the <hi>Sacre,</hi> is of horne, the clapper being of wood, to make it sound.</p>
                        <p>Further I confesse, that wheresoeuer mention is made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> of the names of Iesus, of the holy Uirgin, or of the Saints they are taken away, and in their stead, they put too the names of diuels, it requires some studie to say Masse in these Saboths.</p>
                        <p>I further confesse, that they offer and consecrate vnlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> bread, and when there is none, they consecrate ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie bread, taking most ordinarily, the bottome crust of some loaues.</p>
                        <p>I also confesse, that many crusts &amp; péeces are consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> to be communicated to the Assistants, and when there is not vnder crusts enough, they take the vpper ends.</p>
                        <p>I confesse: that they pronounce on high, the words of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> consecration, whether it be of the body, or of the blood, and when the Sacrament is eleuated, euery one renounceth God alowd, and cryes, Maister helpe vs, addressing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to Lucifer, and other diuels.</p>
                        <p>I confesse, that they vse to consecrate blood in a vessel,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> and a very great bason, and after consecration made, the Priest that saies Masse, bathes therein, and then sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles it on the assistants.</p>
                        <p>I further confesse: that euery one takes of it in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> hands, and poores it on their heads, saying: his blood be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs; and vpon our children.</p>
                        <p>I confesse, that all the crosses which are made during <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the masse are made cleane a reuerse or backward, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Further I confesse, that when one saith: <hi>Agnus dei,</hi>

                        <p>I confesse furthermore: that euery one is bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> &amp; when he does not, he is bound, to giue his part to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a Diuell, who is tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sformed into a Dog: And I remember well, that the diuell, whose office this is, was sharply reprehended by others, for not discharging it well.</p>
                        <p>I confesse, how there be certaine Enchauntors, who are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> charged to bring a great dogge out of their villages, to eate vp that part of the communion which others will not eate.</p>
                        <p>I also confesse that when one saith: <hi>Ite Missa est;</hi> They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> say: <hi>Depart you all, in the Diuells name.</hi>
                        </p>

                           </hi> are bound when any Childe dies, which was baptised in the <hi>sabboth;</hi> to goe disenterre, and bring the same to the <hi>sabboth,</hi> there to be eaten by Diuels.</p>

Wherefore they laboured to make her forget her sorrow and griefe: But could not possiblie effect it; but she rather mournd still the more, and sobd for her Childe, saying:</p>
            <p>Alas! my deare Neighbours, if you haue hid her in any place let me know it, to the end I may be quiet, &amp; haue her bodie; &amp; then I alone will lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t her death.

            <p>The little Childe who was yet but young, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not tell, nor shew the place whether he had ledde his Sister, nor decipher the Sorceresse that had stollen her away; yet by signes he shewed his sorrowfull mother, the place where they were gathering Hedge-berries together, when (the accursed &amp; vnknowne Hagge) gaue him a little péece of siluer, to the ende hee should leaue her, and that her self might thus haue the better meanes to compasse her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and dispoyle this poore Gyrle of her virginitie, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering her into the hands of a fowle Ruffian: when this

But what's this I say? who could haue so barbarous an heart? I cannot belieue it fell out with her in such sort; when returning againe to her selfe, she said. What may I then suppose is become of my child? why heeres no place where she could doe her selfe any hurt? And thus her parents searched all ouer, but could heare no word of her, nor méete with other satisfaction, then to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the losse of their sillie young Daughter, who perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture had alreadie, vndergone the rage and crueltie of this hellish <hi>Megara.</hi> And for the space of one or two dayes, they could not remaine pacified, but continued in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, while they met with a childe, who had conducted her along to that part &amp; place, where the miscrea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t creature cut her throate. But they durst not bee so bolde at that insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to goe thither, without taking some aduise therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; fearing least some greater inconuenience might arise thereupon. The blood of this poore Maide beganne now to calll for vengeance at Gods hands: and then God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that the murder committed vpon her should be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested as it was.</p>
            <p>For hauing obtained a Warrant from the Iustice, they apprehended at the same instant, the shamelesse Sorceresse, but shée being resolu'd on all mischiefe, would not confesse her fault, but was stout and obstinate in her denialls: So that her deliuery was wrought, to the charge and cost of the innocent maides Parents, procured by the rest of that diabolical crew; which wrought their greater sorrow and discomfort then before, being now voyde of all meanes to discouer the trueth, or to come to the knowledge of their

Childes ruine, though bitter griefe neuer left their harts, whensoeuer she came into their remembrance: this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter séeming wholly to be blowne ouer, and no further spéech nor talke hereof vsed.</p>
            <p>This murderesse, at that very time had not yet commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the butcherie, as afterwards her selfe confessed: but the Gyrle was close shut vp in a chamber, whether this Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse, with the rest of her adherents presently went, and so amongst them presently cut her throate. Alas poore heart, shée being no wayes able to resist their violence, said: Alas, my good mistresses, Alas, Kill me not for Gods sake, saue my life, and suffer me to goe &amp; see my Mother once againe, and I vow vnto you, no bodie shall know, what hath bene done vnto me in your house. But then they all layd hold vpon her, and held her, while this old witch cut her throate with a great Knife, and not content therewith they pluckt the heart and lyuer out of her bellie, and stéeped them in her blood, that afterwards they might giue them to a Sorcerer, who had bought them of them, consuming the rest of her bodie within an Ouen, putting the Ashes thereof into a poake, as before I declared vnto you.</p>
            <p>Now this damnable consort, thought themselues out of all perill, and daunger, but it fell out quite contrarie; for they were all taken, vpon the instant, that they meant to haue fled the Countrey.

death; so as to death they were all condemned, &amp; endured those paines &amp; tortures, which we formerly declared vnto you: But alas! what good got y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sorrowful mother by this? could this mittigate or appease her woe? can this giue againe vnto her the life of her child? alas, alas! notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this Infernall hagge suffered Condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the reuenge of her Childes death, yet did not this wipe out of her heart, the remembrance thereof, nor the griefe which daily afflicted her, when she saw but the place where her child was violated, and most vnhappily murdered. And you the rest of her Friends, &amp; Kinsfolkes, can you euer forget such an opprobrie: can this damsell euer slippe out of your reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, whom you so dearely loued? no certainely, for then your hearts should be too much destitute of common humanitie: In like manner all you men, &amp; woemen, that were present at their deaths, will you not alwaies carrie in minde such a butcherie and Tyrannie, will you not euer remember the day of their punishment? you mothers also which haue children, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in the like case<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the like perill and daunger as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this woman, would you not lament? ah would you not gréeue for the violent death of your owne blood? I verily thinke your hearts would be surprised, with as great bitternes and affliction, as hers was after the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her childe, next which is more, the remembrance of the very day when you came to the knowledge of her death would torment you. For my part I know not one in the world, that would faile in so kind and naturall an office, and therefore I neither blame father or mother in this point, (except the mother in regard of her too vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sorrow which caused her desperately to kill her selfe) for who can preserue themselues from miserable afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, except by the speciall grace and goodnes of the celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all mouer, who preserues and kéepes this our life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts it to the place of its saluation. He, he it is, that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

vouchsafe vs his saueguard, &amp; no other. If therefore, we euer loued his sanctitie and holinesse, and neuer heard of a more lamentable, and pittiful spectacle then this was, we ought alwayes to beare and carrie it in minde: For who would haue thought that a maide only of fourtéene yeeres of Age, the daughter of <hi>Marguerite Gallon,</hi> could haue had the stomacke &amp; boldnesse, to deliuer this Maid of ten yeares olde, and to sell and betray her into the handes of others; for so small a summe of money, shee receiuing in all, but <hi>(three &amp; twentie souz:)</hi> a base piece of Coyne.</p>
            <p>Surely I cannot thinke shee could performe this villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie without her mothers consent, &amp; yet her selfe alone was in the greatest part the cause of this hard Accident, which likewise did not remaine vnpunished: For she endured and suffered the like death and punishment as her mother did: shée, as her mother before her, deseruing the fire before her death. But thus this Innocent maid, whome shee sold to this accursed Enchanteresse, cruelly lost her life, to all the peoples great griefe in generall, &amp; euery ones high discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. You sée therefore, how this Prodigie came to bee discouered, and how a sillie Damzell was destroyed, through the bloodie crueltie of most miscreant creatures, who thought their vniust malice, would neuer haue come to light. But GOD not permitting them long to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue, suffered likewise that they should come into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of deuine Iustice, the which (by his Prouidence, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, and the punishment of a most cruell death, they haue suffered and endured, although nothing so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as their enormious impietie deserued.</p>
            <p>Where finishing this our present discourse; Let vs pray vnto GOD, that it would please him, to bring to an end this worldes vnhappinesse, and to diuert all the impious desseignes and practises of the wicked: drawing them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by his Diuine prouidence, to repentance and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from their sinnes; to the end that those benefites may
