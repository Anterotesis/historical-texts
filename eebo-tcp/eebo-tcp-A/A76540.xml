         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thought good to relate unto you, the ſervice lately performed here in theſe parts. On Thurſday night laſt, about eight a clocke there was command given, for a party of a thouſand foot or thereabouts, to be ready to march the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by two of the clocke; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they met at their Rendevouze at <hi>Lathbury</hi> a mile here hence, where a brave parry of horſe of our owne, and Colonell <hi>Norwiches</hi> met with us, and were our Van and Reare-gaurd, ſo we marcht with foure peeces of Artillery towards <hi>Grafton Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,</hi> ſix miles off from this place, where we underſtood that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112611:3"/>
our Enemies were incloſed in a ſtrong houſe of the Ladie <hi>Craines,</hi> and the Church of the ſame Towne: whereupon we faced it, &amp; leaving it on our right hand, we marcht forward towards <hi>Toxiter,</hi> as though we had beene bound thitherward. But when wee came within a mile of the ſaid Towne of <hi>Toxiter,</hi> wee met with a party of horſe and foot that came from <hi>Northampton</hi> for our aſſiſtance, under the command of Colonell <hi>Wettam,</hi> whereupon wee faced about, and the party of the Orange Regiment, which before brought up the Reare, then marcht in the Van, and Colonell <hi>Williams</hi> Forces followed in the Reare of the party that came from <hi>Newport.</hi> But when we came within ſight of the houſe, the old ſouldiers of my Lords outmarcht, us, and gave the onſet on the houſe very couragiouſly, and were as bravely anſwered, and by reaſon of the ſtrength of the walls, and well fortifying of the ſame, our Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers did them ſmall injury at that time; whereupon there were two of our peeces planted againſt the houſe, and playd upon it, but they did not much annoy them neither. On the Saturday morning the Orange and Greene Regiments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved my Lords ſouldiers, and when any advantage could be gained againſt our Enemies, we made uſe of it. They within had very long pieces, and could reach us at a great diſtance. At our guard we having found a convenient place to plant a piece, made uſe of it, &amp; beat down with our Sacre before Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday night a breaſt work on the top of the houſe, which had done us much annoyance, &amp; alſo a window whereat they ſhot out at us. On <hi>Sunday</hi> morning we were relieved by thoſe <hi>Northampton</hi> forces, under the command of Colonell <hi>Wettam,</hi> and about two houres after, he had the guard, they within ſounded a parley but through the eagerneſſe of the Souldiers the Drum, was ſhot, but not ſlaine out right,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112611:3"/>
whereupon they ſent out a Trumpet and had parley gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for halfe an houre, and after that another halfe houre, ſo then they yeelded themſelves priſoners being in number nineſcore and ſeven beſides Officers whereof Sir <hi>Iohn Digby</hi> was chiefe, there was another Officer of note viz. Major <hi>Brookbanck,</hi> and diverſe Captaines, ſome of them men of about 700 <hi>li,</hi> yeare a piece whoſe names are to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. About two of the clocke on Sunday the ſouldiers entered the houſe, where they found great and rich plunder, which they had for their paines; In the taking of this houſe wee loſt about 20 men and had hurt 10, beſides 9 that were hurt by our own powder, on Chriſtmas day before day, order was given to fire our huts which we had made in the field, and for prevention of future inconveniences the houſe was fired alſo, ſo we marcht with our priſoners (guarded by thoſe others forces that aſiſted us) towards <hi>Newport,</hi> very weary by reaſon of the fouleneſſe of the weather and deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the way, but praiſed be God we came ſafely thither, where we now lye expecting reliefe every day, that we may come and reſt our ſelves. I thanke God that neither my ſelfe nor any of my ſouldiers are hurt, nor not one of our Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſlaine, notwithſtanding we were in great danger and hazard, I beſeech God make us thankfull for this preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of us, there were ſome that came to us on our guard as ſpectators, being a ſurvayor of the workes, and a Captain of a Troope of Horſe ſlaine at one ſhot, and alſo a Gunner that belonged to the Sacre, in our guard. I pray remember my love to my neighbours, ſo with my beſt reſpect unto you, I reſt.</p>
