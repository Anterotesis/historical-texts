            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>ALL you that Fathers be,</l>
            <l>look on my miſery,</l>
            <l>Let not affection fond,</l>
            <l>work your extremity,</l>
            <l>For to advance my Son,</l>
            <l>in Marriage wealthily,</l>
            <l>I have my ſelf undone,</l>
            <l>without all remedy,</l>
            <l>I that was wont to live</l>
            <l>uncontroul'd any way,</l>
            <l>With many checks and taunts,</l>
            <l>am grieved every day:</l>
            <l>Alack and woe is me,</l>
            <l>I that might late command,</l>
            <l>Cannot have a bit of Bread,</l>
            <l>but at my Childrens hand.</l>
            <l>While I was want to ſit,</l>
            <l>chief at the Tables end,</l>
            <l>Now like a Servant ſlave,</l>
            <l>muſt I on them attend,</l>
            <l>I muſt not come in place</l>
            <l>where their friends merry be</l>
            <l>Leſt I ſhould my Son diſgrace,</l>
            <l>with my unreverency,</l>
            <l>My coughing in the night,</l>
            <l>offends my Daughter-in-Law,</l>
            <l>My deafneſs and ill ſight,</l>
            <l>doth much diſliking draw,</l>
            <l>Fie on this doting fool,</l>
            <l>this crooked Churl (quoth ſhe)</l>
            <l>The Chimney-corner ſtill,</l>
            <l>muſt with him troubled be,</l>
            <l>I muſt riſe from my Chair,</l>
            <l>to give my Children place,</l>
            <l>I muſt ſpeak Servants fair,</l>
            <l>this is my woful caſe.</l>
            <l>Vnto their friends they tell,</l>
            <l>(I muſt not ſay they lye)</l>
            <l>That they do keep me here,</l>
            <l>even of meer Charity.</l>
            <l>When I am ſick in bed,</l>
            <l>they will not come me nigh,</l>
            <l>Each day they wiſh me dead,</l>
            <l>yet ſay i'le never dye:</l>
            <l>O Lord an't be thy will,</l>
            <l>look on my woful caſe,</l>
            <l>No honeſt man before,</l>
            <l>ever took ſuch diſgrace.</l>
            <l>This was the Old man's plaint</l>
            <l>every night and day,</l>
            <l>With woe he waxed faint,</l>
            <l>but mark what I ſhall ſay.</l>
            <l>This rich and dainty pair,</l>
            <l>the young-man and his Wife,</l>
            <l>Though clog'd with Golden Coin,</l>
            <l>yet led a grievous life.</l>
            <l>Seven years they married were,</l>
            <l>and yet in all that ſpace,</l>
            <l>God ſent them ne'r an Heir,</l>
            <l>their Riches to imbrace:</l>
            <l>Thus did their ſorrow breed,</l>
            <l>joy was from them exil'd,</l>
            <l>Quoth ſhe, a hundred pound,</l>
            <l>would I give for a Child:</l>
            <l>To have a joyful Child,</l>
            <l>of my own body born,</l>
            <l>Full oft I am revil'd,</l>
            <l>of this my barren Womb:</l>
            <l>Much Phyſick did ſhe take,</l>
            <l>to make a fruitful ſoil,</l>
            <l>And with acceſs thereof,</l>
            <l>her body ſhe did ſpoyl.</l>
            <l>Full of grief full of pain,</l>
            <l>full of each grew ſhe then,</l>
            <l>That ſhe cries out amain,</l>
            <l>ſeek for ſome cunning men.</l>
            <l>That I my health may have,</l>
            <l>I will no money ſpare,</l>
            <l>But that which ſhe did crave,</l>
            <l>never fell to her ſhare.</l>
            <l>Alack, alack, ſhe ſaid,</l>
            <l>what torments I live in,</l>
            <l>How well are they apaid,</l>
            <l>that truly eaſe can win:</l>
            <l>So that I had my health,</l>
            <l>and from this pain was free,</l>
            <l>I would give all my wealth,</l>
            <l>that Bleſſed day to ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>O that I my health had,</l>
            <l>though I were ne'r ſo poor,</l>
            <l>I car'd not though I went,</l>
            <l>begging from door to door:</l>
            <l>Fie on this muck, quoth ſhe,</l>
            <l>it cannot pleaſure me,</l>
            <l>In this my woful caſe,</l>
            <l>and great extremity.</l>
            <l>Thus liv'd ſhe long in pain,</l>
            <l>all comfort from her fled,</l>
            <l>She ſtrangled at the laſt</l>
            <l>her ſelf within the bed.</l>
            <l>Her Husband full of grief,</l>
            <l>conſumed wofully,</l>
            <l>His body pin'd away,</l>
            <l>ſuddenly he did dye:</l>
            <l>E're thirteen years were paſt,</l>
            <l>dy'd he without a will,</l>
            <l>And by this means at laſt,</l>
            <l>the old man living ſtill;</l>
            <l>Injoy'd his Land at laſt,</l>
            <l>after much miſery,</l>
            <l>Many years after that,</l>
            <l>liv'd he moſt happily.</l>
            <l>Far richer then before,</l>
            <l>by this means was he known:</l>
            <l>He helpt the ſick and ſore,</l>
            <l>the poor man overthrown.</l>
            <l>But this was all his Song,</l>
            <l>let all men underſtand,</l>
            <l>Thoſe Parents are accurſt,</l>
            <l>live on their Childrens hand.</l>
