            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Gods Remarkable Judgements against Pride.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in the two former learned Tractates, bearing Title of <hi>The Theatre of Gods Iudgements inflicted upon the severall breaches of the Ten Commandements;</hi> so now, to these we adde a third Tract, <hi>Of his most remarkable punishments of the seaven deadly sinnes;</hi> and these il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated by sundry notable Examples, aswell Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick as Forraine. And because <hi>Pride</hi> was the first, which began in the Angels, and hath since infected all mankinde, from our <hi>Protoplasti</hi> (our first Parents) <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and hath continued through all generations hitherto; and shall in their posterity, even to the last disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: I derive my first Discourse from that.</p>
            <p>There be foure sorts of <hi>Pride,</hi> by which every insolent and arrogant man <note place="margin">Foure Species of Pride.</note> discovereth himselfe: For instance, when those good parts (if he have any) of which he is possest, he apprehendeth meerely to spring from himselfe; or when those which he acknowledgeth to be conferred from above, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth to his owne merit; or when he boasteth to have, what indeed hee hath not; or when despising others, he covets to be singular in himself. This sinne was borne in Heaven, but so suddenly precipitated thence, that it could never since finde the way backe againe thither: all other vices are onely at warre with these particular vertues, by which they are overcome; as <hi>Inchastity, Chastity; Bounty, Avarice; Wrath, Patience;</hi> and so of the rest: <hi>Pride</hi> is not with that contented, as to oppose <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> but it rageth against all the vertues of the minde, and like a generall pestiferous disease, striveth to putrifie and infect them all: For <hi>Pride</hi> in riches makes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40285:3"/>
men the more covetous: In idlenesse, scorning labour; in wrath, more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious; in gluttony, more intemperate; in envy, more malicious: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any mortiferous sinne, in which <hi>Pride</hi> is not a supreame agent; The signes thereof are boldnesse in language; sullennesse in silence; arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in mirth; murmuring in melancholly; and despising all others, doa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aesop</hi> being asked by <hi>Chian,</hi> What he thought <hi>Iupiter</hi> was at that time doing? made answer, Hee is now dejecting the proud, and exalting the humble. And the famous Philosopher <hi>Aristotle,</hi> spying a rich young man (but altogether unlearned) strutting along the streets, with a proud affected gate; and his eyes so elevated towards Heaven, as if hee despised the earth, whereon he troad; came to him, and said, friend, Such as thou thinkest thy selfe to be, I wish I were; but to be such as thou art, I wish onely to mine enemie. This also <hi>Socrates</hi> with great modesty reproved in <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who finding himselfe suddenly puft up with his extraordinary abundance in riches, and much to glory in his many spoyles and victories, he drew him into a private Gallery; and shewing him a Cosmographicall Table of the World, bid him looke in what part of the Map he could spy all his great Trophies and Triumphs? And when hee answered him, They were not there to be seene; <hi>Socrates</hi> replyed, <hi>Cur igitur ob illa superbis, quae circa nullam terrae partem existunt?</hi> that is, Why then art thou so proud of these things which are not visible in any part of the earth?</p>
            <p>Neither was the Church it selfe free from this sinne in the dayes of learned Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> who in one of his Sermons thus complaines. Thou shalt see many in the Church, who from obscure parentage being enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and from poverty made rich with pride, so suddenly tumor'd and tympanized, that forgetting from whence they came, have contemned their parents, and blusht at their owne births: Thou shalt see also some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious persons aspire unto Ecclesiasticall honours, and then pretend to themselves a seeming sanctity, by changing of their vestures, not their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and their manner of habit, not their mindes; esteeming themselves to deserve that dignity which they have insidiated by deceit, and which (I scarce dare say) have attributed that to their merit, which they have bought with their money.</p>
            <p>But as the smoake, which of its owne nature is blacke and obscure, yet covets to ascend from a light and bright flame; but in the midst of its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reluctation, resolves it selfe into aire; and so vanishing, loseth both nature and name: So the proud and ambitious, howsoever coursly and obscurely parted, yet will elevate and advance himselfe above others; yet in his striving to stand high, is often precipitated, and loseth both his place and memory; Behold (saith the Prophet) <hi>He that lifteth up himselfe,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Habbak. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>his minde is not upright; but the Iust shall live by his faith.</hi> Yea, indeed, <hi>The proud man is as he that transgresseth by Wine, therefore shall he not endure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath enlarged his desire as the Hell, and is as death, and cannot be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but gathereth unto him all Nations, and heapeth unto him all people: shall not all these take up a Parable against him? and a taunting Proverbe, and say, Ho, he that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and be that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himselfe with thicke clay? Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee? and awake that shall stirre thee? and thou shalt bee their prey; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause &amp;c.</hi>

How <hi>Pride</hi> hath beene severely punished by the Almighty, we finde fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent examples in the holy Text: It was punisht in our first Parents by their Exile out of Paradise. In the Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> (who said, <hi>Come let us build us a Citie and a Tower, whose top may reach up to the Heaven, that we may get us a name, &amp;c.)</hi> In their scattering over the face of the earth, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of their Languages: In <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> by raining down fire and brimstone upon their Cities and people: In <hi>Miriam</hi> the sister of <hi>Moses,</hi> by Leaprosie: In <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the same proud Prince comming after with great dishonour from <hi>Persia,</hi> the God Almighty stroke him with an invisible and an incurable plague, by a paine in his bowels, which was remedilesse, and which grievously tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented him in the inner parts; for so he had tormented other mens bowels with divers cruell and strange torments; yet would not hee cease from his arrogance, but swelled the more with pride, against Gods owne people to destroy them; and commanded to haste his journey for that purpose: but so it was, that he fell downe from the Chari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t that ranne swiftly, and all the parts and members of his body were bruised. Thus he who but a day before thought hee might command the Flouds, (such was his Luciferian pride, beyond the condition of man) and to weigh the high mountaines in the ballance, was cast on the earth and carried in an horse-litter; declaring unto all the world the manifest power of God: so that the wormes came out of his body in abundance, and his flesh dropt from his bones with paine and torment, and all his Army was grieved at his smell: No man
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40285:4"/>
could now endure him because of his stinke, who but a little before, thought with his hands he might reach the starres of Heaven: And then (though too late) he began to abate his haughty and peremptory insolence; when being plagued, he came to the knowledge of himselfe by the just scourge' of God; and by his inward torments which every moment increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon him: and when he himselfe could not abide his owne favour, he said, It is meet for man to be subject to God, and that he who is but mortall should not oppose himselfe against his Maker.</p>
            <p>The like punishment we reade of in the person of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> who came <note place="margin">Nicanor.</note> unto Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> whom the Priests and the Elders of the people went forth of the Sanctuary to salute peaceably, and to shew him the daily burnt offerings for the King; but he laughed at them and derided their devotion, accounting them meerely prophane, and spake proudly, and sware in his wrath, If <hi>Iudas</hi> and his Hoast be not delivered into mine hands; If ever I shall returne in safety, I will burne up this house, &amp;c. and so departed thence in great fury: but observe the event of his so great ostentation and insolence. <hi>Iudas</hi> after some few dayes (though against infinite oddes) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving slaine <hi>Nicanor</hi> in battaile, and routed his whole Army, he caused his head to be struck off, and that arme and hand which he had so proudly lifted up against the Temple of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and brought them to <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and there caused them to be hanged up, as a remarkable judgement.</p>

            <p>And <hi>Nero,</hi> the Arch-tyrant since <hi>Adam,</hi> after he had filled the Earth <note place="margin">Nero Casar.</note> with many insolencies, and <hi>Rome</hi> (the theu Worlds Metropolis) with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Rapes, Murders, and Massacres, not sparing his neare Kinsman <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicum,</hi> his corrivall in the Empire, nor his great grave and learned Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Master <hi>Seneca;</hi> to make himselfe unparalleld in all kinde of parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidy, He caused the wombe of his owne naturall mother <hi>Agrippina</hi> to be ript up before his face, onely in an ambition to discover the place of his first conception; notwithstanding which inhumanities, hee was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with an ardent desire of future memory, that by a publike Edict he proclaimed that the moneth <hi>April</hi> should lose its ancient name, and be called after his owne appellation, <hi>Nero;</hi> and the Citie of <hi>Rome, Neropolis:</hi> Yet this proud man in the end, being quite abandoned and forsaken of all his Sycophants and oily flatterers, was glad to fly from his Royall Court to seeke refuge in a rustick Cottage; and with greater terrour to his owne conscience, then before he had used tyranny upon the carkasses of others; he was compelled to fall upon his sword, his body being after, most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly dragg'd through the streets of the Citie, with more bitter execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and curses, then before he had lived houres or minutes.</p>

For instance, The rurall Girle being a little flattered, shall be easily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be a rare courtly Gentlewoman: nay, even kitchen-maides have held competitorship with Court Madams; no lesse proud, though perhaps lesse painted; and the very course Coridon will scarce give precedence to the complementall Courtier, thinking himselfe as well accommodated in his rustick russet, as the other in his richest raiment. In the like manner I could goe thorow all qualities, and <hi>A minimo ad maximum,</hi> from the least to the greatest, which for brevities sake I omit; desiring rather to satisfie the judicious Reader with matter then manner; the substance, and not sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of discourse.</p>
            <p>And yet to looke a little further into the nature of this deadly sinne, <note place="margin">The nature of Pride.</note> which hath all the other, its concomitants and attendants. <hi>Plato</hi> saith, he that knoweth himselfe best, esteemeth himselfe least; and husbandmen bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter value those eares of graine which bow downe their heads from the stalke, and waxe crooked, then those that erect themselves and stand upright; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they presume to finde more corne in the first than in the last. Pride (saith Saint <hi>Augastine)</hi> is the mother of Envy, and he that knoweth how to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40285:5"/>
suppresse the mother, may easily finde the way to bridle the daughter. <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh King of France, was woont to say, That whensoever Pride sate in the saddle, mischiefe and shame rid upon the cropper: One compareth <note place="margin">S.

In briefe, Pride eateth gold and drinketh blood, and climeth so high by other mens heads, that in the end it breaketh its owne neck. I cannot stand to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into severall branches or heads, but proceed directly on to Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie.</p>
            <p>Let all such, prided in their owne selfe-conceited knowledge and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, be attentive to a story extracted from a learned and grave Spanish <note place="margin">An excellent <hi>Spanish</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry against pride in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> Chronologer; by him to this purpose related. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of Spaine, being a very wise, learned, and discreet Prince, was woont to devise many darke and difficult problems, proposing them to his Lords and Peeres; to shew his owne excellent wisdome, and to taske their ignorance, who had spent their time in more loose and idle studies: amongst others there was a Knight in the Court called <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> one who was very confident in his owne wisedome, and would undertake to make solution of what difficulty soever the King at any time propounded; of which hee so insolently boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, that comming to the Kings eare, he was much incensed thereat; and to let him know what distance his weaknesse had from essentiall wisedome, he caused him to be sent for; and when he, according to his summons made appearance before him, the King at the first, to humour his selfe-conceit, began much to applaud his witty and ready answers, which not a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, but at the length concluded somewhat more sharply, telling him that he would propose three Problems; of the interpretations of which, if hee could not within one and twenty dayes give him a true and plenall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, both his life and goods were immediately forfeit to the crowne; and this sentence notwithstanding any meanes or mediation, no way to be altered. The three Questions were these, which he delivered unto him in writing:</p>
            <p>The first,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>What hath mans labour most increast, <note place="margin">The 3. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note>
               </l>
               <l>Yet of it selfe desires it least.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The second,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>What hath to man most honour gain'd,</l>
               <l>And yet with least lust is maintain'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The third,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>What thing is it men soonest rue,</l>
               <l>Yet they with greatest charge pursue.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>These he no sooner received, but the King with a contracted brow depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so left him; by which he might easily conjecture in what a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous streight he was now environ'd: and returning very sad home, and having long ruminated upon these riddles, but wanting an <hi>Oedipus</hi> to unfold them, he grew into a deepe melancholly, insomuch that he abstained both from meat and sleepe: which observed by his daughter <hi>Petronella,</hi> a faire and beautifull virgin, of some sixteene yeares of age, or thereabout, she so farre insinuated into her fathers discontents, and to know the cause thereof; that at length upon her great importunity he unfolded the whole matter unto
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40285:5"/>
her: who after some pawse, began greatly to comfort him, and told him she would interpose her selfe betwixt him and all danger; who though he had little hope to be relieved by her, yet out of his indulgence towards her, not willing to crosse her, especially in so desperate a case, he told her hee would be swayed according to her direction; which was, that upon the day prefixed she might goe with him to appeare before the King, and that to her he would commit the solution of these questions; which was agreed upon betwixt them.</p>
            <p>Imagine the day come, and the King attended by his Lords and Peeres, seated in his Throne, to expect <hi>Don Pedroes</hi> answer; who presenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before his Majestie, attended with his daughter; (who was very sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously attyred) besought his Majestie, that whilest he himselfe was silent, he would vouchsafe to heare what his daughter could say concerning these problems before propounded.</p>
            <p>The King much taken on the sudden with her beauty and modest behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and in a great expectation whether shee were able to deliver her selfe in language answerable to the former, gave her free liberty of speech; when bowing her face to the earth, and after setling her selfe upon her knees, she began as followeth: Wonder you may my Royall Leige, that so grave and experienc't a Knight as my father here present, should lay all his fortunes both of life and livelyhood, upon so weake and infirme an apprehension, which cannot be better expected from my tender yeares, and immature knowledge; yet since his confidence is so farre built on me, and your high Majestie so gracious to accept of me, I make bold thus further to proceed.</p>
            <p>Touching the first Question,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>What hath mans labour most increast,</l>
               <l>Yet of it selfe desires it least.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>In my weake understanding, I take it to be the Earth, the mother of all <note place="margin">The Earth.</note> creatures, rationall or irrationall, sensitive or vegetative; which though men daily digge and delve, plow or furrow, mine and undermine, trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her sides and wounding her intrayles, not suffering her to have the least cessation of rest in any of the foure seasons; yet she in her owne fertility and annuall vicissitude without these injuries, is able of her selfe to yeeld herbs and flowers, grasse and hay, plants and trees, with food and sustenance in abundance to all creatures bred upon her (still teeming) wombe; who, as she delivers them into the world, not onely fosters and cherisheth them, but when their Date is runne, and their time expired, receiveth them again into her owne breast, from whence they had their first being.</p>
            <p>Touching the second, I take it to be Humility; which teacheth a man <note place="margin">Humilitie.</note> how to rule his affections, and to keepe a mediocrity in all his actions. The high Creator dwelleth in Heaven, and if wee arrogantly lift up our selves unto him, he will fly from us; but if we humbly bow our selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he will descend downe upon us. <hi>Humilitas animi, sublimitas Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani;</hi> In Humility is a Christian mans mindes sublimity: It stirs up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, augmenteth good will, supports equity, and preserves a common weale in safety; It is apt to repentance, hungring after righteousnesse, and conversant in deeds of mercy: It hath brought these good things to passe, which no other reason or vertue could effect: And whosoever shall desire to ascend where the Father is, much first put on that humility which the Sonne teacheth; and most happy is the man whose calling is high, and his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40285:6"/>
spirit humble; of which vertue I may truely conclude with your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Man hath by that most honour gain'd,</l>
               <l>And yet with least losse is maintain'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The third the most basely vile, and yet the highest valued; the most cursed to mannage, yet the most costly to maintain; in my ignorant conceptions I hold to be Pride: which being first hatched in heaven, in an instant, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <note place="margin">Pride.</note> Lucifer and his Angels headlong into hell: which perceiving Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to be honourable, desireth often to be covered with the cloake thereof; least appearing alwayes in its owne likenesse, it might thereby be the lesse regarded. I shall not need much to amplifie the vice, nor to aggravate the sinne; a spice whereof (may I speake it with pardon) hath beene discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red even in this my best beloved parent: and to avoide prolixitie,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>It is that thing men soonest rue,</l>
               <l>And yet with greatest charge pursue.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
With which answer so modestly delivered, and in a kinde of matron-like gravity, (rarely to be found in one of her tender and young yeares) the King was so highly raptur'd, that he not onely received her father into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grace, but spake openly, (being then a Batchelour) that had she beene borne of noble bloud, he would have made her his Queen and Royall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort; and taking her from the earth, caused her to stand before him: when instantly newes was brought him that an Earledome was then fallen unto the Crowne, which he presently for her sake conferred upon <hi>Don Pedro</hi> her father: of which she taking advantage, fell downe againe upon her knees, <note place="margin">Advantage well taken.</note> to give the King thankes for so great an honour bestowed upon him; for which she prostrated unto him in all humble manner her life and service, adding withall some words to this purpose: My Royall Liege, excuse my over-boldnesse, if I challenge your Majestie of your Kingly word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise past unto me before all this presence; who demanding of her wherein he was any way ingaged? she made reply, But late great Sir, you said that were I noble, you would accept of my unworthy selfe as your royall Bride and Spouse: Then pardon my presumption if I thus farre prompt your memory, to put your Highnesse in minde that I am now not onely (by your Grace) ennobled, but an Earles daughter; at which word covering her face with her hand, shee concluded in a bashfull and modest blush: All which so highly pleased the King, that making good his Princely word, he gave order for the present celebration of their nuptiall. <note place="margin">Their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This History though it have a comicall conclusion, yet is pertinent to the discourse now in agitation; for <hi>Don Pedroes</hi> pride of knowledge was sentene't with death, and his life, (howsoever redeem'd by his faire and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous daughter) was immediately forfeit by the doome of the King; and therefore the judgement in Justice, howsoever not in execution, remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>We reade in the French Chronicle of one <hi>Iordaine</hi> of Lisle, by Nation a Gascon, and Nephew to Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth of that name, a man of a most high and insolent spirit, daring any thing though never so facinorous, cruell, inhumane, or bloudy, building all his heinous and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid acts upon the greatnesse of his Unkle; who after he had beene pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for eighteene capitall crimes, still grew more impious and shamelesse,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40285:6"/>
(former mercy making him still the more presumptuous) at the last being apprehended and brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> he was arraigned, convicted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, (surnamed the Faire) King of France; where notwithstanding his great allyes, he suffered like a common felon and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer on the Gallowes.</p>
            <p>It is credibly reported also of a proud Italian Gentleman, borne in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, who in a single duell having the better of his Antagonist in the field, insomuch that he disarmed him of his weapon; and the other now standing at his mercy, he fell to parle with him upon these termes, that there was no way for him to escape immediate death, but by abjuring his Christianity and renouncing his Saviour, to which the other through base timerousnesse assented; of which the Victor taking divelish advantage, even in the midst of his most impious Apostasie, he stab'd him to the heart and slew him, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering these (more then heathenish) words: before I had been onely reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon thy body, but now I have sent both thy body and soule to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and that's a revenge which deserves a chronicle: But what became of this firebrand of Hell, and limbe of the Devill? being apprehended for the murder, and his diabolicall proceedings in the act being related to the Judges; as a terrour to others he was first committed to the rack, and after many other insufferable tortures, despairing of all mercy from God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving shewed no compassion towards man, he most miserably ended his life.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Herebert,</hi> Earle of <hi>Vermendoys</hi> in France, was of that haughty and insolent spirit, that he durst lay hands upon his Soveraigne, <hi>Charles,</hi> King of France (surnamed the <hi>Simple)</hi> who caused him to be imprisoned, and under whose custody hee shortly after died at <hi>Peroune;</hi> which seem'd for a time to be smothered, and he still subsisted in his former eminencie: but where man seemeth most to forget, God doth remarkably remember; nor doth he suffer deeds of such horrid nature to passe unpunished in this world, what vengeance soever he (without true repentance) reserveth for them in the world to come; as it is observable in this present History: for <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourth, the thirty third King of France, by lineall discent, comming to the Crowne, (being the sonne to the before-named <hi>Charles</hi> the simple) and loath that so grosse a treason committed against his father, should be smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered without some notable revenge; (being very ingenious) he bethought himselfe how with the least danger or effusion of bloud, in regard of the others greatnesse and alliance, how to bring it about; and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised this plot following. He caused a letter to be writ, which he himselfe did dictate, and hired an English-man who came disguised like a Poste to bring it unto him as from the King his Master, at such a time when many of his Peeres were present; and amongst the rest this <hi>Herebert</hi> was amongst them: this suborned Poste delivereth the letter to the Kings hands, hee gives it to his principall Secretary, who read it privately unto him; who presently smiling, said openly, Most sure the English-men are not so wise as I esteemed them to be: for our Brother of England hath signified unto me by these letters, that in his Countrey a labouring-man having invited his Lord and Master to dine with him at his house, and he vouchsafing to grace his Cottage with his presence; in the base requitall of so noble a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, he caused him to be most treacherously slaine: and now my Brother of England desireth my counsell, to know what punishment this fellow hath
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40285:7"/>
deserved? In which I desire to be instructed by you my Lords, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your censures, I may returne him the more satisfactory answer.</p>
            <p>The King having ended his Speech, the Lords were at first silent, till at length <hi>Theobant</hi> Earle of Bloyes was the first that spake, and said, that hee was worthy first to be tortured, and after to be hanged on a Gibbet; which <note place="margin">A just cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note> sentence all the Lords there present confirmed: and some of them amongst the rest, much aggravating the punishment, which also <hi>Herebert</hi> Earle of Vermendoys did approve and allow of: whereupon the Kings Officers, who by his Majesties appointment then waited in a with-drawing roome of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, seised upon him with an armed guard: at which sudden surprise hee being much amazed, the King raising himselfe from his seat, said, Thou <hi>Hebert</hi> art that wicked and treacherous labourer, who didst most trayterous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">His owne tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him.</note> insidiate the life of my father, thy Lord and Master; of which felonious act thine owne sentence hath condemned thee, and die thou shalt, as thou hast well deserved: whereupon he was hanged on a Gibbet on the top of a Mountaine called <hi>Lodan,</hi> which since his execution is called Mount <hi>Hebert</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bajazet</hi> the great Emperour of the Turkes, who in his mighty pride thought with his numerous Army to drinke rivers dry, and to weight the mountaines in a ballance; who had made spoyle of many Nations, and with tyranny persecuted the Christians, dispersed through his vast dominions: who compared the world to a Ship, and himselfe to the Pilot: who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the sayles, and secured the helme: yet afterwards being met in battaile by <hi>Scythian Tamberlaine,</hi> and his Army being quite routed, his person also taken prisoner in the field, the Conquerour put this untamed beast into an iron cage, and caused him to be fed from the very fragments and scraps from his table; and carried along with him whither soever hee marched, and onely then released him from his imprisonment, when he was forced to stoope and humble his body as a blocke to tread upon, whilest <hi>Tamberlaine</hi> mounted upon his steed: but here ended not Gods visible Judgements against this Usurper, Persecutor, and Tyrant; who in despaire rayling upon his Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in whom he had in vaine trusted, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Iron grate in which he was inclosed, beate out his owne braines, and wretchedly expired.

This <hi>Bladud</hi> was altogether devoted to the study of Magick and Necromancy, and very expert in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Astrology, by which he is said to make the hot Baths in the Towne then called <hi>Caerbadon,</hi> but now Bath; which Citie he is said to have ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. This King caused the Art of Magick to be taught through his Realm, and ordained Schooles and Schoole masters to that purpose, in which hee tooke such pride and presumption, as that he thought by it all things were possible to be done: so much the Devill, the first master and founder of that Art had deluded him so farre, that at the length having called a great confluence of his people about him, he made an attempt to flie in the arre,

               <hi>Goodwin,</hi> Earle of west Saxon, in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the sonne of <hi>Egelre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> was of that insufferable ambition, by reason of his great revenues, and numerous issue, (for he had five sonnes and one daughter) that he swayed the whole Kingdome, and almost compulsively compelled the King his Soveraigne, to take his daughter <hi>Edith</hi> to wife: After rebelling against the King, and forced with his sonnes to depart the Land, yet after he made such meanes, that hee mediated his peace, and was reconciled to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Harold</hi> the second sonne of Earle <hi>Goodwin,</hi> after the death of his elder brother <hi>Swanus,</hi> aswell heire to his fathers insolent and aspiring spirit, as to his Earledome and Lands: in the twentieth yeare of the raigne of the before-named <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, he sayled into <hi>Normandy</hi> to visit some of his friends; but by adverse windes, and a sudden tempest at Sea, he was driven upon the Province of <hi>Pountiffe,</hi> where hee was tooke prisoner, and sent to Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who inforced him to sweare, that hee should marry with his daughter when she came to mature age; and farther, that after the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> he should keep the Crowne of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40285:8"/>
to his behoofe, according to the will of the Confessor: to both which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles having solemnly sworne, he was dismissed from the bastard Duke, and with great and rich gifts sent backe to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after the death of <hi>Edward,</hi> in the yeare of the Incarnation, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand threescore and sixe, <hi>Harold</hi> forgetting his former oath and promise made to Duke <hi>William,</hi> he caused himselfe to be crowned King of the <hi>Lande;</hi> who was no sooner warme in his Throne, but <hi>Harold Harfoot</hi> sonne to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus,</hi> with a puissant hoast of <hi>Danes</hi> invaded the Realme, whom <hi>Harold</hi> of <hi>England</hi> met in a set battaile, slew him hand to hand, and discomfited his whole Army; for he was of an invincible hardinesse and valour: which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory was no sooner obtained, but newes was brought him that <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> was landed with a potent Army, to claime his right and interest he had in the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> by the last Testament of <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor; with these tydings being thoroughly heated, he marched with all speed from the North, scarce suffering his Army to rest by the way, to give the <hi>Normans</hi> battaile, betwixt whom was a dreadfull and bloudy conflict: But when the victory rather hovered over the English then the other, <hi>Harold</hi> after many deepe and dangerous wounds, was shot into the eye with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and slaine. In whose death may be observed Gods heavy Judgements against price and perjury.</p>
            <p>Of my first sinne, namely Pride, none hath ever beene by our English Chronologers more justly taxed then that French <hi>Gerson, Pierre Gavestone,</hi> the great misleader and seducer of <hi>Edward</hi> the second; whom though his Royall Father King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, sirnamed <hi>Long-shanks,</hi> upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed caused to bee banished; yet the sonne was no sooner inaugurated and admitted to the government of the Realme, but contrary to the wils of all his Lords and Peeres, he caused his Exile to be repealed, sent for him over, and advanced him to great honour: in which he demeaned himselfe like a proud upstart, or as our English Proverbe goes, Like a beggar set on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, who is ready to ride poste to the Devill: for whose sake the King committed <hi>William Lancton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chester</hi> (in the second yeare of his raigne) to the Tower, because he had perswaded the King against his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for which the Barons of the Realme, and especially Sir <hi>Henry Lacy,</hi> Sir <hi>Guy,</hi> and Sir <hi>Aymery de Valence,</hi> Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi> to whom the late King had given charge for his exile upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, wrought so farre by their power, that contrary to the Kings will, hee was avoyded the Land, and banisht into <hi>Ireland</hi> for that yeare, whither his Majestie sent many secret messengers with rich gifts to comfort him, and made him chiefe Ruler of that Countrey.</p>
            <p>But in the third yeare of his reigne, divers grudges and discontents began to arise betwixt the King and his Nobles, insomuch, that for quietnesse sake, and in hope of his amendment, he was againe repealed, but more and more increased in his insufferable insolence, insomuch, that having charge of all the Kings Jewels and Treasure, he went to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and out of the Kings Jewell-house tooke a Table and a paire of trestles all of pure gold, and conveyed them (with other precious gems) out of the Land, to the great exhausting and impoverishing of the same: by whose wanton effoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacies, and loose conditions, he drew the King to many vitious courses, as adulteries, and the like: which mischiefes the Lords seeing daily to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, they tooke counsell againe at <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and notwithstanding the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40285:8"/>
Kings main opposer, he was a second time confined into <hi>Flanders,</hi> but in his fifth year was again sent for over, when not able to contain himselfe from his immoderate luxury, as he demeaned himselfe far more arrogantly than before, insomuch that he disdained and had in contempt all the Peeres of the Land, giving them much opprobrious and despightfull language, wherefore seeing there was no hope of his amendment, with an unanimous consent they vowed to rid the Land of such a Caterpiller, and soon after besieged him in the Castle of <hi>Scarborrow,</hi> and taking the Fort they surprised him, and brought him to <hi>Gaversed</hi> besides <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and the nine and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day of <hi>

            <p>But there succeeded him both in ambition and the Kings favour, of our own Natives, the two <hi>Spencers,</hi> the father and the son, his great minions and favorites, who both in wealth, power, and pride, overtopt all the Nobles of the Land, commanding their Soveraigne, and confounding the Subjects, of whom you may reade in the Records of the Tower, that in the fourteenth year of this <hi>Edward</hi> the second, <hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> the elder, for his riots and extortions being condemned by the Commonalty, and expelled the Land, an Inventory of his estate being taken, it was found by inquisition that the said <hi>Spencer</hi> had in sundry Shires fifty nine Mannours, and in his possession of his own goods and chattels, twenty eight thousand sheep, one thousand oxen and steeres, twelve hundred beeves with their calves, fourty mares with their coltes, one hundred and threescore drawing horses for the teame, two thousand hogges, three hundred bullockes, in his cellar fourty tonnes of wine, he had moreover six hundred bacons, and fourscore carcases of <hi>Martinmasse</hi> beeves, six hundred muttons in larder, ten tonnes of sider, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his provision of ale, (for beer in these dayes was not known) thirty six sackes of wooll, with a fair library of bookes, and other rich and costly utensils; his armour, plate, jewels, and ready money, amounting to more than an hundred thousand pounds; but what in the end became of all this mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And these were remarkable judgements of such as being raised from humble and mean fortunes to high and eminent posture through pride and vainglory, attributed that to their own merit which is onely due to their Maker.</p>
            <p>I come next to Sir <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> who being highly puft up with the favour that he had from Queen <hi>Isabel,</hi> who in the minority of her young son <hi>Edward</hi> swayed all, during the imprisonment of her husband <hi>Edward</hi> the second, whether by the Queenes consent or no, I dare not say, but of most assured truth it is, that this <hi>Roger</hi> caused the King to be removed from <hi>Kenelworth</hi> Castle to the Castle of <hi>Barkley,</hi> where by his direction and command he was most bloodily and inhumanely murdered. After which <hi>Edward</hi> his son (the third of that name) at the age of fifteen yeares was crowned King, but for a time kept in a kinde of pupillage under the Queen and <hi>Mortimer,</hi> betwixt whom there was suspected to have been too much familiarity, in whose power was all the management of State, and many things past by them to the great dishonour of the Kingdom. This <hi>Mortimer</hi> was by the King made Earle of <hi>March,</hi> who imitated King <hi>Arthur</hi> by keeping so many Knights of the Round Table, to whom he allowed both meat and meanes, and bore himselfe in that high straine, that he had in contempt the greatest Peeres in the Land, but in processe of time he was surprised in <hi>Votengham</hi> Castle, and from thence sent prisoner to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> when a Parliament being called in the fourth year of the King, He was convicted of five Articles: first, of the murder of the King; next, that he had dealt perfidiously betwixt our Nation and the Scots; thirdly, that he received certain summes of money from Sir <hi>Thomas Duglas,</hi> and caused to be delivered unto them the Church called <hi>Rugium,</hi> to their great advantage and <hi>Englands</hi> prejudice; fourthly, that he had got unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into his possession much of the Kings treasure, and wastfully mispent it; and lastly, that he was more private with the Queen than was to Gods pleasure or the Kings honour: of all which being convicted by the said Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; upon Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> day, next following he was drawn upon an hurdle to the common place of execution (since called <hi>Tiburne)</hi> and there like a Fellon and Traitour upon the Gallowes hanged, such is the end of greatnesse when it abandons goodnesse and honour, and opposeth it selfe against humility.</p>
            <p>Great also were the arrogancies and insolencies of Sir <hi>William Scroop</hi> Earle of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> and Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Bushey,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Green,</hi> and others, in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, who by him greatly animated and incouraged, greatly vexed and oppressed the people, men advanced from the cottage to the Court, and from basenesse to honour,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40285:9"/>
who through their great pride forgetting from whence they came; in their surplus of wealth, and height of ambition, were surprised in <hi>Bristow</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (as cankers and caterpillars of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) the son of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> who then laid claim to the Crown, and by him caused to be executed on a publike scaffold. Infinite are Gods threatning judgements to this purpose, of which there be infinite examples, but being loath to tire the Reader with too much prolixity, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Tract against pride with one notable president as much (if not more remarkable) than any of the former.</p>
            <p>In the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>Thomas Wolsey</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> and Cardinall, had in his hall daily three Tables or Boards, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by three principall Officers; a Steward, who was alwayes a Priest; a Treasurer, no lesse degreed than a Knight; and a Controwler, who was by Place an Esquire; he had also a Cofferer, who was a Doctor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; three Marshals, three Yeomen Ushers in the Hall, besides two Groomes, and Almners: in his Kitchen belonging to the Hall, two Clerkes of the Kitchin, a Clerke Controller, a Surveyour of the Dresser, a Clerke of the Spicery, (and these kept a continuall messe in the Hall) two master-cookes, and of other Cookes Labourers and Children of the Kitchen twelve persons, four Yeomen of the ordinary Scullery, four Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the silver Scullery, two Yeomen of the Pastry, with two or three Pastulers under the Yeomen.</p>
            <p>In his Privy Kitchin he had a Master-cook who wore alwayes Satten and Velvet with a great chain of gold about his necke, with two other Yeomen and a Groom, in the Scalding-house a Yeoman and two Groomes, in the Pantry two Yeomen; in the Buttery two Yeomen, two Groomes, and two Pages; in the Chandry, two Yeomen; in the Wafery, two Yeomen; in the Wardrobe of Beddes, the Master of the Wardrobe, and ten other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons attending; in the Laundry, a Yeoman, and a Groom, thirty Pages, two Yeomen-purveyours, and one Groom; in the Bake-house, a Yeoman and two Groomes; in the Wood-yard, a Yoman and a Groom; in the Barne one; in the Garden, a Yeoman and two Groomes; a Yeoman of his Bardge, a Master of his Horse, a Clerke of the Stable, and a Yeoman, a Sadler, a Farrier, a Yeoman of his Chariot, a Sumptur-man, a Yeoman of his Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop, a Muleter, and sixteen Groomes of his Stable, every one keeping foure Geldings; Porters at his Gate, two Yeomen and two Groomes; in the Almnery, a Yeoman and a Groom.</p>
            <p>In his Chappell he had a Dean, who was a great Divine, and a man of excellent learning; a Subdean, a Repeater of the Quier, a Gospeller, an Epistoler, ten singing Priests, a Master of the Children-quiristers, twelve Seculars being singing men of the Chappell, ten singing boyes with a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to attend upon them; in the Revestry, a Yeoman and two Groomes, besides divers retainers who repaired to his Palace at principall feasts.</p>
            <p>The rich Furniture of his Chappell almost exceeded apprehension, for jewels and sumptuous ornaments continually there used, where have been seene in a Procession about the Hall foure and fourty rich Copes all of one suit, with Crosses, and Candlestickes, and other furniture of great value; he had moreover two Crosse-bearers, and two Pillar-bearers in his Great-chamber; and in his Privy-chamber, a Chamberlain and a Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamberlain, twelve Gentlemen-ushers, besides one continually in his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40285:10"/>
Privy-chamber, and six Gentlemen-waiters, he had ten Lords to attend him, and every one had two Gentlemen to attend upon them, onely the Earle of <hi>Derby</hi> had five allowed him; he had of Gentlemen, Cup-bearers, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Sewers, and the like, to the number of fourty persons, six Yeomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ushers, eight Groomes, and Yeomen that daily waited in his Chamber fourty five.</p>
            <p>Sixteen Doctours and Chaplaines besides those of his Chappell conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually waited at his Trencher, with the Clerke of the Closet, two Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, two Clerkes of the Signet, and four Counsellours learned in the Lawes, and for as much as it was necessary, for divers Officers of the Chancery to attend him; namely, the Clerke of the Crown, a riding Clerke, a Clerke of the Hamper, a Clerke of the Wax, and a Clerke of Checke; he gave meanes and allowance to them all; he had also four Footmen cloathed in rich Coates with his Armes imbroidered upon them; an Herald at Armes, a Serjeant at Armes, a Physitian, an Apothecary, four chief Musitians with their Consort, a Keeper of his Tents, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourer, an Instructer of his Wards, two Yeomen of his Wardrobe of Robes, and a Keeper of his Chamber continually in the Court; he had moreover in his House the Surveyour of <hi>Yorke,</hi> a Clerke of the Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, and all these were with him uprising and down-lying, and dieted at his charge; he kept in his Great-chamber a continuall Table for the Chamberers and Gentlemen-Officers, with a Messe of young Lords, and another of young Gentlemen; nor was there any Officers Gentlemen or other persons of account, but were allowed some one, some two, some three servants to attend them, which no question grew to a mighty number, besides Officers extraordinary, retainers and sutors who might come freely and dine in the Hall without any to contradict them: and thus far out of his Checke role, whereby we see his exceeding greatnesse, but of which grew such pride, that he blushed not to prefer himselfe before his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, in these words, <hi>Ego &amp; Rex meus,</hi> I and my King. But to conclude with him, this potent prelate falling after into a <hi>praemunire,</hi> forfeited his whole estate to the Crown, and then (though late) confessing, That if he had sought so much to honour God as he had strived to honour his King, he might still have continued in his revenew eminently: and being deprived of all his power and pompe, riches and substance, and brought almost to the extremest indigence and penury, being sent for from <hi>Yorke</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> (as some have supposed to answer for his life) he fell sicke by the way, and in a poor Friery ended his wretched dayes not without suspition of poyson; and such have been Gods judgements from the beginning against this first and capital of the seven mortall sinnes called Pride, of which I cease to write further, and proceed to the second.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Of Gods just Judgements inflicted upon envious persons.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Nvy is defined to be a grievance and sorrow for the thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and prosperity of others, who in his heart would kill the happinesse of his Neighbour, and before God is held no better than an Homicide, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call it <hi>Kineah</hi> and <hi>Kanno,</hi> which is Emulation or Envy, in which we are said four wayes to offend; first, when we grieve at the good estate or fortune of another man, as fearing because of his ability, he may be also willing to endamage us or others. Secondly, when we repine at another mans felicity, because we have not what he hath, nor abound with the like abundance and riches, and this the Philosopher cales <hi>Zelus,</hi> and the first may be in some kinde held laudable, If we emulate a man for his vertues and goodnesse seeking by imitating to exceed them, but if it be for temporall goods it may be brought within the compasse of sin. The third is, when we maligne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, because he injoyes these temporall blessings which he doth not deserve, and such vexation, because it is concerning riches and honour, which happen both to the worthy and unworthy alike, by the Philosopher it is called <hi>Nemesis,</hi> which though <hi>Aristotle</hi> approves, yet our Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will not allow. The fourth is, when we are sad and troubled at our neighbours increase in wealth and substance, because he exceedeth us, and we are not so rich nor so well possessed as he; and this is plain Envy in her own naturall and absolute colours, and is alwayes evill, and is a mortiferous sin, because we grieve at that at which we ought to rejoyce; namely, the prosperity of our neighbour, and this the Schoolmen distinguish into three branches, mortall, veniall, capitall.</p>
            <p>That is called mortall, when it is hatched and premeditated, nay prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the consent of reason, because it directly opposeth the Charity due from us to our neighbour. That which is called veniall, is an emulation bred meerly in sensuality or wantonnesse, when there was no preceding of the consent of reason: and as they are the first motions, so they are held to be idle and imperfect. The third is called capitall, because from it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <hi>susurratio,</hi> that is, a muttering or murmuring behinde ones backe, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to darken or ecclypse the reputation or good name of another in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Next Detraction, when openly we scandall or revile any man to lessen his worth, or darken his glory. Then Exultation, when we triumph or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the disastre or distresse of our neighbour. Next Affliction, when we are grieved and discontented at his prosperity. And lastly, <hi>Od<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>um,</hi> or hate, by which we are not onely sadded and molested at his happinesse, but withall we insidiate his estate, or malevolently desire his ruine.</p>
            <p>Frequent are the Texts in the holy Scripture, against this sin of Envy, and sundry examples to shew it hath been even from the beginning, and so continued through all succeeding Ages: it was betwixt the two first Brothers, for we reade <hi>Genesis</hi> 4. 5. Because God accepted <hi>Abels</hi> offering, and despised that of <hi>Cain, He was exceeding wroth, and his countenance fell down:</hi> (among
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40285:11"/>
strangers) Because <hi>Isaac</hi> had flockes of sheep and heards of cattell, and a mighty houshold, <hi>Therefore the Philistims had envie at him, insomuch that they stopped and filled up with earth all the wells which his fathers servants dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his father Abrahams time, &amp;c.</hi> Betwixt Sisters, <hi>When Raechel saw that she bare Iaacob no children, she envyed her Sister, and said unto her husband, Give me children or I die.</hi> In <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, who when they saw that their father <hi>Iacob</hi> loved him more then them, they hated him, and could not speake peaceably unto him; and when he dreamed a dreame and told it his brethren, the Text saith, they hated him the more: Against which you shall reade, <hi>Levit. 19. 17. Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, but thou shalt plainly rebuke thy neighbour, and suffer him not to sinne. Thou shalt not avenge, nor be mindfull of wrong against the children of thy people, but shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe: I am the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We finde in the twelfth of <hi>Numbers,</hi> that when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured against <hi>Moses,</hi> because he had married a woman of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the Lord was therefore angry with them, and immediately <hi>Miriam</hi> was strook with a Leprosie white as snow. <hi>Saul</hi> envyed <hi>David,</hi> because the Virgines in their songs and dances, gave to him but the honour of killing thousands, and to <hi>David</hi> ten thousands. In <hi>Eliab</hi> the brother of <hi>David,</hi> who when he spake unto the men that stood with him, and said, What shall be done to him that killeth this Philistime, (meaning <hi>Goliah)</hi> and taketh away the shame from <hi>Israel, &amp;c. Eliab</hi> this hearing was very angry with <hi>David,</hi> and said, Why camest thou downe hither? and with whom whom hast thou left those few sheepe in the Wildernesse? I know the pride and the malice of thine heart, that thou art come downe to see the battaile: in <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobias,</hi> who envyed and hindered the building of the Temple, as you may reade in <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> In the Princes and Officers of <hi>Darius, Dan.</hi> 6. 4. who sought an occasion against him concerning the Kingdome, but they could finde no fault; for he was so faithfull, that no blame could bee found in him.</p>
            <p>Come to the New Testament, or Gospell: In the Pharisees, <hi>Mat</hi> 9. 11. <note place="margin">Examples in the Gospell.</note> who said to the Disciples of Jesus, <hi>Why eateth your Master with Publicans and Sinners?</hi> Again, <hi>Luke 19. 39. Then some of the Pharisees said unto him, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, rebuke thy Disciples.</hi> In the Disciples of <hi>Iohn, Mat. 9. 14. Then came the Disciples of Iohn to him, saying, Why doe we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy Disciples fast not?</hi> In the chiefe Priests and Scribes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 15. Who when they saw the marvels that hee did, and the children crying in the Temple, <hi>Hosanna</hi> to the sonne of <hi>David,</hi> they disdained.

In the Rulers, Elders, and Scribes, <hi>Acts 5. 17.

Envy is the daughter of pride, the mother of slaughter and strage, the innovator of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the perpetuall tormentor of vertue: She is moreover the slime and impostume of the soule, a daily corrasive to him in whom she abideth; a venome, a poyson, a Mercury or quicksilver, which consumeth the flesh, and dryes up the bones: and of vices it is said, Envy to be the most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Pride the greatest, and Lust the foulest. The envyed man doth many times forget, but the envious man doth never spare to prosecute; and as griefe or paine is a disease of the body, so malice is the malady of the soule. It is a meere slave to its owne affections, and is found alwayes to waite at Vertues elbow.</p>

The serenity of their neighbours fame they endeavour either by detraction to eclipse, or by silence to conceale. Inglorious Envy striveth to deface the glory of wisedome; then which, no monster more monstrous, no dammage more dammageous, no torment more torturous, no sinne more contagious; of blindnesse it is the abysse, the spurre to contention, the sting of corruption, the motions whereof are adversaries to humane tranquillity, of mundane temptations the instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and inciters; of a labouring minde the vigilant enemies, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peace and amity the combustuous disturbers.</p>

through Envy of the Devill came death into the world, and they that hold of his side prove it: therefore let us be advised by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who in the second chapter of his first Epistle saith, <hi>Wherefore laying aside all malitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and all guile, and dissimulation, and envy; and evill speaking as new borne babes, desire that sincere milke of the Word, that yee may grow thereby &amp;c.</hi> But from the discovery of the foulenesse of the sinne, I come now to shew what severall judgements have beene inflicted upon it.</p>
            <p>And first to search forraine Histories before we come to fearefull and tragicall Examples, moderne and domestick of our owne, (that the one may the better illustrate and set off the other. I begin with that incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous brood of <hi>Thebes,</hi> the two brothers <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> whose father <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> ignorant of his owne naturall parents, and having first most unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately slaine his owne father, and after retyring himselfe to <hi>Thebes,</hi> by the solution of <hi>Sphinxes</hi> riddle, married with his owne mother <hi>Iocasta</hi> (neither of them knowing their proximity in bloud) and by that match swayed the Kingdome: together with those two before-named sonnes, and two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Antigone</hi> and <hi>Ismene,</hi> which he had by her. But at length having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that incestuous match made with his mother, he in griefe thereof with his nayles pulled out his owne eyes, and she in despaire strangled her selfe: after which the Kingdome falling to the two brothers; They first agreed to raigne monethly, and then yearely by turnes; but soone after there grew such malitious envy betwixt them, that whatsoever the one did in his regency, the other when the power came into his hands, utterly abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and disanull'd, making new lawes, to the former quite contrary; which also lasted but a moneth: for then the succeeder paid the resigner in his owne coyne. Upon this grew faction, and divers partisans on either side; some favouring the one, and some affecting the other; in the end from threatnings and braves, it came to battaile and blowes; in which the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers encountering hand to hand, in a single duell they interchangably slew one another; whose envy in life was so irreconcilable and invererate, that it appeared after their deaths: for their two bodies being brought to be burnt in one funerall pile, the very flame was seene to divide it selfe, and burne in two parts, suting to their opposite soules and contrary conditions.</p>
            <p>Another Example of Gods Judgements against Envy, <hi>Greece</hi> affordeth us. <hi>Perseus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon:</hi> (but not that <hi>Philip</hi> who was father to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great) hee had an elder brother whose name was <hi>Demetrius,</hi> a man of most approved honesty, and imitable condition; whose knowne vertues his younger brother, of a malevolent and cumbred spirit much envying, framed a most scandalous and detracting inditement against him; pretending that he had privately insidiated his fathers life and Kingdom, and sold them both unto his enemies the <hi>Romans;</hi> of which by suborned witnesses, he had made such proofe, (and bribing to that purpose) prevailed so farre, that he was convented, convicted, and condemned, and most innocently suffered the rigout of the Law, by having his head strooke off: But the King having had notice of these barbarous and injust procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, surprised with excesse of griefe, died not long after; and this mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fratricide succeeded in the Kingdome: who now having all things answerable to his own desires, thinking <hi>Macedonia</hi> too narrow a limit for his unbounded ambition; he in great presumption not onely opposed, but invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, whose envy and detraction against his brother
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40285:12"/>
God thus punished: He drew him with all his puissant Army neare unto the river of <hi>Danubius;</hi> where being encountred by the <hi>Roman</hi> Consul <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> he and his whole hoast were cut to pieces, and utterly ruined; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that the power of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> being utterly confounded, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came after subject and tributary to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: and thus his defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory destruction conspired against another, fell upon his owne head; and is still registred to his perpetuall shame and inflamy.</p>

            <p>The Empresse their mother fore-seeing some great and eminent disaster, gave them often very matron and pious admonitions, exhorting them to unity and concord; but her indulgent and wholesome counsell nothing prevailed with them, for daily their discord, hatred, and bloudy practises increased, and the one was so jealous of the other, that they durst not eate nor drinke together for feare of poyson. In this mutuall feare they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, till at the length <hi>Antoninus</hi> grew so sicke of his brothers generall love and welfare, that his ambition is now to be the sole possessour of the whole Empire; and therefore in the dead of night, with other of his assasinates, <note place="margin">One brother murdereth the other.</note> he violently broke open his brothers chamber, and basely murdered him, even in the sight and presence of their mother; not thinking hee was throughly dead, till he had cut the head from the body: This done, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused the fact to the Souldiers, and with large donatives so insinuated into their favours, that never was found who so much as repined at what was done; nor was he sooner well seated in the Throne Imperiall, but he caused all the friends, well-wishers, and acquaintance of <hi>Geta</hi> to be most cruelly put to death, sparing neither degree, age, nor sex, so that not one remained alive in the Common-weale of <hi>Rome:</hi> most of the rich Senatours he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

But after all his rapes, incests, and ryots, murders and massacres, as possest with all the horrid and abhominable vices that have any name: As his life was detestable, so was his death remarkable; being in the midst of his sinnes, without any repertance was most wretchedly slaine by his Souldiers, at the instigation of <hi>Macrinus</hi> after Emperour.</p>

               </gap>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exercises were abroad: wherefore making choyce of one Gentleman to be his friend and companion, whom hee valued as a second selfe, furnisht with gold and treasure sufficient, unknowne to any, betooke themselves to sea; and after much perillous navigation they landed in <hi>Persia,</hi> at such time as the <hi>Soldan</hi> had warres with the <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The Prince with his companion (concealing his birth and Countrey) put himselfe under the <hi>Soldans</hi> service, in which he so bravely demeaned himselfe, that he grew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable through the Army, and none in all the hoast was able to compare with him in daring or doing, he so farre transcended them all: insomuch, that by his valour the <hi>Soldan</hi> had many brave victories; and having but one onely daughter, a Lady of incomparable beauty, he had a secret purpose to take an advantage to bestow her upon him, with all the Royalties of Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Sword, Crowne, and Dominion after his decease. In processe it so happened, that in a dreadfull battaile fought betwixt the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> the <hi>Soldan</hi> was mortally wounded in the eye with an arrow; yet his body he yet living, was safely brought to his Tent by this <hi>Roman</hi> Prince, who before his death drew out a ring of great value, and gave it unto him, saying, my onely daughter upon my paternall benediction hath vowed and sworne, that whosoever shall deliver this ring from me to her, shee will without any scruple or evasion, accept him for her husband: and this I <note place="margin">The <hi>Soldans</hi> great love to the Prince.</note> freely bestow on thee, and with these last words he expired.

Which the wise Lady <hi>Mesa</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fearing his fall, and in his, her owne ruine; as farre as she could she excused his grossest crimes, laying the fault upon the tendernesse of his youth; and wrought so, that by his consent <hi>Alexianus</hi> who was the sonne of <hi>Mammea,</hi> her daughter was admitted companion with him in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which <hi>Alexianus</hi> after called <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> was a wise and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Prince, whose vertue had gained him the generall love of the Senate and people; for which <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> so envied him (for vice and vertue are still in opposition) that he made many attempts to poyson him, which by the care of <hi>Mesa</hi> and <hi>Mammea,</hi> were prevented. But how was this envy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished? The people seised upon <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> with his mother <hi>Semiamira,</hi> and dragging their bodies through the chiefe streets of <hi>Rome,</hi> having after torne them piece-meale; would not affoord them the honour of buriall, but cast their quarters into the common jakes, that stood upon the river <hi>Tiber.</hi>

            <p>Neither have women beene free from this rankorous sinne of Envy, as <note place="margin">Envy in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> appeareth by the story following; and shall be made more apparant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. This Prince <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> afore-named, all the time that his grandmother <hi>Mesa</hi> lived, who suffered none but grave and wise men to be about him; (insomuch that no Emperour before or after him could be said to exceed him in all these attributes that belong to an Imperiall Monarch) was both beloved and feared: But she being dead, his mother <hi>Mammea</hi> grew to that height of pride, covetousnesse, and envy, that his indulgent suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance of her ambition was a great, and the sole blemish of his government, who comming to maturity, and the Empire now setled in his owne hands, he tooke to wife a daughter of one of the most noblest Senators of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was also by his mothers consent: but when this Lady came to take upon her the state of an Empresse, <hi>Mammea,</hi> who challenged that title solely to her selfe, malitiously envying her estate; wrought so, that first the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Murder the fruits of Envy.</note> of the new Empresse was put to death: and so terrible was her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and her Majestie so much dreaded, that she banished both from the Court and the bed of the Emperour the innocent Empresse, unto the

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Chronicles speake of one Prince <hi>Cranne,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius,</hi> who having raigned forty five yeares at <hi>Soissons,</hi> now called the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Gant,</hi> upon the decease of his elder brother <hi>Childebert,</hi> who died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out issue male, was proclaimed the seventh King of <hi>France.</hi> This <hi>Cranne</hi> (on whom that may be truly construed of the Poet,

was sicke of his fathers life, envying and grieving that he kept him so long from the Crowne: but wanting meanes to make him away privately by poyson, or the like, because his servants about him were faithfull, and not to be corrupted; he therefore opposed him by publike hostility, incensing his Unkle <hi>Childebert</hi> against him, who supported him in all his insolencies against his father. But <hi>Childebert</hi> being dead, and he now wanting his great support, was forc't to mediate his peace with his father, who upon his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission tooke him to grace, and gave him his free pardon: But his former heart burning envy still boyling in his breast, he fell into a second rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet finding the successe of his bad attempts to grow still worse and worse, as his last refuge, hee fled to the Prince or Duke of the <hi>Brittons,</hi> (whom some call <hi>Conobee,</hi> others <hi>Canubo,)</hi> who undertooke to secure him from the pursute of his father: Whereupon <hi>Clotharius</hi> with his Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded that Countrey, and joyned battaile with the Prince and his sonne, in which the <hi>Brittons</hi> lost the day; their Army was routed, the Prince slaine and <hi>Cranne</hi> taken prisoner, of whom his father having seised, hee caused him to be shut up in an house, and with his wife and children to be burnt to death; a just judgement from heaven, but a cruell sentence from a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who that very day twelve-moneth after died, being the one and fifty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yeare of his raigne.</p>
            <p>I come now to our Moderne Histories. <hi>Ferrex</hi> and <hi>Porrex</hi> joyntly suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their father <hi>Gorboduc</hi> in the governement of this Land of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> in the yeare of the World foure thousand seaven hundred and eleven; and continued in love and amity for a season: but in the end, Envy the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all misorder and mischiefe so farre prevailed with them, that the one began to maligne the others estate; insomuch, that they both studied and devised to supplant each other, thereby to gaine the entire supremacy, which first brake out in <hi>Porrex,</hi> who gathering an Army unknowne to his brother, thought suddenly to surprise and kill him: of which he having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and yet not able for the present to provide for opposition, he was forced to fly into <hi>France;</hi> where craving ayde, he was supplyed with a sufficient Hoast of <hi>Galls:</hi> with which, landing in <hi>England,</hi> he gave his brother <hi>Porrex</hi> battaile, defeated his Army, and slew him in the field: <hi>Ferrex</hi> proud of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory retyred himself to his Tent, whither his mother <hi>Midan</hi> came by night, with some of her women; and being freely admitted to the place where he lay sleeping, she with the rest most cruelly murdered him, and after cut his

body into small pieces, causing them to be scattered in the field: and in these two brothers ended the line of <hi>Brute.</hi> Thus you see a most dreadfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against Envy, as well in the vanquisht as the victor; but the greatest in the last: to be so cruelly murdered, rather by a monster then a mother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morindus</hi> was the bastard sonne of <hi>Flavius</hi> King of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine <hi>Fanguestela;</hi> and was inaugurated in the yeare of the World one thousand eight hundred fourescore and ten, and made Governour of the Land: The Chronicle reports him to have beene of a comely and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full personage, of liberall gifts, having an active body, and a most daring spirit, and strength withall above any Peere or Subject in the Land; but as a grievous staine and blemish to all these good parts and endowments, hee was of an envious condition, and cruell disposition, for he grew jealous of all such as either were great in wealth, or gracious in the Court for any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertue: for the first, hee had a way to confiscate their estate; and the latter he so suppressed, that they never came into favour, or grew to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: being further so subject to wrath, that whosoever crost or vexed him, he would suddenly slay with his owne hands. Afterward his Land being invaded by a Prince of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> he met him in battaile, and chased him to the Sea, taking many prisoners: whom, to satisfie this cruelty and tyranny, he caused to be put to death in his presence and sight, with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sorts of torments; by heading, killing, hanging, burning, drowning, and other kindes of execution: but at the length (as testifieth <hi>Guido de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna</hi> and others) this <hi>Morindus</hi> whom our <hi>English</hi> Chronicles call <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,</hi> walking by the Sea side, and spying a dreadfull monster upon the shore, he out of his bold and Kingly prowesse, assaying to kill the beast, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long fight was devoured and swallowed by the monster, when he had eight yeares governed the Land; which was a most strange and remarkable Judgement.</p>
            <p>Envy and dissension was the first bondaging of this our free and noble Nation, in becomming tributary to the <hi>Romans:</hi> King <hi>Lud</hi> of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory being dead, during the minority of his two sonnes, <hi>Androgeus</hi> and <hi>Tenantius; Cassibelan</hi> the brother to <hi>Lud</hi> was made King in the yeare of the World, five thousand one hundred forty two, who was a Prince, noble, bountifull, just, and valorous: when the young Princes came to yeares of discretion, hee gave to <hi>Androgeus</hi> the elder the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> with the Earledome of <hi>Kent;</hi> and to <hi>Tenantius</hi> the younger, the Dukedome of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall.</hi> In this season <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> being in the warres of <hi>France,</hi> and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the white cliffes and rocks by <hi>Dover,</hi> demanded of the <hi>Gauls</hi> whether it were inhabited or no? or by whom? being satisfied of his demand, hee first exhorted the <hi>Brittaines</hi> by writing, to pay tribute to the <hi>Romans:</hi> to whom <hi>Cassibelan</hi> returned a short and sharpe answer; with which <hi>Caesar</hi> much incensed, makes ready his Navy and people: but when they should have landed, they found long and sharpe stakes pitcht by the <hi>Brittons,</hi> which put them to great trouble and danger; yet at length gaining the shore, <hi>Cassibelan</hi> with a strong Army of <hi>Brittans</hi> gave them battaile, and beat them to their shippes.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, <hi>Caesar</hi> soone after made a second Invasion, with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power, and had the like brave repulse, to his great dishonour. For which double victory <hi>Cassibelan</hi> having first given great thankes to the gods, assembled his Lords and Peeres to feast them; and held sundry triumphs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40285:15"/>
and sports: amongst which, two young Knights, one Nephew to the King, called <hi>Herilda;</hi> and the other <hi>Euelinus,</hi> allyed to <hi>Androgeus;</hi> made a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge for wrastling: in the performing of which exercise they grew to words, and from words to blowes, so that parties were made, and in this tumult <hi>Herilda</hi> was slaine; whose death the King tooke heinously, and sent to his Nephew <hi>Androgeus,</hi> that <hi>Euelinus</hi> might be delivered up, to know how he could acquit himselfe of the murder; which <hi>Androgeus</hi> denying, the King gave him to understand, that it was in his power to chastise his presumption; which the other fearing, sent to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> not onely let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but thirty hostages, (to assure him of his fidelity) that if hee would make a third attempt for <hi>Brittaine,</hi> he would ayde him with a puissant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: of which <hi>Caesar</hi> gladly accepting, with a strong hoast landed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped himselfe neare unto <hi>Canterbury;</hi> of which when <hi>Cassibelan</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he marched towards him, and betwixt them was fought a strong and bloudy battaile, where many were slaine on either side, and the day likely to incline to the <hi>Brittons,</hi> when on the sudden <hi>Androgeus</hi> came in with fresh forces, by which the wearied Souldiers were compelled to forsake the field, and gave place to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who slew them without mercy; so that <hi>Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belan,</hi> with those few that were left, retired himselfe to places of safety. Whose valour <hi>Caesar</hi> admiring, would not prosecute his victory any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the present, but offered him peace, conditionally that he should pay a yearely tribute of three thousand pounds to the <hi>Romans;</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions <hi>Cassibelan</hi> accepted, and still continued King; and <hi>Androgeus</hi> who had so basely betrayed his Countrey, not daring to trust his owne Nation, whom in so high a nature he had injured, abandoned the Realme, and went with <hi>Caesar.</hi> Now if any shall aske me where were Gods dreadfull Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all this? I answer, what greater, then for a free Nation to lose their immunities, and become tributary and vassals to strangers; from which they were not freed many hundred yeares after.</p>
            <p>Long after this <hi>Constantine</hi> was made King, and left three sonnes behinde him: <hi>Constantine</hi> the eldest (because he was of a very milde and gentle tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and no way addicted to any martiall exercise) hee put into a religious house, called Saint <hi>Swithens</hi> Abbey, and made him a Monke: his two other sonnes were <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius,</hi> and <hi>Vter,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Pendragon.</hi> But <hi>Constantine</hi> the father being trayterously murdered, one <hi>Vortiger,</hi> who then was the most potent Peere in the Land; tooke <hi>Constantine</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sonne out of the Monastery, and made him King onely in name, for he himselfe swayed the government of the Kingdome, with all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that belonged to a Crowne and Scepter. Yet not with that contented, he envied the state of the innocent King; and though he had all the power, yet he could not content himselfe without the title; and therefore placed a guard of an hundred <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> about the Kings person, and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed into his hands the greatest part of the Kings Treasury, hee was so bountifull to those strangers, that they feared not to say openly that be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deserved to be King then <hi>Constantine;</hi> and waiting their best advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opportunity, murdered him: Whose head being presented to <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> then at <hi>London,</hi> he made much seeming sorrow for his death; and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himselfe of the act, caused all those hundred Knights to be beheaded: by which the people holding him innocent, crowned him King, when the other had raigned about five yeares: and this his coronation caused those that had the keeping of the two younger brothers, <hi>Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Vter,</hi> to flie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40285:16"/>
with them into little Brittain, where they remained long after: but as a just reward of this trayterous supplantation, hee was never after in any peace or quietnesse, his Land being alwayes in combustion and trouble; his Peeres sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting him of the death of the King, made insurrection against him; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he was forced to sollicite aide of the <hi>Saxons:</hi> who though they hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him for the present; after, of his friends they grew to be his enemies, and were too mighty for him: so that when he had raigned in great molestation and trouble sixteen years, the <hi>Brittaines</hi> deprived him of all Kingly dignity, and crowned his eldest sonne <hi>Vor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At length the two younger brothers of <hi>Constantine</hi> invaded the Land, being aided by the distressed Brittains, and pursued him into Wales, where hee and divers of his complices fortified themselves in a strong Castle; which Castle the two brothers with their Army besieged, and after many vaine assaults, (it being valiantly defended) with wilde-fire they burned and consumed the Fort, together with <hi>Vortiger,</hi> and all his souldiers and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>Worthy it is to observe by how many severall kinde of Judgements this sinne of Envy hath beene punisht, as in the former examples is made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant: namely, by the single sword, by battaile, by poysoning, strangling, heading, torturing, by murdering and cutting to pieces, by being swallowed up of monsters; the living to be buried with the dead, by famishing in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by being torne piece-meale, and the bleeding limbes cast into common privies: some burnt with ordinary fire, others with wilde-fire; the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther murdering the brother, and the mother the sonne; the bondage and vassalling of Nations, &amp;c. which sinne, though for the commonnesse and familiarity it hath amongst us, is scarce minded, or thought upon; (because many who are envious may so hide it, that they may appeare honest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;) yet is this hypocrisie no excuse, for you see how hatefull it is in the eyes of the Creator, by so many visible punishments thereof. But I proceed.</p>
            <p>After many dreadfull battailes fought (and not without great effusion of bloud) betwixt <hi>Edmund,</hi> sirnamed for his strength and valour <hi>Iron-side,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ethelstane,</hi> and <hi>Canutus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Swanus,</hi> during this warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those martiall Princes, to the great desolation of the Realme, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the people; It was agreed betwixt the two Generals to conclude the difference in a single duell: The place where this should be performed was in an Ile called Olney, neare unto Glocester, incompast with the water of the <hi>Severne:</hi> In which place at the day appointed both the Champions met, without any company or assistance; and both the hoasts stood as spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators without the Isle, there awaiting the fortune of the battaile: where the Princes first proved one another with sharpe speares, and they being broken, with keene cutting swords; where after a long fierce combate, both being almost tyred, by giving and receiving of hard and ponderous blowes, at length (the first motion comming from <hi>Canutus)</hi> they began to parle; and lastly to accord, friendly kissing and embracing each other: and soone after, by the advise of both their Counsels, they made an equall partition of

               </gap>lew them all; and after, cut them into pieces and gobbets, which he put into sowce and salt, pickling and powdering their limbes; and afterward sent messengers to the King and his brother, to give them to understand, that if they brought fresh meate along with them, hee had provided them of powdered meate, as much as they could desire. Which barbarous act being bruited abroad, it made him so hatefull to all men, that his owne tenants and people, (men of Northumberland) the Province of which he was then Lord, rose up in Armes against him, seising all the Lands and Goods of which he was possest; and chased him into Flanders, with no more then one or two <note place="margin">Envy pursued by many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters.</note> servants to attend him; where he remained with his wife and children, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Kings life.

            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Seymor</hi> the younger brother being Admirall, and having married King <hi>Henries</hi> Queene Dowager, (whose good fortune it was of all the rest to survive her husband) she was suggested to contest with her sister in law, for priority in place, to which the other (for both were privately incouraged by the two Dukes) would no way assent: the one claiming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence as she had beene Queene, the other challenging it as she was now the Protectors wife. The wives set their husbands at oddes by taking their parts; insomuch, that there grew envy and heart-burning betwixt them, so that in the third yeare of the young King, the Admirall was questioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Office; and by the consent of his brother, condemned in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have his head strooke off, the Protector with his owne hand signing the Warrant for his death.</p>
            <p>The one brother being thus removed, there was now the lesse difficulty to supplant the other: for in the same moneth of <hi>February</hi> in which his brother lost his head, was the Protector by the Lords of the Counsell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower; but about a yeare after, by intercession of the King, and his submission to the Lords of the Counsell, upon the sixt of <hi>February</hi> he was released and set at liberty: yet this proved but a lightning before a clap of thunder. For the two Dukes, his great and potent adversaries, still prosecuted their malice; insomuch, that not long after, calling him to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond account, when he had nobly acquitted himselfe of all Treasons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, that could be alleadged against him; He was in a tryall at Guild-Hall (not having a Jewry of his Peeres) convicted of Felony; and in the first yeare of the King, upon the two and twentieth day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the great Duke of Sommerset (the Kings Unkle and Lord Protector) was beheaded upon the Tower Hill. But this envy in the two Dukes escaped not without Gods heavy Judgements; for after the Kings death <hi>Northumberland</hi> having a large commission from the Lords, signed with the great Seale of England, to raise an Army to suppresse the Lady <hi>Mary:</hi> afterward repenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, sent a countermand after him, and when he thought himselfe in most security, the Nobility forsaking him, and the Commons abandoning him, hee with his sonnes and some few servants in Cambridge were left alone; where notwithstanding in the open Market-place he proclaimed the Lady
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40285:17"/>
               <hi>Mary</hi> Queene; yet in Kings Colledge he was arrested of high Treason, and thence brought to the Tower of London, and on a scaffold upon the Hill, the twelfth day of <hi>August</hi> next following, lost his head.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Suffolke being likewise proclaimed Traytor, had a servant called <hi>Vnderwood,</hi> whom he had raised to a faire estate, and therefore to his trust he committed his person; who for some moneths concealed him in an hollow tree, and morning and evening brought him his food; with millions of oaths engaged for his truth and fidelity: but being corrupted with a small quantity of gold, and some large promises, he betrayed him, and delivered him up to the noble Earle of Huntington, under whose conduct the Duke with a strong guard of speare-men, was conveyed through London to the Tower, and the seaventh day after his surprisall he was arraigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of Treason in the great Hall at Westminster; and upon the twenty fourth day on the Tower Hill beheaded.</p>
            <p>In this relation it is worthy to be observed in those two great Dukes of Sommerset and Northumberland, that though the whole Kingdome could scarce satiate their ambitions, yet now a small piece of earth contents them: for they lie buried together before the Altar in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church in the Tower betwixt two Queenes, the wives of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, Queene <hi>Anne</hi> and Queene <hi>Katharine,</hi> they being also both beheaded.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Iverse are the divisions and branches of this sinne of <hi>Wrath,</hi> which some reduce to these foure heads; <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, Veniall, Capitall, Generall:</hi> It is then called <hi>Mortall,</hi> when it hath a desire to punish, not to satisfie the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the Law, but its spleene; or when through the vehemence of anger, it divides from the love of God, and our neighbour; or when it seekes a severe and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell revenge for trifling delinquencies: It is called <hi>Veniall,</hi> when the motion of ire doth prevent the judgement of reason, but the consent followeth not; when we are too spleenfull and chollerick within: or when the signes of our outward indignation too manifestly appeares outwardly. That which is called <hi>Capitall,</hi> ariseth either from the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>mouth,</hi> or the <hi>act;</hi> that from the heart is rather cal'd indignation, when him whom we suppose to have injur'd us, we hold base and unworthy; and upon that wee animate and incourage our revenge, or <hi>Tumor ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

In Act, that is called <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

which is rayling and scoulding: In which are understood all the nocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and dammages, which through wrath we can possibly doe to our neighbour. Of the fourth called <hi>Generall,</hi> there be three species; <hi>Acuta,</hi> which is that anger which ariseth upon small or no occasion at all; <hi>Amara,</hi> or bitter, when for an injury done we keepe it long in remembrance; and stile a fit opportunity for revenge: <hi>Gravis</hi> or <hi>Difficilis,</hi> when we never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an injury, till we satisfie our rage by punishment.</p>
            <p>Against all these there be Texts in the Holy Scripture, <hi>Genesis</hi> 27. 21. <note place="margin">Texts in the holy Scripturè by which wrath is condemned.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore Esau hated his brother Iacob, because of the blessing wherewith his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blessed him: and Esau thought in his minde, the dayes of mourning will come, and then will I slay my brother Iacob.</hi> Prov. 22. 29. <hi>Make no friendship with an angry man, neither goe with the furious man, least thou learne his wayes, and leave destruction to thy soule, 29. 22. An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.</hi> Eccles. 6. 11. <hi>Be not thou of an hasty spirit to be angry, for anger resteth in the bosome of fooles.</hi> Matth. 5. 22. <hi>But I say unto you, whosoever is angry with his brother unadvisedly, shall be culpable of Iudgement, &amp;c.</hi> Ephes. 4. 31. <hi>Let all bitternesse, and anger, and wrath, crying and evill speaking, be put away from you, with all maliciousnesse.</hi> Coloss. 3. 8. <hi>But now put yee away all these things, wrath, anger, malitiousnesse, cursed speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, filthy speaking out of your mouthes.</hi> Tim. 1. 2. 8. <hi>I will therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up pure hands without wrath or doubting.</hi> Tit. 1. 7. <hi>For a Bishop must be unreproveable, as Gods steward; not froward, not angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre.</hi> We reade in the fourth of <hi>Luke,</hi> that when Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had beene brought up; and as his custome was, went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to reade; at which divine Sermon it is said, <hi>Vers. 28. Then all that were in the Synagogue when they heard it, were filled with wrath, and rose up and thrust him out of the City, and led him unto the edge of the hill on which their City was built, to cast him downe headlong; but he passed through the midst of them and went his way.</hi> Many other Texts are to this purpose, to reprove and condemne wrath and anger; the fruits and effects whereof are for the most part manslaughter, murder, and the like; of which by reason of their consanguinity and alliance, I am tyed to speak something, though briefly.</p>
            <p>Of Homicides, these amongst others are named in the Scriptures; <hi>Cain, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi, Abimelech, Doeg</hi> the Edomite, <hi>Ioab, Baanah</hi> and <hi>Rechab,</hi>

In King <hi>David</hi> himselfe, who wrote thus in his letter, Put you <hi>Vriah</hi> in the fore-front of the strength of the battaile, and recoile ye backe from him, that hee may be smitten and die. <hi>Absalom</hi> in killing his brother <hi>Ammon.

            <p>But I come now to Ethnick Histories; and first of them most forraigne: In handling of which, I will give you to begin with a Catalogue of such as have beene most cruell. <hi>Ptolomaeus Pisco</hi> one of the Kings of Aegypt, caused his owne sonne <hi>Memphites</hi> (whom he had begot of his wife and sister <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra)</hi> to be slaine, and then commanded his head, hands, and feet, to be cut
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40285:18"/>
off, and to be shut in a curious casket made for the purpose, and sent them unto her as a present on his birth-day; and then after, when he perceived that by his barbarous tyranny he was growne odious unto all his subjects, that he might the better oppose the danger, hee caused a Schoole (where most of the Nobilities children, with others, were doctrinated) to be beset and round environed with swords and fire, and so suddenly assaulted them; that some by steele, others by the flame, were all destroyed, not one of them escaping: But that which hee thought to be his refuge, proved his ruine. For the people were so much incenst with this barbarous and bloudy Act, that with an unanimous consent they fell upon him, and tore him in pieces.</p>
            <p>The like (if not greater cruelty) was practised by a woman, one <hi>Cycenis</hi> the daughter of <hi>Diogerides,</hi> King of Thrace, who greatly delighted to behold living men cut in the middle, and invite parents to feast with their owne murdered children, cookt and drest severall wayes; but she was after depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from her principality, and none of her former subjects relieving her, (so hatefull were her inhumanities) she was famisht to death, and died of hunger.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> caused her who was his wife and mother in law, (for his marriage was incestuous) to have her head parted from her shoulders, though nothing worthy death could be alleadged against her; nor did his tyranny end there, for after his father had resigned the Kingdome to his charge, like an unnaturall paracide, he caused him, with an hundred of his children, Nephewes and Kinsmen, to be cruelly murdered: nor did hee escape unpunished, for the Kingdome tyred with his insolencies, and the World weary with his horrible murders, made him in his death remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for as some write, he died by the stroake of lightening.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vitoldus,</hi> Prince of Lituania, studied divers sorts of tortures and torments for men, upon any sleight cause condemned to death, one of which, was, he would command them to be sewed in Beares skinnes, and then made it his sport to behold them torne in pieces with fierce Mastiffes: Moreover in all his warlike expeditions, hee had alwayes a steele bow ready bent, and what souldier soever but stept out of his ranke, hee instantly strooke him dead with an arrow, glorying to himselfe that he was so good a marks-man: But after these, and infinite other cruelties, hee that delighted to see men die like Beares, was himselfe in the end torne in pieces with wilde Wolfes, being paid in the like (though not in the same coyne) which hee lent to others.</p>
            <p>Suiting to which is that story of <hi>Perillus,</hi> who hearing that <hi>Phalaris</hi> the Tyrant over the Agrigentines, was much delighted in the severall wayes of tormenting men, and presuming that nothing could better comply with his cruelty, then to present him with some rare and unheard of machine to that purpose, he devised and forged by his Art a brazen Bull, to open on the one side, and shut againe at pleasure; which being brought to <hi>Phalaris,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him the use for which it was made? who answered him again, he had forged it to punish offendors of high nature; for (saith he) let the naked body be put in at this doore, and then an hot fire made under it, the person tormented will not utter the voyce of a man, to put a telenting commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon you, but the sound will appeare like the bellowing of a Bull, to make it the lesse terrible; which <hi>Phallaris</hi> hearing and grieving in his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions

evill, that any should offer to out-doe him in his cruelty: He told the workeman that he accepted of his gift, but commanded withall that he should make proofe of his owne worke, which was instantly done; and he most miserably tormented in his owne engine: for who more fit to taste of tortures, then they that have the inhumanity to devise them? and they by Gods Justice meritedly suffer themselves what they devise for others: of which <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now if any shall taxe my promise in the title of this worke, and say, True it is, that these were very bloudy and cruell women, and their horrid Acts worthy both to be condemned, and hated of all people whatsoever; but where are the Judgements, or what were the punishments inflicted upon them? I answer: It is not to be doubted but all, or most of these, suffered by the heavy hand of God in this life, and that remarkably: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, the ancient Remembrancers and Chronologers of those times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to leave the manner and particular circumstances of their ends, in that to give the World a more full satisfaction. But howsoever, of this I am assured, that no greater Judgement can be imposed upon any man-slayer or murderer, than to have his, or her name, branded to all posterity. Their actions, as they were prodigious, so their very memories are to be made hatefull, and abhorrid of all.</p>

               <hi>Caligula</hi> the Roman Emperour, when his Grandmother <hi>Antonia</hi> was dead, and her much lamented body being brought to the funerall pile, he would not so much as grace it with his presence; but all the time of the Ceremony, was sporting with his Jesters and Buffoons in a summer Parlor: He slew his brother <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and used his wives father with all contempt and contumelies: He stuprated all his sisters; and which is worse, (if worse might be) hee after made them prostitutes to his Ruffians and Villaines. <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iuba,</hi> his neare Kinsman, and <hi>Macro</hi> and <hi>Euma</hi> his Coadjutors in the Empire, for their good and faithfull service he caused to be put to death: He commanded a <hi>Questor</hi> in Rome (because his name was given up in a Conjuration) to bee stript naked and openly scourged. Many of worthy birth and condition (for crimes devised, not proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them) to branded with hot irons, or otherwise marked and maimed: Some he confin'd to the mending of high-wayes; others, to labour and dig in mynes; and others he imprisoned like bruit beasts in Grates and Cages: some hee caused to be sawed in pieces in the middle, and that for a small fault, or none. When he punisht the sonnes or the daughters, he usually
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40285:20"/>
sent for the parents to bee spectators of the torment; and when a father upon a time would have excused himselfe by the messenger, that hee was grievously sicke and could not come; hee sent a bed to his house, and had him brought thereon. Because a Comick Poet used in his Sceane one doubtfull versicle, which by a double construction might bee wrested to trench upon the Emperours person; he commanded him to be burnt upon the very stage on which the <hi>Dramma</hi> was acted. When hee had sentenc't a Roman Knight to be torne by wilde beasts, because the condemned person proclaimed his innocence, he first commanded his tongue to be cut out, and then sent him presently to be devoured. Having called a Nobleman from Exile, when after his returne he came into his presence, the Emperour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, What he and the rest did all the time of their banishment? who thinking to flatter with him, and insinuate into his favour; made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, We continually prayed that your brother <hi>Tiberius</hi> might die, and your sacred selfe survive and raigne long over us: at which words, a sudden fansie tooke him, that all these which remained in Exile, desired his death; and therefore hee sent in all haste to have them suddenly dispatched out of their lives: Besides his facinorous workes, he used words, fierce, hasty, and favouring of all inhumanity; among others this phrase was often in his mouth, <hi>All things against all men are to me lawfull.</hi> When certaine <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> were together put to death, hee boasted openly, as of a great conquest, saying, He had conquered <hi>Gallogracia.</hi> Those whom he tortured by degree, still as they fainted hee would have them comforted with hot drinkes, to make them longer endure their paine; giving alwayes a charge to the tormentors in these words, <hi>Have yee a care to make them sensible that they must die.</hi> He would also often bragge of that sentence of the Tragicall Poet, <hi>Oderunt dum metuunt;</hi> They hate whilest they fear. He often wished that all the people of Rome had but one neck, that at one blow with an axe hee might cut it asunder. Hee would often grieve and complaine of those times wherein hee lived, because they were not made notorious by some great affliction and dire calamity or other, wishing the slaughter of Armies, famine, pestilence, combustions in the Empire, swallowing of Cities by earthquakes; and whatsoever all good men desired of the gods might not chance, but be removed from them: all these mischiefes and miseries hee wisht might be inflicted on them, not excepting the security of his owne person. Being at <hi>Putcoli</hi> at a solemne annuall dedication made to the Sea, where a multitude of people were assembled; he called and beckoned a great company of men, women, and children, to come to that part of the shore where he was seated; which having done, he commanded the souldiers of his guard to precipitate them into the water; and those who catcht hold of any thing to save themselves from drowning, they with their speares and javelins pusht from all safety, so that they all perisht together. At a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like banquet, because a servant that waited mistooke the taking away of a plate trencher, he presently delivered him to the Hangman to have his hands cut off, and then the plate to be hanged about his neck, and to rest upon his bosome: then a scroule in large letters to be pasted thereon, where was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed his fault and cause of punishment; and in that manner to be led as a spectacle to all the Feasters.

But the people after so great sufferings, now at length tired with his inhumanities, in the very height of his insolencies, when he least dreamed of any such disaster, caused him to be flain; which though a violent death, yet in all mens judgements may appear somewhat too milde for his merit, but the great Judge of all, sometime mitigates the punishments of such grand malefactours here, to make their torments more great and perdurable in the world to come.</p>
            <p>The next I present to your view is <hi>Caius Marius</hi> the Roman, who as he was of great power and potency in <hi>Rome,</hi> so his pride was boundlesse and unmeasured, but his inhumanity far exceeding them both, for after his exile, when he had again emptied the City of all those whom he suspected to have but the least finger in his confinement, by the assistance of <hi>Cinna Carbo</hi> and <hi>Sertorius</hi> he presently fell upon the slaughters of the Princes and Senatours, which was so violent that the channels overflowed with the blood of the slain Nobility.

            <p>I have hitherto spoken of cruell and bloody Tyrants, let me treat a little of Ire or Wrath it self, for they are sinonima's, since all these are but siens growing from that stocke. <hi>Anger</hi> and power meeting in one breast are more violent than any thunderbolt: wrath and revenge take from man the mercy of God, destroying and quenching that Grace which he hath before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time given. <hi>Anger</hi> consisteth in habit and disposition, but Ire and Wrath indeed and effect.

Such is the irreligious boldnesse of some, that I heard a Scotishman of note (soon after King <hi>Iames</hi> came into the Land) speak in the company of prime Gentlemen after this manner, Such a one killed my brother, and I could not meet him in seven yeares after, but at length espying him in the Church on a Sabbath-day, my fury could not contain it selfe, but even where he sate I shot him with my pistoll and slew him, and the arrant puritans (saith he) would have excomunicated me for nothing else but for killing him who had before killed my brother. But though men make slite of these atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and sacrilegious butcheries, that God who made man after his own Image, and all men of one and the selfesame earth and clay, will not let them escape his fearfull and terrible judgements.</p>
            <p>Neither have the holy Fathers the Popes been altogether free of this sin of Ire and implacability, for we reade in their own Chronicles, that upon the day when the <hi>Sacra Cineritia</hi> were celebrated, that was upon <hi>Ash-wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> in which is used great solemnity, when the great Presbiters and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals according to the custome came to kneel to Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> to receive the ashes, he took the ashes and vessell in which they were contained, and in great rage flung them in the face of <hi>Prochetus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Genoa,</hi> with whom he was at oddes, and hated him exceedingly, and changing his words of exhortation and benediction, he violently brake out into this language, Remember O thou man that thou art of the faction of the <hi>Gebelines,</hi> and with those <hi>Gibelines</hi> thou shalt die; for he was of that party, and enemy to the <hi>Guelfs,</hi> whom the Pope favoured. <hi>Stephanus Sextus</hi> because <hi>Formosus</hi> upon his death-bed would not set his hand to his election, (who was Pope before him) when he came to be instated in the Papacy, he commanded him to be plucked out of his sepulcher, and buried in the Church-yard, causing his fingers first to be cut off, and so basely dismembred him being dead, for refusing to subscribe for him being alive. With the like malevolent hatred also did <hi>Sergius</hi> the third prosecute the same <hi>Formosus,</hi> who again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his body to be taken out of the second Grave, and brought it into the <hi>Forum</hi> or publike <hi>Rialto,</hi> when the head was cut from the body, and cast into the river <hi>Tiber,</hi> and this he did to insinuate into the favour of <hi>Lothari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> to whom <hi>Formosus</hi> living was in great opposition. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other examples of the like malitious nature I could extract out of their Annals, and those remembrancers who have writ the lives of the Popes, which for brevity sake I omit, but am confident withall, that these evil presidents from the Clergy (whose light should shine to others) have been a great encouragement to the Laity to offend in the like, who for the most part paterne their actions, be they good or evill, by their teachers and instructers.</p>

In the Raigne of <hi>Christierne</hi> the second King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> when some twelve of his prime Courtiers were making merry in a parlor, and amongst them one who was Post-master to the King, it happened that dissention falling amongst them, upon the suddain all the lights (in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult) were put out, and one amongst them slain with a poniard, but lights at length brought in, and the Body found murdered and breathlesse, the King desired to have account for his dead subject, the Nobles lay all the guilt upon this Postmaster, but the King with whom he was then gracious, thought it to be done of malice, and perswaded himselfe that he was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the act: they on the contrary alledge that he was the cause of that meeting, that there had been a former grudge and malice betwixt them, and moreover, that when the lights were brought in he was found next to the dead Body, so that they desired the Body to be laid upon a table, and every one singly to lay his hand upon the naked breast of the person murdered, with a deep protestation, that they were innocent of the act, which was done in the Kings presence, and they came all by course according to the manner proposed, but in the Body was found no change or alteration at all: at last came the <hi>Cursor</hi> or Postmaster, and first embracing his feet, and with many teares kissed them, thinking by that meanes, if it were possible, to pacific
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40285:23"/>
his just incensed spirit, and at length comming to lay his hand upon the breast of the dead body, a double flux of bloud issued from his wounds and nostrils, and that in great abundance; by which finding himselfe convicted, he confessed his malitious act, and by the King was committed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Executioner. This story the Lord <hi>Henricus Ranzovius,</hi> Vicar gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to the King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> in all his Dukedomes a man illustrious in Nobility and Learning, relates in his Responsory to the Consulatory of <hi>David Chitraus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another suiting to this I finde related by Doctor <hi>Othe Melander,</hi> in his <hi>Iocoserni;</hi> who speaks of a man, who through rankor and hatred had watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his neighbour till he had found meanes by meeting him in the thickets and woods, (a place convenient for such a mischiefe) to lay violent hands upon him, and murder him; and after escaped without the least suspition of the fact: but the body being after brought to the <hi>Iizehohensian</hi> Senate, they gave command that one of the hands should be cut off, and hanged up over the dining-table in the common Jayle or Prison. It happened that the malefactor being some ten yeares after committed upon some delinquency, (of no great matter or moment) that he was brought into the same roome, and by accident when hee sate downe to meate, plac't just under the hand, which though it had beene withered and dryed for so many yeares, bled freshly, and dropt upon his trencher; at which all being amazed, the Gaoler went straight to informe the Senate, who sent to examine him, and he being convinced in conscience by that divine prodigy, soone acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himselfe guilty; for which he was committed to the charge of the Executioner, and according to the custome of those Countries, broken upon the wheele.</p>
            <p>In the Diocesse of one of the Dukedomes of <hi>Saxony,</hi> commonly called <hi>Gerstenauta,</hi> there lived in one Village a Shepheard and a Rustick or Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, who were of that antipathy in condition, that above all measure they hated one another; and though neighbours and friends on both sides had appointed sundry meetings, to mitigate and reconcile this inveterate malice, yet they found it unpossible to be done, and so left them to their giddy and haire-brain'd fury; which gave them now the more scope and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to insidiate one another, yet neither of them durst attempt their worst of indignation, as fearing the danger of the Law: Yet they ceased not back-biting, slandering, railing, calumniating openly, besides private whispering and murmuring, (insomuch as in them lay) to take away each others reputation and good fame: and moreover, to devise and seeke out by what meanes they might dammage one another in their goods, chattels, or any other part of their estate, which grew to such unsufferable height, that neither of them able to indure their mutuall incumbrances and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, secretly agreed together to make an end of all in single fight; for which they both prepared themselves against the day appointed: The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band man provides himselfe of a good forrest bill, with some other shorter weapons, as a ponyard or a dagger, to speed his enemy if they should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to close in the encounter: The other causeth a sheephooke to be made of a strong ashen plant, in the bottome a pike of three inches long, sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like the point of a needle, and to skrew in and out at pleasure: the head thereof (though fashioned like a hooke) was of massy steele, yet made with the like skrew; and being taken off, there was another pike of six or seaven
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40285:24"/>
inches long, insomuch that the Smith who had the charge of forging the materials, greatly wondered for what use it was: Before the day of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate came, newes was brought to the other of this dreadfull weapon, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He now concealeth himselfe in a private house, unsuspected of any, thinking himselfe secur'd both from pursuit and punishment; but Gods Judgements are nearest when malefactors (in that heinous kinde) thinke them to be farthest off, as shall appeare by the subsequence: for soone tyred with the closenesse of the house, (as being still used to the fields, and liberty of the fresh aire) he one day walking abroad, happened to come within the Toyles, where the Illustrious Prince of <hi>Hesse, Philip</hi> the first of that name, was hunting the wilde Boare; and when the beast (who was of an extraordinary magnitude) was in the hottest of the chase, most fiercely pusued by the dogges, he ranne directly against this Homicide, and goaring him with his tusks, gave him sundry mortiserous and deadly wounds, and so left him as dead in the place: presently the Prince came in, and though not knowing the party, in his great commiseration com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his body (yet breathing) to be borne to <hi>Hirifeldia,</hi> the nearest Towne, and all meanes possible to be provided for his cure: but all was in vaine, within two dayes he died. In which time he confest all the manner of his former murder to those that were his visitants; withall affirming, that he saw not the shape of any Boare, but in him the right figure of the Shepheard, who with his dreadfull shoep-hooke gave him these lacerating and tormenting wounds: which misprision of his is worthy your observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his History is verified by the fore-named Author, Doctor <hi>Oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You may reade in the <hi>Turkish</hi> History, in the time of Sir <hi>Thomas Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> being there Embassadour, that the same noble Gentleman entertained into his family an English-man, and made him one of his Domestick ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who was not one whom he brought over out of England, but found there as a stranger and traveller; whom at his earnest suit, (what for chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and what for Countrey-sake) hee admitted into his house, imploying him in sundry affaires, in all which he diligently and carefully demeaned himselfe: But it so happened, that the Embassadours servants being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad recreating themselves, a company of the rude and barbarous Turkes gave them some affront; in conclusion, from words they grew to blowes, and so unto hurliburly, in which, by the hurling of an unfortunate stone, one of the Turkes being hit under the eare, died of the blow: The English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men retire within their priviledge, and the Turkes threaten to pull downe the house, and to make spoyle of all that was therein; for bloud (they said) ask't bloud, and therefore they would have no satisfaction till the offender were delivered into their hands: now this servant late entertained was not

            <head>CHAP. IV. Gods Judgements against Sloath.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Alomon</hi> saith of Sloath, <hi>Proverbs 19. Vers. 15. Sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse causeth to fall asleepe, and a deceitfull person shall be affamished.</hi> And 28. <hi>Vers. 19. He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread, but hee that followeth the Idle shall be filled with poverty.</hi> Againe, <hi>Proverb. 6. 6. Goe to the Pismire, O sluggard, behold her wayes, and be wise, for she having no guide, governour, nor ruler, prepareth her meate in the summer, and gathereth her food in harvest. How long wilt thou sleepe O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleepe? Yet a little sleepe, a little slumber, a little foulding the hands to sleepe: Therefore thy poverty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as one that travelleth by the way, and thy necessity like an armed man.</hi> This being a sinne generally rather of omission then commission; Examples and the punishments thereof are not so frequent in the holy Text; nor other Ethnick Authors as those actuall and in continuall agitation, yet as farre as Authentick authority will give me leave, I will strive to delineate and expresse it to the full; that being (howsoever sleighted and unminded) mortiferous and deadly, and therefore subject to judgement and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may be the more carefully abandoned and avoyded.</p>
            <p>Pride, fulnesse of bread, and idlenesse, which is a neglect of that duty which belongs to God, and a cessation of that consociety and converse which is requisite amongst men, were part of those sinnes which caused God to raine down fire and brimstone upon Sodome and Gomorrah, whose lazinesse and sloath begot incest, adultery, and that most preposterous and abhominable sinne, since called (from the place) Sodometry. But I desire first to annalyse and distinguish of the vice, before I proceed to further president.</p>
            <p>This fourth head of the beast of Hell, called <hi>Accidia</hi> or <hi>Desidia,</hi> hath a bad root, and spreadeth into many evill branches; for it keepeth from <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning well,</hi> and hindereth from <hi>ending well.</hi> It hindereth good beginnings by six sundry sinnes: The first may be called <hi>Faintnesse,</hi> which is, when a mans love, which ought to be zealous and servent towards his Creator and Redeemer, is cold, faint, and weake, and therefore made unapt either for Devotion, or Prayer; and this commonly happeneth when he is backward and averse to enterprise any good worke of piety or charity. The second may be titled <hi>Tendernesse,</hi> which is the very couch and day-bed on which the Devill resteth and reposeth himselfe, still prompting to the man or woman; Thou hast beene ever tenderly and indulgently brought up, not borne to trouble thy selfe with any toylesome vocation: thou art more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over of a weake constitution, not able to endure paine or labour, much lesse fasting, or any needfull chastising of thy body; that sighing for thy sinnes were hurtfull for thine health, and weeping for thy transgressions would in time spoyle thine eye-sight, with the like malevolent suggestions; which aptly comply with a sentence of one of the Fathers, <hi>Iustum est cum Deo, ut moriens obliviscatur sui, qui vivus, oblitus est Dei:</hi> Most just it is with God,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40285:25"/>
that such men should forget him in their death, who would not remember him in their lives. The third branch is <hi>Idlenesse,</hi> from whence many evils arise, as witnesseth the holy Text: for when the old adversary of mankinde findeth a man idle in his duty towards his Maker, he then findeth him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in his owne wicked workes: first putting him in minde to think of evill, and then to act it; addicting himselfe wholly to villany, ribaldry, luxury; to neglect time and opportunity, wherein hee might doe much good, and make his way towards Heaven: Where on the contrary, doing much evill, hee prepares his passage to Hell and eternall damnation. The fourth beares the title of <hi>Dulnesse</hi> or <hi>Heavinesse,</hi> when we solely incline our selves to drowsinesse and sleep; and then are the adversary and his ministers vigilant and waking, to insidiate us in all our senses: and the lesse apt he findes us to the service of God, the more plyant and flexible hee makes us for the workes of Sathan; and such are they, who for one houres sleep will neglect comming to divine Service, to heare the word of God preached, or to be present at the administration of the holy Sacraments: The first is <hi>Refrectory perversnesse,</hi> that is, when we lie and snort in sinne, and are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and apprehensive of the temptations of the World, the Flesh, and the Devill, yet we neither lift up our heads nor hearts to God by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, nor implore unto him devoutly by confession, nor list up our hands unto him, as promising repentance: like that obstinate and wilfull priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who had rather lie rotting in a stinking and noysome dungeon, then take the paines to walke up the staires where the doores stand wide open, to gaine himselfe his franchise and liberty. The sixt may be stiled <hi>Pus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi> that is, when we dare not enterprise any pious act (after a good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) in a diffidence, that God will not assist us in the performance thereof; and this is a foolish dread that some apprehend from their vaine dreames, and may be resembled to such as dare not venture to walke in such a path, because there the snaile putteth forth his hornes; or young children, that shun their way for the hissing and gagling of Geefe.</p>
            <p>These are the six impediments that hinder to begin well; there are six other quite averse from ending well. The first is <hi>Delay:</hi> for when God putteth into the heart of man to have an appetite, or purpose to doe any good worke, or to repent him of his old sinnes, and prepare himselfe to newnesse of life: Then comes the old Tempter and wispers in his eare; What needes this early and too forward beginning? thou art yet in thy prime and strength, take the benefit and pleasures of thy youth: it is yet too soone: Age will come on, and then thou shalt have leisure, for when the delights of youth forsake thee, thou shalt in thy decrepit estate have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle else or nothing to doe: thus dallying and dandling a wretched soule to it's eternall destruction. Most true it is that God saith, At what time so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a sinner repenteth himselfe of his wickednesse, he will blot out all his offences; but he that made that promise, hath not promis'd to give the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a time of repentance. After <hi>Delay</hi> comes <hi>Negligence,</hi> for whosoever maketh doubts and demurres to turne to God, it is no wonder if he doe it feignedly, superficially, and negligently; and this is a vice generall and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded by few: for alas, how many are to be sound that use care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in performing their bounden duty to God, and executing that charity in which we are obliged towards our neighbour. The third is <hi>Oblivion</hi> and <hi>Forgetfulnesse,</hi> and consequent it is, that whosoever is negligent, must needs
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40285:26"/>
be forgetfull; and both these hinder us from a devout confession of our sins to God; for by casting a neglect upon our transgressions and offences, they soone slip out of our thoughts; and when we have occasion to acknowledge them, and be sorry for them, they are quite out of our remembrance, by which the soule incurres great danger of Judgement. Then followeth <hi>Feare</hi> or <hi>Dread,</hi> which is a faintnesse of the heart bred by evill custome, which makes us to grow in a distrust of Gods mercy, and by that meanes to incurre the fearefull sinne of Desperation: of which, not onely former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ges, but even the times present affoord too many dreadfull examples. And then there is a lazy <hi>Supini,</hi> which breeds a diminution and abatement of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; and is a disease to the soule, as a Consumption to the body; when in the stead of going on, we rather stand still, or draw backe; and this recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and defiling, if not taken in time, may turne to Infidelity and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie; sinnes of that attrocity and diabolicall nature, scarce amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to be named. Sixely and lastly, there is a <hi>Fond Zeale,</hi> or foolish ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by which men weaken their bodies, and disable their spirits by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Vigils and Fasts, by which they thinke to merit Heaven, but in the interim fall into such langor, malady, sicknesse, and disease, that they make themselves disabled, either for the service of God, or following their owne vocation and calling; but of such I presume there be not many.</p>

After, they departed from the Mount <hi>Hor</hi> by the way of the red Sea, to compasse the land of <hi>Edom;</hi> and the people were sore grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved because of the way: And they spake against God, and against <hi>Moses,</hi> saying, Wherefore have ye brought us out of Aegypt to die in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse? for here is neither Bread nor water, and our soule loatheth this light bread: Wherefore the Lord sent fiery serpents amongst the people, which stung them, so that many of the people of Israel died. We reade further in the first of <hi>Haggat, Vers.</hi> 2. Thus speaketh the Lord of Hosts, saying, The people say the time is not yet come that the Lords house should be builded: Then came the word of the Lord by the ministery of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Haggai,</hi> saying, Is it time for your selves to dwell in your seiled hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and this house lie waste? Now therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Consider your own wayes in your hearts; yee have sowne much, and bring in little yee eate, but ye have not enough: ye drinke, but ye are not filled: ye cloath ye, but you are not warme: and he that earneth wages, putteth the wages into a broken bagge, &amp;c. Come to the Gospell, <hi>Matthew 25. Vers</hi> 26. And his Master answered to him and said, Thou evill servant and floathfull, thou knewest that I reapt where I sowed not, and gathered where I strawed not: thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the Exchangers, and then at my comming should I have received mine owne with advantage: Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents; for unto every one that hath, it shall be given, and he

shall have abundance: and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away; Cast therefore that unprofitable servant into utter darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. This drowsinesse is also blamed by our Saviour Christ in his Apostles, <hi>Marke</hi> 14. 37. Then hee came and found them sleeping, and said to <hi>Peter, Simon,</hi> sleepest thou? couldest thou not watch one houre? watch ye and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</p>
            <p>From Divine, I come to Ethnick Examples: <hi>Capitolinus</hi> hath left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred unto us, that <hi>Authonius Pius</hi> being Emperour, caused the roofes and coverings of all such houses to be taken away, as were knowne to receive any idle people; affirming that nothing was more uncomly or absurd to be suffered, then such idle caterpillars and slow-wormes, to have their food and nourishment from that common-weale; in the maintenance of which there was no supply from their industry and labour. Notorious was the lazinesse and sloath of <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperour, for where, as it is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of all Princes whatsoever, not to set their hand or seale to any Briefe, Grant, or Warrant, before they had diligently perused the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, lest perchance they might doe something against their honour and dignity; yet he was of that idle condition, that he had neither the patience to peruse himselfe, or to heare read any thing (of what import soever) he was to subscribe: which his sister <hi>Placida</hi> observing, and willing as farre as she durst, modestly to reprove and taxe this strange sloathfulnes in him; she devised an instrument or writing, in which the Emperour had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted her his onely sister to a most vile, sordid, and contemptible fellow, who used about the Court, and was generally knowne to all; which done, she caused that paper to be shuffled in amongst many others upon the sealing day, to which the Emperor set his hand and signet: and the next morrow she came and prostrated her selfe to him, weeping, and complaining to him of her infelicity and strange disastrous fortune; at which the Emperour won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, demanded the cause of her so great sorrow and heavinesse? to whom she shewed the writing, and his hand and seale to confirme it: at which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more amazed, he made a great protestation, that he never had any such thought or purpose; of which the wise and discreet Lady taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, she told him the whole circumstance how every thing came about, and that it was her owne Act; withall beseeching him (under pardon) to avoid the like or greater inconvenience, which might trench upon the honour and discretion of his sacred Majesty: which was delivered in such passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and affectionate language, that the Emperour received it from her gratefully, and reformed that errour in himselfe for ever after.</p>
            <p>This drowsie and snorting sinne, howsoever in outward appearance it seemes innocuous and harmelesse, neither dammaging the party infected therewith, nor others, yet hath many virulent and bitter impendencies, which alwayes hang over it, as may appeare by History; tyrannizing over the strong, and insulting over the mighty: For example, the invincible <hi>Hercules,</hi> whom neither Giants, Savage Beasts, Serpents, nor Monsters, could withstand; after all his active and immutable labours, when hee gave but the least way to sloath and idlenesse, it brought him to his utter ruine and destruction; who casting off his Lyons skinne, and laying aside his mortiferous club, with his fatall shafts and bow, betook himselfe unto all effeminacie: insomuch, that changing his masculine habit, he put on

His chaste wife <hi>Dianeyra</hi> hearing how strangely he had lost him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, both in his person and reputation of the world; thinking to recall him from this dull and sleepy Lethargy, sent him a shirt for a present, (but ignorant that it was poysoned) which hee had no sooner put on, but it instantly putrified and infected his body all over, cleaving so fast to his skinne, that in striving to plucke away the linnen, he tore the flesh from the bones; so that overcome with the anguish and insufferable torture of the poyson, he built a huge pile of wood which he had torne from the trees that grew upon Mount <hi>Oeta,</hi> to which having put fire, it no sooner grew into a violent flame, but first having cast in his club, and then his Lyons spoyles, he afterwards threw himselfe, where he was burnt to ashes.</p>

            <p>How apt is plenty and fulnesse of bread to alter even the best natures, and of men to make monsters! <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> was a wise, discreet, and well govern'd Prince, and celebrated for many rare vertues: yet it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him by <hi>Suetonius, Sextus Aurelius,</hi> and others, that he was accustomed to lodge nightly with twelve hee Catamites of the one side, and as many she Prostitutes of the other; who rejecting his wife <hi>Scribonia,</hi> contracted himselfe to <hi>Livia,</hi> who was glad to hasten the nuptials, lest her great belly should be discovered: and though hee were a bondslave to lust, he used to punish it in others with all severity; (for so the former Authors report of him) at a Feast where was a great assembly of the <hi>Patricians,</hi> and Senators with their wives; in the middle of the service, betwixt the second and third course, (not able to containe himselfe any longer) he tooke by the arme one of the beautifull'st Matrons, (whose husband was present as a guest) and led her into a with-drawing roome; where after some stay he brought her backe to her seat, with her linnen ruffled and out of order, and a great flush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her face, which was palpable to all there present. He is also said to have stuprated <hi>Tertullia, Terentilla, Drusilla, Salvia, Citiscenia,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>But more prodigious were the lusts of his Successor <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Tranquillus,</hi> devised a seller or vault, which was as a schoole of Venery; and where all libidinous acts were practised in his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. In the woods also he built venereall Groves, where prostitution was daily practised; with some things fearefull to be named. And as there were many prodigious examples of <hi>Neroes</hi> cruelty, so there are also of his incontinence and luxury; all which adde to his hatefull and abhominable life, to make it the more infamous, who most irreligiously committed a rape upon <hi>Rubria,</hi> one of the vestall Virgines, to whom it was held worse then sacriledge to offer the least violence. Hee caused from the beautifull childe <hi>Sporus;</hi> his virill parts to be cut away, indeavouring to have made him a woman, (if Art could have done it;) and then to have married him, and so he did: from whence grew a saying, made common in the mouthes of all, Happy had it beene for Rome and the Empire, if <hi>Neroes</hi> mother had beene such a wife as <hi>Sporus.</hi> Many of his actions are too obscene for mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to utter; Hee had naturall congresse and consociety with his naturall mother <hi>Agrippina;</hi> He caused also one <hi>Doriph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

A noble and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <note place="margin">A strange sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid.</note> Lady who had a lasie and drowsie Chambermaid, and as one bad qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity seldom or never goeth without another, she was of a testy disposition, and of a snappish and curst tongue; it happened that her mistresse upon a time chiding her for her neglect and sloath, she began to mander and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, and in the end to give her Lady very crosse and untoward language, at which being much incenst, she gave her a box on the ear, at which she fell down upon the floor, as if she had been halfe slain, and multiplying many bitter and despightfull words, told her Lady that blow should never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got nor forgiven. Who somewhat sorry, as fearing she had strook her too hard, left her mumbling the devils <hi>Pater noster,</hi> as we say, and minded her no farther. But the devill would not let slip this occasion, putting her in minde, to accuse her Lady of Adultery, and day nor night she could be in quiet, till she had so done: at length attending a fit opportunity when she found her Lord in private, the subtle shrew interupted him after this manner; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Sir, (with pardon craved for my boldnesse) I have a strange secret to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with, were I assured of your silence, but I am afraid that my zeal and tender care I have of your honour may be misprised, and that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which belongeth to others may redound upon my selfe to mine own ruine; at which the Crocodile wept, and her Lord longing to know what the matter was, protested secrecy, and bid her say on: when she thus proceeded, I know (Sir) that you are confident of the modesty, purity, and conjugall chastity of your Lady, as wholly devoted to your love, having no other rivall or competitor in her affection; but to my great sorrow I speak it, she violates her matrimoniall tie, and adulterates your sheetes in your absence, not with a Gentleman of any of fashion, or quality, but with one of the Groomes of your stable, which I most humbly beg of your honour that you will keep private to your selfe, till I make you eye-witnesse of what I speak, and bring you to the place where this ungodly congresse is frequently used betwixt them. And here she broke off abruptly as if teares constrained by sorrow had stopped her in her further relation.</p>
            <p>At this discourse the Nobleman was stupified, and though he ever found her indulgent and affectionate towards him, and could never tax her of the least lascivious glance or incontinent gesture, yet he remembred that when his custome was to rise early to hunt, or hawk, or to survey his Parkes and grounds, he found her scarce up or ready when he came backe to break fast, and then his jealousie began to suggest him that in that interim this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse might be committed; and so growing full of thoughts, he left her (the devils agent) to attend the event, who let slip no occasion to prosecute the mischief that she had begun, but finding him comming early one morning (after his sports) and knowing her Lady was then in bed, ran presently to the stable and called one of the Groomes in haste, and told him he must run suddenly to her Lady in her chamber, for she had a serious businesse in which to imploy him, which she did with such servency, that the Groom ran to the chamber as if it had been for life and death, (and so indeed it proved) and finding his Ladies door open, entered: in which time she cals her Lord, and hastens him to the place, but before he came thither, the Lady spying the Groom to rush so suddenly into the chamber, called him bold and saucy varlet, and (ignorant of the deceit) flung bed-staves at his head, and not having the patience to hear what he had to say for himselfe, bad him get him thence with a vengeance, whom his master met just at the door, and with his sword ran him through, so that without speaking he fell dead in the place, and there in the heat of fury, ere she had the leisure to aske what the matter was, he as she lay in her bed and without any question or answer expected transpierc'd her to the heart, whose chaste soul (no doubt) mounted unto that blessed place of rest to which her piety, devotion, and charity in her life time chiefly aymed; now as he stood leaning upon his sword so lately imbrued in the bloud of these two innocents, having a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand chimera's in his brain, and her flinty and obdurare heart mean time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting at the horridnesse of the strage committed, she could keep her own devillish counsell no longer, but presently burst out into this language; Alas my Lord, what have I done? Never was Lady more chaste or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to the bed and imbraces of her husband than she who here lies welter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her innocent blood, whatsoever I spake of her was false and untrue, as meerly suggested by the devill, and this I malitiously devised in revenge

And then called veniall, when though we love wealth, we use no indirect course to get it, nor hinder others by our illiberality or gripplenesse to keep it, and may be called good husbandry. It is capitall, and so called, because it is the head of many other sinnes, and exceedeth either in retaining, from whence ariserh <hi>obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> against pity, which is also called <hi>inhumanity,</hi> or the unquietnesse of the minde, which begets superfluous solicitude and care: or <hi>violence,</hi> when we take from others injustly and by force: or <hi>fallacy,</hi> when we equivocate in our bargaines: or <hi>perjury,</hi> when we use an oath to confirme it: or <hi>fraud,</hi> when for gain we sticke not to deceive: or <hi>prodition,</hi> and that was the sin of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who for a price betrayed his Master. It is called generall, because of it there be many <hi>species,</hi> one specially consists either in the defect of giving, or the excesse in the desire of having; of the first in giving, he is called <hi>Parcus</hi> who giveth little, <hi>Tenax</hi> who gives nothing, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> who parts with that he gives with great difficulty. <hi>Excesse in acquiring</hi> consists in gaining filthily, or injustly; filthily, by illiberall acts, as striving to enrich ones selves by base, vile, and sordid meanes, in which is included all meretricall gain got by prostitution or panderisme, with the like: and amongst these injustly avaritious, are numbered, <hi>Vsurers</hi> guilty of oppression and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Theeves</hi> who rob either openly or privately, <hi>spoilers</hi> of the dead, false Executours, &amp;c. and <hi>Dicers,</hi> who covet to prey on the goods of their friends living.</p>
            <p>And this grand vice with all the severall branches thereof is condemned in the holy Scriptures, <hi>Gen. 18. 21.

He hath devoured sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and he shall vomit it, for God shall draw it out of his belly.</hi> And 27. 8. <hi>For what hope hath the hypocrite when he hath heaped up riches, if God take away his soul. Psal. 62. 10. Trust not in oppression nor in robbery, be not vain, if ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches encrease set not thine heart upon them. Prov. 1. 19. Such are the wayes of every one that is greedy of gain, he would take away the life of the owners thereof. Ier. 8. 10. Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields unto them that shall possesse them, for every one from the least unto the greatest is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto covetousnesse, and from the Prophet unto the Priest every one dealeth falsly. Ezech. 18. 7. He that hath not oppressed any, but hath restored the pledge to his debtour, he that hath spoiled none by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, and hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, but hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, and hath executed true judgement betwixt man and man, and hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgements, to deal truly, he is just, and shall surely live, saith the Lord. Matth. 6. 24. No man can serve two masters, for either he shall hate the one and love the other, or else he shall leane to the one and despise the other, ye cannot serve God and riches. Luke 12. 15. Wherefore he said nnto them, take heed and beware of covetousnesse, for though a man have abundance, his life standeth not in his riches. Iohn 12. 4. Then said one of his Disciples, even Iudas Iscariot Simons son which should betray him, Why was not this oyntment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor? now he said this not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thiefe and had the bag, and bare that was given.</hi> It is <hi>Radix omnium malorum. 1 Tim. 6. 10. For the desire of money is the root of all evill, which whilest some lusted after they erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrowes, for they that will be rich fall into many temptations and snares, and into many foolish and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some lusts, which drown men in perdition and destruction.</hi> Covetous men are contemners of Gods Word, <hi>Matth. 13. 22. And he that received the seed amongst thornes is he that heareth the Word, but the cares of the world, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse of riches choak the Word, and he is made unfruitfull.</hi> It is no better than idolatry, <hi>Col. 3. 5.

He hath undone many, he hath forsaken the poor, and hath spoiled houses which he builded not, surely he shall feel no quietnesse in his body, neither shall he reserve of that which he desired, there shall none of his meat be left, therefore none shall hope for his goods, when he shall be filled with his abundance, he shall be in pain, and the hand of the wicked shall assail him, he shall be about to fill his belly, but God shall send upon him his fierce wrath, and shall cause to rain upon him, even upon his meat, &amp;c.</hi> They are not capable of everlasting life, <hi>Col. 6. 10. Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners shall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Many more Texts there are to the like purpose, but I come nearer to shew you examples of Covetousnesse, and the punishments thereof out of the sacred Scriptures.</p>
            <p>We reade <hi>Iosh. 7. 20. And Achan answered Ioshua, and said, I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus I have done, I saw amongst the spoiles a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, and I covered them, and behold, they lie hid in the earth, in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</hi> It followeth, <hi>Verse</hi> 24.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40285:32"/>
               <hi>Then Ioshua took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sonnes, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tents, and all that he had, and all Israel with him brought them to the valley of Achor: and Ioshua said, in asmuch as thou hast troubled us, the Lord shall trouble thee this day; and all Israel threw stones at him, and burnt them with fire and stoned them with stones, &amp;c.</hi> It was also punished in <hi>Nabal, 1 Sam</hi> 1. 25. who was churlish, gripple, and covetous, and ungratefull to <hi>David</hi> and his servants, for which the Text saith, <hi>Verse 36. And about ten dayes after the Lord smote Nabal that he died:</hi> who not onely lost his life, hut had his wife <hi>Abigail</hi> given unto <hi>David,</hi> whom he before despised. <hi>Ahab</hi> King of Israel for coveting of <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard, and by the meanes of his wife <hi>Iezebel</hi> putting him to death, that her husband might take possession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: hear his terrible judgement that followed, 1 <hi>Kings 21. 17. The Word of the Lord came to Eliah the Tishbite, saying, Arise, go down to meet Ahab King of Israel which is in Samaria, lo, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it: therefore shalt thou say unto him, thus saith the Lord, hast thou killed, and also gotten possession: and thou shalt speak unto him saying, thus saith the Lord, in the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogs licke even thy blood also, behold, I will bring evill upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, as well him that is shut up, as him that is left in Israel: and I will make thy house like the house of Ieroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation whereby thou hast provoked and made Israel to sin: and of Iezebel spake the Lord, saying, the dogs shall eat Iezebel by the wals of Iezreel; the dogs shall eat him of Ahabs stocke that dieth in the City, and him that dieth in the fields shall the fowles of the air eat, &amp;c.</hi> Now what more fearfull judgement could have been pronounced against them? all which punctually happened unto them according to the Prophets saying.</p>
            <p>Further, we reade <hi>Esay 1. 23. Thy Princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves, every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards, they judge not the fatherlesse, neither doth the widows cause come before them, therefore saith the Lord God of hostes, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will case me of my adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies. Ier. 22. 17. Thine eyes and thine heart are but onely for thy covetousnesse, and to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for destruction, even to do this; Therefore thus saith the Lord against Iehoiakim the son of Iosiah King of Iudah, they shall not lament him, saying, ah my brother, and ah my sister; neither shall they mourne for him saying, ah Lord, or ah his glory, he shall be buried as an asse is buried, and cast forth without the gates of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Ezech. 22. 27. Her Princes in the midst thereof are like wolves, ravening the prey to shed blood, and to destroy soules for their own covetous lucre. In thee have they taken gifts to shed bloud, thou hast taken usury, and the increase, and thou hast defrauded thy neighbour by extortion, and hast fogotten me, saith the Lord God, behold therefore I have smitten mine hands upon thy covetousnesse that thou hast used, and upon the blood which hath been in the midst of thee: I will scatter thee amongst the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, &amp;c. Amos 4. 1. Hear this word ye kine of Baashan, that are in the mountaines of Samaria, which oppresse the poor, and destroy the needy, &amp;c. The Lord God hath sworne by his holinesse, that loe, the dayes shall come upon you, that he will take you away with thornes, and your posterity with fish-hookes. Micah 2. 2.

            </p>
            <p>And thus far the Scriptures against this horrid vice of Covetousnesse. I come to the Fathers: Saint <hi>Augustine, De verbo Domins,</hi> useth these words, What is this avidity of concupiscence without measure? when even beasts themselves observe a mediocrity; they onely prey when they are an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, but cease to spoil when they are satisfied, onely the avarice of the rich is insatiable, it alwayes rages, and is never sated, it neither feareth God, nor reverenceth man; it spareth not the father, nor acknowledgeth the mother; it regardeth nor brother, nor childe, but breaketh covenant with a friend, it oppresseth the widdow, invadeth the orphant, distresseth the poor, and is prone to bring false witnesses, and what a madnesse is it to desire death for life? and in seeking to finde gold, to lose Heaven?</p>
            <p>And Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his Sermons thus: It is all one for him that hath, to take from him that wants, and when thou hast, and canst, to deny re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the indigent and needy; it is the bread of the hungry that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinest, the cloathing of the naked that thou keepest backe, the money that thou hidest in the earth is the redemption of the captive, and know, thou robbest so many of those goods as it is in thy power to confer upon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40285:33"/>
when thou denyest to succour them: Those fortunes and those riches are not a mans owne, which he cannot carry with him, onely mercy and charity forsake not a man in his death.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, To a covetous man that is as much wanting which he hath, as what he hath not, because hee rather desires to have what hee wants, or is still in feare to lose what he hath; who, whilest in adversity he hopes for prosperity, in prosperity hee feares adversity. And in another place. The covetous man burnes here with the heat of concupiscence, and shall burne after in the fire of <hi>Gehenna.</hi> If hee see one more potent then himselfe, he suspects an oppressor: If one inferiour, hee feares a thiefe: and such are most unhappy, who really suffer whatsoever they shall but feare to suffer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Huge lib. de Clar.</hi> useth these words: There be foure things in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing of goods and riches to be observed; namely, that lawfull things we doe not acquire injustly; or being injustly acquired, we doe not strive to injoy them unlawfully: that we strive not to possesse much, though law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; nor things justly got, defend unlawfully; for either evilly to acquire, or badly to use what is acquired, what is lawfull makes unlawfull: for, to possesse much hath some alliance to avarice, and commonly it happens, what is too much lov'd, is ill defended. I conclude with <hi>Gregory</hi> in one of his Homilies, Every avaritious man from drinke doth multiply thirst; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when he hath once injoyed what he before coveted, he is not therewith satisfied, but hath the greater inclination to cover more.</p>
            <p>But from the Fathers I come to Ethnick History, and first I will give you the appellation of some rich men: <hi>Cacilius Camidius</hi> was of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite estate, that though he had lost a great part of his riches in the civill warres of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet at his death he left foure thousand domestick servants and retainers; in his stables he had an hundred and threescore horses, three thousand and sixe hundred oxen, and of other head of cattle two hundred fifty and seaven thousand, and <hi>pecuniis numeratis,</hi> that is in ready coyne sixe hundred thousand pound weight, who also gave to be expended upon his Funerall eleven thousand <hi>Sestertii. Marcus Crassus</hi> would not allow any man to be called a rich man, who was not able out of his private coffers to maintaine a Legion of Souldiers for a yeare; the annuall revenue of his fields and grounds arrable and pasture, amounted to fiftie hundred thousand crownes of gold: Neither did this suffice him (saith <hi>Pliny)</hi> but he was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to winne and possesse all the gold of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> The greatest part of his wealth he purchast out of the civill garboyles, seditions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions, converting the publike calamities to his private use and benefit; for when he had left him three hundred Talents onely from his fathers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, before he enterprised any expedition against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> hee had gathered together into one Magazine seaven thousand and one hundred Talents, though hee had before consecrated the Tenths and Tythes of his whole estate to the Temple of <hi>Hercules.</hi> Hee moreover made a publique Banquet, in which he feasted the whole people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and gave to every one of his guests three pounds in silver: He kept moreover as his servants that had dependance of him, five hundred Smiths and Carpenters, skilfull in Architecture; whom hee not onely imployed in his owne sumptuous Buildings and Aedisices; but to any noble Citizen who had a will and desire to build, he not onely lent them freely, but paid them at his owne charge:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40285:33"/>
yet this man overcome with covetousnesse of the <hi>Parthian</hi> gold, was by them taken prisoner in battaile, who knowing his great avarice, caused molten gold to be powr'd downe his throat, deriding his insaciety in these tearmes; For gold thou thirstest in thy life, and now take thy fill of it in thy death.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>Pallas</hi> the freed man of <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi> was held to bee twenty times richer then <hi>Crassus: Plinius</hi> the Praetor speakes of this <hi>Pallas,</hi> as also of <hi>Calistus</hi> and <hi>Narcissus,</hi> possest of innumerable wealth, during the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of <hi>Claudius,</hi> insomuch that the plenty of <hi>Narcissus</hi> grew to a proverbe, for if they had to speake of any man who was possese of superabundant wealth, they would say he was as rich as <hi>Narcissus:</hi> of this <hi>Pallas Iuvenall</hi> speakes in his first Satyre, who with <hi>Narcissus</hi> were the freed men of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius;</hi> and by the generall suffrage of the Senate, had not onely mighty Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives conferred upon them, but they were admitted unto prime Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and underwent the most honourable offices in the Citie: More over the Emperour (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes) bestowed upon <hi>Pallas</hi> the Praetorian En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, with great summes of money, being yearely possest (besides his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick wealth) of three thousand <hi>Sestertii;</hi> but what happinesse had hee by the enjoying of such abundance? the same Author relates, that <hi>Ner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great King of <hi>Syria</hi> did so abound in riches, that purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to make warre upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> he gathered a puissant and numerous Army, who were accommodated in all the bravery that could be possible; their Helmets being richly plumed, and the heads of their Speares and Shields shining with silver and gold; who after with great esteeme, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of his Souldiers, and pride of his Host to <hi>Hanniball,</hi> he asked him whether he thought that these were not able to conquer the <hi>Romane?</hi> who after some small pause made him answer: I cannot presume that they are able to vanquish them, but of this I am most assured, they are able to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them, if the <hi>Romans</hi> be covetous; and so it after proved to his great dishonour.</p>

            <p>From those which were rich, I come to the covetous: <hi>Constat, Manasses, Annaltum pag.</hi> 94. relates that <hi>Chaganus</hi> King of the <hi>Septentrionall Scythians,</hi> when he had invaded many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Forts and Cittadels, even those most strongly manned and defenc't, in his first violent assaults tooke in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny walled Cities, and all the Region bordering upon <hi>Ister,</hi> quite depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutated; insomuch that the whole River was sanguin'd with the bloud of the Natives. And having surprised many Captives, to the number of twelve thousand men, hee sent to the Emperour <hi>Mauricius</hi> to know if hee would redeeme them being Christians, and his subjects: but neither the extreame rage of the <hi>Scythian</hi> cruelty, nor the barbarous Kings inhumanity, neither the cryes and ejaculations of the miserable and distressed prisoners, could move the minde of this obdure and flinty-hearted Emperour, who was wholly given over the base and sordid avarice. Againe, <hi>Chaganus</hi> sent unto him. Embassadours with more moderate and reasonable conditions, with a great part of the first price deducted; to which the covetous Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would not lend any eare at all: which <hi>Chaganus</hi> hearing, he raged like a Tyger, and caused them all to be hewed to pieces; the whole Region to be covered with their carkasses; the fields to bee stain'd with their bloud; and their bodies to be piled in an heape almost to the height of a Pine-tree: which cruell act of the Emperour my Author thus aggravates. O gold and love of gold, more cruell then a Tyrant! of men the persecutor, the Fort of mischiefe, the Castle of destruction, the eversion of Towers, the depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Cities, the demolishing of Walls and Gates, the fall of Houses, the ruine of Families: O with what mischiefes doest, thou afflict us mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals! no earthly thing can compare with thee in cruelty: Thou softnest the hard, indurat'st the soft; thou givest speech to the silent, and makest mute the free speaker: In roving, thou makest the swift slow pac't, and puttest wings to the feet of the lazy: Thou kickest against Law and Justice, expellest bashfulnesse and modesty, violat'st Sepulchres, diggest through; there is nothing which thou wilt not sell, nothing which thou wilt not betray.</p>
            <p>Now let us looke upon the dreadfull Judgement of God, which fell upon this gripple minded Prince, who was so hated amongst the Christians, that upon Christmas day, as he was entring into the Temple, was like to have beene stoned to death: After which he grew jealous even of his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the best friends about him, lest they should supplant him from the Imperiall dignity; of which he grew the more timerous, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of divers ominous dreames: for there appeared unto him in his slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers a blazing-starre like a sword, and a Monke running with a sword drawn to the Emperours Statue, inrag'd and crying out aloud, <hi>Imperatorem ferr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hee dreamed also, That he was given to be murdered to one <hi>Phocas;</hi> upon which he sent for one <hi>Philippicus</hi> out of prison, a man whom hee much trusted, and asked him, <hi>Qualis sit Phocas?</hi> What kinde of man is that <hi>Phocas?</hi> To whom <hi>Philippicus</hi> answered, <hi>Centurio ambitiosus, sed timidus:</hi> To whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour againe replyed, If he be a coward, he is then a murderer.

possible to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he was crowned in the Suburbs by <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Patriarch. <hi>Mauricius</hi> in this interim was with his wife and children at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where through griefe and trouble of minde he fell sicke: thither <hi>Phocas</hi> sped him with all expedition, who first caused his two youngest Sons to be slaine in his sight, and then his three daughters; and next their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Constantina,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the second, the next Emperour before <hi>Mauricius;</hi> who beheld the deaths of his sonnes and daughters with great patience: but when he saw his wife in the hand of the tormentor, he burst forth into these words, (acknowledging his faults) <hi>O Lord God, thou art just, and and thy Iudgements are right.</hi> Lastly, <hi>Phocas</hi> commanded his head to be cut off, whose body, with his wives and children, were cast upon the shore, to be a publike spectacle for all the people; where they lay upon the ground till one of the enemies which had belonged to <hi>Mauricius,</hi> caused them to be interted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Achaeus</hi> a King of the <hi>Lydians,</hi> was much branded with this vice of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, who when he had accumulated much riches, and that too by sinister meanes, not therewith contented, hee proceeded further, and put new and unheard of taxes and exactions upon his subjects; when they knew his Treasury abounded with all fulnesse and plenty: In hate of whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame avarice they conspired together, and made an insurrection against him; and having surprised him in his Palace, they haled him thence, and hanged him on a Gibbet with his heeles upward, and his head drowned in the waters of <hi>Pactolus;</hi> whose streames (as sundry Authors write) are of the colour of gold, and hath name amongst the golden rivers; an Embleme of his avarice. Thus you see this deadly sinne seldome or never escapes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Judgement.</p>
            <p>Neither did <hi>Iustinianus</hi> the second, the sonne of <hi>Constantinus Barbatus,</hi> escape the aspersion of this horrid vice, he was the last of the stocke of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius,</hi> a man covetous, unquiet, cruell, and unfortunate: He had two Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants who furnisht his coffers, and for that were graced by him with all Imperiall power and authority; the one <hi>Theodosuis,</hi> a Monke, the other <hi>Stephanus</hi> the Emperours Chaplaine: who was in such credit with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that he durst beate the old Empresse. These two not onely exercised extortion and oppression amongst the Subjects, but great cruelty upon the Princes, Dukes, and Captaines, keeping one of them called <hi>Leontius</hi> two yeares in prison; who after escaping by the helpe of the Patriarch, was made Emperour, and cut off the nostrils of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and sent him as an Exile to <hi>Chersonesus.</hi> Which <hi>Leontius</hi> being after surprised by <hi>Tiberius Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simarus,</hi> he cut off his nostrils and sent him into a Monastery. After <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> returned, being ayded by the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> and suprising both <hi>Leontius</hi> and <hi>Apsimarus,</hi> he caused them to be led bound through the Market-place; and having first trod upon their necks, cut off their heads: then hee pulled out the eyes of <hi>Callinious</hi> the Patriarch, and hanged up <hi>Heraclius</hi> the brother of <hi>Apsimarus.</hi> But at what time he sent his Army against <hi>Chirson,</hi> the Host made <hi>Philippicus Bardanes</hi> Emperour, who made all speed to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and taking <hi>Iustinian</hi> and his sonne <hi>Tiberius</hi> from the Sanctuary, commanded them most miserably to be slaine.</p>
            <p>Nay, even your greatest Prelates, and in the primest places of Episcopall dignity, have not beene excluded from this generall sinne of Avarice. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus Papa</hi> was of that gripple and penurious condition, that he commanded
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40285:35"/>
the ends of wax-candles left after Masse, and the other Service, to bee brought him home to his Palace, to save him light in the nights for his houshold and family. And <hi>Pontanus</hi> writes of one <hi>Agolastus,</hi> a Priest and Cardinall, who though he allowed liberally meat for his horses, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting him of the charge, would in the night steale privately into the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and take the provender out of their mangers; which hee used so long, that being watcht by the master of his horse, and knowing him, beate him soundly, as if he had beene a common theefe.</p>
            <p>But contrary to these, <hi>Alexander</hi> the first, Pope, was of that bounty and munificence, that scarce any meriting man but tasted freely of his liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; who used to say unto his friends in sport, I will tell you all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: I was a rich Bishop, I was a poore Cardinall, and am at this present a beggarly Pope.</p>
            <p>A great example of this vice of desiring to get and have, was that of <hi>Alcmaeon</hi> the son of <hi>Megaclus,</hi> who when he had entertained some of the chief Nobility of <hi>Croesus</hi> King of <hi>Lidia</hi> in their way to <hi>Delphos,</hi> with great humanity and curtesie, the King loth to remain indebted to him, or at least, not some way to correspond with his bounty, invited him to his Palace, and having abundantly feasted him for some dayes, when he was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and take his leave of the King, Nay (saith he) you shall not part thus empty-handed from me before you have seen my Treasury, and take from thence as much gold as you are able to carry, who being of the craving and having condition, presently provided himselfe of large garmenrs, and wide cloathes, with deep and spatious pockets, and thought not all sufficient, for comming to the Magazine, having taken thence as much as it was possible for him to dispose of in any place about him, he then filled his mouth, and crammed it to the very teeth, and had conveyances in hair, and so swearing under this burden, disguised like a man distracted and quite out of his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he appeared before the King, who when he saw him so estranged from himselfe, burst into a loud laughter, and in contempt of his covetousnesse, with great scorne and derision let him depart. Thus far <hi>Herodotus.</hi>

            <p>Neither hath the Feminine sexe been altogether free from the same asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, but most justly taxed; for when <hi>Brennus</hi> our Countriman (and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Belinus</hi> King of this Land) being then Captain of the Gauls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged <hi>Ephesus</hi> with his Army, a great Lady of the City, called <hi>Dominica</hi> sent to parle with him, and made a covenant, for a mighty great sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to betray it into his hands, which <hi>Brennus</hi> according to the composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion entred, and after sacked and spoiled, and standing at one of the great gates to receive the reward, he willing to keep his promise, and yet in his heart detesting the avarice of the woman, caused so much gold and treasure to be thrown upon her, till under the huge masse she was buried alive.</p>
            <p>Near allied to the former is the story of <hi>Tarpeia,</hi> one of the vestall vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in <hi>Rome,</hi> who having covenanted with <hi>Sabine</hi> the enemies to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, to betray unto them the Capital for the bracelets they wore on their left arme, which were very rich and costly, they when they were entred and had possession of the place, in stead of their bracelets and carcanets threw upon her their shields and targets worne of their left armes, and so sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And the Emperour <hi>Nerva</hi> for the relief and sustentation of the needy and decayed Citizens, disbursed at one time sixty hundred thousand pieces of silver, and made choice of divers of the prime and most trusty Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to buy and purchase such fields as were vendible, and to divide them amongst the poor, according to their present necessities, as with cloathes, dishes, and vessels to the furnishing of their houses, and the rest to be given them in money; nay, he made sale of lands and houses of his own to make good to the utmost his charitable purposes, (for so <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> reports of him) further, what fine, forfeit, or penalty soever came under the name of Tribute he remitted, all the Cities under his Dominions afflicted with plague or famine he relieved, girles and boyes borne of poor and needy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents he gave order to be kept and educated at the publike charge, and this he caused to be punctually performed through all the Cities of <hi>Italy.</hi> All this and much more <hi>Aurelius Victor</hi> testifies of him: and these onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many other I have presented to your view, as a beauty and splendor to make the opposite vice shew the more deformed and ugly; adding onely this, thateven one Nation can afford plenteous presidents of the like boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and liberality.</p>
            <p>But I come now to shew you what dreadfull murders have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through this grand sin of Covetousnesse, their strange discovery, and the fearfull judgements that have fallen upon the malefactours: in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of which, <hi>Heu lacrymae,</hi> I am not able to vindicate our own Nation, for in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (of blessed memory) there dwelt in the lower end of <hi>Cheap-side</hi> in a place called <hi>Honey-lane,</hi> an old man and woman, the least of them threescore and ten yeares of age, who lived privately and kept no servant, and because they had some meanes comming in yearly, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved sparingly upon it, were imagined by the neighbours to have good store of money, and rather because the furniture of their house was very neat and handsom, and fit to entertain any reasonable guests, (though they seldom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited any) and whether this by prating gossips were talked of at the conduit, and so overheard by some idle raskals, who have no other trade or meanes to live, but robbing, stealing, burglary, and the like; it is not certain, but most true it is that in the dead of night, their house by a false key (or some other pick-locke engine) was entred, the two old people fast sleeping, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their beds, their chests broke open, and rifled, and whatsoever was portable, and of any value carried away, and the doores fast shut upon the dead bodies: the next day they were not seen by their neighbours, who won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred they appeared not as they customably were wont, yet suspected little, but the second day when they found their door to continue shut, no noise at in all the house, nor any newes of them, they knockt and rapt at the door, but received no answer: in the end they sent for an Officer, who with his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, forced open the doores, and found in the first room all things out of order, and walking up the staires they might see the chests and trunkes wide

open, but looking further towards the bed, they might easily discover the good man and his wife miserably murdered: upon which, warrants were made for a privy search, and divers taken in suspition, but no witnesse or evidence could be brought against them: at length one vagabond-like sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was laid hold on, who being brought before one of the City Justices, and examined, could give no account of his life, and by reason he had been by some observed to hanker two or three dayes before thereabout, he was upon that presumption sent to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and the next Sessions arraigned and by some errour or default found in his answer, condemned and hanged, but innocently for that crime (heaven knowes;) for the malefactor after the murder done, with his rich prise escaped into the Low-countries, where he set up a trade, made good use of his stocke, and proved a very thrifty and thriving man, in so much that he grew into the knowledge and familiarity of the Burgers, and was of good credit and countenance amongst them, and so he might have continued, but after some twelve yeares aboad there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown out of all knowledge and remembrance here in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he could not rest in his bed, nor sleep quietly, but he must needs see <hi>England,</hi> and made a voyage hither to that purpose, having no other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse but to buy a piece of plate in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> to carry over backe with him into the Low-countries: to a Goldsmith he comes, and in some few shops above the Standard he cheapens a bowle, and whilest he was bargaining about the price, it happened at the same time a Gentleman was arrested just over against Bow-Church, who presently drawing his sword, made an escape from the Serjeants, and ran up towards the Crosse, the Serjeants and the people cried, stop him, and all their faces were bent that way; which the murderer hearing and seeing, and not knowing the cause of their noise and tumult, he apprehends that he is discovered, and that this is done in his pursuit, and so begins to take his heeles. The people seeing him run, they ran after him, (all not knowing the originall of this uprore) they stop him and demand the cause of his flight, who in his great affright and terrour of conscience said, <hi>He was the man.</hi> They asked what man? he answered, <hi>the same man that committed such a bloody murder so many yeares since:</hi> upon which he was apprehended and committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> arraigned by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, condemned, and hanged first on a gibbet, and after at <hi>Mile-end</hi> in chaines.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40285:37"/>
and alone, he made towards him, and bid him stand and deliver; the other unacquainted with that language, answered him, that he had but little money, and what he had he was loath to part with; Then, said the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thiefe, thou must fight for it; Content, saith the other; and withall both alight, and drew, and fell stoutly to their businesse; in this conflict the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest serving-man was infortunately slain: which done, the other but sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, tooke away his cloak-bagge, and binding it behinde his owne horse, up and fled towards the University; and having set up his horse in the Town, and carried the cloak-bagge or Portmantuan to his chamber; he no sooner opened it, but he found a Letter directed to him from his father: the contents whereof were, That hee had sent him his quarterly or halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeares allowance by his owne man a faithfull servant, (commended unto him by a deare friend) whom he had lately entertained; willing his sonne to use the man kindly for his sake: which Letter when he had read, and found the money told to a penny, and considering he had kil'd his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers man, whom he had intreated to be used curteously at his hands, and onely to take away his owne by force abroad, which hee might have had peaceably and quietly brought home to his chamber; he grew to be strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alter'd, changing all his former mirth into a deepe melancholy. In briefe, the robbery and murder were found and known, and the Lord chiefe Justice <hi>Popham</hi> then riding that Circuit, (whose neare kinsman hee was) he was arraigned and condemned at <hi>Cambridge</hi> Assises, though great meanes were made for his pardon, yet none could prevaile; the Judge forgetting all alliance, would neither commiserate his youth, nor want of discretion, but caused him (without respect of person) to be hanged up amongst the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and common malefactors.</p>

The surviving sonne who was the younger arriveth at the Citie, and having first deplored the death of his brother, (as nature bound him, and glad to heare of him so great and good a report, he takes out a copie of the Will, and after receiveth his money to a farthing; and with this new stock (seeing what was past) hee joyfully returnes into his owne Countrey, who at his first arrivall was as gladly welcommed by his father and mother, who were over-joyed to looke upon the bagges that hee had brought; but when by reading of the Will they saw how partially the money was disposed, in that so little fell to their share, they first began bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

to curse the dead sonne; and after, barbarously to raile on the living; out-facing him that he had changed the Will, by altering the old and forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new: which the innocent youth denying, and excusing himselfe by telling them that the originall was upon record, and by that they might be fully satisfied; yet all would give them no satisfaction, till very wearinesse made them give over their heavy execrations: then the sonne offered them whatsoever was his to dispose of at their pleasure, which they very chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly refused, and bad him take all, and the Devill give him good with it: which drew teares from the sonnes passionate eyes; who after his blessing craved (but denyed) very dolefully left them: and was no sooner departed from them, but to compasse this money they began to devise and consult about his death, which they concluded to be performed that night; and when hee was sleeping in his bed, they both set violently and tygerly upon him, forcing daggers into his breast; so that inforced with the agony of the wounds, he opened his eyes, and spying both his parents with their hands imbrued in his bloud, he with a loud ejaculation clamour'd out these words, or to the same sence:

            <p>Sorry I am that I can paralell this inhumanity (arising from the insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate desire of Gold) out of our owne Countrey; thus it hapned: An Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in a knowne City of this Kingdome, whose wife was living, and they having betwixt them lost one onely sonne, and a sole daughter; the sonne he made meanes to be put to an <hi>East-India</hi> Merchant, who imploye him to Sea, and to trade and traffick in that Countrey, where he stayed long, (some ten yeares or thereabout) insomuch that there was great doubt of his life; and to his parents and friends it was credibly reported that he was dead, and therefore they gave over the care for him dead, to provide for the daughter living; and at convenient age provided her of an husband, and gave her a competent portion, so that the young couple lived well and thriftily toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Countrey, some two miles distant from their fathers house: In this interim the Climate had much changed the young mans complexion, who being but a beardlesse stripling when hee went his voyage, after ten yeares was growne hairy and a full man, and might be easily out of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; who returning into <hi>England</hi> with a good stocke, as having the best part of a thousand markes in his purse, after he had dispatched his businesse here about the Towne, he had a great minde to travell downe into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40285:38"/>
to see how the good old folke his father and mother did; and having trust up his money in a port mantuan, he provided himself of a good Nag, and fastning it safe behinde him, and being well accommodated for his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he set forward, and in few dayes sped him so well, that he came within some six or seven miles of his fathers; but all the way as he was travelling alone, he was meditating with himselfe, that his father and his mother were growne aged, and he was now as willing as able to furnish them in any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities whatsoever; or if his sister were living and unmarried, hee had wherewithall to give her a sufficient portion, to see her well bestowed: and these were his true filiall and fraternall conceptions, to depart liberally of what he had unto them. He further apprehended, that because every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy tels me, that knew me in my minority, I am so altered and growne out of knowledge, I will conceale my selfe at the first; that when after I shall open and discover my selfe to them, I shall finde the more kinde and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving welcome at their hands. By this time comming to the next thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare Towne, in the way to the Citie he alighted, and called for wine, and the host to keepe him company; of whom he demanded earnestly if such a man were in health? and how his wife fared? who answered, they were pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing well, and able to live in very good and fashionable manner: Then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded he of their daughter, and what was become of her? who replyed, that she was honestly married to a thrifty and carefull husband, and that she lived in the next village just in his way to the Citie; of all which being exceedingly joyfull, hee tooke horse againe, and found the house where his sister lived; whose husband being from home, after some discourse past betwixt them, and she ingeniously confessing to him that he was a stranger, and no way knowne to her, he at length told her what he was, (her brother) whom they supposed to bee dead; withall the successe of his fortunes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>at which, when by circumstance she found true, she was extreamely extasied, and first would have him to alight and stay till her husband came home, which he would not by any meanes doe; then she would have accompanied him to her fathers: but he would yeeld to neither, telling her his conceit; how he meant to carry himselfe to the two old people, intreating her of all loves, to conceale his comming for a day or two, and then to come and aske for him at their fathers, where she should finde what welcome hee would give her: to which (though unwilling) she assented, and he rid forward, and an houre before sunne-set, came to his fathers Inne, and calling to the host<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, bad him to take off his port-mantuan, and after to walke his horse well, and then put him into the stable; and then he called for mine host, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently appeared like a joviall old lad; hee called then for his hostesse, and gave her the port-mantuan, saying to her, good hostesse, lay this up till I call for it, for here is that which I hope will make us all merry: then hee desired to have the best chamber in the house, and bespake supper, telling them he was alone, and desired them both to keepe him company; yet all this while they not so much as suspected what he was: and whilest he was gone into the stable to see his horse, the woman feeling what weight the port-mantuan had, told her husband, and the Devill presently put it into their mindes to murder the stranger for his money: supper-time came, and they accompanied him, much discourse at randome past amongst them, but covetousnesse and the Devill so blinded their eyes, that all this while they knew him not: After supper they tooke their leaves, to plot what
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40285:39"/>
they before had apprehended: To bed he went, and in the dead of night they both entred his chamber, and murdered him sleeping; then they conveyed his body into a backe place and buried it, his horse they tooke out of the stable, washt the bloud out the chamber, and shifted a new bed in the place, so that all things were handsome, as if nothing had beene. In the morning when they thought the worst had beene past, comes the sister with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, she askes for such a stranger, they stifly deny that any such lodged there; which they did so constantly, that she entreated them not to keepe her owne brother and their sonne from her, who was come out of the <hi>Indies</hi> with such a summe of money, to relieve all their necessities: at first they are both strooke silent, but questioning her further, when by all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whatsoever she said, they found it to be true, not able longer to containe themselves, they fell into a loud exclamation, weeping, and wringing their hands. Briefly, for this they were both publickly executed, and the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the accident by all that heard it, admired.</p>
            <p>I have read strange reports concerning the death of grating Usurers, who though by their broking exactions, and corroding oppressions, doe not visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly imbrue their hands in the bloud of the indigent and needy; yet by their horrible extortions have put them to more lingering and torturing deaths, as to starve, famish, and perish, not beggering private persons who are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to come within their griping clutches only, but annihilating and undoing of whole families and housholds at once: I have heard of one of those earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes, who dying of a suddaine appoplex, his Executors with his wife, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to have his body dissected and opened, that they might know certainly of what disease he died; one giving out one cause, a second another; and to satisfie that doubt, when the Surgeon came to use his Art, and had searcht him thorowly, he found all his entrayles in good order, onely his heart was wanting, at which all the spectators were amazed, and almost stupified, as holding it to be prodigious; till at length one of the neighbours (pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceited) and being well acquainted with his having disposition, you had best (said he) to looke for his heart in his great bar'd chest, for there it was ever in his life, and why not now in his death; which though jestingly spoke, the Executors tooke in earnest, and causing the chest to be opened, they found it panting upon his treasure. This (whether true or no) yet sure I am that it is a just taxation conferred upon Extortioners and Usurers.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Melander</hi> puts me in minde of another of the like, (if not worse condition) who being borne towards his grave, was interposed by a devout man, who by reason of his cruell and abhominable extortions, denied him the right of Christian buriall: which seeing they could not obtaine, as of custome and president, they (I meane his wife and friends) offered a large summe of money to have him buried, if it were but in any corner of the Church-yard, but the Pastor would be neither moved by prayers or bribes, but alleadging that he who lived his whole life-time worse then any Turke, Heathen, or Infidell, ought not in death to have those solemne rights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a Christian; and therefore stopt his eares to whatsoever they could alleadge in his behalfe: at length, after long debating the matter, it was concluded betwixt the two parties, that a Cart and two Oxen should be provided, and the Coffin to be put into the Cart, and to what place soever the Beasts should carry him (without guide) there should his place of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall be: well, the Oxen were put into the Cart, and the body in it, who
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40285:39"/>
went their way of their owne accord out at the Townes end, and then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, just to the common execution place, where they made a stand, and could not by any violence been compelled any further, and there his grave was digged and he buried; a place due to all that generation of vipers.

Then she thinking him distracted, and quite out of his senses, sent presently to the Parson of the Parish to give him some ghostly instructions for his soules health; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the conclusion, that he hoped he would not forget him in his Will: at which words he tooke pen, and writ againe as followeth. <hi>Item,</hi> and thou O Parson shalt beare us company to the infernall torments below; for knowing of all my wicked and injust proceedings, thou wast so farre from reproving them, that thou didst rather smooth me up in my sinnes, and connive at my delinquencies, onely to be welcome at my house, and eate fat bits at my table; for such are the just judgments denounced against us.

Neither have they alone been guilty of these notorious crimes and vices, but all Nations have been tainted with the like impurities, which hath been the depopulation of famous Cities, the ruines of Kingdomes, the removing of Monarchies, from one people and language to another, when seldom any Conquerour from any Nation brought home their victory without their vices, of which there be frequent examples. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> were the first that usurped the name of a Monarchy; the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> wrested it from them; the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> wan it from the former; and lastly the <hi>Romans</hi> from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who as they learned of them <hi>Graecari,</hi> to drinke hard, so <hi>Mechari,</hi> to stuprate and adulterate; and as they used their Dominion, and tyranny, governing them by substitutes, and praefects, and proconsuls, and the like; so with their power they brought in their prodigalities, riots, feastings, rapes, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, stuprations, scortations, fornications, even to abhominations above nature, too immodest to speak, then by consequent, too devillish to act. But from generalities I come to particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gemelius Tribunitius,</hi> though he were one of the Patricians family, and a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40285:42"/>
Nobleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet was so degenerate in his condition, that of his own house he made a Brothell or Stewes, where amongst others were vitiated <hi>Mutia</hi> and <hi>Fulvia,</hi> two illustrious women, and of especiall remarke in the City, with a noble youth called <hi>Saturninus;</hi> who was polluted and defiled against nature: but as some report of the master of the family, his house was after accidentally set on fire, and he himselfe added part of the fewell to the flame. And in this kinde of punishment lust may be said, (and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unproperly) to be quenched with fire. <hi>Calius</hi> reports of <hi>Dionysius junior,</hi> that comming into the City of <hi>Locris,</hi> where he had the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonging to a Prince of his estate and quality, but the Town abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with fair and beautifull virgins, he could not bridle his exorbitant appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, but some he courted with fair words, others bribed with rich gifts, and such as he could win to his insatiate desires by neither, he committed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon their persons, insomuch that divers of the noblest maidens were by him vitiated and corrupted, which they not having patience to endure) made an insurrection against him, and having first dispatched his Guard, to whom he most trusted, they seised upon his person, and put him so great maceration and torment: for, binding him to a stake, they thrust sharpe needles betwixt the nailes and flesh of his toes and fingers, and when he had endured as well the taunts of their tongues, as the exquisite tortures of their engines, they put him to death, and after having dried his bones, pouned them to dust in a morter: and such was the reward of his brutish and beastly luxury: to whom I will adde <hi>Lusius</hi> the nephew to <hi>Marius</hi> by the sisters side, who for offering a preposterous carriage of lust to <hi>Treboninus</hi> a young man of an excellent aspect and feature, and withall of a civill and modest car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, (by profession a Souldier) was slain by him in his tent, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the greatnesse of his alliance and kinred, of which he prefumed so far, that even the most abhominable evils by them countenanced, might be held lawfull. And by the like encouragement, namely the impurity of the times, <hi>Sotodes</hi> the obscene <hi>Iambicke</hi> writer composed his verses in that strain, as savouring nothing but <hi>Pathicke</hi> and <hi>Cinedicke</hi> venery; abhorred by all modest and chaste eares and eyes; insomuch that of them grew a proverbe, If any mans workes tasted of ribaldry or obscenity, it was called <hi>Sotadicum poëma:</hi> and of him <hi>Politianus</hi> speakes in his <hi>Natricia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were extremely taxed with this incontinence, for it is said of them, that they prostituted their wives and daughters for gain, and hence grew a proverbe, <hi>Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum;</hi> It is not for every man to go to <hi>Corinth,</hi> they pay so dear for their pleasure. The <hi>Babylonians, Tyrrhenians,</hi> and <hi>Massagelans</hi> were also greatly contaminated with this vice, abusing their bodies in that monstrous sort, that they were said, rather to live like beasts than men. It is a sin which compelleth men neither to have care of their own good names, nor of their posterity which shall come after them; and therefore <hi>Draco</hi> the famous Law-giver writ so bitterly against this concupiscence, that he is said, rather than to have drawn them in inke, to have inscribed them in blood: and no wonder if he were so austere and supercilious against it; when it inforceth us to covet above our power, to act beyond our strength, and to die before our time. One defineth it thus, an enemy to the purse, a foe to the person, a canker to the minde, a corrasive to the conscience, a weakner of the wit, a besotter of the sense, and a mortall enemy to the whole body; it sweetneth with pleasure to the path

of perdition, and is the loadstone leading and guiding to ruth and ruine, (so far <hi>Pliny.) Demonax</hi> termes it, a pleasure bought with pain, a delight hatched with unquiet, a contentment accompanied with fear, and a sin fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with sorrow, by continuance it growes to impudence, and shame, and infamy continually waites at the heeles thereof.</p>
            <p>For further instance, one <hi>Hostius</hi> a Prince who lived in the time of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus Caesar,</hi> was a man of a most perdit obscenenesse, practised in that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative degree of filthinesse, that scarce any age could produce a prodegy to paralell him, modesty will not suffer me to give them name. And <hi>Tegil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> (according to <hi>Tacitus lib.</hi> 17.) was a man of a most corrupted life, who soothed and humoured <hi>Nero</hi> in all his ribaldries, his sirname was <hi>Othonius,</hi> by whose flattery and calumny many a noble Roman was put to death: and when <hi>Otho</hi> who succeeded <hi>Nero,</hi> came to wear the Imperiall purple, and to be instated Emperour, he sent (amongst other malefactours) for him, to suffer as a putrified and corrupt member of the State, and when the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner with other lictors and officers came to surprise him in his house, they found him drinking and rioting amongst his catamites and harlots, where without limiting any time either to settle his estate, or to take leave of any of his friends, he was instantly slain, and his wounded body cast into the open streets. <hi>Crassus</hi> the richest of the Roman fathers, after the death of one of his brothers, married his wife, by whom he had many children. And <hi>Surinus</hi> the wealthiest and most potent of the <hi>Parthians</hi> next to the King, had in his tents two hundred concubines at one time. And <hi>Xerxes</hi> King of <hi>Persia</hi> was so given over to all licentiousnesse and luxury, that he hired pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suivants, and kept <hi>Cursors</hi> and messengers in pay to inquire and finde out men who could devise new wayes of voluptuousnesse, and to them gave great rewards, for so <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> reports of him. And <hi>Volateranus</hi> remembers us of one <hi>Vgutius</hi> a Florentine Prince, who was slain of his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens and Subjects for stuprating their wives, and vitiating their virgins. Thus seldom we see this vice to go unpunished.</p>
            <p>Nor is it particular to the masculine sex, as the sole provocatours hereof, but women have been equally and alike guilty. We reade in <hi>Genesis</hi> of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphars</hi> wife, who solicited <hi>Ioseph</hi> to her adulterate embraces, who because he refused to commit such villany, and to offend both God and his master, she accused him to his Lord, that he would have done to her violence, for which he lay two years in prison. But from prophane Histories we have many examples. For <hi>Iulia Agrippina</hi> the mother of <hi>Nero</hi> was said to have unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full congresse with <hi>Domitian,</hi> for so <hi>Iuvenal</hi> saith: nay more, after feasting and banqueting, in the heat of her cups, when she with her son were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther topt with wine, they commonly used incestuous consociety: the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of which impious lust was, that the son in the end having caused his mother to be slain, commanded her body to be dissected, and ript open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, as longing to see the bed wherein he lay when he was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne infant. She was the daughter to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> sister to <hi>Caligula,</hi> the wife first of <hi>Domitius,</hi> after of <hi>Clodius</hi> whom she poysoned, for no other cause but to make <hi>Nero</hi> her son Emperour: and you hear how well he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited her. A chicken of the same brood was <hi>Messalina</hi> the daughter of <hi>Messala,</hi> and the wife and Empresse of <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> a woman of a most insatiate lust, whose custome was to disguise her selfe like a private Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, so that she might not be known, and with her pandor ushering her,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40285:43"/>
to walke unto common stewes and brothell-houses, and there prostitute her selfe to all commers whosoever, nay, she was not ashamed to contend with the ablest and strongest Harlot in the City for masterie, whence also shee returned rather tyred then satisfied; nay more, she selected out of the noblest Wives and Virgins to be eye witnesses and companions in her fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, whither men also were not denied accesse, as spectators, against all womenly shame and modesty: and if any noble Gentleman of whom she seemed to be enamoured, refused or despised her profered imbraces, shee would feigne and devise some crime or other to be revenged on him, and his whole familie. <hi>Pliu. lib.</hi> 29 tels us, That one <hi>Vectius Valius</hi> a notable Physitian was nobilitated meerly for pandthering to her luxuries. <hi>Fabia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Fabrius Fabricanus</hi> grew greatly besotted on the love of a faire <note place="margin">Fabia.</note> young Gentleman call'd <hi>Petroninus Valentinus,</hi> who the more freely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in her petulant imbraces caused her husband to be traiterously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.

This Lady drunke with her Lust, commanded the old woman to open the doore, and receive the Letters.

Bishops Hall at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Kings Cause was strongly maintained by the venters and Advocates; but no one appeared in the poore Queenes defence; insomuch that Sentence was ready to be pronounc'd against her, and speedy order and direction given for a Bill of Divorce to be drawne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. When on the suddaine (as the Court was ready to rise) stept out of the Presse a faire and beautifull young man, of a sweet and amiable aspect, and not knowne to any in the Company, who after a Congy made, demanded audience; and having delivered the truth in every particular circumstance, pleaded sharply in the Queens behalfe against the King, convincing the opposite party with such irreproveable arguments, that he made the Case cleare on her side; and having ended his Speech, Congying to the King and the rest, and returning into the throng, was never more <note place="margin">A miraculous deliverie.</note> seen after.

            <p>A Noble Gentleman lived very conjugally and lovingly with his Lady; she had a Chamber-maid of a very sweet aspect and feature, not any way <note place="margin">Jealousie.</note> to bee taxed for the least wantonnesse or loose carriage; but if the Lady thought her guilty of the least immodesty, she needed no other Jury, for she was both Jurer and Judge, and condemned her by her owne verdict and sentence. It happened that the Noble-man having some occasion to detaine himselfe some few dayes abroad, in his absence shee pretended a quarrell with her maid; the colour was for letting a young childe slip out of her Armes; which though it had little or no hurt, yet she made of it as if it were lam'd beyond all recovery; upon which her anger grew im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, and shee would commit her to prison: but unto what prison? not into any ordinary light, or tollerable; but into a deep, obscure, and <note place="margin">A fearefull Prison, or Dungeon.</note> desolate Dungeon in the bottome of the Castle, for many yeares shut up with an Iron gate, and abounding with Toads, Snakes, Adders, and other Serpents: Into which no Sacrilegious person, Thiefe, Pyrat, Witch, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racide, Traitor, or the greatest Malefactor whatsoever within the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of man had beene committed; and into this noysome, stinking, and most horrible place she was forced to enter, and the doores fast shut upon her: but from all the corners of the Vault the venemous vextiles came in heapes, with fearefull hissing, and seized upon those parts of her body that were in their reach, which with lowd ejulation and shrikes, shee striv'd with her hands to beate off, but all in vaine: At noone one of the servants, a young man (who it seems had some affection to this maid, but how soever humanity could not have suffered him to doe lesse) hearing those her most pittifull vocifirations, and understanding the cause, came to his Lady, and humbly besought her as she was a Christian to commiserate the wretched estate of her poore afflicted prisoner: but all to no purpose, she was inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, revil'd him with his boldnesse and sawcinesse, and sent him away with blowes to boot.

After supper to bed the houshold went, and at mid-night the young man could not containe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40285:47"/>
but hee must goe listen at the Dungeon doore. But now hearing no no noise, not so much as a sigh or groane, hee began to imagine that shee was dead, (and so indeed it prov'd) hee then more incivilly then before rapt at his Ladyes chamber-doore, and wakned her, telling her, that shee had now the event of her bloudy and cruell desires: for by reason that there was a still silence in the Dungeon, hee perceived the poore Virgin had expired her life. At which words being startl'd, and strangely mov'd, she rose from her bed, and calling for store of lights, caused the Dungeon doore to be opened, where they might behold a most ruthfull and samen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <note place="margin">A fearfull sight.</note> spectacle; the maid throwne upon her backe, and foure great Snakes wrapt about her, one of an extraordinary bignesse wound about her neck, another had twinde it selfe encompassing both her legges, a third like a girdle imbrac'd her waste, or middle, a fourth stuck upon her jawes, stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its selfe to its utmost length, which no sooner taken thence, but was found dead, having so ingorg'd it selfe with her bloud, that it swel'd, and burst asunder: At whichsight the Lady strook with the horrour thereof, from a suddaine melancholy grew into a meere madnesse, and in a raging fit soon after dy'd.</p>
            <p>Strange were that act abroad, which cannot in some sort be parallel'd with us at home.

Now this Gentleman had in his house a young gentlewoman sent thither to bee tuter'd, and withall to learne good huswifrie, and was about the age of fourteen or fifteen yeares at the most. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before hee tooke horse, when hee call'd for water, this maid brought him the Towell and Bason, and held it till hee had wash'd; onely in rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of his hands he sprinkled a little water on her face, which his wife observed: after Breakfast the Gentleman road on his journey; and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in whom this slight accident, strooke a deepe impression of devillish Jealousie, soon after call'd to the maid to deliver her an account of her lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen us'd the night before (which was her charge) she having hid a Napkin or two out of the way of purpose to pick a quarrell with her. The Girle sought in every roome and could not finde them: then she bid her looke in the next Chamber; but shee was no sooner up staires, but after followes the Mistresse, like an incens'd Virago, and shut the doores fast upon her, then casts her upon the Bed, and threw another Feather-bed upon her, and spying a Scotch Pocket-Dagger hanging by the Walls, shee tooke out one of the knives, and casting her selfe upon the upper bed, turn'd up the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, where she fell most unwoman-like to worke with her maid, making her quite uncapable of future marriage; and this was done withinin memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (for to the womans great ignominy and shame, in the same Towne I <note place="margin">An unwoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Act.</note> have heard it reported, and been shewne the very house where the deed was done: The horridnesse of which Act makes me that I cannot conceale her name; shee was call'd Mistris <hi>Brig house.)</hi> In this intrim, a Serving-man comming in, and hearing his Mistris was in great displeasure and distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature gone up with her maid, and knowing her froward and hasty dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, he went to the doore and knockt; but hearing none but one as it

were miserably forcing breath for life: he lookt in either at some chinke, or the key-hole, where he saw his Mistris in the same posture I before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, with a knife in her hand, and one pittifully bleeding under her: He broke open the doore, being Wainscot, and casting her off from the Bed to the floore, tooke up the Maid, nigh stifled, and carried her to a neighbours house, where Chyrurgeons were sent for, and she in time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of life, though shee had made her utterly unable of Conception. But what gain'd shee by this her uncivill cruelty? she was after abhorr'd by all good and modest women, asham'd to looke out of her owne doores; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would any of fashion converse with her, but held it a scandall to be but seen in her company.</p>

This revenge to any of reason might seeme sufficient; but here her anger rested not, but shee caused the faire <hi>Estrild</hi> and her Daughter <hi>Sabrina</hi> to be brought unto her Tent, where having reviled them both, one with the name of Whore, the other of Bastard, shee in her heat of bloud, and height of rage, commanded them both to be throwne into the River neare unto the place where the Battaile was late fought, where they were both drowned, the River upon that accident losing the name; and after the Daughter <hi>Sabrina</hi> hath beene called Severne even to this day.</p>

            <p>But when after he was informed of her unstable condition, hee thought to make some tryall of her; and being at that time a Widdower, one day when hee was in some private conference with her at a window. hee said openly; Now Lady I put it to your free election, whether you will take mee for your wedded Lord and Husband, or this my Son here standing in presence? To which Question, shee without the least pause gave this <note place="margin">An unadvised Woman.</note> suddaine Answer; Then I make choice of the Sonne, and refuse the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which the King taking as an affront, and being therewith somewhat mov'd, he as suddenly reply'd; I protest woman, if thou hadst made choice of me, I would have given thee to my Sonne, if he would have accepted of thee; but for that thou hast slighted and for saken me; thou shalt now have neither of us; and so presently commanded her as a Recluse to be shut up into a Nunnery. But this place, though never so strict, could not containe her within the bounds of Modesty or Chastity; For by the meanes of some Libertines, her old companions and acquaintance, shee made an escape out of the Cloister; and having quitted that place, shee wandred up and downe, till having consumed all that shee could make, she fell into necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous poverty, in which she miserably dy'd, none commiserating her in her greatest extremity. In memory of which her misdemeanors, mixt with the murder of her naturall Lord and Husband, the Kings of the West Saxons made a Decree, that thence-forward none of their Wives should be called Queenes, nor sit by them at any Feast, or in any place of State or Honour: And this was observed amongst them for a long time after.</p>
            <p>Now to shew how the Creator of all, who instituted chaste Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Paradice, as hee hates those contaminated with all impurity, so of the contrary, he is a Guardian and Potector to those of cleane and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led life, as may appeare by this subsequent story.

And the Lord God commanded the man saying, thou shalt eat freely of every Tree of the Garden, but of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evill, thou shalt not eate of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dye the death.</hi> Againe 3. 6. <hi>So the Woman seeing that the Tree was good for meat, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a Tree to be desired to get Knowledge, took of the fruit thereof, and did eate, and gave also to her husband</hi> 
               <note place="margin">From the Old Testament.</note> 
               <hi>with her, and he did eate:</hi> For which they were most grievously punished, and all man-kinde for their sakes: For Verse 16. <hi>Vnto the Woman God said, I will greatly encrease thy sorrowes and thy conception: In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children; and thy defire shal be subject to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</hi> Also to <hi>Adam</hi> he said, <hi>Because thou hast obeyed the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the Treewhereof I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eate of it: Cursed is the earth for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eate of it all the dayes of thy life: Thornes also and Thistles shall it bring forth unto thee; and thou shalt eate the herbe of the field: in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate bread, till thou returne to the earth; for out of it wast thou taken, because thou art dust, and to dust shalt thou returne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 32. then the people arose all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and gathered the Quailes: he that gathered the least, gathered ten Homers full; and they spread them abroad for their use round about the Host: whilst the flesh was yet in their teeth, before it was chewed the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with an exceeding great plague: There they buried the people that fell a lusting, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. When thou shalt eate and be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, beware diligently that thou forgettest not the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, and the house of bondage. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, 21. 20. The Parents shall say to the Elders of his City, This our Son is stubborne and disobedient, and will not obey our commandement, but is a Rioter and a Drunkard. Then all the men of the City shall stone him with stones unto death, so shalt thou take away evill from amongst you, that all Israell may heare it and feare, <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> 31. 12. If thou sittest at a costly Table, open not thy mouth wide upon it, and say not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold much meat: Remember that an evill eye is a shame; and what thing created is worse then a wicked eye; for it weepeth for every cause: Stretch not thine hand wheresoever it looketh, and thrust it not with it into the Dish. Eate modestly that which is set before thee; and devour not, lest thou bee'st hated. Leave then off first for nurtures sake; and be not insatiable, lest thou offend. When thou sittest amongst many, reach not thy hand out first of all: How little is sufficient for a man well taught? and thereby he belcheth not in his Chamber, nor feeleth any paine. A wholsome sleep commeth of a temprate Belly; he riseth up in the morning, and is well

at ease with himselfe; but paine is watching and choler, like diseases and pangs of the belly are insatiable men. If thou bee inforced to eate, arise, goe forth, and empty thy stomack, and then take thy rest; so shalt thou bring no sicknesse unto thine house. Shew not thy valiantnesse in Wine, for wine hath destroyed many; the Furnace proveth the edge of the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, so doth Wine the hearts of the proud by drunkennesse. Wine so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly drunk is profitable for the life of man: what is life that is overcome with Wine? Wine was made from the beginning to make man glad, and not for drunkennesse: Wine measurably taken and in time, bringeth glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and chearefulnesse of the minde; but drinke with excesse maketh bitternesse of minde, brawlings, and scoldings. Drunkennesse increaseth the rage of a Foole, till he offend; it diminisheth his strength, and maketh wounds, &amp;c. Againe 37. 28. be not greedy in all delights, and bee not too hasty of all meats: for excesse of meats bringeth sicknesse, and gluttony commeth with cholerick Diseases. By surfeit have many perished, and he that dyeteth himselfe prolongeth his life.</p>
            <p>Thus farre the old Testament; let us now heare what the Gospel saith <note place="margin">Texts out of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 24. Woe be to you that are rich, for ye have received your conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: Woe be to you that are full; for yee shall be hungry: Woe be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that now laugh; for yee shall waile and weepe. Againe 21. 34. Take heed, lest at any time your hearts be oppressed with surfeiting and drunkennesse, and cares of this life, lest that day come upon you unawares: For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch therefore and pray continually, that yee may bee counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to passe, and that ye may stand before the Sonne of Man. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12. The night is past, and the day is at hand; let us therefore cast away the workes of darknesse, and let us put on the Armour of light: so that we walke honestly as in the day, not in drunkennesse or gluttony, nor in chambering or wantonnesse, nor in strife or envying: but put yee on the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and take no thought for the flesh to fulfill the lusts of it. And <hi>Luke</hi> 17. In the dayes of <hi>Noe</hi> they eate and dranke, they marryed Wives, and were given in marriage, even untill the day that <hi>Noe</hi> entred into the Arke, and the floud came and destroyed them all.</p>
            <p>Thus farre the Scriptures: I come now to the Fathers, St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Fathers of Gluttony.</note> in one of his Sermons saith, That ill Ministers wait upon the Throat, which alwayes covets, but is never satisfied; for what is more insatiable then the belly? to day it receives, to morrow it requires; being full, it commends abstinence; being empty, it cannot endure the name of any such vertue. Hunger is a friend to chastity, an enemy to wantonnesse: But saturity betrayeth modesty, and corrupts good manners. It is not the meat, but the immoderate appetite that is condemned: For as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, It was not for a Quaile or a Phesant that <hi>Eve</hi> longed for, but for an Apple; and thereby brought a curse unto all man-kinde. It was not for a Kid, or a Lamb of the flock that <hi>Esau</hi> hungred, but for a messe of Broth; for which he sold his birth-right. <hi>Elias</hi> was fed with flesh; but <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist with Locusts and wilde Honey: and <hi>David</hi> thirsted not for wine, but water; for which he reprehended himselfe: neither was our Saviour in the Wildernesse tempted by the Devill with flesh, but bread: and as <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Moralls saith, It is not the meat, but the lust after it that is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40285:51"/>
in fault; for we oft-times may eate of dainty Cates without offence, and yet upon course and common fare may sinne by surfeit: And in another place, where Gluttony is predominant, all those honours that men winne are lost; and whilst the belly is not bridl'd, all vertues runne to havocke; but when that is curb'd and kept in moderation, many vices with it are awed and restrain'd. In vaine it is for us to enter into any spirituall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict against the Devill, our common adversary and his agents, unlesse we first suppresse the enemy that is within us: which is voracity and lust af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eating and drinking, because if those enemies that are so neare us bee not subdued, in vaine we shall strive to have the victory over those remote and afarre off: To smal purpose it were to fight against the enemies without the Walls, when there is nothing but tumults, mutiny, and sedition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City: after full feeding, when the stomack is supply'd even unto belching, so that it must needs say it hath enough; yet is not the curiosity of the appetite satisfied, for the eye is delighted with the colour, and the pallate pleased with the taste, when the poore suffering stomack (best pleased with a mediocrity and temperature) which neither sees the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, nor relisheth the pleasantnesse of the Taste, is rather ruin'd then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh'd, and confounded then comforted. <hi>Innocentius lib de Vil. Condit. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> useth words to this purpose: Gluttony shut up Paradice, sold the Birth-right, hang'd the Baker, beheaded the Baptist; <hi>Nebuzandan</hi> the Prince of <hi>Cooleus,</hi> burnt the Temple, destroyed Jerusalem; &amp; <hi>Baltazer</hi> sitting at his great Feast saw the hand-writing upon the Wall, and that night was slaine by the <hi>Caldeans.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Hugo in Claus.</hi> saith, That there be some who sit downe to a feast with an unquiet agitation of the members, expressing the insatiate intemperance of their mindes, they shake their heads, shrug the shoulders, they expand their hands, and not without great uncomlinesse, and unseemly gesture, as if they were rowzing and preparing themselves to ingorge and swallow the whole banquet. Other unmannerly postures and carriages at Table they use; for sitting in one place, with their eyes they greedily survey eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dish that is served in; their hands ready to reach to the full length of their armes, removing this further off, and pulling that nearer; then they breake the Bread, poure wine into the Cups and Glasses, besieging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves round with the best dishes; then they pant, swell, and breath short, through the vehemence and extremity of feeding, so that you wou'd thinke them seeking for some wide passage to tumble in their fat bits, to satisfie their craving and crooking bellies, as if the narrownesse of their chaps and jawes could not supply their voracious stomack with that superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance which it expects: Thus sits hee like one besieging a City, doubting in what place first to begin his assault, and therefore would make irruption upon all places, and at once; and such is this <hi>Gastrimargia,</hi> or Cormorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edulitie. They were wont of old to build Temples to the gods, erect Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, appoint Flammins and Priests to serve, kill beasts for the Sacrifice, burne Incense: and so the carnall and voluptuous men in these dayes, they make their Kitchin their Temple, their Table their Altar, their Cookes their Priests, their Veales, Lambs, Capons, &amp;c. provided for their Dyets; the Beasts for imitation, and the fumes and steame of their sawe'd Dishes, Censary Incense. Indeed over superstitious is the industry and care they have in setting forth the services and severall courses at their great and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne

Feasts and Banquets. Infinite are the varieties and multiplicity of their decoctions, Rostings, Bakings, Fryings, Stewings, and the like; with new devised Sawces, composed of severall ingredients, now soft, then hard, now cold, then hot; some temper'd with Pepper, others with Onions and Garlick, then with Cinamon, then with Salt; mens guts longing as Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with great Bellies. Then ariseth a disputation amongst these <hi>Helnoes,</hi> whether such a Dish tastes better boyl'd or roasted, bak'd or broyl'd, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binado'd, or otherwise: insomuch that after a dozen dishes of solid meat devovr'd, there is no impediment or let, but that the last course of more curious and dainty Cates, is as soone swallowed: and when the stomack by often belching, and eructations shall say it hath enough; yet are not their boundlesse and unlimited appetites satisfi'd: such are they who make their bellies their God: and thus far <hi>Hugo.</hi>

But his gluttony was incomparable, for hee had served into one Supper, two thousand severall sorts of Fishes, and seven thousand se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall kindes of Fowles; and more hee would have had, if more could have been compass'd: Moreover, when hee lay neare unto the Sea hee would suffer no Fish to come to his Table; but when hee kept Court farre up within the Land, hee would feede upon nothing else, because without extraordinary charges it could not bee conveighed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; esteeming that which was deare onely dainty.

The Father out of his greater indulgence, as having but one, had allowed him large exhibition; and the mother too of her naturall love had still supply'd his riotous expences, both using him with gentle and courteous language, hoping by that fair course to draw him to some regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: But finding that it nothing prevailed, but that every day he grew worse then other, he began then to change his Coppy, his Brow was more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere, and his look more supercilious, and his tongue (before altogether inur'd to advise and gently perswade) grew now to another tone, sharply to reprove and reprehend him: But that which toucht the Son nearest, was, he took away all his meanes from him, leaving him to the wide world, thinking (if any thing) want and necessity might make him look into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and in time reduce him to some goodnesse: but alas his hopes were all in vaine; for the young man grew so stupid and besotted in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that hee grew like one sencelesse, at least uncapable of any good and wholsome counsell. It happened some moneths after he had this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from his Father, and his scores abroad grew so high, that neither Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne nor Ale-house (knowing him to be in his Fathers displeasure) would give him any further credit: He came home to the house (whence hee had been foure weekes absent) and being full of Wine, entred at the gate, whom his father meeting, and seeing him in that distemperature, he began to chide him after the old manner; which the other impatient to heare, catcht him by the throat, and having utter'd many execrable oathes, call'd him old Dotard, and said, Money he wanted, and money he would have ere he departed: The Father seeing violence offered, called out for helpe; at which the Sonne drew his Dagger, and stabb'd him into the Shoulder, most of the Servants were absent abroad; but the mother hearing her husbands <note place="margin">An unmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able villain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now this man who was no Gamster to lavish his meanes that way, yet spent all his whole and entire estate within the space of three yeares: Would any man beleeve how this could be possible? Well, I will tell you how; he kept two or three tall fellowes in Skarlet Liveries, dawb'd with gold lace; and for his owne particular would shift his Cloathes twice a day, wearing one suit in the morning, another after dinner: his most frequented Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, was the Kings Head in new Fish-street, where hee usually din'd and supt in the long Roome, at the long Table, where though hee were but himselfe and his friends, hee would have the Boord throng'd with variety of Dishes, from the top to the bottome; and as his meat was beyond rule, so many times his drinke was beyond reason: and though he could not be without flatterers or Sycophants about him, yet could they never foole him out of any bounty: His Table was free for them, but his Pockets shut, keeping alwayes a brace of principall good Geldings; his delight was to ride them off from their legges, and when they were foundred, or past present service, give them to one of his Groomes.</p>
            <p>He had a great longing to please all his five senses at once; nor could he bee at peace within himselfe till he had accomplish'd it; and allow'd to <note place="margin">A strange and unheard of prodigall.</note> the delight of every sense a severall hundred pound, for which hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoke a curious faire roome, hung with the richest Arras that could bee hir'd, and furnish'd with all the most exquisite Pictures that might bee bought or borrowed, to please the eye.</p>

            <p>Who that shall look upon all the Prodigalls and spend-thrifts that have had great fortune, and have wasted them to nothing; or consider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young Shop-keepers that have had good and sufficient stocke to set up with, and through Drinking and Company-keeping, (neglecting their home-affaires) have suddenly proved Trade-falne; and what hath been the end? but to fill Gaoles, and furnish prisons; or if they escape with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to fall into dissolute and desperate courses, which bring them into certaine disgrace, but most commonly unto untimely end. Besides, how many young heires in the Countrey, borne to faire Revenues, and possest of great estates, who having liv'd formerly in the Countrey, and after come to see the fashions of the City, what by Tavernes, Ordinaries, Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, Brothell-houses, and the like, have been so besotted and stupified, that they have suddenly run themselves out of all their fortunes; and then growing desperate, having spent their own, forc'd from others, and taking purses by the high-way side, have come at length to disgrace their gentry by their infamous deaths at the Gallows. And these and the like are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable judgments continually exercis'd upon gluttons &amp; drunkards: from which sin of Gurmandizing, as from all the rest, God of his infinite mercy, even for the merits of his Sonne Christ Jesus deliver us all.</p>
