            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

&amp; vnchastitie of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishe
clergie hath long agoe
ministred an olde tale, how
a person of a towne hauing
the lordship annexed to his
personage, as many haue, by reason ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was by speciall custome charged, as in
many places they be, to kéepe a common
Bull for the towne, wherby theyr cattell
and his tithe might be encreased, which
Bull had great libertie and is by custome
not poundable. It happened that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
was brought to him by hys neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
of the insufficiencie of his Bull, that
he dyd not get calues so plentifully as in
tyme past they were wont to haue. The
person a wise man of good skill as it should
seme, c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>used hys Bull to be tyed fast and
hys crowne to be shauen, and then let him
goe, saying, now goe thy way, there was
neuer any bad of thys marke, he will get
calues I warrant him. So is it happened
that of late a holy Bull, I thinke some <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
is come for loue of hys <hi>Io,</hi> or rather
for iust to some leud <hi>Pasiphae</hi> arriued in
this land.</p>
                  <p>It is the great persons bull, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was wont by custome to finde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:22728:3"/>
Buls for all England, when he clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or vsurped the Lordship of England
as annexed to hys personage. It is the
same Bull that begat the famous Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calfe
that of late yeares made the terrible
expectation. Of late being against custome
empounded, or kept from breaking of
hedges as he was wont to do, and from
spoyling of seuerall pastures, he grew to
some faintnesse. But now hath his owner
new shauen hys crowne &amp; sent hym to get
calues agayne for encrease of the townes
hearde and the persons tithe.</p>
                  <p>And surely the experience is notable,
for since he came ouer so lately disguised,
he hath light vpon certaine ranke kyen,
who I thinke by their long forbearing are
become the lustier, that is, treason, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
rebellion, and such other, and with
them he hath so bestirred him, that by the
helpe of maister Doctor <hi>Harding, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and other, some there, some here,
iolly cowkéepers and herdemen of Popish
clergie, which sent and brought him ouer,
&amp; brake open for him the seuerall hedges
and senses of true religion, obedience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance,
fayth, and honestie, he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
a marueilous number of calues in
fewe yeares, that is, since the yeare. 1567.
<pb facs="tcp:22728:3"/>
he hath begotten multitudes of all the
formes of calues hereafter mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
other in the wilde woodes not yet
knowen, &amp; lastly he hath begotten a most
horrible monster, of whom shall hereafter
be entreated.</p>
                  <p>He hath begotten some traitorous
calues, as the practisers and vnderminers
of the state. Some rebellious calues, as
those that haue combred the realme with
vnhappy sedition. Some deinty calues
with white faces, as dissembling hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
that watch their time. Some calues
with blacke faces, as black soule and his
fellowes common bleaters and railers at
true religion. Some Apostaticall calues,
that haue forsaken fayth and do impugne
the knowen truth. Some tame drousy
calues, that with their brutishe superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can not raise vp their heads from
ground, nor their eyes to heauen. Some
mad wilde calues, as Roges and Rumor
spreaders. Some running and gadding
calues, wiser than Walthams calfe that
ranne nine miles to sucke a Bull, for these
runne aboue nine hundred miles. And no
maruell, for they desire not to sucke milke
but bloud. Some calues with hornes,
and some without, some with power run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:22728:4"/>
fiercely, some pushing with their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
heades as eluishly as they be able.
Some doctor calues, some proctor calues,
and some of other degrees. Some wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
calues, euer running backward and
athwart, without regard of ditch behinde
them, or hedge before them. Some calues
whom no fense will hold, no not the brode
sea. Some cow calues, some bull calues.
Some calues that neuer wil be but calues,
though they liue these hundred yeares.
Some winking calues. Some suttle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
calues. And some fonde licking
calues there he that be none of the same
Buls calues, but calues out of Gods own
hearde, seduced by leude companie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stray calues. These in séeking to licke
woundes whole, do not onely licke poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
into their owne bodies, but also enue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime
other therby, and specially the good
damme with whose wholesome milke
them selues be fedde. This Bulles calues
since they receaued their sires blessing,
are waxen wilder then they were, no
heardman can rule them, but as if the gad
flye were in their tailes, they runne whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
about, or of mere eluishnishe will
taste no wholesome and naturall foode.</p>
                  <p>The Monster of whom I tolde you,
<pb facs="tcp:22728:4"/>
is no way so fitly to be described, as by the
olde tale of the ancient Poetes, that seme
as it were to haue foreshewed him in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
as followeth. <hi>Pasiphae</hi> Quéene of
<hi>Creta,</hi> not sufficed with men, conceiued
inordinate, vnnaturall, and therewith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperable
lust to engender with a Bull.
Neither regard of vertue, honor, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
nature or shame, in respect of God,
her husband, her countrey, her selfe, or the
whole world, could restrayne her violent
rage of vncleane affection. Yet wist she
neither how to wooe the Bull, nor how to
apply her selfe vnto him. A meane at
length was founde to make this vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
coupling.</p>
                  <p>There liued then a cunning craftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Dedalus,</hi> the selfe same <hi>Dedalus</hi> of
whome it is famous how he made hym
winges, wherewith by cunning guiding
him selfe he passed seas &amp; countries at his
pleasure. And winges he made also for
<hi>Icarus</hi> his sonne to fly with him. But the
vncunning <hi>Icarus,</hi> climbing to neare the
sonnes heate, his winges melting, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the water and gaue name to the sea.</p>
                  <p>This fine <hi>Dedalus,</hi> to satisfie the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Quéenes feruor of lust, &amp; to match her
and the Bull in abhominable copulation,
<pb facs="tcp:22728:5"/>
framed a cowe, and so made couered and
vsed it with leud deuises, and therein so
inclosed and placed the good innocent and
vertuous Lady, that of the Bull she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the abhomination of the world,
and in time brought forth the monster <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notaurus</hi>
halfe a Bull and halfe a man,
fierce, brutish, mischeuous, cruell, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and odious.</p>
                  <p>To shroud thys monster from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wonder, &amp; yet therewithall to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
him the foode and contentment of hys
crueltie the destruction of men, a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
or Maze was builded by the same
cunning <hi>Dedalus,</hi> wherein <hi>Minotaurus</hi>
the Man bull or Bull man lurked, and
men passing in thether to him by entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement
of the Maze &amp; vncertayne error
of wayes, were brought to miserable end,
till at length valiant <hi>Theseus,</hi> furnished
with the policy of wise <hi>Ariadna,</hi> receaued
of her a clew of thred, by which, leauing
the one end at the entrie, he was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
guyded and preserued from the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Maze, and hauing slayne the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
by conduct of the same thred safely
returned.</p>
                  <p>The appliance hereof to the experience
of our times hath an apt resemblance,
<pb facs="tcp:22728:5"/>
not to proue but to shew the image of
some doinges at these dayes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
by conference not onely to sharpen
an intentiue sight of that which we winck
at, but also to rayse a iust lothing of that
whereof by some hurtfull impedimentes
we haue not discerned or rather not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the horror.</p>
                  <p>Lecherous <hi>Pasiphae</hi> may well be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to treason in hys estates addicted to
papistrie, forsaking Gods ordinance of
humane royall gouernement. Which
when so euer it happeneth, (for happe it
may and hath oft so chaunced) such trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
destroyeth good and naturall affection,
it kindleth vile and beastly desires, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all other none comparable in filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the lust of yelding them selues to
beare the engendring of the great Bull of
Basan or rather of Babylon, the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
incumbence, and tiranny of Rome,
the vsurpation of the Romaine siege the
siege of all abhomination. This princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
traitorous lust, that throweth downe
the person vnder this vncleane desire,
throweth away vertue &amp; respect of God,
for Romane pride hath climbed into the
seate of God and shooued to shoulder him
out, and banished vertue by open dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:22728:6"/>
with vice. It expelleth remembrance
of honor and kindnesse in regard of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
for fayth of wedlocke hath no place
in adulterers, and by Romane practises
neither doth superstition permit the soule
to keepe her chastitie from idolatries and
from forsaking Gods rules of religion,
nor the wife her due fayth from wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
lust, nor the husband his safetie from
traitorous violence. It driueth out natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
loue of countrey, for it prostituteth all
dominions to the common adulterer, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminer,
and forcer of kingdomes, the
Bull of Rome. It banisheth shame, for
it boasteth her filthinese to the worldes
sight, soliciteth it publikely, practiseth it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly,
defendeth it impudently, and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it in glorious pompe and triumph, not
as <hi>Iö</hi> ryding on a Bulles backe through
the water, but as it were carna<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
with a beast on the toppe of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianes</hi>
piller. And surely no more sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticall
is in nature the vnnaturall mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Bull and a woman, than is sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticall
in policie and religion the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling
of the popish vsurpation of Rome
with a temporall prince, yelding his or her
realme to Popish iurisdiction, or with the
spouse of Christ the vniuersall church ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished
<pb facs="tcp:22728:6"/>
by that Bulles force or desyled by
his abuses. But as in <hi>Pasiphae,</hi> so where
such rage of traiterous and superstitious
desire entreth, Gods grace forsaketh, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
feare departeth, shame flyeth, and the
lust is vntemperable.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Daedalus</hi> that must bryng the
enioyeng of this horrible lust to effect, is
the treason of Popish Clergie, full of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
workmanshyp, as the world hath
long had great experience, euen the same
Popish Clergie that hath framed to hym
selfe wynges, not naturally by Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance

Dioceses by vsurpation, fastened together
by art of symonie, and ioyned to theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes

With these haue they passed landes

                  <p>The sonne of this <hi>Dedalus,</hi> that is, of

his father and guide popish treason,
but not so well guiding himselfe for lacke
of experience, and desiring to sodenly to
climbe to nere the Sunne, or perhappes
mounting with more hast than good spéede
before his winges were well fastened, or
while himselfe could but yet flutter with
them and not perfectly flie, as God would,
his glew melting, and his winges drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
away, fell downe in his climbing, and
no doubt will geue name to the place
where he lighteth for perpetuall memorie
of his vndue presumption, surely yet pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
bewayled of papistes as <hi>Icarus</hi> was
of <hi>Dedalus</hi> his father.</p>
                  <p>This cunning <hi>Daedalus,</hi> Popish trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to bring this copulation to content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the vnchast <hi>Pasiphae,</hi> encloseth
her in a counterfait cow, that is, such prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or great estates as desire to lie vnder
the Bull of Rome, popish clergie turneth
into brutish shape to serue brutish lust, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them beastly, forsakyng the dignitie
of man and womans shape, whom God
made vpright to looke to God and Gods
seate the heauen, &amp; it maketh them cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly
stoupe to earthward, without regard
of the nature of man, the dignitie of kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<pb facs="tcp:22728:7"/>
the reuerent aspect to diuinitie, or
any other manly and reasonable conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
without any more vigor, agilitie
of soule and industrie to do noblely than
is in a cowe: a beast in déede profitable for
worldly foode, as Papistrie is, but (as most
part of beastes be) redy to promiscuous &amp;
vnchosen copulations, and specially méete
for a Bull, and among other prety quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
hauyng one speciall grace, (as one of
theyr owne Popish Doctours preached) to
swynge away flyes with her tayle wett in
the water, as foolish papistes swinge away
sinnes and temptations with a holy water
sprinkle.</p>
                  <p>In this beastly likenesse, degenerating
from manly forme, and maiestie of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance,
by <hi>Dedalus</hi> workmanship, that
is, by popish clergies traitorous practise,
ensued the copulation of a Bull and a
Quéene in a cowishe shape, that is, Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticall
and vnnaturall mixture of popish
vsurpation with and vpon royall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in brutish and reasonlesse forme.</p>
                  <p>Of this ingendring is begotten <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notaurus,</hi>
a compounded monster, halfe
a Bull and halfe a man, a beastly cruell
bodie, roaring out with the voyce or sound
<pb facs="tcp:22728:8"/>
of a Bull, and wordes of a man, the sense
of a deuill. The selfe same monster Bull
is he that lately roared out at the Bishops
palace gate in the greatest citie of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
horrible blasphemies agaynst God,
&amp; villanous dishonors agaynst the noblest
Quéene in the world <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Quéene of England, he stamped and
scraped on the ground, flong dust of spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
speches and vaine curses about him,
pushed with his hornes at her noble coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers
and true subiectes, and for pure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
all to berayed the place where he
stoode. And all this stirre he kept, to make
a proofe if hys horned armye of calues
would or durst come flyngyng about him
toward midsommer moone.</p>
                  <p>But he looked so beastly, and he raged
so vaynely, that though the whole wood
rang of hys noyse, yet hys syre the great
Bull, hys damme the prostitute cowe, and
hys children the foolish calues, were more
ashamed of hym than the noble Lion was
afraide of him. And therfore the Bull hys
fire, the cowe hys damme, and the wysest
of hys calues, fled once agayne to <hi>Daeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
the treason of Popish Clergie, for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and good counsell, by whose good
workmanshyp this myngled monster is
<pb facs="tcp:22728:8"/>
closed vp in a Maze, that is, in vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of vayne and false reportes, and (as it
happeneth in a Maze) by wayes leadyng
to other places than they seme to tend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
by crokednesse of deuises, by spredyng
into sondry créekes of rumors, to hyde
whence the Bull came or where he lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
euen as in the Maze of <hi>Daedalus</hi>
it happened, so it commeth to passe that
the <hi>Minotaure</hi> is not found out, and such
as enter into the Maze, that is, into folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
of Popish reportes and deuises, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
them selues so, that wanderyng
vncertainely at length they may hap to
perish in <hi>Daedalus</hi> engyne. And iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they lacke (the euident proufes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
that are in that behalfe to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred)
that beleue the report to be true of
transferring that Bull to Protestantes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises.
But I feare a worse thing: for if
they haue no wisedome that say so, wise
great persons can not beleue them: and
if they lacke not witte, then can not them
selues beleue it, and so is their truth to
the Prince to be perilously suspected.</p>
                  <p>The remedie resteth that some <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus,</hi>
some noble and valiant counseller,
or rather one bodie and consent of all
true and good nobilitie and counsellers
<pb facs="tcp:22728:9"/>
follow the good guiding thred, that is, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
policie deliuered them by the virgine
whom they serue, and conducted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
not onely may passe without error
through the Maze and finde out the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Minotaure</hi> that roared so rudely, but
also destroy hym and settle theyr Prince
and them selues in safetie: so as, <hi>Pasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phae</hi>
duely and deseruedly ordered, <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalus</hi>
vnwynged and banished, hys fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ryghtly restored, <hi>Icarus</hi> fayre drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the cowe transformed, the Maze dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
&amp; razed, the monster destroyed, the
calues (after the cow perished) sent with
Walthams calfe to sucke theyr Bull,
<hi>Theseus</hi> may be victorious, the virgine
Ladie most honorable, the land quyet, the
subiectes safe, and Gods prouidence euer
iustly praysed not vaynely tempted, hys
kyndnesse thankfully embraced, his name
louyngly magnified, hys policies wisely
folowed, hys Religion zelously maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>But till these noble enterprises be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued,
it is not good to be hedelesse. The
Monster may be let out of the Maze,
when it pleaseth <hi>Pasiphae</hi> and <hi>Daedalus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is good to be awake. Some men be
wakened with tickelyng, and some with
<pb facs="tcp:22728:9"/>
pinchyng or pullyng by the eare, that is,
some with mery resemblances, and some
with earnest admonitions. Some be ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
out of sléepe with noyse, as by the
spéech or calling of men, or by brute voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as the roaring of Bulles and noyse
of beastes, that is, either by aduises of
them that warne with reason, or with the
bragges &amp; threateninges of the enemies,
or inklinges slipped out of vncircumspect
aduersaries mouthes. Some be wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with very wisperinges, as with secret
rumors and intelligences. Some agayne
are so vigilant and carefull, that the very
weight of the cause and pensiue thinking
of it, wil scarcely let them sléepe at all. But
most miserable is their drowsinesse, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fatall semeth their sléepinesse, that for
all the meanes aforesayd, and specially so
leude and loude roaring of so rude and
terrible a Bull, can not be wakened or
made to arme and bestirre them, till the
tumult and alarme in the campe, the clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of armour, the sounde of shotte and
strokes, the tumbling downe of tentes
round about them, the groning of woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
men dying on euery side of them, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
force, and hostilitie triumphing in
their lustiest rage, and <hi>Sinon,</hi> that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb facs="tcp:22728:10"/>
the safetie of the traiterous horse,
insulting among them, yea till the very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
weapon in theyr body awake
them. Such may happe so to sléepe as they
may neuer wake.</p>
                  <p>Let vs all wake in prayer to God.
Let vs cry louder in sinceritie and deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than the Bull is able to roare in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and blasphemie. Let vs pray God to
arme our Quéene and Counsell with all
wisedome and fortitude, and our selues
with all fidelitie and manhoode, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our selues vpon confidence of their
most blessed gouernance, and redy with
our liues and all that we haue to follow
and serue them.</p>
                  <p>Let vs dayly and nightly pray God to
send a curst Cow and a curst Bull short
hornes, or to be well capped, or well sawed
of, that they budde no more, for els it were
better to take away head and all to be
sure, least honester then these calues be
made calues, or knocked on the head as
though they were calues. Surely as of
a body there is but one head that can not
be spared, so in a body may be many hods
that must néedes be spared, as perhappes
twenty byles &amp; euery one hath a head, in
which case there is no perill but least they
<pb facs="tcp:22728:10"/>
goe into the body againe &amp; then perchance
infect the hart bloud and put the body in
danger. And the onely perill of driuing
them in agayne you wote is colde and
colde handling. Some of our botches
be runne already, of some theyr heads
be broken, some ryping and I trust
shall be well launced or cleane
drawne out in time. In the
meane time beware cold.
And God send &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
the warmth
of his grace.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat ye be not deceaued,
good Readers, for I sée it
commonly mistaken, I
thought it good to let you
know, that the Bull which
is published in Print in
Latine and Englishe, together with the
forme of Absolution annexed vnto it, is
not the same Bull that was set vp at the
Bishops gate, as many suppose, but an
other. For plaine explication of the truth,
ye shall vnderstand that there be two
Bulles. The one conteineth a power and
forme to pardon, assoyle, and reconcile all
such as would returne from the Christian
Religion now taught in England, which
they call heresie, and from obeying our
Quéene and her lawes, which they sclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derously
call schisme, to the bosome of the
Chirch of Rome which we may truely
call Helles mouth.</p>
                  <p>The dispensation publishing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
of this Bull was committed to
Doctor <hi>Harding,</hi> and so many other seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
not onely to relieue those Popish
Patriarkes with the gaine of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
but specially to send out those Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papistes
with that Bull of reconcilement
<pb facs="tcp:22728:13"/>
among the Quéenes saint subiectes Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Papistes, as it were capitaines to
strike vp their drommes to gather sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
offering them great wages that
should fight vnder the Popes banner for
an other hed agaynst our Quéene, that is,
remission of their sinnes, as pure cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as when they were baptised, restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the communion of the faythfull, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
from all sentences, and from all
paynes of Purgatorye, and the enioying
of life and kingdome euerlasting.</p>
                  <p>With these Bulles and this proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of wages, they haue bene gathering
of rebelles euer since the yeare 1567. and
haue withall geuen to very many of them
prest money to be ready in rebellions, that
is, certaine papers, and badges of sondry
formes, some with a figure of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
some with fiue woundes, and some
other.</p>
                  <p>Since which time, namely in the ende
of Februarie 1569. when the late rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was redy layed and in hatching, the
Popes holinesse hath decréed an other
Bull, no dout at the speciall sute, procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
instance, and importunate calling
on of our Englishe traitors, and among
<pb facs="tcp:22728:13"/>
other <hi>D. Harding</hi> and the rest that procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the other Bulles.</p>
                  <p>In this is conteined an arrogant, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall,
and blasphemous taking to
himselfe the power, as committed to him
from God, to destroy, transpose, and alter
kingdomes at his pleasure, a number of
vile and horrible sclanders and vncomely
naminges of our Quéene, such as a good
subiect can hardly heare with pacience, the
very effect of a great part of the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles
proclamation as it were translated,
&amp; finally his lewd presumptuous sentence
of her maiesties depriuation, in so spitefull
abhominable, villanous, and traitorous
forme as is not to be rehersed. This is the
Bull that was set vp at the Bishops gate.</p>
                  <p>It séemeth by all probabilitie, and no
dout vpon examinations it will so fall out,
that the originall of this Bull sealed was
among our rebelles, and as it is thought)
brought them by <hi>Markenfeld</hi> or some
such other, or deliuered them vpon their
conference with strangers, and kept close
among them ready to be published so sone
as they should haue bene able to get into
their company such hed as they desired to
set vp after our Quéene, or such strength
<pb facs="tcp:22728:14"/>
as that they durst auow it. God so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
them that they neuer came so far.</p>
                  <p>In hope of the successe of this Bull,<note place="margin">Pl. &amp;c.</note> a
number of Papistes, that sometime did
communicate with vs, or at least came or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
to our publike prayers, haue of
late forborne, and by this note shall ye
know many of them.</p>
                  <p>In hope of the successe of this Bull,
were (as it is reported) letanies and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in Rome for the good spéede of our
rebelles.</p>
                  <p>In furtherance of the successe of thys
Bull, was the spreading of false newes in
Spaine, of a great battell in Ireland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
Papistes and Christians, wherein
an Angell with a Chalice in his hand was
reported to haue discomfited many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes
of our Quéenes subiectes, for which
there were in Spaine publike gratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ringing of belles, and triumphinges,
adorned with the greatest presences there,
or rather (as may well be suspected) pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for our rebelles successe, according to
the good meaning of the holy league or the
conspiracie of Trent.</p>
                  <p>In hope of the successe of thys Bull,
our Louanistes haue stayed their handes
<pb facs="tcp:22728:14"/>
from writing, and stand in suspense (better
it were they did hang in suspense) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
what will become of these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieues
whereof them selues haue bene
the proctors.</p>
                  <p>In hope of the successe of this Bull,<note place="margin">Co. &amp;c.</note>
a number of Papistes haue fled of late, and
some of them with promising or rather
threatening by letters a recompensing at
their returne of such kindnesses as are
shewed to their friendes in their absence,
haue vttered their courage.</p>
                  <p>This is the Bull that maketh so many
Papists stand yet so stiffly in not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
her maiesties iust authoritie. And
whatsoeuer they pretend for ecclesiasticall
causes, the very truth is to be thought that
since the decrée and publication of this
Bull, the most part of them estéeme not
the Quene lawfull Quene of this realme,
sithe the Pope hath decréed the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
who they thinke can not erre. And
no dout if an othe were ministred in
thys forme that they should acknowledge
her maiestie lawful Quene of this realme,
notwithstanding any sentence that the
Pope hath geuen or can geue, and that if
he haue or shall presume to geue any such
<pb facs="tcp:22728:15"/>
sentence they estéeme if erroneous and
presumptuous, &amp; will to their power resist
him, his adherentes, &amp; fautors that shal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to put any such sentence in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or affirme it lawfull: surely they would
likewise refuse such othe, vnlesse they wold
affirme the Pope to erre shamefully, iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
presumptuously, seditiously, traito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,
and in vilest maner, which they
would neuer sincerely confesse: but in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
the interrogatories ministred in
the booke of warning they would shewe
them selues as euill subiectes in very déede
as they haue by some proceding, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by setting vp of thys Bull, shewed
the same warning to be true and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                  <p>Because they neuer came in the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
time to possession and habilitie to set
vp the Comete whom they meant to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
in stede of the Sunne rising, I
meane, they had not the person whom they
would extoll, nor the power to auow it,
neither by forein ioyning, nor by domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
strength, it seemeth they did forbeare
the proclaiming of thys great Bull, and
haue hidden him in the Maze. And yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
some hope left that toward sommer
<pb facs="tcp:22728:15"/>
perhappes some fooles would be madde, or
yet at the least desperately at all a very
ventures to vtter their stomake, they set
vp a printed copie of thys Bull, whereby
they haue shewed that they not onely had
the originall to be proclaimed if time and
other circumstances had serued, but also
had prouided a number of copies printed,
sodenly to make it common, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
by the way a signification that our
bookemen are priuie to it.</p>
                  <p>Fayling yet of this hope, and the wiser
sort of them espiyng that the vnseasonable
setting it vp came not to so politike end as
they loked for, to supplie the fault of that
rashnesse, they haue found a new deuise.
Their complices, and the secret fauorers
of these treasons, or paraduenture such as
(for some respectes) are loth that to much
of the bottome of this treason should be
searched, haue spred or fauored a rumor,
and geuen insinuation that it is no true
thing, but counterfaited by protestantes
to bring the papistes in hatred.</p>
                  <p>No, no, this fetch is to farre set a great
deale. Treason it is, and vile and hie trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to auance such a thing, whosoeuer do
it, protestant or papist. And no protestant,
<pb facs="tcp:22728:16"/>
you may be sure, will traitorously ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
this estate, neither is any of them so
madde to thinke it a good excuse for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
if he should be arrained for traitorous
setting vp of such a Bull or paper, to say he
did it of an other intent to bring papistes
the Quéenes enemies in hatred. And so
may we well be bold to say, that there is
not a protestant in England of sufficient
wit and habilitie to forge such a Bull, that
would be content himselfe to be he hanged
drawen and quartered to spite a papist, or
that doth thinke he should spite a papist in
procuring to himselfe so great a danger.</p>
                  <p>But the thing being so traitorous and
perilous, euen in a protestant so intending
as these pretend, I would faine learne, or
rather haue it remembred of them to
whom it apperteineth, of what qualitie
the offence is in these qualifiers to concele
it. I do not meane of leauing it vndisclosed
when they know it, but of doing what
they can by perswasion that other should
not finde it, orby disswasion transferring
the suspicion an other way. Such are not
like to such concelers of felonies and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as do not vtter the felonies, treasons
and offenders that they know, but they are
<pb facs="tcp:22728:16"/>
like vnto those that when a felon or trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
is pursued, do helpe to hide him, and
conuey him into bie corners, and for the
felons or traitors easier escape do tell
them that pursue him that he is gone a
contrarie way or geue them contrarie
markes to kéepe them from knowing and
attaching him, or point them to a wrong
persone while the very these or traitor
may make shift for himselfe, yea and lend
him some of their owne clothes to disguise
him.</p>
                  <p>The thing is to euident, and thereby
the truth of such hiders is the more suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
There are intelligences enow that
the effect of the thing it selfe was more
than a yere agoe decréed in Rome. The
ordinarie procéeding of the Pope in like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and specially the folowing of the holy
league induceth it. The print is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen.
The very paper, after it was
taken downe, falling it selfe into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
crestes &amp; foldes and sise of the packet
wherein it came ouer, with a number of
other plaine euidences, disclose the thing,
and whence it came. Besides the very
thing is such that he may well be sayd to
lacke iudgement that discerneth it not to
<pb facs="tcp:22728:17"/>
be a very Bull. Be not therefore deceaued
ye good subiectes: and ye deceiuers, beware
ye deceiue not your selues.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is euident that such pérswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
lacke either wit or truth, but I feare
me they are so vaine glorious, and stand
so much vpon vndeserued reputation, that
they can be better content to be traitors
than to be taken for fooles.</p>
                  <p>But let vs call to mynde, &amp; gather some
frute of the olde tale of <hi>Cassandra</hi> king
<hi>Pryames</hi> daughter of Troy. She hauing
the gift of prophecie by <hi>Apollo,</hi> alway to
geue true warninges, had yet this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
anexed, that though she prophecied
truely she should neuer be beleued. So
happened it that when suttle <hi>Sinon</hi> had
perswaded the Troianes vnder false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
of religion, and specially a dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
shew of dedication to <hi>Pallas</hi> goddesse
of wisdome, that is, vnder colour of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and policie, to breake downe their
walles to receiue the horse that the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had framed and stuffed full of chosen
soldiars, <hi>Cassandra</hi> gaue warning what
treason the horses wombe conteined. But
by the ordinarie and fatall discredit that
was layed vpon her, and for that (as Poets
<pb facs="tcp:22728:17"/>
say) the fates and destinies of Troyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
were not remoueable, she was
not beleued, the walles were broken
downe, the horse deuoutely receiued, and
though the armour within gaue sound
and noyse, yet was he vnsearched, in the
night <hi>Sinon</hi> opened the window, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
men issued out, the Citie was fired
and destroyed, and all (as the Poets tell)
by conduct of <hi>Pallas</hi> goddesse of wisdome
and policie.</p>
                  <p>I will not at this time prosecute the
tale of <hi>Laocoon,</hi> his office of priesthoode,
his speare, the serpent from sea, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
nor the rest, wherof euery poynt and
euery particle hath his apt resemblance
for our benefit.</p>
                  <p>Onely this I will say, that it may be
that for our sinnes we haue <hi>Cassandraes</hi>
plague, though truth be tolde vs, it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
not beleued. The Grecians then
framed a horse. The Papistes haue now
framed a Bull. Their horse was stuffed
full of soldiers lurking redy to be let out to
set Troye on fire. This Bull is stuffed
with traiterous practises to destroy thys
realme. <hi>Sinon</hi> perswaded them to receiue
the Troyan horse without violating or
<pb facs="tcp:22728:18"/>
searching it. Our <hi>Sinons</hi> &amp; lewd qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
would haue the Bul estemed an other
thing, and take from vs the desire to haue
his belly searched. Their horse with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing
shooke, and they might heare the
very sound of the armour within him. In
this Bull the euidences are plaine of open
treason, and the very effect of our rebelles
proclamation translated soundeth within
it, and semeth as it were out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bulles belly to roare and tell vs that
all they were priuy to it that were by any
appendance or deuise of coniunction or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
knit to the late rebellion: as also
hard it is to excuse <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Antenor</hi>
great Lordes of <hi>Pryames</hi> house for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to much of the Grecians counsell.
<hi>Cassandra</hi> cryeth out agaynst the horse,
the fates will not let her be beleued,
<hi>Sinon</hi> opened the window, the horse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laded
his treasons. Lay this to our case, I
will compare no more.</p>
                  <p>The Lord be mercifull vnto vs and
preserue our Prince, and contrey, which
without our prince can not in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode
be preserued. God kéepe her noble
Counsellers, and geue grace to all her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
to sticke fast and faithfully to her,
<pb facs="tcp:22728:18"/>
and graunt to her maiestie to continue to
sticke fast to true subiectes, and principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we all by repentance wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the sinnes that are the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
why Christian <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draes,</hi>
the preachers of Gods
truth, and good admonitions,
are not beleued and folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
to our preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
