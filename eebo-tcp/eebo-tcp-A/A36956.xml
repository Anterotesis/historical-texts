            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Diſeaſe of Goſpelling firſt broke
out in <hi>Germany;</hi> and from Thence
the Contagion crept into other States
of <hi>Europe. Martin Luther</hi> was the Firſt
this new Plague ſeiz'd on; and from Him
his Pot-Companions took it: He wrapt his
foul Deſign under fair Appearances; He
aim'd at Abuſes, to ſtrike at the <hi>Church,</hi>
and cry'd out <hi>Reformation of Manners,</hi>
to let-in <hi>Deformation.</hi> His maskt <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie</hi>
drew Shoals of <hi>Admirers;</hi> and
then the charming Promiſes of <hi>True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Liberty,</hi> ſoon flung them into an Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Slavery; for from <hi>Admirers</hi> of his
<pb facs="tcp:66115:3"/>
               <hi>Doctrine,</hi> they paſt to be <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> and
Canoniz'd his <hi>Groſs Dreams</hi> for <hi>Divine
Revelations.</hi> But, as yet, his <hi>Progreſs</hi>
was ſcarce diſcernable: He found <hi>Prieſts</hi>
and <hi>Religious,</hi> as Vigilant to defend the
<hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Himſelf</hi> to attack it: And
therefore he ſet Two <hi>Gins,</hi> the One to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
Them, the Other to fright Them, and
their Inferiours too, from their <hi>Duty.</hi> He
felt, by Experience, that a <hi>Capuche,</hi> and
an <hi>Hair-Shift,</hi> were troubleſome <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;</hi>
That <hi>Faſting</hi> aud <hi>Praying</hi> were
Melancholy <hi>Entertainments;</hi> and, That
to give a <hi>Breviary</hi> for a Fair <hi>Lady,</hi> could
be no Bad <hi>Exchange.</hi> And therefore, by
his Omnipotent Power, be diſpenc'd with all
<hi>Religious Vows;</hi> and gave Mankind ſo
vaſt a <hi>Liberty,</hi> as to do any thing but
thoſe Obligations <hi>CHRIST</hi> had laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: <hi>Senſe</hi> applauded this New <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>'s
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>German-Reaſon</hi>
ſoon approv'd it: So that many <hi>Prieſts,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66115:3"/>
and <hi>Religious,</hi> accepted of the <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;</hi>
and made a <hi>Divorce</hi> with the
<hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>CHRIST</hi> Himſelf, to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe
the <hi>World,</hi> and its <hi>Fopperies.</hi> But
Thoſe, who refus'd theſe Proffers, to accept
of <hi>GOD</hi>'s; who plac'd the Good of their
<hi>Souls,</hi> above the Criminal Eaſe of their <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi>
and valu'd <hi>Fidelity</hi> to their <hi>Maker</hi>
at an higher Rate, than a Criminal <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
to his Mortal <hi>Enemy;</hi> Thoſe, I ſay,
were oppugn'd with different <hi>Engines:</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>Reformer</hi> begat ſome Scandalous
<hi>Pamphlet,</hi> and ſo contributed to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
of the <hi>World</hi> with the <hi>Children</hi> of
his <hi>Brain,</hi> as well as with the ſpurious <hi>Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring</hi>
of his <hi>Body.</hi> Some ſtruck at <hi>Prieſts,</hi>
Others at <hi>Religious;</hi> But all Conſpir'd (as
if <hi>Aſſociations</hi> were even then in Faſhion)
to decipher the <hi>Leaders</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as
Perſons rather to be Deteſted, than Obey'd.
By which Piece of <hi>unchriſtian Policy,</hi> they
intended to raiſe a Diſeſteem of <hi>Superiors</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66115:4"/>
in the Hearts of <hi>Inferiors;</hi> which once affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<hi>Diſobedience</hi> (the conſtant Sequel of
<hi>Contempt)</hi> would follow. And indeed, this
<hi>Method</hi> prov'd ſo favourable to the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrous
Deſigns of the firſt <hi>New Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
that their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> have pitch'd
on the ſame <hi>Expedient</hi> for the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that <hi>Religion,</hi> which, like a Young
<hi>Minerva,</hi> jumpt out of their <hi>Fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s
Brain. Invectives againſt <hi>Prieſts</hi> and
<hi>Jeſuits,</hi> are the common Cries in the Streets,
and the never-failing Topick of all <hi>Pulpit-Rhetorick.</hi>
But, I confeſs, the Latter bears
the greateſt part of the <hi>Satyrs.</hi> A <hi>Jeſuite</hi>
and <hi>Behemoth</hi> are nigh a-kin; for, as this
<hi>Beaſt</hi> was a Compound of all <hi>Animals;</hi> ſo
<hi>He</hi> is a Mixture of all <hi>Abominations.</hi>
Is there any Black Deſign contriv'd? The <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite</hi>
is of the Counſel. Any Abominable
<hi>Treaſon</hi> put in Execution? He is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
The <hi>Parliament</hi> of 41. was a College
of <hi>Jeſuites: Hugh Peters</hi> a Profeſs'd
<pb facs="tcp:66115:4"/>
Father; nay, <hi>Fairfax, Waller,</hi> and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
too, had been adopted Children of the
ſame <hi>Society,</hi> but that They wanted the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
qualifications. <hi>Diſloyalty, Rapine,
Murders,</hi> and the Tribe of <hi>Jeſuitical Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi>
In 66. the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> laid <hi>London</hi> in
Aſhes. Like fiery <hi>Dragons,</hi> they ſpit Flames
into <hi>Cellars,</hi> and <hi>Oyl-Shops;</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
then experienc'd, firſt, the Omnipotent
Power of <hi>Teukesbury Muſtard-Balls.</hi>
Nay, I have it from Credible Hands, their
Malice went ſo far, as to undermine the
<hi>Thames;</hi> and had infallibly blew it up in
the Air, but <hi>Providence</hi> put a Stop to
their Helliſh Enterprize, and ſo blew up their
Deſign. From <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> they run to
the <hi>Sword;</hi> and no <hi>Blood</hi> would lay the
<hi>Devil</hi> of <hi>Revenge,</hi> but His <hi>Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s.
Omnipotent <hi>Oliva,</hi> ſent down Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
from <hi>Rome,</hi> Father <hi>de la Chayſe</hi>
Ships of Money; and, in Concluſion, They
carry'd the <hi>Treaſon</hi> ſo ſecretly, that They
<pb facs="tcp:66115:5"/>
knew not of it Themſelves: Nor did any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
elſe, but thoſe <hi>Villains</hi> who accus'd them;
and who thought to build their Fortune on the
Ruin of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> In fine, A <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite</hi>
is, by Trade, a <hi>Butcher;</hi> but with
this Difference, That <hi>He</hi> ſtabs <hi>Kings</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be doing, and the honeſt Butcher <hi>Beaſts,</hi>
only to gain a Livelyhood. His <hi>Religion</hi> is
to profeſs All or None, as <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies</hi>
require. From <hi>Maſs</hi> he runs
to the <hi>Quakers;</hi> From <hi>Theſe</hi> to the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians:</hi>
Then he is dubb'd <hi>Jew,</hi> and
ſometimes <hi>Turk,</hi> when-ever the <hi>Alcoran</hi>
ſutes better with his Occaſions, than the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi>
Thus <hi>Jeſuits</hi> make ſale of Things,
even the moſt Holy and Rever'd in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;</hi>
acknowledging no other <hi>God,</hi>
but <hi>Intereſt;</hi> no other <hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
and (the greateſt of Crimes) <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
But, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> if all theſe Accuſations
are true, Why is not the <hi>Evidence</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, equal to the <hi>Boldneſs</hi> in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
<pb facs="tcp:66115:5"/>
them? Why? Our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> make
the World believe, That we are gifted with
<hi>Proteus</hi>'s Faculty; That we can turn and
wind our ſelves into all Shapes and Figures;
That <hi>Gyges</hi> bequeath'd us his Myſterious
Ring: And, What Wonder then, if we play
ſuch <hi>Prancks,</hi> without being catch'd, when
we cannot be ſeen.</p>
            <p>But, ſober <hi>Reader,</hi> Let us caſt away Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
and argue a little like <hi>Men,</hi> by the
Rules of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and not of <hi>Paſſion:
Firſt,</hi> Were <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſuch Mortal Enemies
to <hi>Princes,</hi> Is it credible, that the Greateſt
<hi>Monarchs</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their <hi>Conſciences</hi> to the Directions
of <hi>Men,</hi> whoſe only Aim is the Deſtruction
of their <hi>Bodies,</hi> and ruin of their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies?</hi>
No, certainly, unleſs we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they are all of the ſame Party with the
<hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and conſpire againſt Themſelves;
as ſome Gentlemen aſſur'd the World, that
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, of bleſs'd Memory, did
<pb facs="tcp:66115:6"/>
againſt his own <hi>Royal Perſon. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
Were their Principles of <hi>Morality</hi> ſo
bad and Anti-chriſtian, as ſome Malevalent
<hi>Perſons</hi> have deſcrib'd them, Can any <hi>Man,</hi>
of an unbyaſs'd Judgment, ever be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that all the World would run <hi>Mad</hi>
together, and ſend their <hi>Children</hi> for <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
&amp; <hi>Learning,</hi> to their <hi>Schools,</hi> where
no Leſſons are read, but of <hi>Debauchery</hi>
and <hi>Faction?</hi> I will rather believe, ſome
<hi>Pamphleteers</hi> have been miſtaken, than
that the greateſt Part of <hi>Europe</hi> is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and that They deſerve rather to be Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor'd
for <hi>Calumniators,</hi> than the <hi>Jeſuites</hi>
to be Condemn'd for <hi>Criminals.</hi> Some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
in <hi>Germany</hi> confeſs'd, That in the
Rules of our <hi>Society,</hi> there was nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible,
but the <hi>Roman Religion:</hi> And
for my part, I am of Opinion, That our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Miniſters can find no other Fault with
our Actions, but that They tend more than
they deſire, to the Increaſe of That <hi>Faith.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66115:6"/>
But, if <hi>Zeal</hi> for our <hi>Church</hi> be a Crime,
our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> muſt have Patience; for
there is no Hope of <hi>Repentance;</hi> We glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Sin, becauſe we eſteem it a Vertue:
And, if any can diſabuſe us with <hi>Reaſon</hi> and
<hi>Arguments,</hi> we will thank them for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:
But, if they will needs endeavour to
beat down our <hi>Zeal,</hi> by accuſing it, to ſtop
our Mouths with Morſels of <hi>Printed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
upon my Word, their Labour will prove
extreamly unſucceſsful. I hope, by the Grace
of <hi>GOD,</hi> we ſhall feel ſo great a Love for
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as to Forgive them; ſo much
<hi>Courage,</hi> as to bear their moſt foul Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
without any other Concern, than for our
<hi>Adverſaries</hi> Impiety, We will never ſo far
condeſcend to an Enemy, as to revenge Wrongs
done us, upon our own Souls; nor to be really
Wicked, becauſe our back-Friends would have
us be ſo. <hi>Innocence,</hi> I am ſure, ſtands for
us; and therefore, we need not fear a Weak

VINDICATION
OF
St. IGNATIUS
From the CHARGE of
Phanaticiſm, &amp;c.</head>
            <div type="introduction">
               <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong other Artifices, where-with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the <hi>Church of England</hi> recommend their
<hi>Religion</hi> to ignorant and deluded Perſons, none
has been more frequently made uſe of, than
the charging both our <hi>Church,</hi> and its <hi>Members,</hi>
with ſuch Crimes, which derive their Being,
as well as Enormity, from the inventive Brains
of our <hi>Accuſers.</hi> The Badneſs of their Cauſe, permits them not
to deſcend into a Scrupulous Examination of the Merirs of it.
Every ſingle Controverſie hath been ſo often handled, and ſo
demonſtratively determin'd againſt Them, that it would be
raſh and diſadvantagious to re-aſſume the Debate of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Queſtions. Wherefore they have wiſely judg'd it moſt
ſecure for their Reputation, to lay aſide <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66115:8"/>
and to take up no other Arms to defend their gaſping Cauſe,
than <hi>Forgery</hi> and <hi>Railery,</hi> the laſt Refuge of <hi>Deſperado's.</hi> To
make my Charge good, I will ſend my <hi>Reader</hi> to Two Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
lately come out, <hi>viz. <hi>The Art of Miſſionaries,</hi>
                  </hi> and
<hi>The Enthuſiaſm of the Church of Rome:</hi> In the Firſt,
<hi>Forgery;</hi> in the Second, <hi>Impiety</hi> (to call it no worſe) appear
bare-fac'd, in ſpight of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> For though, indeed, the
Author of the <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> cites his <hi>Authorities;</hi> yet many of
them are of ſo profligate a <hi>Reputation,</hi> that no Man, who did
not intend to put an Univerſal Cheat on Mankind, would ever
produce them, but to condemn them. A main Support of his
Slanders, is Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> a Perſon long ſince out-law'd by his
Country, and hath not as yet learnt <hi>Repentance:</hi> Nay, he adds
freſh Crimes to thoſe of an older Date, by flinging Dirt on his
Sovereign, and lending his Mercenary Pen to the Broachers of
New <hi>Rebellions.</hi> And ſhall he, who flies in the very Face of
his Prince, be admitted as an Evidence againſt <hi>Catholick</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
whom he profeſſeth to abhor? A great part of his other
<hi>Authorities</hi> are of the ſame Stamp and Reputation; only with
this difference, That Some, at leaſt, have been burnt by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Hang-man; and the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s, with a great part of the Herd,
as yet, only deſerves the ſame Puniſhment. In a word, The
<hi>Gentleman</hi> ſhou'd have taken into his Liſt the <hi>Salamanca</hi>-Doctor's
Narrative, to make it compleat, and to preſs his Accuſation
homer. Now, had this <hi>Pamphleteer</hi> firſt prov'd, by credible
Witneſſes, the Veracity of his <hi>Authors,</hi> and withal been more
ſparing of his <hi>Billingsgate</hi>-Rhetorick, his Accuſation might
have gain'd ſome Degree of Probability even in the Opinions
of well-meaning Men, till <hi>Catholicks</hi> had confuted it. But
firſt to Empanel a byaſs'd <hi>Jury,</hi> and then to Condemn a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of Men on its corrupt Verdict, is ſo foul a Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as not to be parallel'd but in the Tranſactions of <hi>Titus</hi>'s
Reign.</p>
               <p>As for the other <hi>Gentleman;</hi> Indeed, he has taken a far more
expedient way, to bring our <hi>Religion</hi> into an Odium: The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66115:8"/>
Name of a <hi>Phanatick,</hi> ſounds harſh to an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Man's Ear;
and therefore, he doubted not, but the very Imputation of
<hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> would raiſe the Hot-headed <hi>Mobile</hi> againſt us;
and turn the good Eſteem of many <hi>Church-Proteſtants,</hi> into an
utter Execration of our Folly. The Reverend Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
gave him the Plat-form of his Deſign; and, indeed, all <hi>England</hi>
could not afford him a more expert Maſter in the Science of
<hi>Phanaticiſm:</hi> For, let People talk what they pleaſe, <hi>Practice</hi>
is the beſt Miſtreſs; and the <hi>Doctor</hi> wants not this Advantage.
When <hi>Phanaticiſm</hi> turn'd Trump, it was the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Religion;</hi> and, if we may gueſs at his Mind by the Fruit
of his Brain (his Writings,) Two fat Benefices are the chief
Motives of Credibility, which keep him in the Prelatick
Communion. Nay, our <hi>Gentleman</hi> follows, through his whole
<hi>Pamphlet,</hi> this Guide ſo cloſe, that he often treads on his Heels.
So that, without any Injuſtice, I may change the Tittle Page,
and chriſten the whole Book, <hi>The Second Edition of Dr.</hi> Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet<hi>'s
Folly.</hi> But, to do him Juſtice, I muſt inform my
<hi>Reader,</hi> That he hath heightned the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s <hi>Railery,</hi> as well
as <hi>Impiety;</hi> and, as much as I can gueſs, hath ſpent ſo much
Time in turning over <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> as to have left none for the
<hi>Scripture:</hi> For, had he the leaſt inſight into that Sacred Book,
or the leaſt Tincture of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> he never durſt have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
his ridiculing Vein on the Sacred Counſels contain'd in that
Holy Volume; nor plac'd thoſe Pious Men, who follow'd
them, on the ſame Level with <hi>Phanaticks.</hi> But, what will not
Men do, when <hi>Paſſion</hi> blinds <hi>Reaſon?</hi> When the pleaſant Charms
of <hi>Revenge</hi> caſt <hi>Conſcience</hi> into a <hi>Lethargy?</hi> when they have
<hi>Light</hi> enough to ſee their Errors, and no <hi>Reſolution</hi> to correct
them.</p>
               <p>Would the <hi>Gentleman</hi> peruſe his own Lines in cold Blood,
I am perſwaded, he would bluſh at the Sallies of his <hi>Paſſion,</hi>
and confeſs he deſerv'd thoſe reviling <hi>Epithets,</hi> he has ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
flung on the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> for promoting imaginary
<hi>Enthuſiaſms,</hi> and on St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> for practiſing them. However,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66115:9"/>
though perchance his Buffooning <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> may be paſt cure;
yet for the diſabuſing thoſe, who poſſibly may be ſo far im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on, as to take a meer <hi>Romance</hi> for a real <hi>Story,</hi> I ſhall
make a ſhort <hi>Reply</hi> to a long <hi>Fable:</hi> Though I am convinc'd,
indeed, that Many may be pleas'd with the <hi>Slander;</hi> yet Few
will approve it, and Fewer the <hi>Author.</hi> The moſt Favourable,
perchance, may rank him among the Merry <hi>Andrews:</hi> But,
I am ſure, the more Judicious will place him among Thoſe,
who profeſs little <hi>Religion,</hi> and exerciſe leſs <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not intend, in my <hi>Reply,</hi> to follow this <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſo
cloſe by the Heels, as he has done Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi> for I find
the greateſt Part of his <hi>Calumnies</hi> long ſince wip'd-of, in the
<hi>Second Letter</hi> to <hi>A. B.</hi> But I will only touch thoſe <hi>Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which either ſlipt by the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Memory, or were ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
falſe, as he thought fit to conceal them.</p>

and an Hundred Compliments to the <hi>Saints</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

moſt endearing Epithetes; as if the <hi>Gentleman</hi> had loſt his
Breath, he ſtops of a ſuddain, and thus very gravely reads the
Indictment againſt St. <hi>Ignatius:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In forming this Inquiry, I ſhall begin with the Qualities ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
requiſit to compleat an affected <hi>Enthuſiaſt;</hi> among which
an ardent Deſire of Glory, and immoderate Ambition, obtain the
firſt place; for none could proſtitute the Dignity of his Nature
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66115:9"/>
to the Follies and Impertinencies of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> deny to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the common Benefits of Life, and undergo Poverty, Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Hunger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a thouſand other Inconveniences incident to that
Profeſſion, if he were not tranſported with a violent Ambition.</p>
               <p>I confeſs ingenuouſly, that <hi>Pride</hi> is a neceſſary Ingredient
to make a <hi>Phanatick;</hi> but that ſuch a Self-denial as you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is incident to Men of that <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> is, in my Opinion,
a moſt groundleſs Aſſertion. No Man in <hi>England,</hi> I believe,
is ſuch a Recluſe, as not to be acquainted with ſome of that
Perſwaſion; and yet I dare affirm, That no Body can point
me out any conſiderable number of thoſe Proſelytes of <hi>Phanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm,</hi>
who ever eſteem'd <hi>Voluntary Poverty, Nakedneſs, Hunger,</hi>
and a <hi>Thouſand other Inconveniences,</hi> to be neceſſary Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their <hi>Religion.</hi> Indeed, the <hi>Church of England</hi> ſeems
to be convinc'd, that a Renunciation of thoſe <hi>Common Benefits
of Life,</hi> is an eſſential part of their Obligation; and therefore,
mov'd with a Pious Indignation to ſee ſo <hi>Chriſtian Duties</hi> laid
aſide, thought fit (ſome Years paſt) to call ſtraying <hi>Phanaticks</hi>
to a ſevere Account, for the Contempt of ſo laudable a Tenet.
She tormented their <hi>Bodies</hi> with loathſom Priſons, for the good
of their <hi>Souls,</hi> drain'd their Purſes with Weekly and Monthly
Fines; and, in fine, forc'd them to <hi>undergo Poverty, Nakedneſs,
Hunger, and a Thouſand other Inconveniences incident to that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.</hi>
Nay, the no leſs Provident, than Pious <hi>Mother-Church,</hi>
went further: She knew full well, that <hi>Human Nature</hi> is frail,
and that Men are far more prone to Fall, than to Riſe; and for
this Reaſon, She judges it moſt convenient to keep the <hi>Rod
(viz.</hi> the <hi>Penal Laws)</hi> in her Hand, that now and then, with
a gentle Laſh, She may admoniſh them of their Duties, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
Nakedneſs,</hi> &amp;c: And 'tis for this end too, that She ſtickles
for the <hi>Teſt,</hi> leſt poor <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> by intruding themſelves
into gainful Offices, ſhould cut a new Channel for their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to run in, and pride rather in <hi>Opulence,</hi> than in the wan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of the <hi>Common Benefits of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It being then no Principle of our <hi>Engliſh Phanaticks,</hi> to feed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66115:10"/>
their <hi>Ambition</hi> with ſuch an Averſion from the <hi>Creature,</hi> as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to expoſe their naked <hi>Backs</hi> to publick View, their <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs</hi>
to the inward Knawings of a biting <hi>Hunger,</hi> rather
than enjoy it: Without doubt, your piercing <hi>Genius</hi> has found
out a new <hi>Sect,</hi> which Modeſty commands you to conceal.
But to ſatisfie the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Curioſity, and to contribute as much
as I am able to the Increaſe of your <hi>Reputation,</hi> and the Credit
of that pure <hi>Church,</hi> of which you are a ſpotleſs <hi>Member,</hi> I ſhall
communicate your <hi>Diſcovery;</hi> that the World may be Witneſs
as well of your <hi>Piety,</hi> as of your <hi>Railery:</hi> And that I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
your Meaning without all Debate, let the <hi>Reader</hi> take
notice of your Words: <hi>For none would proſtitute the Dignity of
his Nature,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>deny to himſelf the common Benefits of Life, and
undergo Poverty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if he were not tranſported with a violent
Ambition.</hi> So that, if we do but form one <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> this new
<hi>Diſcovery</hi> will lie at the Tail of it: <hi>Thoſe who deny themſelves
the common Benefits of Life, who undergo Poverty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>have the
firſt Quality to compleat an Enthuſiaſt.</hi> But, <hi>The Apoſtles, the
Primitive Chriſtians, and to be ſhort, Chriſt himſelf did deny
themſelves the common Benefits of Life.</hi> Ergo. <hi>Chriſt, and his
Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>had the firſt Quality to compleat an Enthuſiaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a <hi>Diſcovery</hi> worthy indeed of a <hi>Julian,</hi> or <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi>
but, for my Life, I cannot find one Fig-leaf to cover your
<hi>Impiety.</hi> If it be a piece of <hi>Phanaticiſm,</hi> to leave All for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
ſake, to obey our Great <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Counſel, we acknowledge
the Accuſation, and plead <hi>Guilty:</hi> But if it be a Crime of the
firſt Magnitude, to turn <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Life, and his Doctrine into <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries;
<hi>Sir,</hi> let me tell you, You ſtand heavily guilty at <hi>God</hi>'s
Tribunal, and will infallibly bear the ſmart of your <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>
in the next World, unleſs you learn to repent in This.</p>
               <p>But, perchance, you will tell me, That to quit all World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Pretenſions, to deny ones ſelf the <hi>Common Benefits of Life</hi>
meerly for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake, is Praiſe-worthy: But that St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>'s
Poverty ſprung from a Principle as far different, as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi>
is remote from <hi>Humility.</hi> So 'tis not preciſely the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66115:10"/>
Train of <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> which qualifies him for a <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
but Interior <hi>Ambition.</hi> Prove then, <hi>Sir,</hi> That <hi>Ambition</hi>
was the fiſt Motive of all St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Auſterities. He is about
it: where he uſhers in his Proof with a Diviſion of <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
to ſhew he loves to take things from the bottom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> (ſays he) <hi>was in a moſt particular manner indu'd with
this Heroick Quality, and that both Natural and Acquir'd.</hi> I
ſuppoſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Natural <hi>Temper</hi> of a Man's Body is no more
a Crime, than the Natural <hi>Features</hi> of his Face; becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the One, nor the Other falls under a Free Election; which
is a neceſſary Requiſit to frame a Sin. So that the Firſt
Part of your Proof being null, we muſt fall to the Examen of
the Second: <hi>This Natural Ambition of St.</hi> Ignatius <hi>was fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and increaſed by his extraordinary Addiction to read Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the Lives of Saints,</hi> p. 21. But it was the <hi>Reading of the
Legends of Saints, which finally compleated the Diſeaſe, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it incurable: This excited in him a paſſionate Deſire of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
an equal Reputation in the Church,</hi> p. 22. If the Lecture
of <hi>Romances</hi> inflamed his <hi>Ambition,</hi> whilſt he was yet a Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and breath'd the Air of the World, we accuſe the <hi>Lecture</hi>
as well as the Effect of it: But then, too, I cannot but wonder,
that ſuch an Accuſation ſhould fall from your <hi>Mouth,</hi> who are,
without doubt, guilty of the ſame Folly; for, if his Paſſion
carry'd him to <hi>Amadis,</hi> yours tie you to <hi>Don Quixot;</hi>
otherwiſe you could never have follow'd ſo cloſe your Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel:
But that the Life of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Actions of the <hi>Saints,</hi>
ſhould work the ſame Effect, I underſtand not, unleſs he had
your Faculty to draw <hi>Bad</hi> from <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<hi>Vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will grant you willingly, that the Zeal of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and
Humility of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> firſt open'd his Eyes, and gave him
a Proſpect of the Folly of all Worldly Pretenſions; as well as
of the Happineſs of Thoſe, who leave all this for his ſake who
made them. Where is the Crime? Where's Ambition, but in
your Fancy, who ſpy Faults in others, where there are none;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66115:11"/>
and will not turn an Eye homeward, where, I am ſure, you
would find a Subject more than ordinary of Confuſion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation?
Does not St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> recount the
<hi>Converſion</hi> of Two Noble <hi>Romans,</hi> by an accidental Reading of
St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Life? And does he load theſe <hi>Converts</hi> with the
Accuſation of <hi>Ambition?</hi> No, no: This Trade is new, and
takes its Date from the Bleſſed <hi>Epoche</hi> of <hi>Reformation.</hi> 'Twas
then <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Counſels began to be laugh'd at, when his very
Commands were declar'd <hi>Noxious to Chriſtian Liberty:</hi> When
Purity of <hi>Faith</hi> ſounded the Trumpet of <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and any
thing paſs'd for Lawful, but <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Church:</hi> When
<hi>Coblers</hi> left their <hi>Stalls,</hi> to mount the <hi>Pulpits;</hi> and paſs'd from
the mending of <hi>Soals,</hi> to the Direction of <hi>Conſciences:</hi> When
<hi>Religion</hi> grew in Vogue, like <hi>Almanacks;</hi> and the Freſhneſs of
its Date, was a ſufficient Argument to recommend it. I ſay,
'Twas <hi>Then</hi> Men eſtabliſh'd a New <hi>Language,</hi> when they pickt
up a New <hi>Faith;</hi> and firſt term'd <hi>Humility, Pride; Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Poverty, Nakedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. the moſt palpable Sequels of an
<hi>Enthuſiaſtick Ambition.</hi> Yet this <hi>Gentleman</hi> having once bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this wild Propoſition, <hi>[Ignatius, in his Converſion, was acted
with Principles of Ambition]</hi> is reſolv'd to ſtand to it, though
his <hi>Conſcience</hi> flies in his Face for it: Nay, and to demonſtrate,
that his <hi>Face</hi> is dy'd as deep with Braſs, as his <hi>Pen</hi> is dipt in
Gaul, he tells us; <hi>'Tis ſo undeniable, that even the Writers of
his Life cannot diſſemble it. This appears from the Account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by them of the Motions excited in his Imaginations, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Romances, and the Lives of Saints, at his firſt Converſion,
which was before mention'd; and may be further demonſtrated
from what</hi> Bouhours <hi>adds, That in exerciſing all his Religious
Auſterities, he had at firſt no other Aim, than to imitate thoſe
Holy Penitents, whoſe Lives he had read, and to expiate his Sins,</hi>
p. 30. <hi>Sir,</hi> The Meaning is, That at the beginning of his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi>
he had no Thoughts of Inſtituting an Order, for
the ſaving his <hi>Neighbour</hi>'s <hi>Soul;</hi> but his Deſign was wholly
confin'd to the <hi>Salvation</hi> of his own: So that, in ſhort, here's
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66115:11"/>
your Argument; St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> at firſt, employ'd all his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
by reading of the <hi>Saints Lives,</hi> and asking <hi>God</hi> Pardon
for his Sins, to ſave his own <hi>Soul,</hi> without extending his Care
to the <hi>Salvation</hi> of his <hi>Neighbour</hi>'s; therefore his <hi>Converſion</hi>
flow'd from the Principle of <hi>Ambition.</hi> Is not This a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<hi>Enthymema?</hi> Does not the <hi>Author</hi> deſerve to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
<hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> for this cunning <hi>Illation?</hi> Without doubt.
And, I hope, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> will be pleas'd to take it into its
ſerious Conſideration, whither ſuch an ingenious <hi>Philoſopher</hi>
is not worthy of ſome Promotion? But becauſe he wiſely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
the laſt Clauſe <hi>[And to expiate his Sins]</hi> would break the
Neck of the Argument, he thought fit to prevent it, by a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Slight of Hand, uſual to Perſons of his Quality; <hi>This laſt
Clauſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>was annex'd, only to ſave the Credit of the Saint.</hi>
And, let me tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> 'Tis only rejected by you, to ſave
the Credit of a <hi>Pamphleteer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Gentleman</hi> has Two Strings to his Bow. If <hi>Bouhour</hi>'s
Recount of his <hi>Converſion</hi> will not brand St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi>
the Publiſher of his Life by <hi>Mutius Vitelleſchius</hi>'s Order,
ſhall. Pray obſerve: His <hi>Firſt Reſolutions were to exerciſe great
Auſterities, and perform extraordinary Penance;</hi> (No harm yet,
not one Grain of <hi>Ambition</hi> is hitherto viſible) <hi>Not ſo much to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
his Sins, which then preſented themſelves to his View; as
becauſe he imagin'd, that in theſe Rigours the utmoſt Perfection
of Chriſtianity conſiſted, having no higher Idea of it; and deſiring
with Paſſion to acquire that Perfection.</hi> Now, let any Man turn
this <hi>Quotation</hi> into all Shapes, let him make what Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he pleaſeth, he will never frame, I am ſure, an <hi>Argument</hi>
able to convince any Perſon of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Ambition: For
the natural Senſe which the Words import, is, <hi>That the Saint
aim'd at the higheſt Perfection of Chriſtianity, and plac'd it in the
Exerciſe of great Auſterities;</hi> which, without doubt, was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake:
For the Perfection of Chriſtianity, conſiſts in a moſt
perfect Love of our <hi>Creator;</hi> other exterior Auſterities, are
only Means to arrive to it. Say then the <hi>Saint</hi> was miſtaken
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66115:12"/>
in his <hi>Idea</hi> of Perfection, and I will put my Hand to your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation:
But, on my Word, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you lay <hi>Ambition</hi> at his
Door, without better Proofs, than you have already produc'd,
you muſt maintain your Charge alone.</p>
               <p>Well then, rather than fall ſhort of his Intent, he ſingles out
another Circumſtance very material; viz. <hi>The Ambition of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a new Order in the Cburch, had ſtrangely poſſeſs'd his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and was the grand Motive of all his Auſterities,</hi> p. 32. That
from his <hi>Converſion</hi> he had conceiv'd ſuch a Deſign, <hi>Orlandin</hi>
and <hi>Bouhours</hi> agree; and I ſubſcribe: But that <hi>Ambition</hi> put
this Reſolution on foot, and as Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> very well ſays, <hi>And
all that;</hi> Where's your Proof? Why, <hi>I Gad, he will not tell
us:</hi> And yet we muſt ſwear ſuch a blind Obedience to his
Worſhip, as to believe him without any further Inquiry. For
my part, I do not intend to give him a Deference he denies
to the <hi>Church;</hi> nor to accuſe the <hi>Saint,</hi> by freeing him from
Calumny. <hi>St.</hi> Ignatius <hi>fram'd a Deſign to Inſtitute a new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi>
Ergo, <hi>Ambition was the Mover of this Great Work.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
infer ſuch an Impious <hi>Conſequence</hi> from ſo Pious an <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent;</hi>
nor any Body elſe, without betraying at once a want
of <hi>Wit,</hi> and an abundance of <hi>Impiety.</hi> I find, that St. <hi>Baſil</hi>
and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had the ſame Deſign, nay, and put it in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and yet I dare not, for my Life, draw this Concluſion,
Ergo, <hi>They were Ambitious.</hi> Will you therefore know St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>'s
Motive? It was a Zeal for his <hi>Redeemer</hi>'s <hi>Honour,</hi> and
for his <hi>Neighbour</hi>'s <hi>Salvation,</hi> which prompted him to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
He ſaw the greateſt Part of the World ſleep in <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
and <hi>Impiety;</hi> and that as they liv'd without <hi>Knowledge</hi>
of <hi>GOD,</hi> ſo they dy'd without <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> and without
<hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> He thought it then an Act both of <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
to <hi>GOD,</hi> and of <hi>Charity</hi> to his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> to be <hi>Founder</hi>
of an Order of Men, whoſe only Imployment ſhould be, firſt
to procure their <hi>Own,</hi> then the <hi>Salvation</hi> of their <hi>Neighbour</hi>'s:
And ſo it is. Beſides, he ſaw the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> attack'd
in <hi>Europe;</hi> That the Contagion of Brain-ſick <hi>Goſpellers</hi> had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66115:12"/>
infected the greateſt Part of the <hi>North;</hi> That <hi>Reformation</hi> was
the Fair <hi>Hellen,</hi> which inchanted <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and, That the
Name of <hi>Liberty,</hi> had plung'd whole <hi>Nations</hi> into <hi>Slavery:</hi>
Wherefore, to Heal theſe <hi>Wounds</hi> already made, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
future Dammages, he fram'd in his Head the <hi>Idea</hi> of the
<hi>Society;</hi> which he after Eſtabliſh'd by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority:
And how <hi>GOD</hi> favour'd his Deſigns, the Event has demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
beyond a Poſſibility of doubting. The Faireſt and moſt
Populous Nations, both of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> from his <hi>Deſcendants;</hi> who flung up all Right
to the <hi>Common Benefits</hi> of Life, in their Native Countries, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
their <hi>Lives</hi> to as many Dangers as there be <hi>Winds</hi> in the
Compaſs, to draw their <hi>Fellow-Creatures</hi> to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> and to perſwade them to Live like
<hi>Men,</hi> that they might not Die like <hi>Beaſts.</hi> In theſe <hi>Apoſtolical
Functions,</hi> above Three Hundred loſt their <hi>Lives,</hi> and ſeal'd
with their own <hi>Blood</hi> that <hi>Goſpel</hi> they Preach'd to Others. I
challenge all the <hi>Miniſters</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to ſhew the World ſo
viſible Marks of <hi>Piety</hi> in their <hi>Order,</hi> or ſo manifeſt an Evidence
of <hi>Divine Approbation:</hi> No, they have found ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
<hi>Livings,</hi> made to their Hands by the <hi>Piety</hi> of their
<hi>Catholick Anceſtors</hi> within the Compaſs of the Four <hi>Seas,</hi> that
they reſt contented with their <hi>Portion;</hi> and think it a piece
of the higheſt Folly, to be ſo enamour'd with the <hi>Converſion</hi>
of <hi>Heatheniſh Souls,</hi> as to expoſe <hi>Chriſtian Bodies</hi> to the leaſt
Inconvenience for their ſakes. Beſides, a pack of little <hi>Children</hi>
is an expenſive Burden, and the Tears of a Loving <hi>Wife</hi> a
ſtrong Retentif: So that a well-meaning <hi>Miniſter</hi>'s <hi>Zeal</hi> is
choak'd by Two Impoſſibilities; that is, He cannot go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Tranſportation of his Family, and in this Caſe his Purſe
is too little; or without an abſolute Renunciation of <hi>Wife</hi> and
<hi>Children:</hi> and as for That, without any Ceremony, he tells the
Heathens, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xorem duxi &amp; ideo non poſſum venire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but though we are advanc'd to the <hi>32th. Page,</hi> I can
find no End of the <hi>Firſt Accuſation:</hi> My <hi>Author</hi> follows his Point
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66115:13"/>
cloſe, and will not part with his belov'd Topick, <hi>Ambition;</hi>
which makes me think, he is no ſuch Enemy to it: For People
talk of That moſt, which they love the beſt; and often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe
thoſe very Things, they moſt paſſionately dote on. What
then has he yet to ſay? He <hi>Reveal'd one Day to</hi> Polancus <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Favours GOD had beſtow'd on him;</hi> and pray'd earneſtly,
<hi>That</hi> Eguia <hi>might not out-live him, leſt he ſhould diſcover to the
World, what he knew of the Sanctity of St.</hi> Ignatius: This is,
as I conceive, your Meaning, though not your Words. To
take a view as near as we can of the Streſs of your <hi>Argument,</hi>
let us ſtand on the Right Side: <hi>St.</hi> Ignatius <hi>reveal'd privately
one Day to</hi> Polancus, <hi>That GOD had beſtow'd many Favours on
him;</hi> Item, <hi>That he did not relate the Thouſandth Part;</hi> Item,
<hi>He pray'd earneſtly, that his Confeſſor might die before him:
Therefore, he was Ambitious.</hi> Here the <hi>Reader</hi> ſees the whole
<hi>Objection,</hi> not through falſe <hi>Opticks,</hi> but in it natural Bulk
and Proportions. But whether it skulks in the Firſt or Second
Inſtance, for my Heart I dare not preſume to determine:
Yet methinks, the <hi>Gentleman</hi> might have drawn, from the
Second Inſtance, a <hi>Concluſion</hi> of his Modeſty; becauſe his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of out-living <hi>Eguia,</hi> aim'd at this, That many Gifts of <hi>GOD,</hi>
known to him, as being his <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> ſhould lie forever bury'd
in Oblivion. But I have to deal with a Man, who is equally
offended with <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Speaking,</hi> and makes the One as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
as the Other. But, <hi>St.</hi> Ignatius <hi>made</hi> Polancus <hi>Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of his Heavenly Viſits?</hi> and I find, that <hi>Solomon</hi> wiſper'd
that Famous <hi>Apparition</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> in the Ear of a <hi>Confident:</hi>
Yet the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is not over-ſhy in taking notice
of this Great <hi>King</hi>'s Faults, never ranks that Action among his
Crimes. Again; St. <hi>Paul</hi> recounts us his <hi>Rapture</hi> to the <hi>Third
Heaven;</hi> yet among all the Reflections of <hi>Commentators</hi> on
that Paſſage, I find not One which attributes the Rehearſal
of ſo ſignal a Favour, to <hi>Pride:</hi> Nay, King <hi>David</hi> proteſts, <hi>He
will always ſing the Mercies of the LORD;</hi> And why ſhould
You and I be ſo Satyrical, as to queſtion the Lawfulneſs of his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66115:13"/>
Reſolution? If therefore ſuch a Confidence be not the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Reſult of a <hi>Phanatick Pride,</hi> find ſome other <hi>Argument</hi> to
back your <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> or confeſs you are miſtaken in your <hi>Charge.</hi>
In fine, <hi>Sir,</hi> When you feel <hi>Ecſtatical Tranſports</hi> of <hi>Divine
Love,</hi> when you work <hi>Miracles,</hi> and bring me ſufficient Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
to render them Credible; although you proclaim your
<hi>Gifts</hi> at <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Croſs,</hi> I will not lay down my good Opinion
of your <hi>Humility,</hi> but rather increaſe it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Quality</hi> requiſit to make a compleat <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi>
ſays our <hi>Author,</hi> is <hi>Ignorance, and Weakneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi>
This he faſtens on St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and very civilly gives all the
<hi>Founders</hi> of <hi>Orders</hi> the ſame Complement. The <hi>Great Founders
of Monaſtick Orders are obſerv'd to have been Ignorant and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
to a Prodigy; and</hi> Ignatius, <hi>far from being ambitious to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
them in Learning, thought it Meritorions to be more Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
than them all.</hi> May I be ſo bold, <hi>Sir,</hi> as to learn of you
thoſe <hi>Obſervers?</hi> I fear, they took their Obſervations ill. For
my part, I have obſerv'd, and Others with me, That many
Great <hi>Founders</hi> have always been, and are ſtill eſteem'd the
Learnedſt Men, in all reſpects, that ever the World produc'd,
ſince the Riſe of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> What think you, <hi>Sir,</hi> of St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil?</hi>
What of St. <hi>Auſtin?</hi> Do theſe paſs with you for <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
Perſons, and <hi>Stupid to a Prodigy?</hi> If They do, I ſhall not
much rely on your Judgment. Indeed, ſome have not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd
<hi>Doctors;</hi> but I never read of any <hi>Stupid to a Prodigy.</hi>
If you have diſcover'd this ſo material a Point of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> do
us the Favour to impart it; and the <hi>Gentleman</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi>
ſhall reward you with a Place in the <hi>Journal Des Scavans.</hi> But
has our <hi>Author</hi> let fall no peculiar <hi>Encomium</hi> on St. <hi>Ignatius?</hi>
Yes: He <hi>Thought it Meritorious to be more Ignorant than them all.</hi>
Did any one but read your following <hi>Page,</hi> he would ſcarce
believe you to be now in earneſt: For there you tell us, That
<hi>He put himſelf to School, and beſtow'd many Years in learning
Philoſophy, and the Latin Tongue;</hi> That, <hi>He betook himſelf to
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Paris. Now, I cannot perſwade my ſelf, you
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66115:14"/>
are in earneſt, when you make us believe, he judged <hi>Ignorance ſo
Meritorious</hi> after all theſe Efforts, to loſe it. Methinks, you might
have alleadg'd ſtronger <hi>Arguments,</hi> to evince his high Eſteem
of this great <hi>Virtue,</hi> rather than to repreſent him with <hi>Children</hi>
in the <hi>School,</hi> turning over his <hi>Accidents,</hi> and ſweating about
the Firſt Conjugation, <hi>Anno.</hi> I ſuſpect your continual hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Notions of <hi>Crack'd diſturb'd Brains,</hi> &amp;c. has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
miſplac'd yours; and that you have ſo long hector'd St.
<hi>Ignatius</hi> out of his <hi>Wits,</hi> till you have loſt your <hi>Own.</hi> However
you have receiv'd the Wound in the <hi>Church of England</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and you may, in Recompence, hope for a <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> in
<hi>Moor-field College.</hi> But laying aſide all your Demonſtrations
of his <hi>Stupidity,</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of <hi>Sorbon</hi> aſſures us, That he
took his Degree: Which makes me conclude, (what-ever you
are pleas'd to the contrary) he was not ſuch an Enemy to
<hi>Learning,</hi> nor ſuch a Friend to <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as you deſcribe him:
But 'tis no matter. You will have him, after his Death, to be
the profeſs'd <hi>Enemy to Learning:</hi> Back your Aſſertion with
a good Reaſon, and I'll not oppoſe you. Why, <hi>Ten Years after
his Death, appearing to</hi> James Terry, <hi>a Young</hi> Scotch-<hi>Man of
his Society, (who with Diligence and Fervour, had apply'd himſelf
to the Study of True Learning) he ſharply reprehended him; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
to him leſs Knowledge, and more Virtue.</hi> Here's his
Proof; now attend to his Illation: <hi>St.</hi> Ignatius <hi>recommended
to him a greater Study of Virtue, than of Knowledge.</hi> Ergo, <hi>He
was the profeſs'd Enemy of Learning.</hi> I wonder the <hi>Gentleman</hi>
has ſpar'd ſo long to caſt ſome by-reflection on our <hi>Saviour;</hi>
for I do not remember, He ever exhorted his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to the
Study of <hi>Human Learning;</hi> but, every <hi>Page,</hi> is full of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to <hi>Virtue.</hi> Nay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems rather to diſſwade <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
from too curious a Search into Litterature; and he gives
a Reaſon too, <hi>Becauſe it is the Mother of Pride; Scientia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat:</hi>
And, without Flattery, I am of Opinion, the Flatuous
Vapours of an imaginary Learning, now and then flie up to
our <hi>Scribler's</hi> Brains, and diſturbs his <hi>Intellect:</hi> For, How
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66115:14"/>
can a Man, in his Wits, commit ſo foul a Crime, as to write
<hi>Bantering</hi> for <hi>Truth,</hi> and down-right <hi>Impiety</hi> for ſolid <hi>Reaſon?</hi>
Yet this is his Caſe, without an <hi>Hyperbole.</hi> He has charg'd
on St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> Two Eſſential Conſtitutives of an <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> viz.
<hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> with ſuch an hectoring Accent, that
one would have expected as many Demonſtrations as Prepoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But, in the end, you ſee, the <hi>Gentleman</hi> forgot his Meſſage;
and inſtead of preſſing his <hi>Accuſation,</hi> has thus blindly flung it
on <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Come, <hi>Sir,</hi> let me exhort
you, as St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> did his Proſelyte, <hi>Leſs Knowledge, more
Virtue.</hi> Study more how to ſerve <hi>GOD,</hi> and leſs how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
your <hi>Neighbour.</hi> Now, if you will be ſo cruel, as, for my
<hi>Charity,</hi> to enrol me among the Enemies of <hi>Learning,</hi> I ſhall
only ſay, <hi>Amen, So be it.</hi>

<hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> (ſays he) <hi>conſiſts in pretending to Divine Viſions,

Hold there, <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> as you tender your Credit, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtancy:</hi> If you give ſo large Notions
of <hi>Phanaticiſm,</hi> you exclude from the Pale of your <hi>Church</hi> the
moſt Famous <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and if once
theſe Supports be thrown away, your <hi>Church</hi> muſt fall. Saint
<hi>Martin</hi> was a Pretender to <hi>Extraordinary Illuminations;</hi> and
Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us of a certain Voice, which bid him, <hi>Tolle
&amp; Lege,</hi> Take up and Read; and a Thouſand others. Now,
<hi>Sir,</hi> If I put my Hand to this Part of your Definition, I cannot
refuſe it handſomly to this Conſequence; Ergo, <hi>St.</hi> Martin,
<hi>St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>&amp;c. were Enthuſiaſts.</hi> My Reaſon is, Becauſe you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
That all thoſe who pretend to <hi>Divine Viſions, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

But, <hi>All thoſe fore-mention'd Saints did pretend to Divine Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>after Chriſtian Religion was once fully ſettled;</hi> Ergo,
<hi>Thoſe Saints were Phanaticks.</hi> Excuſe me then from Subſcribing
to the Firſt of your Definitions, unleſs you think good to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
your Mind better. I will take up the Context; <hi>In beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66115:15"/>
of infus'd Knowledge, and inward Light.</hi> I admit this, on
condition you do not intend to make an humble <hi>Recount</hi> of thoſe
<hi>Favors,</hi> meerly for others <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> paſs current for <hi>boaſting.</hi> My
Precaution is neceſſary, leſt unwarily we find St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Name
in the Catalogue of <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> before we dream of it. What
follows next, is full of Equivocation: And therefore I muſt
declare on what terms I admit it, and on what I reject it. <hi>In
pretending to have receiv'd all the Articles of Faith by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Inſpiration.</hi> This Propoſition, as it lies, is not Orthodox:
For after the compleat Settlement of the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> the
<hi>Prophets</hi> did pretend to <hi>have receiv'd the Articles of their Faith
by particular Inſpiration;</hi> and yet I dare not pronounce them
<hi>Phanaticks.</hi> Now indeed, if you ſtoop ſo low, as to regulate
your Charge by my Notion of <hi>Phanaticiſm,</hi> we will proceed
to the Trial. I conceive it then, with Submiſſion, that only
thoſe deſerve the Title of <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> who pretend, That <hi>the
natural and ordinary Means inſtituted by Divine Providence to
find out all Articles of Faith, is an Inward Light, and an Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Revelation.</hi> This I underſtand by <hi>Phanaticiſm:</hi> And if you
can prove St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> guilty of this Folly, I will fling up the
Cauſe; if you cannot, <hi>Juſtice</hi> obliges you to a ſpeedy <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi>
Firſt, For having ſo abus'd the World with loud Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of ſtrange Diſcoveries, concerning the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome<hi>'s

your <hi>Pen</hi> to wound the Reputation of the <hi>Saints</hi> in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Men.</p>
               <p>You therefore affirm St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> to have been a <hi>Phanatick,</hi>
becauſe he pretended to <hi>Divine Viſions and Illuminations;</hi> and
then you draw up an <hi>Inventory</hi> of ſome <hi>Apparitions</hi> and <hi>Ecſtacies</hi>
recounted in his <hi>Life,</hi> which takes up a conſiderable Part of
your <hi>Pamphlet:</hi> All which you are pleas'd to attribute to the

<hi>Brain.</hi> But ſhall any ones Judgment be ſo byaſs'd, as to take
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66115:16"/>
this for a <hi>Confutation?</hi> Would any Man take bare <hi>Aſſertions</hi>
for ſolid <hi>Reaſons,</hi> or falſe <hi>Aſperſions</hi> for real <hi>Crimes,</hi> your <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi>
is, I grant, moſt perſwaſive: But who-ever takes the
pains to ſift it, will be able to find nothing but <hi>Scum</hi> above,
and <hi>Malice</hi> below. <hi>Sir,</hi> For my part, I know no <hi>Catholick</hi> of
ſo eaſie a Belief, as preſently to ſwallow down every fictitious
<hi>Story</hi> for a real <hi>Miracle.</hi> They meaſure their <hi>Aſſent</hi> by the
Rules of <hi>Prudence.</hi> Where the <hi>Authority</hi> is weak, their Belief
is ſuitable; where ſtrong and evident, their <hi>Aſſent</hi> is without
Heſitation. In fine, They always are of Opinion, That to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
All, and to <hi>Deny</hi> All, are Extreams equally reprehenſible.</p>
               <p>Now produce ſome <hi>Arguments,</hi> which prove credibly, That
the <hi>Illuminations</hi> and <hi>Viſions</hi> aſcrib'd to St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> were but
the Effect of a diſcompos'd <hi>Brain,</hi> of a ſtrong <hi>Imagination,</hi> and
diſorderly <hi>Fancy;</hi> and if I cannot oppoſe more weighty <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
to the contrary, I'll fling up my <hi>Cards.</hi> The only Ground
of your Scruple, as far as I can learn, is this, <hi>If indeed</hi> Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
<hi>receiv'd a perfect Knowledge of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>How came it to paſs, that for many Years after, he was ſtill eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Fool, and an Ideot?</hi> You have put a pretty <hi>Sophiſm</hi> in
the Mouth of a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a <hi>Turk.</hi> If <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> was
<hi>GOD,</hi> How came it to paſs, that He was ſtill eſteem'd for a
<hi>Fool, and an Ideot?</hi> To make us believe that ſuch an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was not a Popular Noiſe only, you tell us, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Examen by the Inquiſitor of</hi> Alcala, <hi>and Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
<hi>he was adjudg'd not to have been ſufficiently inſtructed in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion:</hi> You might as well have quoted your darling
Romance, <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> as <hi>Bouhours;</hi> and found as much to
your Purpoſe in the One, as in the Other: For <hi>Bouhours,</hi> in
the Book cited, mentions not one Word of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
before the <hi>Inquiſitor;</hi> much leſs of a <hi>particular Examen:</hi>
And therefore any puny <hi>Logician</hi> may infer out of that <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in Nubibus,</hi> That you are far more meanly inſtructed in
the Rules of <hi>Truth,</hi> than St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:66115:16"/>
Indeed, <hi>Bouhours</hi> tells us, That the <hi>Great Vicar</hi> caſt him in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
upon the Account of the Indiſcreet Fervor of Two <hi>Ladies,</hi>
abſcrib'd by Dr. <hi>Cirol</hi> to the Perſwaſions of St. <hi>Ignatius;</hi> and
told him, <hi>That not being a Divine, he ſhould abſtain from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating
to the People the Myſteries of Religion, till ſuch Time
he had ſtudied Four Years in Divinity:</hi> But here's no mention
either of an <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> or of a <hi>particular Examen.</hi> And as for
<hi>Don Alphonſo de Fonſeca,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> he was ſo far
from judging him not to have been <hi>Sufficiently inſtructed in
Matters of Religion,</hi> that he very much <hi>Exhorted him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his Functions of Piety towards his Neighbour.</hi> So that here
lie chain'd, one to the Heels of the other, Two <hi>Forgeries,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Diſpute, as well as without Excuſe. Had you been forc'd
to Tranſlate your <hi>Author</hi> out of <hi>Greek,</hi> Charity might have
oblig'd me rather to have faſt'ned this Miſtake on your <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
than to have imputed it to your <hi>Malice:</hi> But the <hi>Book</hi>
being <hi>Engliſht</hi> to your Hands, the moſt favourable Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
I can put on your Crime, is, That you have taken up
that <hi>Principle</hi> ſo often laid at the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Door, viz. <hi>All things
are lawful, if profitable to the Church;</hi> and then working by
this Maxim, you concluded, That a <hi>Forgery</hi> was but a ſmall
Price to buy <hi>Heaven</hi> for your ſelf, and the Diſ-eſteem of the
World for St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and thoſe of his <hi>Society.</hi> But, <hi>Sir,</hi> You
have taken falſe Meaſures, and as diſadvantagious a <hi>Topick</hi> as
you could have light upon. Vent your Burleſquing Vein
till <hi>Dooms</hi>-Day, you will never ſo far unman Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as to wheedle them into a Belief, that the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and
their <hi>Founder,</hi> are <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Ideots.</hi> Had you taken up your
Quarters at <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> and from that <hi>Enchanted Caſtle</hi> popt
in the <hi>Hawker</hi>'s Mouths <hi>New Narratives of Popiſh Plots, and
Jeſuitical Contrivances;</hi> or ply'd them with <hi>White-Horſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations,
Armies of Jeſuits in the Air,</hi> and <hi>Thouſands of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
in the Rear,</hi> your Labour might ('tis poſſible) have met
with ſome Succeſs: But, on a ſuddain, to Metamorphize their
<hi>Plotting</hi> into <hi>Folly,</hi> their intrieguing <hi>Genius</hi> into <hi>Stupidity,</hi> is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66115:17"/>
to raiſe a Scruple in the Wiſeſt Part of the Nation, Whether they
did not want ſome Grains of <hi>Wit,</hi> when they fear'd to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on by <hi>Fools?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet indeed, to give the <hi>Gentleman</hi> his Due, he dropt a
Word or two, <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. which inſinuate, That at firſt he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
rather to have charg'd the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> with <hi>Knavery,</hi> than
<hi>Folly:</hi> for thus he tells us; <hi>It ſeems, the Propagation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
by Force of Arms, is connatural to the Order of</hi> Jeſuits; <hi>only
the Wiſdom of latter Years hath chang'd theſe Spiritual, into
Carnal Weapons.</hi> You are in the right, <hi>Sir;</hi> The <hi>Wiſdom of
latter Years hath chang'd theſe Spiritual into Carnal Weapons:</hi>
But the Miſery is, the Wiſdom of the little Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi>
joyn'd with the indefatigable Induſtry of Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi>
was not able to find them in <hi>Jeſuitical,</hi> nor <hi>Popiſh</hi> Cabinets.
The Gentlemen of <hi>Rye-Houſe</hi> engroſs'd them to themſelves for
a peculiar Uſe; and then the <hi>Proteſtant Duke</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> convey'd them to his Friends at <hi>Taunton,</hi> for the
Propagation of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> But, <hi>Sir,</hi> You are too
wary; You might, without Scruple, extend the <hi>Wiſdom of
latter Years to latter Ages;</hi> for I find <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> and <hi>Carnal
Weapons</hi> of the ſame Date.</p>
               <p>Look over to the <hi>Godly Churches</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and you will
ſee them making Elbow-Room with <hi>Drawn Daggers</hi> in their
Hands, and <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> in their Mouths; Two pretty
<hi>Proteſtancy</hi>-dilating Engines, and both the Product of <hi>Modern
Wiſdom.</hi> What think you, <hi>Sir,</hi> of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of a <hi>Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Republick?</hi> Did it not effect the <hi>Propagation of the Goſpel</hi>
by Force of Arms? Did it not break in pieces the fretting
Yoak of its Maſter the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to put on its Neck that
of the <hi>LORD?</hi> Yes. And Dr. <hi>B.</hi> a Miniſter of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> extols to the Skies the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of his <hi>New Lords,</hi>
for a Crime, which, I fear, has puſht the <hi>Contrivers</hi> into <hi>Hell.</hi>
The <hi>Wiſdom of latter Years</hi> has produc'd the ſame Effects in
every <hi>Kingdom,</hi> where <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> (the <hi>Religion</hi> of Latter
Times) got foot; and I dare ſay, That it ſeldom gain'd one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66115:17"/>
Inch of Ground, but by the Help of <hi>Carnal Weapons.</hi> So that,
I am ſure, (what-ever <hi>Mines</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have laid to propagate
<hi>Popery)</hi> the <hi>Propagation of the Goſpel by Force of Arms, is more
connatural to</hi> Proteſtancy.</p>
               <p>After an Hundred and Two <hi>Pages</hi> ſpent in wild <hi>Notions,</hi> ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<hi>Propoſitions,</hi> and nonſenſical <hi>Probations</hi> to back them, as
if he had intended all the while to give Scope only to a Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
<hi>Imagination,</hi> or to teach the World, That much <hi>Confidence,</hi>
and little <hi>Reaſon</hi> go far; he reſolves to knock down St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>'s
Sanctity, as well as the <hi>Church</hi>'s, at one Blow. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
is great, and ſuitable to <hi>Don Quixot</hi>'s Bravo; and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
contriv'd to Admiration. Be pleas'd therefore to attend:
<hi>In the Bull of his Canonization, the Pope affirmeth, That from the
Time of his Converſion, nothing proceeded from him, which can be
accounted a Mortal Sin.</hi> But St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> committed the Sin of
<hi>Deſpair in the moſt aggravating Circumſtances, ſometime after his
Converſion:</hi> Ergo, <hi>The</hi> Pope <hi>was deceiv'd, and St.</hi> Ignatius, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a Throne among the Saints, deſerves a Place among the
Sinners.</hi> Here are Two Charges; but <hi>GOD</hi> ſend they fall not
on the Head of the <hi>Accuſer.</hi> I deny then, <hi>Sir,</hi> the <hi>Minor,</hi> viz.
<hi>That St.</hi> Ignatius <hi>was guilty of Deſpair.</hi> But let me deſire you,
not to run to <hi>Bouhours</hi> to make your Charge good; for, on
my Word, you will betray your Blindneſs, as well as the <hi>Cauſe</hi>
you have in Hand.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gentleman,</hi> after ſo many unlucky Chances by Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
will try another Hit for it: He tells us then out of
<hi>Bouhours; That he</hi> (Ignatius) <hi>falls into a dark Melancholly; and
being one Day in his Cell, he had the thought of throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out of the Window, to end his Miſery.</hi> Here is, indeed, a ſhrewd
Temptation; but yet no ſhadow of Sin. All the World knows
well, that it is not in the Power of any Man breathing, to
barr out of his Imagination, <hi>Criminal Suggeſtions:</hi> No, no; they
lie within the reach of <hi>Satan,</hi> who can imprint in them the
Pictures of the moſt monſtrous <hi>Crimes;</hi> and, oftentimes, the
beſt Men are aſſaulted with the worſt Thoughts. A bare Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66115:18"/>
is no Fault; 'tis a voluntary embracing of it, derives all
its <hi>Malice</hi> into the Action. Shew me then, out of <hi>Bouhours,</hi>
that St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> deliberately yielded to the Temptation, and
I will caſt aſide all further Diſpute. <hi>But Heaven</hi> (ſays he) <hi>by
Force reſtrain'd him, againſt his Will.</hi> Ay, here is <hi>Deſpair</hi> with
a Vengeance, indeed! Does <hi>Bouhours</hi> affirm this? Not one
word of it, upon my Credit. Pray, <hi>Reader,</hi> condeſcend ſo far
to Curioſity, as to turn to <hi>Lib. 2. pag.</hi> 29. and you will find
<hi>Boubours</hi> of a quite contrary Opinion; <hi>But he was with-held
from yielding to this Motion of Deſpair, by the ſame Hand which
ſtruck him:</hi> Thus he. Which Words, taken in the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Senſe imaginable, import only this, That St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was
aſſail'd with the Temptation of <hi>Deſpair;</hi> but, by the Helping
Grace of <hi>GOD,</hi> he moſt happily triumphed over the <hi>Enemy.</hi>
And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> Shall ſuch an <hi>Impudence</hi> go unpuniſh'd? No,
no; if a <hi>Searing Iron</hi> has not paſt over his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> if ev'ry Spark
of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is not ſtifled; I am ſure, he has felt the Bitings
of a knawing <hi>Conſcience;</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> ſend the Torment already
began Here, may not continue Hereafter; where it is like to
he without Redreſs, becauſe without End. I will appeal to any
ſober Man, Whether this <hi>Gentleman</hi> hath not drawn up an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Demonſtration,</hi> both of his own <hi>Forgery,</hi> and <hi>Deſpair?</hi>
I ſay, <hi>Deſpair,</hi> and that in the moſt aggravating Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
becauſe nothing beſide the utmoſt <hi>Deſpair</hi> of making his
<hi>Indictment</hi> good, could ever throw a Man into ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
as to oblige him to run bare-fac'd into a <hi>Guilt</hi> of the
higheſt Nature, to faſten a <hi>Crime</hi> on another. Yet the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
may, in ſome ſort, be excus'd; 'tis the <hi>Epidemical Diſeaſe</hi>
of the <hi>Climate.</hi> His <hi>Church</hi> ſprung from the Itch of <hi>Liberty,</hi>
was firſt wean'd with <hi>Forgery,</hi> and ſtands yet on the ſame
Crutches: And this is ſo black a Patch in the Face of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Guardians</hi> not being able to waſh
it off, have thought fit to perſwade the World, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
are guilty of the ſame Defect. But the Miſery is, the Blur
is ſo minute in us, that none can ſee it, but the <hi>Miniſterial Guides;</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:66115:18"/>
ſo that Others, who believe it, muſt pin their <hi>Faith</hi> on the Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verend
Sleeves of their <hi>Divines</hi> Canonical Habit.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> is now piping-hot againſt the <hi>Pope:</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Crime of <hi>Deſpair,</hi> was mention'd to convince the World,
that his <hi>Holineſs</hi> took ill Informations of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<hi>Ex abundanti,</hi> he comes out with a Second: <hi>However, if
it be a Venial Sin for a Man to ſacrifice his Life to his Folly; it
is no leſs than a Mortal One, deliberately to commit an Action,
which he is perſwaded in his own Conſcience to be unlawful.</hi> Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
<hi>in his Voyage to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>thought it utterly unlawful, and
contrary to Evangelical Poverty, to carry any Proviſions with him;
yet being reſolv'd by his Confeſſor to the contrary, he boldly did
that out of Obedience, which he durſt not do of himſelf.</hi> By this
Paſſage he pretends to demonſtrate St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> guilty of a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Sin; but after having ſifted it from top to bottom, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
I cannot find the very Shaddow of a Venial One. Let us
put to the Teſt each Propoſition: <hi>It is no leſs than a Mortal
Sin, deliberately to commit an Action, which he is perſwaded in
his own Conſcience to be unlawful.</hi> Certainly, <hi>Sir,</hi> your Cloſet
turn'd round, when you Penn'd this Propoſition. I ſuppoſe,
you are perſwaded in your <hi>Conſcience,</hi> the leaſt Untruth to be
unlawful; and yet I ſhould not be ſo ſevere, as to judge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſlight Untruth to amount to a Mortal Sin: To ſteal a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is an unlawful Action; and yet I dare avouch, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
taxes ſuch a petty Theft with a Mortal Sin, ſtands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to <hi>GOD</hi> of a Mortal One himſelf: And when it
ſhall pleaſe you to call for my Reaſon, you ſhall not fail to
have it. Let us go on: Ignatius, <hi>in his Voyage to</hi> Jeruſalem,
<hi>thought it utterly unlawful, and contrary to Evangelical Poverty,
to carry any Proviſions with him. Sir,</hi> You are ſo innur'd to
falſe Quotations, that you cannot forbear. 'Tis <hi>utterly falſe,</hi>
that St. <hi>Ignatius thought it utterly unlawful to carry any Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
along with him:</hi> For <hi>Bouhours</hi> only tells us, <hi>He was afraid,
he ſhould deviate from Evangelical Poverty, in carrying any thing
along with him.</hi> So that his Doubt was not of the Lawfulneſs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66115:19"/>
of the Action; but, whether it were not a greater Perfection,
to embarque himſelf unprovided? But, ſuppoſe his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
told him, <hi>It was unlawful;</hi> yet his <hi>Confeſſor</hi> brought ſo
weighty Reaſons againſt what he objected, that at laſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
his <hi>Confeſſor</hi> was in the Right, and <hi>Himſelf</hi> in the Wrong;
and ſo accordingly he follow'd his Advice. Where is the Sin
in all this Proceeding? <hi>Where is the Renouncing the Liberty of
his Will, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of his Reaſon?</hi> Do Men fling up their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
I beſeech you, <hi>Sir,</hi> when they leave a weak Motive, to
ſtick to a ſtronger? At this rate we muſt conclude, That <hi>Fools</hi>
run looſe in the World, and that all the <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are confin'd to <hi>Bedlam.</hi> Indeed, I am not ſo great an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of <hi>Blind Obedience,</hi> as to judge it a <hi>Virtue</hi> in all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
Men may command Things contrary to the Law
of <hi>GOD;</hi> and in this Caſe the <hi>Commander</hi> and the <hi>Obeyer</hi> are
equally guilty. Such a Caſe may be inſtanc'd in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of the laſt Week: Thouſands of well-meaning Men
thought nothing ſo reaſonable, as to Read his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
for Liberty of Conſcience</hi> in the <hi>Churches:</hi> But then
their <hi>Reverend Confeſſors</hi> were of another Opinion; and ſo the
poor <hi>Penitents</hi> yielded <hi>Blind Obedience</hi> to their <hi>Directors,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Obedience</hi> to the beſt of <hi>Princes</hi> oblig'd them to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Procedure. Here was, I grant, a <hi>Renouncing of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Free-Will, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Reaſon,</hi> to the purpoſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
according to your <hi>Logick,</hi> a Sin of the deepeſt dye both
againſt <hi>GOD,</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> But prompt <hi>Obedience</hi> to a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
paſſes in <hi>Proteſtant Caſuiſts,</hi> for <hi>Virtue:</hi> Yet when a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Saint</hi> lays aſide his private Judgment upon good and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Motives, to follow the Sentiment of his <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> no leſs
than a Capital <hi>Crime</hi> is preſently clapt on his Shoulders.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s <hi>Gall</hi> is ſtill boyling againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> and
nothing can quench it, I ſee, but another Puſh for it againſt
both the <hi>Pope,</hi> and St. <hi>Ignatius;</hi> for you muſt know, he frets
at the One for being a <hi>Saint,</hi> and at the Other for Canonizing
him. <hi>But what</hi> (cries he, in a pleaſant Humor) <hi>if after all,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:66115:19"/>
Ignatius <hi>ſhould be found an Heretick?</hi> (Ay marry, <hi>Sir,</hi> This is
a necking Blow.) <hi>He would ill deſerve the Dignity of a Saint.</hi>
(Queſtionleſs, you are in the right.) <hi>And at the next Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Calendar, might be perhaps expung'd out of it.</hi> p. 112.
You might expunge your <hi>Perhaps,</hi> and aſſert it confidently.
Nay, I queſtion not, but all <hi>Catholicks</hi> would thank you for your
Service, could you unmask ſuch a Cheat; for they are well-meaning
Men, and are as loth to be impos'd on as their <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>
But becauſe I know, (if a bare Aſſertion be ſufficient)
nothing is ſo ſurprizing, which you cannot prove <hi>ad eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi>
I beg a ſhort Authentick <hi>Reaſon</hi> on Record; It will reliſh
well: He <hi>Believ'd Scripture to be the only Rule of Faith,</hi> Ibid.
I deny it: But go on. He ſaid, <hi>That if the Articles of Faith
had never been Recorded in the Scripture,</hi> (or, as another
<hi>Author</hi> expreſſeth it) <hi>Although no Monuments or Teſtimonies
of the Chriſtian Religion had remain'd, he ſhould ſtill have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which manifeſtly ſuppoſeth him to have believ'd,
that the Knowledge of the Chriſtian Religion muſt neceſſarily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
either from the Scripture, or from Extraordinary Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and that there is no Medium, which might ſerve the Ends
of a Rule of Faith.</hi> What? no <hi>Medium?</hi> Look back to the
<hi>105th. Page,</hi> and there you will ſee your ſelf of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
for, Do you not expreſs your ſelf, in as intelligible Terms
as poſſibly can be, That he ſo much doted on <hi>Blind Obedience,
that if he adher'd to his own Principles, he muſt have renounc'd
Chriſtianity, and even Natural Religion, if his Confeſſor had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him:</hi> And, <hi>That he propos'd this as a firſt Principle to
all, That true Chriſtians ought to ſubmit themſelves to the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Church, with the Simplicity of an Infant.</hi> Methinks,
this is a <hi>Medium between Scripture alone,</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination:</hi>
Had I been to have drawn up this <hi>Indictment</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi>
my utmoſt Care ſhould have been to have ſtifled this.
But you never Look before you Leap, and that makes you ſo
often Fall. Your Invective againſt <hi>Blind Obedience,</hi> jump'd
handſomly into <hi>Pag.</hi> 105. and in <hi>Pag.</hi> 112. you ſell connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66115:20"/>
into <hi>Hereſie;</hi> and ſo down they went, though you knew,
they would never be kept from Claſhing on the ſame <hi>Paper.</hi>
But let us wink at this trifling Miſtake; and grant what you
affirm, That St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> did ſay, <hi>That if the Articles of Faith
had never been Recorded in Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. he would firmly have
embrac'd them all; Does it follow, That he held <hi>Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi>
or <hi>Illumination,</hi> to be the <hi>Rules of Faith?</hi> By no means.
He was of Opinion, 'tis true, That an <hi>Extraordinary Rule</hi> might
be an <hi>Extraordinary Illumination;</hi> and that the <hi>Ordinary One</hi>
is <hi>Scripture</hi> interpreted by the <hi>Church:</hi> So that the Senſe of his
Words, is this; Although all <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
had periſhed, <hi>GOD</hi> had given him, by an <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Illumination,</hi> ſuch a clear Knowledge of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of
our <hi>Religion,</hi> that he would have believ'd them.</p>
               <p>Here, you ſee, the <hi>Gentleman</hi> has not been ſparing of Dirt;
but he groſly miſs'd his Aim: for I am throughly convinc'd,
a moderate <hi>Eye</hi> will eaſily diſcover, that the greateſt Part ſticks
cloſeſt to the <hi>Aſperſer:</hi> Yet <hi>Paſſion</hi> will ſet his <hi>Pen</hi> afloat, in
ſpight of <hi>Fate.</hi> Indeed, he is come to an End of his <hi>Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and to ſay ſomething, runs in a Circle, by making a Recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation.
<hi>If it be prov'd, That in his Life-time he was eſteem'd
an Enthuſiaſt, an Impoſtor, and an Heretick, by many ſober, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and learn'd Men of the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>it will be no ſmall
Confirmation of the Truth of whatſoever I have hitherto obſerv'd.</hi>
Yes, if their <hi>Surmizes</hi> were ſounded on <hi>Reaſon;</hi> otherwiſe by
no means: For, in this Caſe, I am no greater a Friend to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi>
than your Self. I grant you, <hi>Catholicks,</hi> in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimates,
may be miſtaken, as well as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and equally
lie open to Prejudices. <hi>At</hi> Alcala <hi>he was ſuſpected by ſome of
Sorcery.</hi> Why? The <hi>Gentleman</hi> begs your Pardon there; he is
not ſuch a Fool, as to tell the Reaſon: No, that would wipe
off the <hi>Aſperſion.</hi> The Truth of the Buſineſs is: St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>
reclaim'd, from his ſinful Courſes, a Perſon of the firſt Rank;
and preſently the Wiſe Populace concluded, nothing but the
Power of the <hi>Devil</hi> could draw ſuch a noted <hi>Debauchee</hi> to <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:66115:20"/>
A pretty Accuſation, you ſee; and as well grounded, as that
againſt our <hi>Saviour; In Belzebub Principe Daemoniorum ejicis
Demonia;</hi> You caſt out <hi>Devils</hi> in Vertue of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the
Chief of the <hi>Devils. By others of Hereſie, and put in the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
for a Viſionary.</hi> 'Tis true; but, How came he of? After
an <hi>Exact Enquiry into the Manners and Doctrine of</hi> Ignatius, <hi>not
finding any thing that might render him ſuſpected, and judging it
not expedient to make him appear before Them; They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to refer the Matter to</hi> John Roderiguez <hi>Grand Vicar of</hi>
Alcala; <hi>who told</hi> Ignatius, <hi>That the Juridical Information which
had been made, was much in his Favour;</hi> and, <hi>That he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his Functions, for the Service of his Neighbour.</hi> So <hi>Bouhours,</hi>
without the leaſt mention of any ſuch Clauſe, touching Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Methods of <hi>Religion. Soon after he is clapt into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
a Second Time, for inſtilling fooliſh Principles into his
Hearers.</hi> But, Was he not, by publick Sentence, freed from
the <hi>Imputation?</hi> I thought, it was not a Crime to be <hi>Accus'd,</hi>
but to be <hi>Guilty;</hi> yet You confound both: Though, at this
rate, our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Reputation ſuffers, who was Indicted of as
heavy Crimes as ever <hi>Ignatius</hi> was.</p>
               <p>When he was remov'd to <hi>Salamanca, both Him and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
were put in Chains by the Inquiſition there, as Hereticks and
Seditious Perſons; and not Abſolv'd, but upon condition of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more.</hi> Certainly, <hi>Sir,</hi> You imagine your ſelf in <hi>Lucian</hi>'s
<hi>Iſland of Dreams;</hi> or that all the World is aſleep, beſide your
ſelf; or ſo enamour'd with your great <hi>Abilities</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> as
to embrace every <hi>Falſity</hi> dropt from your <hi>Pen,</hi> as Eternal <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</hi>
I grant, he was clapt in <hi>Priſon;</hi> and You, that he was
<hi>Abſolv'd:</hi> Hear the Sentence: <hi>After Two and Twenty Days of
Impriſonment, the Maſter and his Diſciples were cited before the
Judges, to hear their Sentences read; by which they were decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be good Men, and their Doctrine to be ſound.</hi> (What could
Innocence deſire more?) <hi>They are further permitted to ſpeak
of Heavenly Things, and to inſtruct the People as much as they
pleaſe.</hi> With what Face, then, dare you averr, (and then cite
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66115:21"/>
                  <hi>Bouhours</hi> to ſecond your <hi>Impoſture,)</hi> That he was <hi>Acquitted,</hi>
upon Condition of <hi>Preaching no more?</hi> A Man would imagine,
you cited <hi>Authors</hi> only to corrupt them, or to render your
<hi>Forgeries</hi> more palpable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soon after his Arrival at</hi> Paris, <hi>he is accus'd to the Inquiſitors,
for ſeducing young Scholars; but, by the Interceſſion of Friends,
diſmiſs'd.</hi> Good <hi>Sir,</hi> and was not the ſame laid at our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s
Door? Were not the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> hurry'd before <hi>Tribunals</hi> on the
ſame Account? They were all ſtil'd <hi>Seducers,</hi> for diſſwading
People from being ſeduc'd by the charming Flatterings of the
World: And the Crime of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
This the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> was convinc'd of; and therefore Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
the <hi>Accus'd,</hi> not by the <hi>Interceſſion of Friends,</hi> as you
were pleas'd to inſinuate, but out of a Motive of <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, in Concluſion, all theſe <hi>Accuſations,</hi> which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as corroborating Proofs, do not add one Grain to the
Weight of your <hi>Arguments:</hi> Nay, they rather Extenuate
them; though they add a notable Increaſe to your <hi>Guilt,</hi> and
demonſtrate to the World, at one view, both the Exceſs of
your <hi>Folly,</hi> and the Hainouſneſs of your <hi>Forgeries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From this univerſal Contempt of</hi> Ignatius <hi>in his Life-time,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>it may be farther evinc'd, That all the Reports of his Miracles
are abſolutely falſe.</hi> May it ſo? Why, <hi>Sir?</hi> At this rate our
Bleſſed <hi>LORD</hi> was the greateſt <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> that ever breath'd:
For, I am ſure, neither St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> nor any other Man ſince
the World ſtood, lay under a greater Contempt, than He. Nay,
<hi>Jeremy,</hi> at this wild rate of Arguing, was a petty Cheat;
ſince, I am ſure, He felt as heavy Effects of his Country-Men's
(I will not ſay, <hi>Contempt,</hi> but) <hi>Fury,</hi> as St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> did of
<hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> If your <hi>Antecedent</hi> be deny'd, What will become
of your <hi>Conſequence,</hi> and all your Erroneous <hi>Deductions?</hi> Yet
ſo it is. Venture once more on <hi>Bouhours,</hi> and you will find,
that the greateſt Men living, had a Tenderneſs for his <hi>Perſon,</hi>
and ſtood in Admiration of his <hi>Prudence.</hi> And if he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66115:21"/>
'twas only by Thoſe who could not be ſufficiently
blam'd themſelves. Wherefore this <hi>Argument</hi> not being able
to concur the leaſt to your Deſign, I will examine your <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Conſiderations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To what purpoſe ſhould <hi>GOD</hi> work ſo many Miracles
in the midſt of Chriſtian Countries, many Ages after the Faith had
been fully ſettled in them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Might not the refractory <hi>Jews</hi> have objected the ſame,
againſt the Miſſion of <hi>Jeremy?</hi> Might not the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> by
the ſame Rule, ſtop St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Mouth, when he recounts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Miracles,</hi> on his own Knowledge? The <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
was then fully ſettled. So that, if you will inform me, to
what purpoſe <hi>GOD</hi> did work <hi>Miracles</hi> in thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
I will requite your Civility, by returning you a Reaſon,
why <hi>GOD</hi> did it in Theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Were thoſe Countries devoid of True Religion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By no means. But, what then? ſhew me any Reaſon,
or Authority, why <hi>GOD</hi>'s Power is ſo chain'd up, that it
cannot Act, but according to the Rules preſcrib'd by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Providence, in a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Was the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> at that Time, grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
corrupted with Errors and Superſtitions? <hi>(No,</hi> Sir: <hi>What will
you infer?)</hi> It remains therefore, that <hi>GOD</hi> ſhould perform
all theſe Miracles, meerly in Teſtimony of the Extraordinary San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to manifeſt his Favour to him, and procure to
him Honour and Eſteem among all Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You are quite out of the way, and wholly miſtaken
in your <hi>Arithmetick: GOD</hi> might have had many Motives,
which you have paſs'd by, All worthy of Him; and not at
all <hi>contrary to his Excellency,</hi> or the <hi>Imperfection of our Nature.</hi>
For you may remember, that although even Then the <hi>Roman
Faith</hi> was as Pure, as when it deſerv'd ſo large an <hi>Encomium</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:66115:22"/>
from the Mouth of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> who was little vers'd in the
Science of <hi>Flattery:</hi> Yet the New-inſpir'd Prophets of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
call'd it in Queſtion. Theſe Men, as Spiritual as the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
<hi>Senſuality</hi> could render them, <hi>reſolv'd</hi> to make room for their
Luſts, by rending themſelves from her <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
them; and ſo pretended to purify her <hi>Faith,</hi> by the moſt
enormous Crime, <hi>Rebellious Apoſtacy. Novelty</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>
were fair Baits for a <hi>Populace</hi> to ſwallow; and then fine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of a <hi>Paradiſe</hi> Hereafter, and of a <hi>Mahometical Heaven</hi>
Here, were too ſtrong Temptations for a ſenſual <hi>German</hi> to
overcome. Our <hi>Engliſh Laity,</hi> you know, felt the Comfort of
<hi>Abbey-Lands,</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> of fair <hi>Wives:</hi> So that the moſt
Conſiderable Part of the <hi>Northern Provinces,</hi> ſet up a <hi>Religion</hi>
of their own Coining; or, to ſpeak more properly, every one
preach'd his own <hi>Dreams</hi> for <hi>Divine Revelations.</hi> Now, in ſuch
a diſtracted Poſture of the <hi>Church,</hi> Was it a proceeding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of <hi>GOD,</hi> to point out his <hi>True Church</hi> by <hi>Miracles,</hi>
and by the Sanctity of Thoſe, who were <hi>Members</hi> of it. This
was the Method <hi>GOD</hi> took to Eſtabliſh <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and to
reduce the <hi>Rebellious Jews</hi> from their <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi> And if it was not
then a Proceeding unworthy of <hi>GOD</hi> to condeſcend ſo low, as
to have Recourſe to his <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> for the reclaiming of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
I do not conceive, why it ſhould be in <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Time,
when the ſame Cauſe was too too viſible. Again, Why could
not <hi>GOD</hi> work <hi>Miracles</hi> for the Comfort, as well as Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
of the <hi>Faithful?</hi> I ſee no Inconvience, unleſs it were,
that ſuch a Kindneſs would make the <hi>Reformers Conſciences</hi> flie
too often in their Faces, for running from that <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe
<hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Piety GOD</hi> ſo highly atteſted.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Gentleman</hi> comes out with a ſhrewd <hi>Objection</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all <hi>Miracles:</hi> (Have at the <hi>Jeſuites!)</hi> The <hi>Temptation
of lying and feigning Miracles, for the Reputation of an Order, is
in that Church for more perſwaſive, than the Evidence of Reaſon.</hi>
This is a <hi>Compliment</hi> borrow'd from the worthy <hi>Dean</hi> of St.
<hi>Pauls:</hi> But I challenge Him, and You, to produce one <hi>Jeſuite,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:66115:22"/>
or <hi>Catholick Divine,</hi> who ever taught it lawful to lie for the
Honour of their <hi>Order,</hi> or on any Account whatever. 'Tis a
<hi>Doctrine</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Leaders</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> A
Catalogue of <hi>Lies,</hi> in a <hi>Proteſtant Pamphlet,</hi> is no leſs conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
than a Liſt of wonderful Cures to a <hi>Mountebank.</hi> Look
back on the Bleſſed Times of <hi>Titus Oats;</hi> peruſe thoſe <hi>Satyrs</hi>
vented from the <hi>Pulpits,</hi> as <hi>Divine Oracles;</hi> and then tell me,
Whether 'twas poſſible to crowd more <hi>Lies</hi> in a <hi>Romantick
Fable,</hi> than the furious <hi>Divines</hi> of the Zealous <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
marſhall'd in their <hi>Sermons</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> They
blew the <hi>Fire</hi> to ſuch an Extremity, that it almoſt reach'd
their own <hi>Vicariges;</hi> and the Deſire to rout out the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> by
a Juſt Judgment of <hi>GOD,</hi> flung them within an Inch of their
own Ruin. The Juſtice of the <hi>Nation,</hi> deluded by Fabulous
<hi>Narratives,</hi> and Malicious <hi>Sermons,</hi> in Proceſs of Time, found
out its Error, and made a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> no leſs Authentick, than
the <hi>Fault.</hi> But the <hi>Pulpit-Oats</hi>'s could not ſtoop ſo low, as to
acknowledge their <hi>Crime;</hi> which makes me think, they thought
it none, to Lie and Calumniate for the Honour of their <hi>Church,</hi>
and the utter Diſparagement of <hi>Ours.</hi> And, <hi>Reader,</hi> to ſpeak
my Mind freely, I am of Opinion, That the <hi>Conſult</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi>
in Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi>'s Library, hath pitch'd upon the Method of
<hi>Slandering,</hi> as the beſt <hi>Preſervative againſt Popery;</hi> for had it
not been a <hi>Reſolve</hi> of a whole <hi>Cabal,</hi> 'tis hard to determine,
how all the <hi>Proteſtant Scriblers</hi> ſhould unanimouſly ſtumple
on the ſame Expedient.</p>
               <p>Out of the former <hi>Antecedent,</hi> my <hi>Author</hi> draws this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence:
When therefore</hi> Ignatius <hi>was to be promoted to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of a Saint, his Diſciples ſet their Inventions on the Rack, to
raiſe a Fund of Miracles.</hi> What ever the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Ignatius</hi>
did, I am ſure you have ſet your <hi>Brains on the Rack,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
to boot, to find ſome plauſible Grounds for denying
them: But all will not do your Work. You tell us, indeed,
They were <hi>Feign'd without ground:</hi> This is a groundleſs Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
and of no Force with me, till you propoſe ſome good
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66115:23"/>
                  <hi>Authority,</hi> beſides your <hi>Own.</hi> I grant indeed, that <hi>Miracles may
be eaſily obtruded upon the World, after a long diſtance of Time;
and that nothing leſs than a ſtrict Examination, can defeat the
Hopes of Impoſtors.</hi> But I alſo contend, that all the <hi>Miracles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Bull of his <hi>Canonization,</hi> have undergone this <hi>Teſt</hi>
to the utmoſt Rigour: And therefore I am oblig'd, in reaſon,
rather to conclude, That you are deceiv'd, who <hi>Deny</hi> Them;
than thoſe Judicious Perſons, who <hi>Approv'd</hi> Them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But here the</hi> Gentleman <hi>offers a very material Proof, to the
falſity of the</hi> Miracles <hi>aſcrib'd to St.</hi> Ignatius: <hi>Ribadeneira,</hi> who
was his familiar Companion, in the Year 1572 firſt publiſh'd his
Life, and made along Apology in it, in defence of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining.
That it was no way derogatory to his Sanctity, that he had
perform'd no Miracles. Afterwards, in the Year 1610. publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Second Edition of his Life, he was ſo far enlightned in this
Matter, that he giveth us a long Catalogue of the Miracles of
<hi>Ignatius;</hi> but withal confeſſeth, That the Reaſon why he had not
inſerted them in the Firſt Edition, was, Becauſe they were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
certain and unconteſted. <hi>Becauſe I have not the</hi> Firſt
Edition <hi>by me, I will acquieſce to what the</hi> Gentleman <hi>ſays:
But, What then? Is it impoſſible, that Matters of Fact, which
for want of Examination, were doubtful in the Year 1572. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an exact Trial afterward, ſhould be found true in</hi> 1610?
<hi>According to this Rule, a great part of your</hi> Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>might be plac'd among the</hi> Apocrypha: <hi>For you muſt
grant me, that moſt, if not every Book of the</hi> New Teſtament
<hi>was call'd in queſtion, immediately after the Deceaſe of the</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<hi>and ſome not receiv'd till many</hi> Centuries <hi>after. Now, might
not a</hi> Jew <hi>take up your Argument, and oppoſe it to the</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>juſt as you oppoſe it to</hi> Miracles? It cannot be imagin'd,
how the genuine Writings of the Apoſtles, who dy'd in the Firſt
Century, ſhould be unknown, or at leaſt uncertain, when the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of them were yet freſh; and, after above an Hundred Years,
when the greateſt Part of the Witneſſes muſt be ſuppos'd to have
been dead, ſhould be advanc'd to undoubted Certainty. <hi>Wind your
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66115:23"/>
ſelf out of this</hi> Labyrinth, <hi>and I ſhall eaſily diſ-engage my ſelf
from That you imagin to have caſt me in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot paſs on, without one ſmall <hi>Reflection</hi> on our <hi>Author</hi>'s
way of Arguing: <hi>Firſt,</hi> He tells us, <hi>That Papiſts eſteem it a
Virtue, to lie for the Credit of an Order. Secondly,</hi> He advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
a Step forward, and tells us, <hi>He has juſt Reaſon to ſuſpect,
that they have put that Principle in practice, by forging the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Part of the Miracles (aſcrib'd to St.</hi> Ignatius) <hi>after his Death.</hi>
This he proves, becauſe <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> omitted to recount, for
want of ſufficient Teſtimony, thoſe <hi>Miracles</hi> in his <hi>Firſt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which he ſets down in his <hi>Second; Item,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Maſſeius
leaves out many other wonderful Actions, for that they are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
certain.</hi> Now, for my part, I ſhould draw a quite contrary
<hi>Concluſion,</hi> from the Cautiouſneſs of theſe Two Writers, <hi>viz.</hi>
That they did not intend, for the Honour of their <hi>Founder,</hi> to
impoſe on the <hi>Readers;</hi> nor to augment their own <hi>Sins,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s <hi>Miracles.</hi> For, let me tell you, People of
ſo looſe <hi>Principles,</hi> as the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> paſs for in your Judgment,
would never have minc'd the matter; eſpecially when a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Miracles</hi> would have much enhanc'd the Glory of their
<hi>Saint,</hi> and not added one Grain to their <hi>Labour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> I ſhould be glad, did you make uſe of the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs
of the Two fore-mention'd <hi>Writers;</hi> and lay no <hi>Crimes</hi>
on <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> but thoſe which were <hi>ſufficiently cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and unconteſted.</hi> Your <hi>Auditors</hi> would leave their <hi>Pews</hi>
more calmly, and feel more <hi>Charity</hi> in their <hi>Breaſts</hi> at the End
of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> and leſs <hi>Animoſity</hi> againſt their <hi>Fellow-Subjects.</hi>
But a Calm and Serene <hi>Seaſon,</hi> is bad Weather for the <hi>Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
to Fiſh in. They delight in <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Tempeſts,</hi> meerly out
of Hopes, that both will fall heavy on the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> Theſe
Holy <hi>Conjurers</hi> raiſe the Wind in the <hi>Pulpits,</hi> which ſoon breaks
out of the <hi>Church-Door,</hi> and ſpreads its ſelf through the whole
<hi>Town</hi> in a Trice. All raiſe this <hi>Devil</hi> of <hi>Diſcord</hi> the ſame way:
And, by good Fortune, no <hi>Text</hi> is ſo remote, which does not

the greateſt <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Example: In the <hi>Art of Miſſionaries Diſcover'd,</hi>
the <hi>Author</hi> preſents his <hi>Reader</hi> with one Father <hi>Leech;</hi> who
told Mr. <hi>Gee, That if any but hear Maſs, and after hearing be
ſprinkled with Holy Water, and kiſs the Prieſt's Garment, he
could not commit that Day any Mortal Sin.</hi> Here is a pretty Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
you ſee, affirm'd by Mr. <hi>Gee;</hi> yet it muſt be believ'd, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his <hi>Infallible Authority:</hi> Although, in my <hi>Conſcience,</hi> I think
it ten times more improbable, That a <hi>Catholick Prieſt,</hi> in his
Wits, ſhould vent a <hi>Doctrine</hi> ſo notoriouſly falſe, than that the
<hi>Saints</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> ſhould, by <hi>GOD's</hi> Aſſiſtance, work <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again:</hi> The Jeſuites give their <hi>General</hi> an Account of all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
of State, in thoſe Provinces and Kingdoms, whereof they
are the Reſpective Aſſiſtants: To which End they have Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents
in the Principal Cities of all Kingdoms; who ſending
all their Informations to the General, they balance the Intereſts of
every Prince; and then reſolve, That the Affairs of ſuch a Prince
ſhall be promoted, the Deſign of Another oppos'd, <hi>&amp;c. Now, that</hi>
Jeſuites <hi>ſhould have</hi> Kingdoms <hi>thus in a String, is no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
in it ſelf, than that</hi> Ignatius <hi>ſhould work ſtrange Cures;
and yet</hi> That <hi>muſt be ſwallow'd down by the greedy</hi> Reader,
<hi>and</hi> This <hi>rejected; although the Latter be atteſted by Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Witneſſes, <hi>and the Former rely on the Authority of a</hi> Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain;
<hi>who Compos'd a Book againſt the</hi> Jeſuites, <hi>of the ſame
Stamp with the</hi> Salamanca-Narrative.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:66115:24"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the <hi>Preface</hi> after a late <hi>Challenge to Mr. Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
(as full of <hi>Rhodomontado's,</hi> as the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
ſent the <hi>Emperour;</hi> not doubting but ſuch bluſtering Language
would ſtrike Mr. <hi>Poulton</hi> dumb:) <hi>I do not,</hi> ſays the Author,
<hi>much expect an Anſwer to this Challenge; for thoſe Men who could
lie near Twenty Years under ſuch a Charge, as Dr.</hi> Du Moulin <hi>laid
againſt Them; and dar'd Them to call him to an Account for the
Murder of King</hi> Charles the Firſt, <hi>without ever venturing to clear
Themſelves, may eaſily bear This.</hi> Here the <hi>Mobile</hi> is deſir'd to
believe as firmly as any Part of the <hi>Bible,</hi> That the <hi>Jeſuites</hi>
Murder'd the <hi>King;</hi> That <hi>Cromwel</hi> was a rank <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and the
<hi>Parliament</hi> a Pack of the ſame <hi>Society.</hi> Now, I am of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That any Honeſt Man, before he can ſwallow down this
<hi>Article,</hi> muſt renounce all <hi>Senſe,</hi> as much as any <hi>Papiſt</hi> does,
to believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> Yet down it muſt, under Pain
(at leaſt) of paſſing for a <hi>Papiſt in Maſquerade.</hi> Read <hi>Bouhours</hi>
from one End to the other, and then tell me, Whether any <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
related of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> be not twenty Degrees more Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible?
And therefore, if this <hi>Calumny</hi> muſt gain Credit, Why
<hi>They</hi> muſt deſerve none? For my part, if we may gueſs at
the Future by the Paſt, Ten Years will turn the <hi>Convocation</hi>
of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> into a <hi>White-Horſe-Conſultation;</hi> and thoſe <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who were ſo Zealous,
as to tell His <hi>Majeſty, They thought His Proceeding to be Illegal,</hi>
will be Metamorphos'd into <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> Such a Change
is eaſily wrought: One <hi>Miniſter,</hi> with an Ounce of <hi>Braſs</hi> on
his Face, and a well-hung <hi>Tongue</hi> in his Mouth, will carry
the Metamorphoſe a great way; and then, <hi>One I was told ſo,</hi>
concludes the Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He tells his <hi>Readers,</hi> (p. 42.) <hi>That beſides <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
and Divines, who teach the Lawfulneſs of Calumnies, and falſe
Reports, we find it, among other Rules of the</hi> Jeſuites, <hi>That they
ſhould be ſure, to put this Doctrine in Practice, even againſt thoſe
of their own Communion, the Antient Orders of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66115:25"/>
The Rule is, Let their Faults be diligently noted, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
as dangerous to the Publick Peace.</hi> This is told us by
a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who challenges all the World to ſhew, in his
whole <hi>Book,</hi> one falſe <hi>Quotation:</hi> Yet I have read the <hi>Jeſuites
Rules</hi> more than once, from one End to the other; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
before <hi>GOD</hi> and Man, there is not to be found one Tittle
of this. So that, let the <hi>Gentleman</hi> make Ten Thouſand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
of his <hi>Sincerity</hi> more than he has, I will rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrought <hi>Miracles,</hi> than that This is true. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
he cites <hi>Inſtructio Secret.</hi> &amp;c. but they are no more our
<hi>Rules,</hi> than His. They were Compos'd by a <hi>Villain,</hi> who was
reſolv'd to make <hi>Jeſuites</hi> appear as black as Himſelf, and are
eſpous'd by a Man of the ſame Temper. If they really were
found in a <hi>College,</hi> as is pretended, make it out, and that They
are our <hi>Rules:</hi> If not, under favour, you are guilty of thoſe
very <hi>Crimes</hi> you aſcribe to the <hi>Jeſuites:</hi> For 'tis, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
no leſs a <hi>Crime</hi> to fling a <hi>Slander,</hi> made by Another, on
our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> than to forge One.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To demonſtrate the Slandering Vein of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> he
brings <hi>(p.</hi> 61.) a freſh and very material Inſtance; viz. <hi>No longer
ſince than the Winter 1685. a Report went current through all
the Countries in</hi> England, <hi>where there are many</hi> Romaniſts, <hi>That
Dr.</hi> Burnet <hi>was at</hi> Rome <hi>become a</hi> Papiſt; and, <hi>That great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
were beſtow'd upon him.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Calumny,</hi> without doubt,
not to be born, that a Perſon ſo Famous for <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as that
<hi>Reverend Divine,</hi> ſhould be ſnatch'd, againſt his Will, from that
<hi>Church,</hi> which had taught him <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Higher Powers</hi> in
ſo Superlative a manner, that they thought it convenient to
recompence it with <hi>Outlawry.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> if <hi>Catholicks</hi> were
ſo Credulous, on the Receipt of <hi>Foreign Letters,</hi> as to believe it,
I make an <hi>Apology</hi> for their Miſtake; although I am apter to
believe, that when that <hi>Gentleman</hi> began to kick againſt the
<hi>Government,</hi> and to ſhew ſome <hi>Ferguſon</hi>-Tricks, the <hi>Proteſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Gentry</hi>
of thoſe Counties you mention, thought it convenient
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66115:25"/>
to heave him out of Their <hi>Communion</hi> into Ours; to the end,
that the next <hi>Age</hi> might bind-up his <hi>Life</hi> among Thoſe of the
<hi>Popiſh Rebels.</hi> My Conjecture ſtands on better ground than
Yours, or than any of your <hi>Friends</hi> Exceptions againſt the
<hi>Miracles</hi> of St. <hi>Ignatius.</hi> Seeing now we are fallen on the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
of <hi>Tale-telling,</hi> I cannot omit to put my <hi>Story</hi> in among
the reſt, that the World may ſee, how eaſily <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſlip
into the Vice of <hi>Credulity,</hi> as well as <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> when the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
takes them: <q>When the Happy News of Her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s
being with Child was ſpread abroad, and all <hi>Loyal Subjects</hi>
teſtify'd their Interior <hi>Joy</hi> by outward <hi>Acclamations;</hi> ſome
incredulous Perſons, not convinc'd by the Decree of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Council</hi> for a <hi>Thanksgiving-Day,</hi> blaz'd abroad, That it was
a <hi>Sham:</hi> And yet this was ſo prevalent with ſome, that
they would not diſcredit it, till Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> Lay-in.</q> To theſe
People 'tis a Madneſs to obtrude <hi>Miracles;</hi> for, What <hi>Miracle</hi>
of <hi>CHRIST</hi> can be better atteſted, than Her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s being
with Child? Yet at the ſame time, as if they had made a Vow,
never to act like Men, they would ſcarce perſwade themſelves,
the <hi>Proteſtant-Duke</hi> was Dead. Which gave occaſion for theſe
Two Verſes:
<q>
                     <l>In the <hi>Whigg</hi>'s Creed, Two Articles are read,</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Queen</hi> is not with Child, nor <hi>Monmouth</hi> Dead.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, one Line from a <hi>Pulpit</hi> would have ſo far prevail'd on
them, as to have oblig'd many to take Horſe, to meet his <hi>Grace</hi>
at <hi>Taunton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>He deſires the</hi> Reader (p. 21.) <hi>to believe, that he
has not imitated the</hi> Scavenger, <hi>in ſtopping no where, but at
a Dunghil:</hi> For I have <hi>(ſays he)</hi> quoted none but allow'd and
approv'd Authors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as for what I have cited out of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Books, let them invalidate their Teſtimony, if they can:
I will engage for the Truth of my Quotations; and know of no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
againſt any Author I have cited, which are of any Force.</p>
               <p>You are, <hi>Sir,</hi> either in ſome <hi>Ecſtatick Tranſport,</hi> or elſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66115:26"/>
with that great Virtue, <hi>Ignorance,</hi> beyond Expreſſion;
which your <hi>Friend</hi> ſo highly commends in St. <hi>Ignatius.</hi> Were
not the <hi>Provincial Letters</hi> burnt by the publick Hang-man in
<hi>France?</hi> Did not <hi>La Pratique Morale</hi> run the ſame Fate in the
Year 1669? And is not this as real and material an <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
againſt the Validity and Sufficiency of thoſe <hi>Libels,</hi> as Mr.
<hi>Oats</hi>'s yearly Pillory, againſt the Authority of <hi>His,</hi> and his
<hi>Brethrens Narratives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you propoſe in your <hi>Second Part,</hi> (as you promiſe)
as convincing <hi>Reaſons</hi> againſt <hi>Miracles,</hi> as I have done againſt
the <hi>Credit</hi> of theſe Two <hi>Authors,</hi> I will come over to You.</p>
               <p>Again: Your <hi>Arcana Societatis Jeſu, Inſtructiones Secretae,</hi>
are Chips of the ſame Block; that is, Pieces forg'd with <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,</hi>
and cited with a daring <hi>Confidence:</hi> In a word, They
are of as great <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> as Thoſe who live by the
<hi>Basket,</hi> and receive <hi>Knight-hood</hi> from the <hi>Pillory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Had it been my Fortune to have been in <hi>London,</hi> ſome
Years ago, I would not have ſtood in your Way: I ſee, by the
<hi>Authority</hi> you give <hi>Varlets</hi> in Print, how you eſteem'd them
in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> and <hi>Old-Baily.</hi> Nay, I fear, that had the
Balance ſtood equal, you might have dropt in a ſingle Oath,
to raiſe a <hi>Jeſuite</hi>'s Neck into an Halter.</p>
               <p>Would Time permit me, I could give as good an Account
of ſome others of your <hi>Authorities,</hi> as I have of Theſe, and by
Conſequence of your <hi>Book;</hi> in which I find a Thouſand more
<hi>Impoſtures,</hi> than, I am ſure, can be found in Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s
<hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this Proceeding the Effect of a <hi>Frenzy,</hi> paſt the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Heblebore?</hi> Shall the profeſs'd Enemies of our <hi>Religion,</hi>
and <hi>Order,</hi> by the Omnipotent Power of a <hi>Defaming Faction,</hi>
be turn'd into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbyaſs'd Perſons, Subſtantial Witneſſes,</hi> &amp;c! And
ſhall their bare <hi>Words,</hi> without any Shadow of <hi>Proof,</hi> ſerve for
<hi>Evidence</hi> againſt Us, of all thoſe <hi>Calumnies,</hi> which took their
Being from <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Prejudice;</hi> and have no <hi>Reality,</hi> but in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66115:26"/>
the <hi>Imagination</hi> of Thoſe, whom confident <hi>Gown-Men</hi> maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
impoſe on. But when we recount any thing, in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of our <hi>Church,</hi> although back'd with irrefragable <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi>
preſently it muſt be ſlighted; as if all the <hi>Moral Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
in the World was confin'd to the narrow Compaſs of this
<hi>Iſland;</hi> or, as if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had engroſs'd all <hi>Truth</hi>
to its ſelf.</p>
               <p>And, now, 'tis high time to leave my <hi>Author,</hi> and <hi>Reader</hi>
too: Only, I muſt deſire the Latter to turn to <hi>E. W.</hi> Printed
at <hi>Antwerp</hi> in the Year 1676. and to the <hi>Second Letter</hi> by
<hi>A. B.</hi> in the Year 1672. In the Firſt you will find Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>'s
<hi>Exceptions</hi> againſt <hi>Miracles;</hi> in the Second, againſt
St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> fully Anſwer'd: For, I conceive,
the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Dean,</hi> is a full <hi>Reply</hi> to my <hi>Author;</hi> he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing material, but an higher-flown <hi>Impudence,</hi> which
is not borrow'd from the <hi>Doctor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, <hi>Dear Author,</hi> before we part, I admoniſh you friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to change your <hi>Method,</hi> if you intend to advance your
<hi>Church.</hi> A <hi>Burleſque</hi> is only to convince <hi>Fools; Wiſe Men</hi> are
led by <hi>Reaſon;</hi> of which you have been over-ſparing in your
<hi>Book:</hi> So that, if you intend to make any <hi>Progreſs,</hi> increaſe
<hi>This,</hi> and diminiſh <hi>That.</hi> And if you be over-confident,
that you have ſo much ſolid <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as to convince any one
of the <hi>Truth</hi> of your <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Corruption</hi> of <hi>Ours,</hi>
be pleas'd to bring your <hi>Reaſon</hi> to the Teſt. <hi>I promiſe you here,
on the Word of a Gentleman, That I will Meet you Where, and
with Whom you pleaſe:</hi> But it ſhall be upon this Condition,
That you promiſe to treat me more civilly, than the <hi>Divines</hi>
of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> did ſome time ago, a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who was call'd to
a Sick Perſon. I dare not venture to engage with <hi>Divines,</hi> who
have for <hi>Seconds</hi> a <hi>Populace;</hi> for, who knows, but They may
ſtrengthen the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s <hi>Arguments</hi> with <hi>Blows;</hi> and foul their
Hands to beſpatter <hi>Me,</hi> as their <hi>Leaders</hi> have the <hi>Preſs,</hi> to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66115:27"/>
Aſperſe my <hi>Religion.</hi> Bring then with You ſuch a <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>

ſolid <hi>Reaſon</hi> from loud <hi>Clamours,</hi> concluding <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms</hi>
