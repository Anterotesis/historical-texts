            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Alſo ſhewing, that though there be diverſity of Adminiſtrations, yet there is not diverſity of Lights and Spirits, by which they are miniſtred: And ſhewing by clear teſtimony what the more ſure Word of Propheſie is, which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the people to take heed unto, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day did dawne, and the day-ſtar ariſe in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Herein alſo is a falſe <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and a falſe teſtimony reproved; and a falſe witneſs is rejected, and an untimely birth caſt out, though for the time of Travel it might have been a monſter, being above two yeers; but in the end is brought forth for deſtruction; the name of him which hath ſo long travell'd to bring forth wind and confuſion, is one known in the City of <hi>London</hi> by the name of <hi>Iohn Iackſon;</hi> being by the truth of this following made manifeſt: That ſo by every motion of the Spirit of Truth, and every teſtimony given from it, Underſtanding and Knowledge of the Truth may be increaſed, in thoſe that follow on to know the LORD.</p>

            <p>THE Light is broken forth as the morning, and the health of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is in it, and is ſpringing forth ſpeedily, and the righteouſneſs of the righteous Seed is going forth before them, and the glory of the Lord is revealed to his Seed, which now calleth, and the Lord doth anſwer, Here am I; and the Lord hath made, and is making his Seed as a watered Garden, and like a ſpring of water, whoſe waters fail not; and is raiſing up the foundations of many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, that people may come to build again upon shat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Foundation which they have been driven from, eſpecially by their Paſtors: for ſaith the Lord, Many Paſtors have deſtroyed my Vinyard, they have trodden my Portion under foot, and made my pleaſant Portion a deſolate Wilderneſſe, and have made Gods Heritage as a ſpeckled Bird, the Birds round about are against her, and all the Beaſts of the Field come to devour, <hi>Jer. 12. 9, 10.</hi> And now is the Lord come forth againſt theſe devourers, even as a Lyon bereaved of her young ones: for the Lord will not ſuffer the ſpoyle of his Heritage no longer, but will dreſſe his Vinyard that it may bring forth fruit unto him: And now is the Lord caſting out the blind Vatchmen, and the fooliſh Prophets which have followed their own ſpirit, and have ſeen nothing, and all ſuch is the Lord caſting out, and his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire is he kindling amongſt them: And now I hear a cry of torment go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the Nation: Can any kindle a fire among Serpents, and they not be offended and shut their ſtings? Can any touch the Vipers but they will ſmell with venom? and when Scorpions are trodden upon, will they not shew forth their strength?

            <head>TO THE READER</head>
            <p>MEN of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lye; and the heart of man is deſperately wicked and deceitful above all things. Hear this ye wiſe men and fooliſh; the more ye ſtrive againſt the Lord, the more is your wound made incurable; and the higher you riſe in envy, alwaies the deeper is your fall in confuſion. And now Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader, whoſe heart God hath opened to ſee and behold the things that be eternal, and can truly diſcern of different cauſes, and between the good and the evil, and between the light and the darkneſſe. This Book is ſent forth in the purſute, and after a Book called, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David, &amp;c.</hi> by a nameleſſe Author, whoſe work indeed was hardly worthy of an honeſt mans Name, though very ſubtilly &amp; craftily he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes his purpoſe, &amp; traverſes his ſteps ful cunningly, as this worlds wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom could guide him, in which wiſdom he cannot know or receive the things of God; &amp; therefore it cannot be expected that the things of God ſhould be received from that wiſdom; and though he hath confounded in his words his deſcription of the Light of Chriſt, ſometimes ſpeaking well of it, and ſometimes otherwiſe, and not knowing hardly whereof he hath affirmed; his words are ſo counfounded and mixed in his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt reaſon, in giving forth his knowledge of the things of God, which he ſeems to be ignorant of, but onely as he hath the knowledge of them from the Letter, by which no man can come to the knowledge of God, nor of the things of his Kingdom without the revelation of the Spirit of Jeſus, and the opperation of the ſame ſpirit: But friends, the teſtimony of God ſtands ſure for ever, though men would confound it in their own reaſon: And this is the teſtimony, <hi>That Chriſt lighteth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that cometh into the world, which light is ſufficient to lead every man to God, or elſe to condemn every man from God;</hi> and this teſtimony is true, notwithſtanding all the oppoſition againſt it; and it ſhall abide ſure for ever, though men ſtrive never ſo much in the gain-ſaying of it: And this is the teſtimony which we have born and ſhall bear to the end, and who believes it, and who believes it not, this is the hand of the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure, and to him we leave it, and ſo we do, and muſt clear our conſciences from time to time, while the Lord gives us a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And herein we are a good ſavour to God, and our reward is with him, whether Iſrael be gathered or no, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. And alſo this nameleſſe Author, which is ſuppoſed to be one <hi>Iohn Iackson,</hi> known in this City, hath taken ſome ſeeming occaſion againſt us by ſearching our Books, and (as he ſaith) hath found ſome contradictions in them, which may
<pb facs="tcp:114965:3"/>
appeare to be ſo to his dark mind; yet in the ſight of the ſpirit of the Lord that is truth which he ſees to be no other then error: However, this is ſent forth for the true information of peoples minds, that they may know that truth is bold and confident, and that it is Armor which defendeth from all enemies, and giveth ſtrength to anſwer the craftineſſe of men. And this ſame <hi>Iohn Iackson</hi> hath ſhewed himſelf now to be one with the common Prieſts of the world, for as they have done, ſo hath he; oppoſed the way and people of God, and with the very ſame Arguments, ſhewing that he is of the very ſame ſpirit with them, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and arguments being of the ſame nature as theirs are; yea, he hath ſhewed himſelf to be of the very ſame ſpirit with all the open prophane wretches which doth revile, and ſcorn, and abuſe, in every town and countrey the Lords people; and as they do ſo, ſo hath he writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with ſubtil Arguments, to the very ſame end as they reproach and ſcorn, (to wit) in a deriſion, and deſpiſing the way and ſervants of the Lord; ſo that his ſelf-ſeparation is now ſeen what it is, to be a very cheat and hypocriſie, who while he profeſſeth a ſeparation from the world, doth practice the very ſame wickedneſſe, and is not changed from them in nature, though he be in appearance: But what a poor work hath he brought forth in two years time? which he ſaith his work hath been as Embres raked up in aſhes, yet a work that gains no praiſe of God, nor very little of the praiſe of any man: It ſeems he hath hatched miſchief upon his bed, and brought it forth in the morning: Who would have thought but a wiſe man in that time would have brought forth a larger peece, and more to purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am ſure he might have made better uſe of his time in another exerciſe, then to have writ againſt the ſervants of the Lord: It had been more honeſt for him to have ſet his Pen to Paper, and ſtudyed to have given his teſtimony againſt the pride, and drunkenneſſe, and oppreſſion, and whoredoms, and wickedneſſe in this great City. I ſay, it had been more honeſt, and liker a Saint, to have ſought the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of prophaneneſſe and wickedneſſe that greatly abounds in this City, then to have ſtudyed two years to bring forth his invented ſtuffe againſt a harmleſſe and innocent people, which he, nor any, can juſtly charge with evil, but as he hath digged deep by his imaginations, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting a ſeeming-contradiction out of our writings, which is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, no more then Chriſts words are, who ſaith, <hi>Except ye eat my flesh, and drink my blood, ye have no life in you;</hi> and yet in the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſaith, <hi>The flesh profits nothing:</hi> and for <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to go with the word of the Lord to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to tell him he ſhould dye and not live; yet in the ſame inſtant of time, told him he ſhould live and not dye: Would not <hi>Iohn Iackson</hi> have counted theſe contradictions? But what he hath done in this, in ſending forth a Book againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he hath been ſo far from beating down ſin, drunkards, and rude ſcorners, and abuſive men that he hath fully ſtrengthened their hands, and the wickedſt people in this Nation are very glad of his work: He hath given them matter to oppoſe truth withall; but his reward and theirs ſhall be both with one

            <p>Now the teſtimony which this Author gives to that which after a long travel is come forth, is this, that it hath been in his breſt two years and upwards, while it at length is come forth as an untimely birth, or as that which is born out of due time, labouring under the burden of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both unneceſſary and unſeaſonable.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114965:5"/>So the burden of this man is ſearched, &amp; Judged, and found not to be the burthen of the word of the Lord, though he thought it to be ſo, when in him he felt the fire of enmity, boyling and bubling up within him, as in his Epiſtle; But we have found it to be ſuch a burthen as the falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prophets in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did ſee for the people, which was falſe burthens, and cauſes of baniſhment, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 14. But if the fire of the Lord had been kindled in him, it would have conſumed this birth in the womb, before ever it had been brought forth.</p>
            <p>But the hour is comeing and now is, in which the Lord is fulfilling his promiſe according to the Scriptures, which ſaith, that he will make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a burthenſome ſtone for all people, all that burthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it ſhall be cut in peices, though all the people upon the earth be gathered together againſt it, <hi>Zac.</hi> 12. 3.

               <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. 40. So this is written that no man ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more burthen themſelves with the burthenſome ſtone, wereby they will be broken to peices if they fall upon it: But that every one may come to it, that with it they may ſee their falſe burthens, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſiely beſet them, and may ceaſe grieving of the ſpirit of the Lord, while his ſpirit ſtriveth with them; &amp; may come to know

            <p>Therefore then ſeeing that it is an untimely birth, and not that which is born of the ſprit which is come forth from him to whom I now am to ſpeak. Now leaſt others being in the ſame blindneſſe with him, think as he doth, that it is a true voice, or <hi>Hoſana to the Son of David,</hi> or a true teſtimony to the Lords Chriſt, I ſhall weigh his teſtimony, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the true Voice is gone forth both in the dayes of his fleſh, and ſince, in which dayes he was truly declared to be the light of the world, and the true light which lightneth every one that cometh into the world, <hi>Ioh. 1. 9.

Now they were not without the ſpirit of a man, for then they could not be a man, as he ſaith: now if they had the Spirit of man, and Reaſon, and if this was all eye, how was it that they ſaw nothing, when he ſaith, <hi>It ſees all things?</hi> ſo it is not a true teſtimony of the <hi>Light,</hi> nor of the <hi>Lords Chriſt:</hi> But the ſpirit of man is the Candle of the Lord, and the Lord having light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, then it ſearcheth the inward parts of the belly: And <hi>David,</hi> who knew what the ſpirit of man was, and what a Candle was without light, and what it was when it was lighted, he ſaid, <hi>For thou wilt light my can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, the Lord my God will enlighten my darkneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to ſay there is the diſcovery of ſin and iniquity where the ſound of Chriſt as a door, the light the way hath not been, this remains to be proved, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>the ſound is gone into all the Earth, and the words to the end of the world:</hi> Have they not all heard? Yes verily: That which makes manifeſt is light; Is there light making ſin manifeſt, and is there nothing of Chriſt, ſeeing that his life is the light of men, and that men have no light but what proceeds from his life? When was ever Chriſt and the light, which diſcovers ſin, ſeparated? and where is that Scripture which ſaith, That the ſound of Chriſt, as a light, hath never been heard where ſin and iniquity is diſcovered; but that which hath brought forth theſe things may well be called an untimely birth, which never ſaw the Son, nor never knew the light which Chriſt hath enlightened every man withal which cometh into the world, for a little of this fruit doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that tree from whence it ſprings, and ſo we ſhall judge the tree by its fruits: Another fruit from this tree is to give his teſtimony of the Law of Faith, which is this:</p>

as all, who conſider thy teſtimony of the law of Faith, in ſaying, that the diſcovery thereof ariſeth from what is without; and that it had never been known, nor never thought of, nor never would it, or could it ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally have come into the heart of man to have conceived ſuch a thing, but from the Declaration of God in his promiſe: Here it doth appear Faith is a Myſtery to thee, and thy eye have not ſeen it, nor the ear heard, neither hath it entered into thy heart to conceive Faith in the working and operation of it: And in that thou ſaieſt well, that it was not given thee to underſtand how it is written upon every mans heart; and thou had done well if thou had not ſtretched thy ſelf beyond the line of thy knowledge and underſtanding, for thou thy ſelf confeſſeſt that unto thoſe firſt beleevers, <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Moſes, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Daniel,</hi> and the reſt, there was communicated unto them a Spirit of Faith, and a Light ſutable and proportionable, whereby they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to behold Chriſt, who was the object of their Faith: Then if it did ariſe from the Spirit of Faith within them, and the light of Chriſt, who was the Author of their faith, it did not ariſe from the Declaration of God in the promiſe without, ſo that the myſtery of faith which is held in a pure conſcience is yet to be learned, which was witneſſed amongſt the Saints: So when thou writes again of the Law of Works, or the law of Faith, or the diſcovery which the Lord maketh to his creature, under the diverſities of theſe adminiſtrations, keep back to the meaſure of the gift of God, and then will thy teſtimony be no larger than thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is a guilt hath ſpread over many in theſe dayes; But this I ſay, Bleſſed is the man which doth not condemne himſelf in the thing which he alloweth, and which doth not deſtroy himſelf with the breath of his own mouth.

            <p>Again, concerning the Light which every man is enlightned withal, which is thy ſtumbling block, and rock of offence, as it is unto all the reſt whoſe deeds are evil; Thou ſaieth, God hath not annointed it to that work, nor laid the weight of eternal Salvation upon the ſhoulders thereof, it being too weak for that ſervice.</p>

But wo unto the world becauſe of offences; if any have the ſpirit of a King, let them ſearch out the cauſe of the offence which is now broken forth amongſt the children of men, that the enmity which is in all ſorts of people, of all profeſſions, ſhould riſe up together, and become a body, the wicked joyning hand in hand, preaching, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and crying for unity, which they are making up of enmity, that they may be ſtrong againſt that which the Lord hath now brought forth in his light and power to be witneſſes unto him in every place whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he doth call them, witneſſing forth his mercy and truth, by which iniquity is purged out; and preaching the Goſpel freely to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby they may come to the knowledge of the truth, that they may be ſaved: But in the world it is ſo come to paſſe in theſe dayes, that he that can but give reviling terms and hard ſpeeches againſt the light which Chriſt hath enlightned every man withall, calling it natural, or inſufficient; and if they do but revile thoſe which they call <hi>Quakers,</hi> and put this in the beginning of his Book, then it paſſeth with toleration, and have as good approbation from the world as any of the Prieſts have for their Miniſtry: but if any man begin to ſpeak of the light within, and the annointing within, and the word of faith in the heart, and of the myſtery of faith in a pure conſcience, and of the ſprinkling of the heart from an evil conſcience, and of believing in the light, as <hi>Christ</hi> ſaid, ſuch a one ſpeaking of theſe things, and not directing his ſpeech in open reproach againſt them called <hi>Quakers,</hi> the peoples hearts will be filled with jealouſie, leſt he be one. So that even the light is become a reproach unto them, and their diriſion daily, but the Lords hand is turned againſt all ſuch, and he is turning the wiſe men backward, and making their wiſdom become fooliſhneſs; For once there was a ſeeking after light in many, that it might riſe, and open the things of God unto them, and reveal the myſteries of his life, whereby their ſouls might be ſatisfied; and now when it is riſen in many, and hath brought forth its powerful effects; now the man of ſin hath his time, and doth prevail in many to make them believe, that it is not the light which is able to ſave the ſouls of them which believe in it, and doth beget a ſpirit of jealouſie in them which is ſtronger than death; and begetteth a fear in them, which worketh torment: and many now doth fear, and are jealous, that that light is not the Chriſt which hath enlightened them, and every one which cometh into the world, and this is the work of Satan in the hearts of the diſobedient, which as every one comes to obey his light, and to anſwer his perfect love to them which is manifeſt in the light, that fear will be caſt out, and life will be given to that witneſs of God which once did breath after his life, without which the ſoul cannot reſt, nor be ſatisfied; and this ſhall many come to witneſs, as the man of ſin comes to be revealed, which letteth, and will let, until he be taken out of the

Another effect is, That it convinceth of all ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and is a Teacher and Director, teaching and directing in righteouſneſſe, purity, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the light is but one in him that loves it, and in him that hates it, leading the one to God, from whence it comes, to receive eternal life, and condemning the other from God becauſe he obeyeth not the truth, that he might be ſaved. And this is the teſtimony of truth which is now held forth, never to be denyed: But who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved our report? even they to whom the Arm of the Lord is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And this is the way by which people may come to know the truth of this teſtimony, by obeying the light which Chriſt hath enlightned them withall, thereby ſhall they know whether this Doctrine be of God, or whether we ſpeak of ourſelves, and whether all thoſe effects is not brought forth by the working of Chriſts light in them; and then they

ſhall not believe onely becauſe of our words, nor be envious againſt it becauſe of others words, but will finde the teſtimony in themſelves, which is according to the record which God hath given of his Son, and according to the teſtimony which we have given of the light; and he that believeth ſhall be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Now that which oppoſeth this, is that which beareth a teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>For this end was I born, and for this end came I into the world, to bear witneſſe unto the truth; and every one that is of the truth heareth my voice, Ioh.</hi> 18. 37. And this was his witneſſe, and his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers witneſſe, <hi>That he was the Light of the world,</hi> and, <hi>That this is the true light which hath enlightned every man that cometh into the world, Ioh. 8. 12. Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. And this contrary teſtimony which is brought forth is this, <hi>That it is the ſpirit of man that is the light which hath enlightned every man;</hi> and ſo going about to prove the ſpirit of man not to be ſufficient, under this would deſtroy the ſufficiency of the light of Chriſt. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures never did give teſtimony that the ſpirit of man was the light of the world; neither did we ever ſay that this light was the ſpirit of every man, nor a natural light: And therefore this man which hath writ a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume in proving a natural light, or mans reaſon inſufficient, let all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple take notice what he contradicts, or diſproves by it; he doth not by it contradict nor diſprove any thing that we have ſaid, for we never did affirm that mans reaſon was the light; but he hath laboured to contradict himſelf: He hath ſet up an Image, and then glories in breaking of it down, &amp; from our words draws a falſe inference, and glories in confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it: And this is the general courſe of our oppoſers, to raiſe a falſe propoſition or concluſion from their own imaginations, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it, and then cry, <hi>The Quakers contradicted, or confuted, and their Doctrine diſproved, and they irrecoverably ſlain;</hi> and many ſuch cryes is gone forth in the world among people, like the noiſe of many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, Nay, they are not of ſuch a birth that they are ſo eaſily ſlain, nor of ſuch a Doctrine that they are ſo eaſily diſproved; for the immortal birth is brought forth, unto which God hath given wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding to be as wiſe as Serpents, and in their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is their wiſdom brought forth, which Seed inheriteth the ſtrength of the Almighty: ſo though they be permitted to fight and contend againſt the truth, yet to prevail is not given them: Therefore in vain is the Net ſpread in the ſight of any Bird, and in vain do they exerciſe their ſtrength againſt the Lords annointed; for this which they have brought forth is but as ſetting of bryars and thorns in battel againſt the Lord or as if the untimely birth ſhould ſtrive againſt that birth which is brought forth without deformity, to ſlay it, as thoſe in former ages, who were wiſer in their generation then the children of light, ſought to ſlay the Heir, that the Inheritance might be theirs. In like manner do men now alſo riſe up againſt the life of the ſame Seed which is riſen in the hearts of the children of men, to ſlay it, that ſo they may profeſſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114965:13"/>
in their high ſwelling words of vanity, having mens perſons in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration becauſe of advantage: for if this Seed doth live which the Lord hath not onely brought to the birth, but alſo brought forth, it will ſtop that profeſſion which ſtands in the hypocriſie, and will quench that violence of fire in which that zeal flames out, which is not according to knowledge: But the Seed is riſen which inherits the ſtrength of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, which can bear all things, and ſuffer all things, and will come to reign over all gainſayers; for all the high ſwelling words of vanity ſhall come to nought, and truth ſhall be exalted over all, in the power of the eternal Spirit, when blackneſſe of darkneſs will cover all thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which have ſpent their ſtrength againſt the appearance and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of truth; and thoſe that now boaſt themſelves in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption againſt the ſervants of the Lord, and teſtimony of truth, <hi>Shall come to be a ſervant of ſervants, even to the leaſt in the kingdom of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have right unto that which they now profeſs, or before they be counted worthy to cry</hi> Hoſanna <hi>to the ſon of</hi> David, <hi>or to bear a teſtimony to the Lords Chriſt; For he will have none ſuch to be his witneſſes, as deny his light which he hath enlightened every man withal: For the true witneſſes bear this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Christ, That he is the true light, and is the light of the world, which hath enlightened every man that cometh into the world, that every man through him might bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Another Accuſation is againſt <hi>Richard Farnſworth,</hi> for ſaying, <hi>That Chriſt did break the Paſſeover with his Diſciples, and herein he is Charged to want Light; or, that the light in him was not ſufficient in him to open this, and that he did not diſcern between the Paſſeover, and the Supper of the Lord:</hi> And likewiſe is Accuſed, for <hi>calling that a Shadow, which the Scripture ſaith was but to shew the Lords death till he came.</hi>

Matth.</hi> 26. 20, 21, 22. and that which they eat he broke: but it doth not ſay, That he broke his bones, nor eat his bones; yet he eat the Paſſeover with his Diſciples. And whereas he is accuſed for calling that a ſhadow, and many now, in imitation, take bread and wine, and call that the Lords Supper, oppoſing thoſe that are come to the ſubſtance, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the ſubſtance, eating that which is meat indeed, and drinking that which is drink indeed; But this man which doth oppoſe <hi>Richard Farnſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> and others, in theſe things, he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h the leaſt reaſon to mention this Supper, or the breaking of Bread of any, for others do call their breaking of bread, and drinking of wine, the Lords Supper, becauſe they practiſe it: But this man doth neither practiſe that as the Lords Supper, nor witneſs the ſubſtance, ſo that this is the greateſt hypocriſie, To contend about that, or to accuſe others, in denying of that which he

            <p>
               <hi>Another Accuſation is againſt theſe two Writers,</hi> Richard Farnſworth, <hi>and</hi> Francis Howgill, <hi>as if they should be in an unreconciled Difference; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one hath affirmed, That the light of Chriſt is ſufficient to open all the Scriptures: And the other ſaith, Thou that tells of opening Chapters or Verſes by meanings, thou never heard a word of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are not Differences; for the light of Chriſt and mans meanings are contrary: So for the one to ſay, the light doth open; and the other to ſay, mans meanings doth not open, this is not contrary: So the confuſion is turned again to the Accuſer, and doth not belong to theſe two Writers: So the ignorance of this Accuſer is to be taken notice of, which would make people believe things that is not: For if he write his Book for thoſe that can neither read, ſee, nor hear, his labour is in vain: and if he write it to thoſe that can read, ſee, hear, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, they will account it fooliſhneſs, eſpecially in this day, when the light of life is broken forth among the children of men, to give them an underſtanding according to truth, for in this day, he that keepeth ſilence is reputed wiſe; and better is he that keepeth ſilence, than he that ſpeaks, unleſs the ſpirit of the Lord give him utterance.</p>

May he only be called Chriſt unto whom the Father hath given the Heathen for his inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion, who reigneth, and hath all his enemies under his feet, and is not he the ſame as he is deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, and which took upon him the form of a ſervant? So therefore that none may err in their judgments concerning the teſtimony which is given of Chriſt, and of his light, his light is more or leſs according to his manifeſtation in every one, there being given to every one a manifeſtation of the ſpirit to profit withal, and every one is to be turned to the meaſure of their manifeſtation, to know and witneſs Chriſt in it, though in many it be but as a little light, yet they are to be turned unto it, while it is ſo, which as it doth encreaſe, and is enlarged, it may be called, or declared under another name than little, as the kingdom of Heaven is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes like unto a grain of muſtard-ſeed, nor as a little leaven, but comes to rule in the children of men: And whereas the Accuſer replieth againſt the light, and againſt Chriſt to be the word of Faith; ſaying, Chriſt is called the Word of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 13. but not the Word of Faith; and yet ſaith in <hi>page</hi> 45. That Chriſt is the Author and finiſher of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If Chriſt be the Word of God, and faith come by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God, then how is it that he is not the word of Faith, being that word by which Faith comes when it is heard, and he being the Author of it? May he not then as well be called the Word of it, as the Author of it, ſeeing he is the Word by which it comes: but that all may underſtand what this word of faith was which the Apoſtle preached, This was Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and they preached no other Word to be the Word of faith but Chriſt, That whoſoever believed on him ſhould not be aſhamed: So that if the ignorance of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles words, were blotted out of the hearts of our Accuſers, they would be ſilent, and the daylie reproach would ceaſe.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is affirmed by us, That the Light, or a meaſure of Chriſt within, is a ſure Word of Propheſie, or a more ſure Word of Propheſie, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
