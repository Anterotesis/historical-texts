            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HOw great and dangerous a Mutinie hapned lately in part
of the Army, is not unknown to the Nation. How
great, and manifold miſeries were thereby threatned unto
the languiſhing Common-Wealth is beyond expreſſion:
This mutinous and turbulent ſpirit that was amongſt us, not being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
within the quarters of one Regiment, but diffuſed (like evill
blood through the veines) into many Regiments of the Army: wherein
this diſcontented humor hath infected divers. I having had too much
experience, by bearing too great a part in this diſcontented Rebellion)
ſhall do what I can to diſcover unto the world both the Cauſes and
effects thereof; that by the manifeſtation of the weakneſs of the ground-work,
and by the declaration of the hideous conſequences: men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
undeceived, They who are any way intangled, may be recovered,
out of that dangerous and deſtructive Faction; They who are yet free
may have their thoughts prevented, That dangers of like nature may
be anticipated, and a right underſtanding ſetled. That Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Love and Concord, may knit and unite the joynts of this preſent
Army ſo together, that neither open enemy, or pretended friend, may
be able by force or flattery to devide it.</p>
            <p>The firſt, and great occaſion of this unexpected Mutiny, was this:
Our Regiments, with ſome others, were by Lot deſigned for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Service we granted both very honourable, and
alſo neceſſary, for the prevention of War, and ſetling of Peace in this
Nation: Yet did we beleeve that there ſtood between us and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
an ingagement made by the Army, at that famous Rendevouz at <hi>Trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe
Heath, June</hi> 5. 1647. binding us neither to ſuffer dividing nor
disbanding of this Army: untill ſuch ſatisfaction were given, as in that
ingagement required: It was thought eſſentially conducing to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the Army, to the reconciliation of differences, to the
procuring of Nationall freedom, and to the reliefe of <hi>Ireland:</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſuch a Councel, to be ſet up again in the Army, conſiſting of Two
Commiſſion Officers, and Two Agitators, choſen by every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Horſe or Foot; together with the concurring generall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
In this we were very bold, (I do not ſay wiſe) propounding to
his Excellency this condition, to be performed before we could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto his <hi>Excellencies</hi> order: This performed, we were contented
to refer our ſelves to the cenſure of this Councell. That which gave us
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93945:3"/>
boldneſſe herein, and that which beguiled us, was this: That we did
not conceive how the engagement, could poſſibly admit of a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
            <p>Such a Councell being by that ingagement appointed, as a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of the Army, ought (as we did then beleeve to be ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unleſs we would prove perfidious Covenant-breakers. I could not,
(I confeſs) unty this knot: but here I was intangled, and enſnared,
and therefore, for that preſent, thought my ſelf bound in duty to God
and men, to proſecute this ingagement: Hence it was (many being
of the ſame minde) That 12. Troopes of Horſe were drawn together
and looking upon ſuperior Commanders, as Tyrannicall Covenant-breakers.
We marched contrary to his Excellencies expreſſes; being
heightned with the zeale of the performance of our engagement.</p>
            <p>And touching this thing we were further perſwaded, that it did hold
forth ſuch ſtrength of reaſon, That the greateſt part of the Army
would ſuddenly have joyned with us: And this was the cauſe why I
joined with that Party, deviding from the Army, notwithſtanding there
appeared leſs ſafety, and greater hazard: And I beleeve this Cord drew
on many honeſt hearted men, who did conſcientiouſly ſeek to make
good that ingagement. But herein I confeſs a double error: Firſt, had
this ingagement been to be proſecuted: yet ought not we to have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
beyond our Sphear; and to break one ingagement by the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another; to diſobey his Excelencies order under any pretence. It
is a good thing to yeeld obedience unto that authority under which we
are placed. Our ſecond Error was, in not peracquainting his Excellency
and his Councel of War, with our grievances, In whom we have found
ſo great meekneſs and moderation, that we could not have miſſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>But that further anſwer may be given, and thereby the ſnare may be
broken, and no more be intangled, I ſhall declare what ſatisfaction I
have received: That ſo I may give the ſame ſatisfaction unto others.
Such a Councell indeed, the ingagement required, And ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
was conſtituted in the Army, acting, and tranſacting of matters
pertaining to the diſcipline of the Army. And ſo long was this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
continued; untill the inconvenience thereof was ſo far manifeſt;
That moſt of the Regiments of Horſe and Foot did Petition his Exelency
to ſend back the ſeverall Agitators, unto their reſpective Regiments,
untill he ſhould be pleaſed to reſummon them: Profeſſing a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in themſelves, to ſubmit unto his Excellency with his Councel of
War, according to the priſtine diſcipline of the Army. His Excelency ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93945:3"/>
received theſe Petitions, did not immediatly ſend back the Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
(as requeſted) But having firſt ſummoned a Councell, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
the Petitions unto them; it was by them concluded, that
according to the Petitions of the ſeverall Regiments, the Councell of
Agitators ſhould be diſſolved, untill his Excel. ſhould fee cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummon
them. Now this being ſo: his Excel. cannot be charged with
violation of that ingagement: neither doth th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re remain any obligation
on his Excel. to have continued or revived any ſuch Councell. Much
leſſe is it warrantable in the Souldiery of the Army to aſſume that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to themſelves Seeing they ſuffered a diſſolution by the ſame power,
by which they had their firſt conſtitution.</p>
            <p>And if this had been formerly known unto ſome of us, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
many had been prevented in this precipitate action.</p>
            <p>This that hath been ſpoken (though now it ſeems weak) was the
firſt and chief ground of our diſcontent, which brake forth into irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
and high diſobedience. Some other grounds there are which did
add fuel to this fire, and blow up the ſparkles which did here begin to
be kindled. A ſecond ground was, The many aſperſions which are caſt
upon ſome general Officers of the Army, to the blaſting of their fame
and reputation, have proved as a whet-ſtone, to ſet a rough edg upon
the reſolutions of many and to ſtir them up unto further diſcontent. I
need not repeat what is ſpoken and written by ſome men. As to my
ſelf, I do profeſs, I did never beleeve them; and I bleſs God I ſee leſs
cauſe to believe them then ever: I have thought ſtrange that men
ſhould ſeek to diſhonor them whom the Lord hath honored. But truly
I do obſerve great credulity (the character of Lightneſs) in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
whom I could wiſh otherwiſe minded. I deſire that diligent ſearch
may be made, Whether this proceed not either from jealouſie, which
always ſuſpecteth the worſt, and betrayeth all hope of good, or from
envy, repining at the felicity of other men: Yet leaſt ſome ſhould ſay,
That there is no ſmoak but ſome fire; all theſe accuſations cannot be
falſe. I ſhall plainly ſhew that much ſuch ſmoak hath been where no
fire was to be found, and that the beſt men (eſpecially in authority) have
been partakers of this portion. And tacitly to anſwer another Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I ſhall ſhew, That good men have ſometimes been infected with the
forenamed Contagion. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt man in his time upon
the earth, yet did the Conſpirators charge him as fiercely and hainouſly
as any Officer of the preſent Army is charged this day, in taking too
much upon him, lifting up himſelf, making himſelf a Prince over the
people; and this is not only ſpoken by ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> but by thoſe that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93945:4"/>
were men of renown, and famous among the people, yea countenanced,
becauſe beleeved by the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Now unleſs
we will ſay, That all the Congregation were evil, we muſt be forced to
confeſs, That good men are ſometimes overtaken with this fault, of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
and condemning others when there is no cauſe. Experience will
teach us, not to be too credulous to give ear to reports, leſt we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to believe that which we have no ground for: if flying reports
might be taken for evidence, we ſhould in all ages find very few good
men, but we ſhould be ready to condemn the generation of the juſt.</p>
            <p>Another complaint exaſpering the minds of ſome, is, That one Tyrant
is pulled down, and a ſecond ſet up in his room. I confeſs this complaint
were of great weight if it were true: But truly I ſuppoſe this ariſeth
from the want of diſcerning of true Government from Tyranny: As
Flattery was wont of late years to extol Tyranny, as if it had been the
perfection of Government; ſo Ignorance and Envy is ready to brand
true and lawful Government with the name of Tyranny. I ſee the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the one and the other, and I deſire other men may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
it. A Tyrant makes his Will the Law, the other makes the Law his
Will. And truly if we exclaim againſt Tyranny when our Rulers govern
not according to luſt, but according to Law and Rule, we ſhall incur
a juſt ſuſpition, that it is not Tyranny but Magiſtracy that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of.</p>
            <p>Another thing that hath much diſturbed the minds of men, and filled
them with diſcontent is, The ſlow motion of the Parliament, as to the
taking away of oppreſſions, and eaſing the grievances of the people. In
anſwer to this, We are to conſider the Parliament before, and after, the
Armies entrance into <hi>London.</hi> As to the former conſideration, before
the Armies entrance into <hi>London,</hi> I am ſo far from admiring their
ſlow motion, that it is a wonder to me that they moved at all any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way then backward: And I do admire the great providence of
God, who withheld them from turning all things upſide down, while
the Houſe was filled with ſo many men of corrupt intereſts. As to the
Parliament in the ſecond Conſideration, ſince the Armies approach to
<hi>London,</hi> we have cauſe to bleſs God, that they have done ſo many
things for us, which our eyes have ſeen; and what is not yet done,
is in promiſe already performed unto us, with aſſurance of ſuch celerity
as matters of ſo great weight will poſſibly admit. And for anſwer unto
this Complaint, there needeth not any to a patient ſpirit, and the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
are not capable of an anſwer. In concluſion of this I ſhall declare
my thoughts. That although ſome men do not ceaſe to caſt duſt in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93945:4"/>
faces both of Parliament and Councel of the Army, yet hath not that
Cloud been thick enough to hinder the appearance of thoſe beams of
Juſtice, Mercy, Pitty, Clemency, Moderation, which ſhine forth
in them, which have drawn me to ſo reverend an eſteem of both, as
I cannot conveniently now ſet forth, leſt I ſhould incur ſuſpition of
falling from one extream into another.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only ſay this, That I bleſs God for them; and it were no ſmall
degree of ingratitude, if we ſhould deny it a great mercy to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that God hath raiſed up ſuch men amongſt us. Theſe are the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Cauſes of our Diſcontents, which being weighed in the ballance
it will appear, that the greateſt of all is the unthankfulneſs of our hearts
and impatiency of our ſpirits, our want of love to cover offences, and
our too much envy, aggravating what may be amiſs. I ſhall now
proceed to ſhew the effects of this Diſtraction, if it be lawful to judg
of the Effects in the Cauſe; The fruits of this Mutiny would have
proved ſo bitter, that had I many tongues, and great ſtrength of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
I could not ſufficiently declare them: But when I ſhall have
done that which I am able, it will appear clearly to the world (though
we with faces of braſs ſhould deny it,) That the Sentence paſſed on
us all, and the Execution upon ſome, was very juſt and righteous; and
that his Excellencies Clemency in ſparing of us was very great. Let
me ſpeak truly of the conſequences likely to have attended this Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
as they were repreſented unto me upon ſerious Meditations, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had received the Sentence of Death, at ſuch time as I judged my
ſelf, not only unworthy, but alſo incapable of Mercy (from men) in
reſpect of my deep crime. And I ſhall make it appear, that if we had
not been prevented, this Mutiny would have proved more dangerous
and deſtructive then the firſt War raiſed by the King, with his Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or the ſecond revived by the Welſh, the Kentiſh, the invading
Scots, and others.</p>
            <p>The firſt and ſecond War did unite the hearts of the Army together,
and cauſed the well-affected in the Nation, with heart and hand, to
joyn in one: But this would have procured a diviſion between the
well-affected, and made a breach in this victorious Army, by forcing
one part to engage againſt the other, and one in fury to deſtroy the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and thereby Ham-ſtring the ſinews of this Nation, rendering all
former Victories null; bringing upon us a more deſperate condition
their ever, re-delivering us up into the hands of our conquered, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting,
Enemies. Surely hereby great joy had ſprung up to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
party: But exceeding ſorrow and woe to the well-affected.</p>

I cannot but with ſhame acknowledg blindneſs of heart, and a ſpirit
inſatuated, when we undertook this deſperate and dangerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.
We have therefore cauſe to ſay; Bleſſed be the Lord who gave
us into his Excellencies hand. And bleſſed be his Excellency of the
Lord, who hath been ſo happy an inſtrument to withhold our hands
from the blood and ruine of our Nation.</p>
            <p>The firſt and ſecond War had ſome Baſis and foundation to build
upon, ſome appearance of viſible Authority to countenance it: from
which appearance of Authority it derived a Beginning, in which alſo
it did terminate it ſelf; <hi>(viz.)</hi> in the will and pleaſure of a King. But
this Mutiny was without any foundation at all: The name of a King
we diſclaimed: From the Parliament we had neither received nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Commiſſion: The People knew not our deſires, and they were
more againſt us then for us, for ought we knew. Now what Succeſs
could be expected from ſuch Confuſion? Juſtly did the Lord diſ-own
us, to teach all men that he is a God of Order, and not of Confuſion,
to teach us that he needeth not our diſobedience to Superiors, or any
evil action, to conſummate this determination.</p>
            <p>The firſt and ſecond War was managed by men of one intereſt, as
touching the King, they all aymed at his reſtitution, at the advancing
of his Prerogative: But we were an Heterogenial Body, conſiſting of
parts very diverſe one from another, ſetled upon principles inconſiſtent
one with another. So that although the intentions of ſome men were
good and plauſible; yet the major part muſt needs be far different,
unleſs we think it poſſible, that light and darkneſs, good and evil, can
be concentrick together, inſomuch that had we proved the ſtronger
party, and prevailed, where ſhould we have terminated? Who can
imagine otherwiſe, but that parties amongſt us of ſeveral diſpoſitions
would have every one ſought to fulfil his own will? and ſo ſhould we
have run into diviſion, and ſubdiviſions, until we had ended in Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
Theſe things I have declared for this end, that I may manifeſt
unto my Fellow-Soldiers, that I am aſhamed of the late proceedings, and
do conceive great indignation againſt my ſelf, for being acceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch raſh attempts; That I may give warning unto others, that
they may beware and fear to do any ſuch thing. Oh, how neceſſary is
it at all times to draw neer unto God for wiſdom and underſtanding
to guide us and direct us in all our ways. And laſtly, I deſire all may
conſider and acknowledg how great the preventing mercy of God
hath been towards us at this time, that ſo we may be incited to offer
praiſe, and honor, and glory to him that liveth for ever and ever.</p>
