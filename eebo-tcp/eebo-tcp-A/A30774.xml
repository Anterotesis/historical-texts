            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Good Brother <hi>RUSTICUS,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough there have been some unkinde
jars between my brother <hi>Aulicus</hi> and
me, yet my earnest desire is to keep a
good understanding between your self
and me: I cannot but congratulate
your happinesse that breathe in so free
an ayre, wherein it is lawfull to heare
and speak <hi>truth:</hi> O <hi>Truth,</hi> sacred <hi>Truth,</hi>
whither art thou fled? if you at <hi>Oxford</hi>
did not give her entertainment, I
know not where she would find a place of aboad, for here at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
we fortifie against her to keep her out: Nay with us in the
City it is come to that passe, that <hi>it is almost as dangerous to speak
truth as Love the King:</hi> you know how famous we have been
here for publishing and printing Lyes, he that will not lye to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the great Cause in hand, is not amongst us thought fit to
have accesse either to the Pulpit or the Presse. And therefore when
I was first set on work to communicate Intelligence to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to indear my self to them that imployed me, I played my
part reasonable well, I Lyed my share; but at last admonished by
our brother <hi>Aulicus,</hi> and to confesse to you, touched a little in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
I began by degrees to take off my self from that unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
course, and did here and there sprinkle a little truth, yet very
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101375:3"/>
sparingly lest I should be thought to be turned <hi>Malignant</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeer:</hi>
but as little as it was, it was distastfull: for hereupon
Mr <hi>Pim</hi> and the Remainder of the <hi>five Members,</hi> assisted by Mr
<hi>Martyn,</hi> illiterate <hi>Serjeant Wild, Peard</hi> (that hath lesse Law if it
be possible then the Serjant) &amp; some others that have sworn ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to indure truth again, since they have thriven so well by Lies,
moved at the Close Committee to have me silenced: yet to blind
the world, as if their ayme were not at me alone, they involve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the same doome, and for Intelligencers, by an Order they
bung up all our mouths at once: yet knowing how much it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them that the old trade went on, though since they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
another to make use of my name, yet at first they gave au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to one man onely to lye for all the rest: him they call the
<hi>Parliament Scout,</hi> not <hi>Bulmore</hi> the Scout that was slain at <hi>Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
bridge neer you at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I meane not him, yet if you look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his weekly Pamphlets, you would sweare that he had no more
braines in his head, then <hi>Bulmore</hi> had when they were shot out.</p>
            <p>This man indeed tels you some truths, but such antiquated ones
that they were stale newes above a Thousand yeares since, as that
on the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there dwelt a People whom they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Picts,</hi> that there was a Wall built between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the like: while he keeps at this distance and comes no
nearer, he never needs feare that the heeles of the times may
chance dash out his teeth: he may write on! but if once he come
to publish any Moderne truths, as that his Excellency durst come
no nearer <hi>Oxford</hi> then <hi>Thame,</hi> that <hi>Fairfax</hi> is beaten in the
North, and <hi>Waller</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> in the West, or the like, he were
best looke to himselfe, he may read his fate in us: These new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
will never Brooke it.</p>
            <p>Since therefore we are here inslaved either to Lies or Silence,
that the world may not for ever be kept hoodwinkt, goe on (I
pray) as you have begun to let her see the Miseries under which
she dayly suffers. But me thinks it would be a work well worthy
your endeavour, to let the Country see not only their miseries, but
to point them out the fountain &amp; source from whence they flow:
This discovery hath beene within me as <hi>wine that hath no vent,
redy to burst like new bottles,</hi> yet as ful as I am, I dare not vent my
thoughts concerning this <hi>here,</hi> but have chose rather to whisper
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101375:3"/>
them to you: for it is in vaine to dissemble it, your sad stories of
the Ruine and devastation of the Countrey are ecchoed in our
Streets, and though we beare it out in a Vaunting way, as if these
things concerned not us, yet I assure you there are many soules
that mourne in private, (for in publique we must be as mad as
the rest, or else we suffer as <hi>Malignants</hi>) as knowing how justly
we stand charged with all those Calamities, which the sword of
Rebellion hath brought upon you: I never heare that of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
read, <hi>Woe to the bloody City, it is full of Lies and Robbery,</hi> but
I cannot choose but think of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is too too manifest, nor can it be denied, but that all your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
have been derived from us: when Common-Prayer was
in use amongst us, I remember such a Query in one of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Is there any evill in the City and the Lord hath not done it?</hi>
But you may aske, Is there any evill in the <hi>Countrey,</hi> and the <hi>City</hi>
hath not done it? You have made us Rich and Populous, and we
in foule Ingratitude have prodigally powerd out both our Wealth
and Strength to make you and our selves miserable.</p>
            <p>Well might the Incendiaries of this present Rebellion (so I
dare call it to you, though I dare not speak so plain here) bring vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
affections, eager endeavours to set this flourishing <hi>Church,</hi>
and <hi>Kingdom</hi> in Combustion, but alas! all this had signified little
or nothing, had they not gained our consent, and we resigned up
our persons and estates to their disposall to be made the base in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to compasse their most Trayterous designes: Could <hi>Say</hi>
or <hi>Pim,</hi> and their beggerly Confederates have found money to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
an Army against their Leige Lord, that had not money to pay
their own Debts, had not we furnished them? If we shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
partiality consider the severall helps which this City hath
Contributed to this Rebellion, we must confesse <hi>that both the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and continuance of this unnaturall Warre may be ascribed
to us:</hi> So that in all <hi>England</hi> there is but one <hi>Rebell,</hi> &amp; that is <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
To reflect a little &amp; look back on those times when this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
was but am <hi>Embrio,</hi> or else did begin to creepe into the
world, (for we may not think that this Monster was a Brat of a
suddain birth) though it were conceived (some <hi>Say</hi>) ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>re <hi>Banbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
&amp; shaped in <hi>Grays-Inne-Lane,</hi> where the undertakers for the
Isle of <hi>Providence</hi> did meet and plot it, yet you know it was put
out to Nurse to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101375:4"/>For <hi>first</hi> you may well remember when the <hi>Puritans</hi> here did
as much abominate the <hi>Military-yard</hi> or <hi>Artillery-Garden,</hi> as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris-Garden</hi>
it self: they would not mingle with the Profane: but
at last when it was instill'd into them, that the blessed Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
intended could not be effected but by the sword, these places
were instantly filled with few or none but men of that Faction:
We were wont you know to make very merry at their Training,
some of them in two yeares practice could not be brought to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
a Musket without winking; We did little imagine then,
that they were ever likely to grow formidable to the State, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to that strength, as to be able to give the King Battle, but
after a while they began to affect, yea and Compasse the chief
Offices of command, so that when any prime Commanders dyed,
new men were elected, wholy devoted to that Faction; and it
became a Generall Emulation amongst them who should buy the
most, and the best Armes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they might fill all places of authority with such
as should advance the designe, all care is taken to fill the Bench of
Aldermen, and the Common-Councel, with men disaffected to
the Government, both Ecclesiasticall, and Civill. To this purpose
if <hi>London</hi> did not afford men bad enough, they would call them
from other Corporations, as <hi>Alderman Atkins</hi> from <hi>Norwich</hi> and
the like: but if he had been <hi>Amsterdam</hi> or had been an Adventurer
to <hi>New England,</hi> or been the host of the <hi>silenced Ministers,</hi> he was
a jewell: Nay some will tell you, &amp; I am much of their opinion,
that the Faction have had so great a Care of this, that they have
chosen some men to places of the best esteem in the City, whose
estates were not able to defray the Charges, but have been sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by a Common Purse, and if you have not forgotten it, there
was a Motion you know made, That <hi>Honest men,</hi> so they cal th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
might beare the <hi>Magistracy,</hi> and the Citty beare the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:</hi>
some men thought that this proposall had especiall Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to those two beggerly Captaines, <hi>Ven</hi> and <hi>Manuring,</hi> who
having nothing either within or without them to render them fit
for government, yet in this Rebellious City, were thought <hi>most
fit,</hi> because <hi>most averse</hi> from what was by Law established.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> because all this could not compasse the end they ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at, unlesse the <hi>Clergy</hi> did conspire with them and contribute
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101375:4"/>
their help, and because they found very few of the <hi>Setled Clergy</hi>
here in the Citty, (except Dr. <hi>Gough,</hi> M. <hi>lackeson, Votier, Simons,
Walker,</hi> and a very few more) Compliant with their indeavours,
they laboured by all means possible, to introduce that <hi>Gibbus</hi> or
<hi>excrescency,</hi> of the Clergy called <hi>Lecturers</hi> over their <hi>Parochiall
Ministers</hi> heads, whose maintenance being dependent (yet a
portion by double Leases and other Sacralegious devices stolne
from their owne Parsons, so that the barren Mountaines of <hi>Wales</hi>
afford not so many poore, and as Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyer</hi> was wont
to call them, scandalous Livings together, as are to be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the walls of <hi>London</hi>) must preach such Doctrine as may fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
disloyalty, and instill such Principles into their Auditors as
may first dispose them <hi>to,</hi> and after engage them <hi>in</hi> Rebellion,
when things were ripe, or else they shall want bread to put into
their heads: The Truth is, Brother <hi>Rusticus,</hi> these Military prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
had effected Little, had not the fire been given from the
Pulpit.</p>
            <p>And because they saw how Successefull this Course was, and
what strange effects it wrought in our City, a <hi>Fourth</hi> design was,
to place some of their Emissaries in all <hi>Corporations</hi> (those Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not to my present purpose.</p>
            <p>The thing that I shall observe unto you is, the great care and
art used in fitting men for their service, and then disposing and
securing them in their Imployment, from any Molestation of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Censures. To this end, <hi>First,</hi> they account it necessary
to plant two <hi>Seminaries,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> an <hi>Initiary Seminary,</hi> to this
purpose they project the buying of a Headship in one of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi>
for some eminent man of their own party, under whose
Influence their <hi>Novices</hi> might be trained up in their <hi>Mysteries:</hi>
though some houses in both Vniversities were notorious enough
in this kind before, and might have saved them this Labour, as
<hi>Magdaline Hall</hi> and <hi>New-Inne</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Emanuel Colledge</hi>
and <hi>Katherine Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> was a <hi>Practique Seminary,</hi> and that was at St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholines</hi>
here in <hi>London,</hi> and did <hi>in Spiritualibus</hi> answer to the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilery
Garden,</hi> being a place to traine up their young <hi>Emissaries,</hi>
where they might take an Essay of their affections and abilities,
and by the bewitchments of <hi>gaine</hi> and <hi>popular applause</hi> deeply
ingage them in their Faction: and from this <hi>Seminary</hi> were most
of their new bought Impropriations fill'd. And as they had their
Salary <hi>from,</hi> so they were subordinate <hi>to</hi> a <hi>Classis</hi> or <hi>Cler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Consistory,</hi> who had power to transplant their most hopeful Imps
either into their purchased Impropriations, or else into a Lecture
in some of the most populous places of the Kingdom, maintained
by a borrowed portion from an Impropriation elswhere: yet this
<hi>Consistory,</hi> did not in their choice, strictly tye themselves to the
plants of their own Nurceries, but if any man had been a <hi>Pseudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyr</hi>
for their cause, or had been sentenced by the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
for Non-Conformity, or by some Notorious undertaking
had evidenced and declared himself, and irrevocably without
apparant note of Infamy and Levity (if he retracted) ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to their party: or had Letters Testimoniall from <hi>Patriarch
White</hi> of <hi>Dorchester,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>Boston,</hi> or the like, (for <hi>Calamy</hi>
and <hi>Marshall</hi> were not, as it is said of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> as yet
<hi>famous in the Congregation.</hi>) This man was a choice plant and fit
for their Soyle.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101375:5"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> being planted abroad, their second care was, that
whatsoever they Preached, though never so derogatory to the
Government either <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> or <hi>Civill,</hi> yet they might be free
from molestation, and Preach on, without danger of loosing their
maintenance by Ecclesiasticall censure. To this purpose they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the buying a Commis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to make any speciall plantation: who being after their own
hearts, might winke at their irregularities, and though the
Church-wardens should by chance be so honest to regard their
oathes, and present them, yet by the purchased or bribed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary
they may secure them from the danger of the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> for feare least any of their Creatures should fall from
them, and desert the Cause as some had done, when they had
got what they looked for; wisely they provide, that their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
shall be dependent, on the pleasure of their good Masters
the Feoffees, alterable by addition, or substraction, according to
their merits, or demerits, and their persons subject to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheered
if they Preach not to the advancement of their holy
cause, and according to the directions sent unto them from the
Conclave of their Elders at <hi>London:</hi> That so as much as humane
Policy could invent, they might (to use Mr <hi>Foxlies</hi> own words
speaking in this argument) <hi>Establish the Gospel by a perpetuall
decree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When all things were now ready, their <hi>Emissaries</hi> having
prepared the hearts of the people to Rebellion, first alienating
them, by frequent slandering the footsteps of Gods annoynted,
decrying the Government both of Church and State, fomenting
the causelesse discontents, and aggravating the necessities of State,
with the odious names of <hi>Tyranny, Arbitrary power, Violation</hi>
of the Subjects <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> and likewise possessed the
credulous multitude, that the conformeable <hi>Clergy</hi> had made a
Revolt from the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and had an earnest intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to introduce <hi>Popery:</hi> at last was fulfilled that Prophecy of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> toward the end of the Preface to that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
work of <hi>Ecclesiasticall Policy, that after the Puritans
have first resolved that attempts for Discipline are lawfull, it will
follow in the next place to be disputed, what may be attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Superiors who will not have the Scepter of that discipline to

rule over them?</hi> Which <hi>Prophecy</hi> we see exactly fulfilled in our
dayes, for the Puritans having first rebelled by a <hi>Proxey,</hi> they then
thought it seasonable to take an essay what an entertainment the
doctrine <hi>for taking up Armes against the King</hi> would find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
their Disciples.</p>
            <p>To this purpose Doctor <hi>Downing,</hi> a man fitted for any base im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and one that (what ever he counterfeited) ever
looked awry on the Church, in which (being setled and in peace)
he could never hope to advance farther then <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Hack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was to feele the Pulse of the Citty: while therefore discontents
runne high in the <hi>North,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> having in a hostile manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the Kingdome, the People every where, especially in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
stirr'd up by some agents to Petition the King for this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
D. <hi>Downing</hi> Preaching to the Brotherhood of the <hi>Artile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Garden</hi> positively affirmed, <hi>that for defence of Religion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Church, it was lawfull to take up armes against
the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He having thus Kindled the fire in the City, for feare of being
questioned (for as yet it was not lawfull to Preach Treason) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired

Randevouz of all Schysmaticall Preachers, this Sermon in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
place administring matter of discourse, People censured it,
as they stood affected, which gave occasion to the Ringleaders of
this faction to enter upon a serious examination, and study of this
case of Conscience: and it seems, consulting the Iesuites on the
one side, and the Rigid Puritans on the other, or indeed, because
without admitting this doctrine, all their former endeavours
would vanish into smoak, they stood doubtfull no longer, but
closed with these two contrary Factions, yet shaking hands in this
poynt of Rebellion, and subscribed to D. <hi>Downings</hi> doctrine, as
an Evangelicall truth.</p>
            <p>And<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that in this I may not be thought to speak as if I were a

               </gap>re he was of another opinion, ingenuously confessed

               </gap>ough the

truth is, they whispered this doctrine long before in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
but never durst proclaime it in their Pulpits, before
they saw an army in the bowells of the Kingdom to make it good
by the sword, and a Faction in a Parliament comeing on, that
would Authorize Rebellion under this pretence, by their Votes
and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>After it was once owned as a Truth, and a Truth, first scann'd,
and then avowed by <hi>Marshall, Calamy, Downing,</hi> and Colonell
<hi>Cornelius Burges,</hi> and the rest of their Elders, <hi>That for the cause
of Religion it was lawfull for the Subject to take up Armes against
his Lawfull Soveraigne,</hi> good God! how violently did the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>London</hi> rush into Rebellion? how plyable did the Faction
in Parliament find them, to raise Tumults? make outcries for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice?
call for innocent blood? subscribe and preferre Petitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the holy Lyturgy? and the Hierarchy, Root and branch, if
Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> did but hold up his finger to his <hi>Mermidons?</hi> or
Captain <hi>Ven</hi> send his summons by his Wife, to assemble the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi>
of the City?</p>
            <p>But because all other attempts had been to little purpose,
while the power of the sword remained in His hands, into which
<hi>God</hi> had put it, the Heads of this Rebellion consider, that it was
more seazable by secret practises, to render the King unable to
withstand them, then for them openly to oppose the King; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their main indeavour is to wrest the power of the <hi>Militia</hi>
out of the Kings hands by degrees, and to put it <hi>there, where</hi> they
might place the greatest confidence.</p>
            <p>But this was a work not easily effected, great Changes could
not be ushered in but by great preparations to make it way for
them; hereupon the Faction in Parliament make it their first work
to make this City wholly <hi>theirs,</hi> that one soule as it were might
animate both <hi>representive bodies,</hi> That of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and this
of the <hi>City:</hi> knowing that it was in vaine for the Faction in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>contrive</hi> unlesse the Faction in the Common-Councellin
<hi>London</hi> would <hi>execute:</hi> for though there were some flourishes
made from <hi>Buckingham-shire</hi> in the behalfe of M. <hi>Hampden,</hi> and
from <hi>Leicester-shire</hi> in the behalfe of Sir <hi>Arther Hasterigge;</hi> and
the like, yet the standing Guard, and power of the Faction in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
on which they relied, to affront the King; and save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

from the justice of the Laws, was that fixed here in
<hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because where feare doth possesse the multitude, it makes
them work not like agents, but like instruments, and moulds them

to believe Lies, was the invisible Army quartered under ground

<hi>Lewis</hi> an Inne-keeper at <hi>Rosse,</hi> to Alderman <hi>Actons</hi> Coachman:
except the blowing up the Thames with Gunpowder to drowne
the City, one of the most dangerous plots that ever affrighted
<hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as by their own fictions they endeavoured to possesse the
People with Iealousies, so whatsoever the King did never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a sinister interpretation, glossed to the multitude, to traduce
His actions, as if in them there were ever some evill intended to
the City and Parliament. When the King removed <hi>Belfore</hi> from
the Lieutenancy of the Tower, and placed Sir <hi>Thomas Lunsford</hi>
in that charge, the Citizens and their Wives could not sleep
quietly in their bedds, for feare of having their houses beaten
down about their eares. To satisfy their Clamours, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
were objected against him, the King reassumes the Trust,
and presently deposites it with Sir <hi>Iohn Byron:</hi> the Faction were
as ill satisfied in him, yet it was not easy what to object against
him: nay it was a Query that did not a little trouble them in
what to quarrell him: at last Lieutenant <hi>Hooker</hi> the <hi>Aquavite</hi>
man, and <hi>Nicholson</hi> the <hi>Chandler,</hi> complaine in the Common-Councell,
that since Sir <hi>Iohn Byron</hi> came to be Lieutenant of the
Tower, the Mint (to the great prejudice and dishonour of the
Kingdome) stood still. Those that knew what trade these men
drove, by the poor retaile of Broomes, Candles, and Mustard, their
chief merchandize, to improve brasse farthings into Groats and
Sixpences, accounted the Objection as inconsiderable as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
that alleadged it, yet as meane and false as it was, it served
some mens turnes to slander the King to His People, and raise a
Clamour. The King out of the abundant goodnesse of His Nature,
hoping to winne them by some condescendments, (which now
the world sees is impossible: Puritans being of another manner of
Temper then to be overcome with kindnesse) removes Sir <hi>Iohn
Byron,</hi> and confers this great trust on Sir <hi>Iohn Coniers,</hi> a man of
whom the Faction it seems conceived better hopes, and indeed
hitherto if you consider his exaction upon the Kings friends in his
custody, or retaining the name of Lieutenant, but resigning the
power contrary to his expresse oath, and that on his own Petition
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101375:8"/>
to the Train bands of the City, he hath not given them any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to repent them of their acquiescence in him.</p>
            <p>It were endlesse, <hi>Brother Rusticus,</hi> to relate all the meanes used
to heighten the fears of this miserable City, and by consequence
of the Kingdome: especially after the Faction in Parliament, had
shewen them the way by publishing that great Buggbeare to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
the People, the <hi>Remonstrance of the state of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last to make experiment what good effect all these arts had
produced the maine Engineers resolve on Twelfe night to see

to the Serjeant of the Chamber to Summon them. Yet in the
Yeare 1641. the small space of time betweene S. <hi>Thomas</hi> day, and
the day of this Returne, was a very <hi>active</hi> time: and that which
laid the Ground-work, of that Revolt of this City, from their
Loyalty to Rebellion, which presently followed. Therefore Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to stay the time of their ordinary calling, and knowing
the Necessity of their presence for the advancement of the work
in hand, when the King, gave order to the <hi>Lord Major,</hi> for
calling that Common-Councell held <hi>December,</hi> 31. 1641. when
the Lord <hi>Newburge</hi> was sent from the <hi>King,</hi> to give the City no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the late Tumults at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and to
recommend unto them the Care of preventing the like disorders,
for the time to come. To this Common-Councell, comes <hi>Fowks,</hi>
and with him, all the Tribe of this new choice, and mingle with
the old; which being an Intrusion without president, was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
opposed by <hi>them,</hi> that loved the ancient order, and honour
of the City; and foresaw the Inundation breaking in upon them,
yet out of Respect to the <hi>Kings</hi> Message, and that <hi>Lord</hi> that
brought it, the controversie for the present was hushed up, and
generally, they applied themselves to give dispatch to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
which they were to returne to the <hi>King,</hi> which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
done, and the Answer presently after published in
Print.</p>
            <p>So, on the 5. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> being the day after the <hi>King</hi> went
to the House of Commons to demand the <hi>Five Members,</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Councell being called by the Kings direction to the <hi>Lord
Major,</hi> to which himselfe in Person came, to impart unto them,
the reasons that induced him to goe to the House the day before,
and to admonish them, not to harbour or protect these men in the
City. Thither came <hi>Fowke</hi> and his new Elected, but not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to make unto the <hi>King,</hi> concerning <hi>Feares,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iealousies,</hi> touching
the <hi>Members</hi> accused, The <hi>Priviledges of Parliament,</hi> and that
they might not be tried but in a <hi>Parliamentary</hi> way. The <hi>King</hi>
heard him with admired patience, and whereas so disloyall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
justly deserved his Royal Indignation, to have se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t him
to <hi>Newgate,</hi> or <hi>Bride-well</hi> (especially interposing in that Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
body of which, as yet, he was no member.) The <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101375:10"/>
onely returned this short, gracious Answer, bidding him and the
rest, <hi>to assure themselves, That they should have a lust Tryall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Lawes of the Land;</hi> adding, <hi>that they were dangerous
men, and that neither he, nor they, could be in safety, as long as these
men were</hi> permitted to go on in their way.</p>
            <p>It was observed by some, very wise men, there present, that
the <hi>King</hi> at His comming to the Common-Councell, was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with Joy, and acclamations; not much Inferiour to those, at
His entrance into the City, on His returne from <hi>Scotland.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of the Kingdome were in danger, to be called to a Legall Triall,
for Treason, at His returne, there was a new face on the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and instead of <hi>God save the King,</hi> there was nothing eccho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in His eares, but <hi>Priviledges of Parliament, Priviledges of
Parliament! Great is Diana of the Ephesians</hi> was never roared
louder. The <hi>King</hi> dined that day at Sheriffe <hi>Garrets,</hi> and the
Faction of the Sectaries, Brownists, and Anabaptists having time
to assemble, after dinner, the house was beset, and the streets
leading unto it thronged with people, Thousands of them flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from all parts of the City: and the clamour still was <hi>Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Parliament;</hi> which <hi>cry</hi> first taken up that day, and <hi>that,</hi> with
so good successe, never failed to be Objected to the <hi>King,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated
to the <hi>People,</hi> even unto this day, in all their appeales
unto them.</p>
            <p>This Tumult sweld to that height, that the King in His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
was in great danger, the people in a most undutifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
pressing upon, looking into, and laying hold on His Coach:
nay, in defiance of His sacred Person, and Authority, that sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Pamphlet of <hi>Walkers, To your Tents O lsrael,</hi> was throwne
either into, or very near His Coach: Insomuch, that those few
friends, which the King had in the City, were heartily glad when
they heard that the <hi>King</hi> was safely arrived at <hi>White-Hall:</hi> for I
assure you, His fast friends here in the City, as the never enough
honoured Sir <hi>Richard Gurney,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Gardner</hi> the <hi>Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
were in great danger, being pursued with outcryes, as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Protestation,</hi> others calling them <hi>halfe Protesters;</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101375:11"/>
nay the <hi>Lord Major</hi> had his Chaine torne from his neck by a Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
sister.</p>
            <p>This very day, the two Houses (the leaders in both) thinking
themselves unsafe at <hi>Westminster,</hi> affrighted with their own guilt,
resolve to take Sanctuary in <hi>London,</hi> knowing, that what ever they
had done, or ever should doe, though never so derogatory to the
King, never so contrary to Law, yet the Puritan Faction in the
City would afford them not only protection, but power and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
Both Houses therefore adjourn, untill the <hi>Tuesday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
and cast themselves into a Committee, to meet at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi>
or <hi>Grocers-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Committee at <hi>Grocers hall,</hi> come the <hi>Five Members</hi> in
great Triumph, guarded, and attended by the Train-bands, and a
strong guard set to secure the place of their sitting. Now, if ever,
was the fatall conspiration of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> for Coyning new
unheard of <hi>Priviledges</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> not only to the securing
the persons of Traitors, but Iustifying Treason it selfe: For here
was (before this day) the unheard of Priviledge of Parliament
declared, <hi>That no Member of Parliament ought to be arrested by
any warrant whatsoever, without consent of that House, whereof he
is a Member,</hi> and by the same Ordinance it was declared, <hi>That
they that shall arrest these Members are enimies to the State: with
free liberty granted for all persons to harbor or converse with them:</hi>
In all which, it is evident, that the power and strength of <hi>London</hi>
were made the first obstruction of the free course of Iustice, and
the City made the <hi>Asylum,</hi> and Sanctuary of those, whom the
King had justly declared Traytors.</p>
            <p>And now, having undoubted experience of the affection of
the City, all eyes being turned from <hi>White Hall,</hi> to <hi>Grocers Hall,</hi>
where the <hi>Darlings</hi> of the People were pompously feasted, and
fawningly courted: on Saturday the eight of <hi>Ian.</hi> 1641. the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
consult, how the accused Members might come to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster;</hi>
the Tuesday following, and without any long debate, it
was resolved upon the question, That <hi>the Sheriffes of London
should, and might raise a guard of the Traine-bands, for the defence
of the King and Parliament; and that they might warrantablely
march out of their Liberties,</hi> and that you may see that the Scene
was right layd, there were some ready at that instant to make a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101375:11"/>
tender of the assistance of the <hi>Seamen</hi> and <hi>Mariners,</hi> whose pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
should guard them by Water, as the Train-bands by Land.
Next day being Sunday, every Pulpit that was at their devotion,
sounded nothing but the praise of <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and the <hi>Five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:</hi>
inciting the People to stand up in the defence of these <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

else if they permitted the King to take away these to day,
he might goe on to seize on as many more to Morrow, untill he
had left the Parliament naked of all <hi>good Patriots,</hi> and <hi>Zealous
assertors</hi> of Religion, the Lawes, and Liberties of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>On Munday the tenth of <hi>Ian.</hi> 1641. the King hearing of these
great Preparations, an Army by Land, and a Navy by Sea, which
was to cast ancre against <hi>White-Hall,</hi> suddenly, (and certainly gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
byan immediat providence, which in a peculiar manner wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
over Kings) resolved with his ever glorious <hi>Queen,</hi> the
<hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> to withdraw to <hi>Hampton Court,</hi>
which accordingly He did: not leaving (though well he might)
His <hi>curse</hi> behind him upon <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France</hi>
did on <hi>Paris,</hi> fowly provoked in the like manner; who flying from
the <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>Holy League</hi> the Parallell of this Treason here, at

            <p>The King, now, no better then fled from <hi>London,</hi> and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent

at the disposall of a Faction of Puritans in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and a

the King for his safety from these Tumults, withdrew himselfe
(and 'tis a wonder that any man should be so frontlesse to deny,
that for that reason, and that reason only, he withdrew himselfe)
was the returne made of the Indentures of the Election of the
Common councell-men, and if any election was questioned, as
some were, and that most justly, 'twas truely observed, that the
decision, never failed to goe on their side, who were last elected,
whether it were right, or wrong: for whereas formerly all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
of this Nature were submitted to the determination of

and Clamour of <hi>Fowke,</hi> and his adherents, it must be

<hi>Committee</hi> which was for <hi>the Safety,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> step which the
<hi>Puritans</hi> made towards the <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus put the King to flight, and by most indirect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
Practices, turned most of the discreet able men of the
City, out of the Common-councell, they beginne to put the City

And to have a leader for the intended Rebellion, upon

added as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the <hi>Committee.</hi> And though a great debt
lay on the Chamber of London, which was often Complained off,
but never paid, yet <hi>Serjeant Major Generall Skippon,</hi> (so many
are the Syllables of his new honours) is ordered by act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-councell,
to have 300<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> a yeare, out of the Treasury for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
during his life, if he should so long continue in the City
service.</p>
            <p>A strong Party being thus made, they beginne to make all
manner of Warlike Preparations, and provide Ammunition of all
sorts: they increase the number of the Train-bands, from sixe, to
eight Thousand, and appoint over them sixe <hi>Aldermen,</hi> to be
<hi>Colonells,</hi> each <hi>Colonell</hi> to have his Captains, Officers, Colours,
and Regiment, to be assigned him by the Committee for the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of Defence:</hi> and yet as if all this had been to no purpose, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they can make the <hi>Lord Major</hi> (a shrewd rubbe in the way)
a meer Cipher, and reduce their <hi>Governour,</hi> to so mean a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as to be only their <hi>instrument,</hi> they intrench upon his power,
and invade it many wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> therefore, whereas the power of summoning Common-councells,
resided only in the <hi>Lord Major,</hi> who, with the advice
of some Aldermen, was to judge of the Reasons inducing him,
to assemble this Representative body, now by Orders from the
House of <hi>Commons,</hi> at the instance of <hi>Pennington, Ven,</hi> &amp; <hi>Vassells,</hi>
the <hi>Lord Major</hi> is not left to his own judgement, when to call or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101375:12"/>
not to call a Common-councell, but must doe it, as oft as the Men
of this Faction shall command him: which usurp'd power, both
<hi>Ven</hi> and <hi>Fowkes</hi> have used with that insolency, that when they
have required Sir <hi>Richard Gurney</hi> to call a <hi>Common-councell,</hi>
and he hath demanded a reason, they have vouchsafed him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answer, then this saucy one, <hi>that when he came thither he
shold know.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> as the power of calling Common-councels was trusted
by their <hi>Charter &amp; Long prescription,</hi> with the <hi>Lord Major,</hi> so the
power of <hi>dissolving</hi> them, was put into the same hands, he might
rise in the midst of a debate, and dismisse the assembly, and yet was
not bound to give them an account, why he did so; but now, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by violence, and partly by pretended orders from the House of
<hi>Commons,</hi> he is fastned to his seat, there he must sit, untill <hi>Ven</hi> and
<hi>Fowkes</hi> and the rest have no farther use of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> heretofore, when a Common-councell was called, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be put to the Question, or proposed as the Subject of
their deliberation, but what the <hi>Lord Major</hi> by the <hi>Recorder</hi> did
offer unto them; but now, when they could not prevaile with the
<hi>Major</hi> to command the <hi>Recorder,</hi> nor with the <hi>Recorder</hi> without
the <hi>Lord Majors</hi> consent, to propose what the Faction pleased,
by the Omnipotency of an order, from the House of Commons,
they make the <hi>dumb to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

them: or else the <hi>Lord Major</hi> and the <hi>Recorder</hi> must answer it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> whereas the <hi>Lord Major</hi> and <hi>Ald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

point) have cast all into a common huddle, blending the <hi>Court of

in the major part of the Commons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Puritan Faction,</hi> by the assistance of the <hi>House of Commons<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi>
having thus gotten the <hi>power to call</hi> Common-councells, <hi>power</hi> to

no more sway then <hi>Perkins the Taylor, Rily the Bodyes maker,</hi> or
<hi>Nicholson the Chandler,</hi> they may dispose of the Wealth and
Power of the City as they please: now the two Factions openly
communicate Counsills, walk hand in hand, that 'twas a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
which was the Parliament, that at <hi>Westminster,</hi> or this at
<hi>Guile-hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards the end of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1641. the Commons house Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition'd
the King touching the <hi>Tower,</hi> the <hi>Forts,</hi> and the <hi>Militia,</hi>
and as two strings set to the same tune, though on two severall
<hi>Violls,</hi> at a convenient distance, if you touch one, the other by
consent renders the same sound, so, the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> and
the <hi>Common-councell</hi> of this City, were now grown to such a
Sympathy, that the motions, and endeavours of one, were the
work of both: that you would sweare, <hi>Fowkes</hi> was as much a
Parliament man <hi>here,</hi> as <hi>Ven</hi> at <hi>Westminster:</hi> for before <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
was tenne dayes old, there was a Common-councell held, in
which many things were debated: the Court was continued
long, untill one of the Clock: at last, tired out with long sitting,
and willing to rise, <hi>Ven,</hi> taking advantage of the present indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Court, to sit longer, ready to admit proposalls,
without any strict scanning, (especially since whatsoever pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that Common-councell, was to undergoe a second considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the next, as their constant custome is) produceth an Order
from the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> by which, they were desired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
such mens names, with whom the City thought fit to intrust
the Militia of London.</p>
            <p>The Court, surprized with so unexpected a Message for the
present, not piercing into the reason of it, nor understanding that
the Houses were in so great forwardnesse to settle the Militia,
as afterwards they found they were, nor imagining that the men,
whose names they returned, should have absolute power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
any thing of themselves, but only as a Committee to consult,
and prepare, and report to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> Common-councell, as the limited
power of all Committees is, and, considering that the <hi>Posture of
Defence,</hi> and the new <hi>Militia,</hi> though two names, were in effect
but one the same thing, Ordered that the names of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ittee,</hi>

for the <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> should be sent to the House in
returne to their order. The Intention of the House, (as some
thinke) in this Message, (though for my part, if I were put to my
oath I dare not sweare it) was, to indeare the City, and to lay an
Obligation upon them by giving them power to nominate their
owne men: But <hi>Ven</hi> (instructed by some, that had more wit,
but as little honesty as himselfe) his purpose in the carriage of
this businesse was, to make the Lord <hi>Major,</hi> the <hi>Sheriffes</hi> and
<hi>Court of Aldermen,</hi> by their owne voluntary, but Inconsiderate
act, to renounce (as it were) their owne Interest, and so, to place
this great power of the <hi>Militia</hi> on the <hi>Committee</hi> for the <hi>posture
of Defence,</hi> whereof the Major part, if not all, were of his owne
Faction.</p>
            <p>Many dayes had not passed, before it was generally knowne,
to the great Regret of all Loyall discreet men, That the <hi>Militia</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> was put in the hands of the <hi>Committee</hi> for the <hi>posture
of Defence.</hi> Not long after, a common-Councell was called, at
which, when the orders made the last meeting, (as the Custome
is) were read, at this, many men seeing the snare, into which
unwittingly they had cast themselves, beganne to retract, and
speake against that order, whereby the <hi>Committee</hi> for the <hi>Posture
of Defence,</hi> were invested with the power of the <hi>Militia:</hi> nay,
some of the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> whose names were returned, for the new
<hi>Militia,</hi> utterly protested against it: affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ming, that when they
passed that order, they had not the least Intention, to exclude the
Lord <hi>Major,</hi> from having power over the <hi>Militia,</hi> nor had any

that being as mad as his Lady, he will hold up the Rebellion,

fomented it, and given it life.</p>
            <p>If therefore Posterity shall aske, who broke downe the

and Prophanation, with the shew of Zeale, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
Lastly, if they aske who would have pulled the crown

Bloody City of London,</hi> so that what they wanted of devouring this

            <p>That therefore these dangerous <hi>defluxions,</hi> and continuall,
