            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if thou wilt be a trewe christen man / and of ryght beleue, thou shalte not deny, but that Christ is lord of al thinges. To hym it was sayde in the sauter boke: Aske of me,<note place="margin">

The tyme of his humilytie was from the tyme that he toke flesshe and blode, vnto his passion: the tyme of his power and maiestie, was and is after his Resurrection, whan he said: All po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is yeue to me in heuen and in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the / Mat. vlt.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Peter was ordeyned Christis vicare for the state of his humilite / and not for the state of his blysse and maiestie: but to folowe hym in doynge those thynges, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Christe in humilite dydde here in erth: for those thynges are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for vs. Ergo Christ commytted thylke power to his vicare, whiche he as a man mortall exercysed / and not that power, whiche after his glorification he resceyued. And for to proue this by holy wrytte, I take wytnes of Christe and holy writte / 
<pb facs="tcp:10447:6"/>
as thou doste. Lo Christe sayde to Pilate: My kyngedome is nat of this worlde, / Io. 18. Also he saith / he came not to be serued, but to serue other men, Matt. 20. This wytnes is so manifeste, that it maye confounde a man, resiste he neuer so moche / and all to frusshe his necke / be it neuer so styffe. And it is wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Luc. 12. howe one said to Christ: Mayster say to my brother / that he departe herytage with me. To whom Christ answered and sayde: Manne / who hathe ordeyned me iudge or departer betwene you? Lo thou hereste openly, that Christ was nat iudge nor dealer ouer tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraltees. Ergo in that state of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation taken on hym, he neyther had nor desyred temporalle kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But whan the people, that he hadde fedde / wolde haue made hym kynge / he fledde from them Ion. 6. Also in Peters commission
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10447:6"/>
he yafe hym not the keyes of the kyngdome of erth / but the keyes of the kyngedome of heuen. Also it is euydent and playne / that the bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of the Hebrewes were subiectes to kynges, and the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges deposed the bysshoppes: but god forbydde, that they shulde so nowe. And for to knowe / that Peter was Christis vycar in godly kyngedome of soules / and not in temporalle lordeshyppe of castelles and of landes: take hede what Paule the appostelle saythe wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge to the Hebrewes.<note place="margin">

That the bysshoppe is made ruler in those thinges that long to god, thou maist perceyue by the wordes of saynte Paule writynge to Timothe / the .2.

pistel, &amp; .2. chap. where he saith: No man that trauayleth in knyghthode to godward, medleth him in secular busynesses.

Therfore the kynges strength is to you in stede of a stronge walle.

And if ye wold not, all that ye haue were vtterlye loste. Howe moche than wolde ye paye for to haue the kynges succour his helpe and defence / as ye had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?

But as ye haue alway ben vnkynd, for the goodnes that he hathe done to you: euen so nowe ye playne and grutche, agaynste that that is youre owne profyte. If the kynge fayled

fee. This is an harde thynge / saye ye, but ye wyll not reste, tylle ye be (as ye are wont) conuicted and also confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by holy scripture: ageinst the whiche ye can not resiste. For of Ioas the kynge (of whome we spake before) hit is wrytten in the. 4. boke of kynges, the .12. chaptre. and in the seconde booke of Parali. the .24. chapyter thus: Wherfore Ioas the kynge of Iuda tooke all that was halowed / the which thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Ioram &amp; Ochozias his fathers / kynges of Iuda had halowed, and whiche thynges he hym selfe hadde offered vppe / and all the syluer that he coude fynde in the treasaurye of the lorde, and Palaice of the kynge / and sente it to Azael / the kynge of Syrie, and he departed from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem. Lo here thou mayst plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see, that for to paye the peoples raunsomme, he toke those thynges oute of the temple / not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10447:19"/>
he spared not the kynges pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layce / whan he toke those thynges out of the temple.</p>
               <p>¶Also in the .4. boke of kynges, cap. 18. it is thus redde of the holy kynge Ezechias. The same season Ezechias braake the gates of the temple of the lorde / and toke the plates of golde / that he hym selfe had there stycked vppe, and gaue them to the kynge of Assiriens.</p>
               <p>¶And if thou woldest saye, that Ezechias dyd amysse, I aunswere as it is sayde secundo Paralipo. cap. 32. Ezechias is not blamed for any of all his workes, that he dyd, but onely for the message of the princis of Babylon. Thanne who shall dampne hym / the whiche holye wrytte preysethe in all his dedes? If he erre, not vnderstandynge the sothenesse and the veritie of holye wrytte / wherfore than stryue you agaynste kynges and princis?
<pb facs="tcp:10447:20"/>
It is red secundo Machab. quinto. Godde chose not the people for the place / but the place for the people.</p>
               <p>Therfore the churche of lyme and stone shuld not be spared / whan the chrysten people be in perylle. The which thynge the holy kynge Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel and Ioseph vnderstode and tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly dyd fulfyll. If your goodes be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly churches goodes / and the people is a great parte of holy church: shal not than holy churches goodes skyl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully be spended for the succour and saufegarde of the people? And so it foloweth / that it longethe to the ghostlyche of holy churche. And our lorde saythe, Matthei duodesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo. I tell you / this is more than the temple. For it is no doubt the ghost<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly temple, that is mankynde, is more worth than the temple that is made of lyme and stone.</p>
               <p>Therfore a mylde and a prudente kynge mote by these wordes knowe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10447:20"/>
the wylle of all myghty god: and hym nedeth not to seke auctorite of other. Nor the temple of lyme and stone / nor the thynges dedicated therin / shulde not be spared / to wyn peace and saufegarde to the people, that is in perill. Nor we shuld not smyle (after a flaterynge facion) at the superfluite of the churche / but se that the great multitude of christen people be holpe and succoured in theyr nede. And though the kynge dealeth gratiouslye with you / and goodly gouerneth you alway / yet ye be not ashamed to withsay hym in that that he may laufully do by the lawe of god almyghty, and wyll not with your good wyll therto as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. But take hede and beware by the wordes of Salomon: The kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges wrathe is the messanger of deathe.</p>

               <p>If ye well consider, and vnderstande the gospell aryght / ye may se / that the tribute or dragme was demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely of Christe: And onelye for Christe this answere semeth to be gyuen: For he is the verye sonne

of god, the sonne of the greatte myghty kynge. And as the kynges sonne is greatter than the bysshop: so is goddes sonne greatter than the emperour. And so that aunswere was gyuen for Christe, and not for you. Neuer the lesse bycause they, that chieffely serue the kynge in his presence, shulde not be put to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and greuous charges / so we grant, that clerkes in theyr owne persones be free / but not they, that leade theyr lyfes as lewde men, and not as clerkes to the worshyppe / but to the gyle and fraude of oure lorde / as hit is all day sene.

them by priuileges of princis.

Than if possessions be as ryghtfully subiecte to the common charge / as to the yeres rent, he shall be vnder charge / who so euer oweth them, specially if it nedeth for the defence of the comon welthe: for they nede the comon defence, as al other nede.

kyngedome, or els (whiche is moste lykely) ye enuie the hygh estate of the realme. If ye well beholde the actes of greatte Charlemayne, or lysted to rede the auncient approued hystories: ye shall fynde, that the realme of Fraunce is but a portion of the empire / by a iust diuision sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it / and was by the space of .500. yeres egall therto bothe in dignitee and auctoritie. Therfore what so euer priuilege of dignite the empire holdeth in one part / the same holdeth the realme of Fraunce in an other. For whan by brotherne the realme of Fraunce was deuyded from the other parte of the empire: what so euer lawes / power, or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite the empire opteined and exercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ouer and vppon the sayde parte thus diuided, the verye selfe power fell to the frenche kynge.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10447:25"/>
is well knowen to be subiecte to the empyre: so lykewyse all thynges within the boundes of the realme / be subiecte to the realme. And lyke as the emperour may make la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes ouer al his empire, and to them adde more or diminisshe, as he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good: so maye the kynge of Fraunce, eyther vtterly repelle the emperours lawes, or change which of them hym lyste: or els cleane exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge and fordoynge these lawes / maye at his pleasure ordeyne and make newe. For whan nede shuld re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quyre (as it ofte chaunceth) to enact and ordeyne a statute, if the kynge that is the chiefe, coude not do it: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is none other that canne: for there is none aboue hym.
