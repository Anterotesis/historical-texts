            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Relating that on the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> last, about 9 in the morning were seen between <hi>Dole</hi> and
<hi>Salins</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> a most incredible number of Birds, who by their multitude darkened the
Sky; after having for some time, as it were skirmished together in great confusion, they
seperated into two bodies; and after most horrible cries, they engaged against each other
with such fury, that several thousands were faln dead to the Earth; some smothered with
most of their feathers off, and others all bloody and torn; These Birds were of a hundred
several sorts, of several sizes, and several colours. Those which were most Numerous
weighed four or five pounds a piece; their claws were like those of <hi>Indian</hi> Hens, <hi>Nibs</hi>
crooked like Parrots, and their feathers of an Ash colour; about 500 Paces of Ground
were covered with these dead carkasses to a mans height. Besides several Thousands that
were found dispersed here and there: Insomuch that it being seared that Air might be
infected by them, Pioneers were sent from <hi>Dole</hi> to bury them.</p>

               <l>To tell them they shall be cut off,</l>

               <l>why such strange Fowls was gathered there.</l>
               <l>For sometimes they were seen to fight,</l>
               <l>and skirmish in confused wise,</l>
               <l>To tug and pull, to claw and bite,</l>
               <l>sometimes to fall, and sometimes rise.</l>
               <l>At length as it were by consent,</l>
               <l>into two parties they devide;</l>
               <l>As if it were two Armies bent,</l>
               <l>to fight it out on either side.</l>
               <l>And then with fearful hideous cries,</l>
               <l>each party did the other dare,</l>
               <l>The like was never seen with eyes,</l>
               <l>how they proclaimed open war.</l>
               <l>At last each other did engage,</l>

               <l>Both parties being in a rage,</l>
               <l>like two brave armies in their pride.</l>
               <l>Most fiercely they did fight it out,</l>
               <l>whilst thousands to the ground did fall;</l>
               <l>They were so furious and so stout,</l>
               <l>they freely ventured life and all.</l>
               <l>Their bodies mangled, rent, and torn,</l>
               <l>upon the earth most thick did lye,</l>
               <l>So that the child that's yet unborn;</l>
               <l>may wonder at this prodigy.</l>
               <l>At length their forces being spent,</l>
               <l>those that were left, away did flie,</l>
               <l>But whence they came, or whither went,</l>
               <l>there's no one ever could descry.</l>
               <l>These birds which did the battle fight,</l>
               <l>were of a hundred sundry sorts,</l>
               <l>Of several colours and of shape,</l>
               <l>as doth appear by all reports.</l>
               <l>The greatest of their bodies were,</l>
               <l>of four or five pounds weight each one;</l>
               <l>As to the people did appear,</l>
               <l>which view'd them over as 'tis known.</l>
               <l>Their claws like those of <hi>Indian</hi> hens,</l>
               <l>their crooked nibs, like Parrots just;</l>
               <l>Their feathers of an Ash colour,</l>
               <l>if we may the relation trust.</l>
               <l>Five hundred paces, as 'tis said,</l>
               <l>of ground were covered with the dead,</l>
               <l>Unto the height of any man,</l>

               <l>their bodies should infect the air,</l>
               <l>Sent Pioneers to bury them,</l>
               <l>which is a thing most strange and rare.</l>
               <l>Thus was this bloody combate past,</l>
               <l>within the sight of many a one;</l>
               <l>Who at the wonder stood agast,</l>
