            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

One onely thing there is, which is able in this case much to temper our affections; when we see our friend to die in the Lord; that is, in comfort of conscience, and assurance of saluation through <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This blessed departure God giues to many, for diuers good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. First, that the world may know that peace is the end of the iust, and comfort in death is the portion of the righteous. Secondly, That his eternall truth in our holy profession may appeare to bee able to comfort us, not only in our life, but in our death also, when all other comforts forsake vs. Thirdly, that our enemies may see our faith is not in vaine. Fourthly, that the weake by their example may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to a holy life, when they see it bring with it so happy a death, and that they may be strengthened against the feare of death, seeing it is alwayes comfortable to those that lead a godly life. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and finally, that the friends of the departed, by their heauenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, may be admonished not to mourne so much for their death, as to reioyce for their life, <hi>and to thanke God, that euer it was their lot, in any degree to be ioyned or matched with so blessed seruants of God.</hi>

This Gentlewoman, Mistresse <hi>Katherine Brettergh</hi> was one of this number: her life, as long as God continued it, was deere to those among whom she was, as the life of a friend might be. Her husband, friends, kinsfolks, brethren, sisters, and all the godly that knew her, enioyed a great blessing of God of her: and her death (no doubt) was grievous to her husband, as the death of a vertuous yokefellow.</p>
            <p>This is the thing I thought with profit might bee presented to the view of other also that knew her not: for when I had for my owne priuate vse, and the vse of my friends faithfully collected (out of the fresh memories of those that were present, and eie-witnesses as well as my selfe) and set downe the manner of her sicknesse and death: I considered, that the knowledge thereof could not but bee welcome to all those that desire to dye the death of the righteous. And so the same causes that moued me to collect it, gaue mee also occasion to publish it. I remembred the saying of one, <hi>That it is is great piety to set forth the vertues of the departed, if they haue excelled therein; yea it is</hi>

I considered the vngodly and vncharitable tongues of the <hi>Papists</hi> abiding in our Country, who, since her death, haue not ceased to giue it out, that she died despairing, and by her comfortlesse end, shewed that she professed a comfortlesse Religion. Wherein they bewray their malice and madnesse, and shew themselues of what generation they are, euen a people (saith <hi>Ieremie) which bend their tongues like bowes for lies: and</hi> (as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith) <hi>make</hi>

            <p>To reade, to pray, to sing, to meditate, was her dayly exercise; and her chiefest delight was in the holy society of the Saints vpon earth (which I say not for any cause, but only to shew the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from whence her godly end flowed, and that the World may see some there be, which chuse rather to bee ioyned with the people <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25.</note> of God, than to <hi>enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season;</hi> and these I doubt not haue chosen the better part.) Finally, the precepts of the Lord were precious vnto her; for from her childehood she fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God, and walked before him: both knowledge and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did ioyne in her, the fruites and effects whereof did appeare in her life, and was seene at her death, to the glory of God, and comfort of all beholders.</p>
            <p>She was not like the simple Popish women of our dayes, which <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 6, 7. Act. 17, 11, 12.</note>

Many times shee would pray that God would forgiue them, which had done them this hurt, and send them repentance: and shee would call vpon her husband, that hee would doe the like, and <hi>blesse them that cursed him.</hi> And for feare <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44.</note> lest her husband should faile in that point through infirmity and weakenesse, as it is said of <hi>Iob, who offered sacrifice for his sonnes, lest peraduenture they should sinne, and blaspheme God in their</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iob. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>hearts:</hi> so shee neuer failed, but dayly prayed vnto the Lord to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie her husbands thoughts, and direct his heart aright, onely to seeke Gods glory, without either desire of reuenge, or satisfying his owne affections. So humble was her spirit, so carefull to auoide and preuent sinne, both in her selfe and others: and so milde of nature, that as <hi>Iacob</hi> with his mildenesse softned the malicious <note place="margin">Gen. 33. 3, 4.</note> heart of <hi>Esau</hi> his brother: and <hi>Dauid</hi> by his kindenesse in the caue, changed the fury of <hi>Saul,</hi> into weeping and confession, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was more righteous than hee: so shee by her meekenesse, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 17, 18.</note> and vnspotted carriage in the World, forced some of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries to religion, to speake well of her.</p>
            <p>For her life, shee was well reported of all that knew her. Piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and bountifull was shee to the poore, and slacked no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to doe good wherein she could; but constantly held her course, and kept her times of praying, reading, and meditating, (wherein shee had plentifull gifts) and contiuuasly used the same at such times as were fitting for her estate, sex, and calling. At the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Religion, as prayer and instruction in her family, she would not be wanting: besides priuate prayer, and meditation which she omitted not, but vsed dayly, both in her chamber, as also abroad secretly and solitarily in the Orchard, Garden, or Fields, as <hi>Isacks</hi> manner was. In reading the Scriptures shee vsed euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more <note place="margin">Ge. 24. 63.</note> to taske her selfe, eight Chapters a day at the least, and for the time which shee saw euill or idlely spent, without doing some good, shee vsed to call <hi>the time of tentation.</hi> Many times also
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17867:5"/>
she would read some godly writer, or expositor of Scripture, or in the booke of Martyrs; and was seene to weepe most bitterly, when either she had read of that which touched her affections neere, or of the cruell Martyrdome, which the deere Children of God were <note place="margin">Exo. 13. 13. Psal. 16. 4. Ephes. 5. 3. Iudg. 6. 31, 32. Eccles. 4. 25. 28.</note> put vnto, by the cruell and wicked tyrants of former dayes.</p>
            <p>For Popery, she saw it so grosse and foolish, that she would not once <hi>name</hi> it, except it were to argue against it, but neuer for it: so zealous was shee of Gods glory, and loued the truth so entirely, that shee would not once open her mouth to plead for <hi>Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sinne aboue all things was hatefull vnto her, for thereat shee would haue grieued, as well when shee had seene it in others, as in her selfe. One or two examples I cannot omit, wherein shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed a worthy spirit, sanctified by the Spirit of God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all the assaults of Satan. On a time, as her husband and shee were riding toward the Church, he was angry with his man: <hi>Alas husband</hi> (quoth shee) <hi>I feare your heart is not right towards God, that can be thus angry for a trifle:</hi> And weeping shee said fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>you must pray against this your affection, and alwayes bee sure your anger bee of God, for else how dare you appeare this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Minister? And offer vp your prayers in the publike congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the saints of God?</hi> Another time, a Tenant of her husbands, being behinde with his rent, shee desired him to beare yet with him a quarter of a yeere, which he did: and when the man brought his mony, with teares she said to her husband: <hi>I feare you doe not well to take it of him though it be your right, for I doubt he is not well able to pay it, and then you oppresse the poore.</hi> So great a compassion had shee of other mens wants, that all things being duely considered, and rightly weighed, methinks I may say of her, as <hi>Paul</hi> said of <hi>Timothie, I know none like minded.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus after she was married, shee continued in the things shee had learned, and held her profession with much sincerity, that the common enemies to our religion (the very Papists) had nothing to say against her, but confessed her life was vnreprooueable. And as for the godly that knew her, they alwayes acknowledged that modesty, and vertuous carriage in her, ioyned with knowledge and practise of all the duties of religion, that they had lust cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of her, as of a sound and faithfull professor of the Gospell.</p>

            <p>To helpe her somewhat herein (for properly otherwise, it is the peculiar worke of the <hi>holy Spirit of God,</hi> to perswade the heart and soule of her particular interest in these generall promises) she was told, that the <hi>Almighty</hi> who was <hi>mercifull,</hi> as she had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and <hi>faithfull,</hi> as she confessed, intended all these mercies to as many as hee did call, and make promise to.

            </p>
            <p>One time she tooke her Bible in her hand, and ioyfully kissing it, and looking vp toward Heauen, she said that of the Psalme: <hi>O Lord, it is good for mee that I haue beene afflicted, that I may learne thy statutes: The law of thy mouth is better to mee than thousands of gold and siluer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another time shee called her husband to her, and said: <hi>O Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, beware of Papistry, keepe your selfe holy before the Lord: Yeeld not to the abomination of the wicked, lest they reioyce, and so you dishonour God, and destroy your owne soule.</hi> Againe shee said, <hi>Let my little Childe bee brought vp among the Children of God, and in the true feare and knowledge of his Maiesty; so shall I meete her in heauen, whom now I must leaue behinde me on earth.</hi>

            <p>Againe sometime she would pray with a low voyce to her selfe, and that saying of <hi>Paul, Wee haue not receiued the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to feare any more, but the Spirit of adoption, whereby wee

            <p>About eleuen of the clocke shee began to tremble and quake a little, and withall shee asked her husband if he would helpe her <note place="margin">William Brettergh.
