            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>GReat and Various have the Actions been
between</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>ſince the
Invaſion of the</hi> Normans, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1066.
<hi>which makes</hi> September <hi>next juſt 629 Years, but
that the</hi> French <hi>Nation ſhould make a Conqueſt
of</hi> England <hi>hereby, nothing is more manifeſtly
untrue, that People being a diſtinct Nation
from the</hi> French, <hi>who conquering that Province
by main force, from</hi> Neuſtria, <hi>call'd it</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandia
<hi>in the Reign of</hi> Charles le Simple;
<hi>whence by the way 'tis worth the remarking what
kind of Kings</hi> France <hi>hath often had, and what
ſort of Epithetts their own Cronicles give
them, which ſtand upon publick Record to all
poſterity, as</hi> Charles le Simple, Charles le
Chauve, Charles le Gros, Charles le Gras,
Charles le Phrenetique, Philip le Long, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
le Begue, <hi>&amp;c. Now tho there have been
many and mighty Quarrels, War-like Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and Feuds betwixt</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France,
<pb facs="tcp:110026:6"/>
               <hi>yet in the reign of the</hi> Saxon <hi>Kings the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
make little mention of any; but ſince</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>was joined as it were to the Continent by
addition of</hi> Normandy, <hi>there have been as
frequent traverſes of War as have happen'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
any two Nations; for of thoſe 28 Kings
and Queens which have reigned here from</hi> Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
<hi>the Firſt to</hi> William <hi>the Third now Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
there have been but a very few of them
free from actual Wars with</hi> France; <hi>yet in ſo
long a tract of time, when the</hi> French <hi>were at
their higheſt pitch of Power, they never did
nor had any adequate power to invade</hi> England;
<hi>'tis true that they took footing once or twice in
the Iſle of</hi> Wight, <hi>but it quickly grew too hot
for them. And touching</hi> Lewis <hi>the</hi> French
<hi>King's Son who did ſtay and ſway the Scepter
here about two Years (whereof they ſo much
vaunt:) That was no Invaſion, but an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
being brought in by the diſcontented</hi>
Barons <hi>in</hi> England; <hi>ſo that in a manner</hi> France
<hi>was the Theater of the War between the two
Nations down from</hi> William I. <hi>to the preſent
time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the great Battles which were fought
from time to time, 'tis confeſſed by the</hi> French
<hi>Hiſtorians themſelves, that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>were at
moſt but half in number to them in almoſt all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements;
<pb facs="tcp:110026:6"/>
inſomuch that by pure proweſs and
point of the Sword, the</hi> Engliſh <hi>poſſeſs'd two
parts in three of that populous Kingdom, and
how all came to be loſt again, will appear by the
ſequel of the Story, but here I cannot omit one
remarkable accident, that was concomitant with
the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Arms in</hi> France, <hi>and that is, that
when the</hi> Engliſh <hi>were at the height of their
conqueſts in that Kingdom, the Pope came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
at</hi> Avignon <hi>in</hi> France, <hi>and there was a
common ſaying which continues ſtill in memory
among the Vulgar,</hi> Ores le pape eſt devenu
Francois, &amp; Chriſt eſt devenu Anglois <hi>i. e.
Lo! the Pope is become a</hi> Frenchman <hi>and
Chriſt an</hi> Engliſhman, <hi>which related to the
marvelous Exploits and Succeſſes the</hi> Engliſh
<hi>had in that Kingdom, which were ſuch that
Sir</hi> Walter Rawleigh <hi>ſpeaking of the famous
Punick Wars, puts this Quaere.</hi> If one ſhould
ask which was the valianteſt, the <hi>Roman</hi> or
the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> one might anſwer the
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> who performed greater feats of
Arms then either of them; <hi>inſomuch that ſome
foreign Authors give this Character of</hi> France,
<hi>that it was the ſtage whereon the</hi> Engliſh <hi>acted
their valour ſo often.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis true that in canvaſſing of Treaties, in
ſubtleties or ſhuffling the Cards, and mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
<pb facs="tcp:110026:7"/>
they were moſtly too hard for the</hi>
Engliſh, <hi>who naturally uſe down right dealing,
and real integrity; but in point of performance
of what was ſtipulated, eſpecially if the Article
related to Money (whereof we drew from them
vaſt ſumms) they ſeldom exactly performed the
Capitulation of any Treaty, as Foreign Writers
obſerve; ſo that part of King</hi> John'<hi>s ranſom
is yet behind, beſides the Mony which was to
be paid for</hi> Tournay <hi>in</hi> Henry VIII. <hi>time,
the 500000 Crowns which</hi> Edward VI. <hi>was to
have for</hi> Bolloign, <hi>and thoſe great expences which
Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was to have for ſending her
Armies to aid</hi> Henry IV. <hi>and the</hi> French <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,
two parts of three are not paid to this

provoked them upon every occaſion, preſuming
no doubt very much upon the favour of the

too much partiality in that regard. 'Tis true,

ſaid, <hi>Well, when after my delivery I go to Church, I
ſhall offer a Thouſand Candles to him, and ſware to

and this he made good the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi>
the ſame year, when he entred <hi>France</hi> with Fire

invincible; but King <hi>Edward</hi> had equipp'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as formidable a Fleet, in oppoſition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he was <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> and Admiral himſelf. It
was one of the moſt glorious Victories that ever
was got at Sea, for the Chronicles mention that
the whole <hi>French Navy</hi> periſhed, and 30000
Men Wounded, Slain, and Taken: This great

Naval Battel was fought upon <hi>Midſummer Eve,</hi>
and Heaven appeared much for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for
they had Wind and Sun favourable to them in the
Fight; and to make it more glorious, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
himſelf was wounded in the Thigh with
an Arrow, whereof he was quickly cured. He

<hi>Normandy</hi> like a Whirle-wind, and carries all
the Countrey before him as far as <hi>Poiſſy</hi> about 10
miles from <hi>Paris,</hi> and after divers hot Skirmiſhes
a main Battel is appointed. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
near a Village called <hi>Creſſy,</hi> where it was
divided into 3 Battallions; the firſt was led by
the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the ſecond by the Earls of
<hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> and in the third, was
the King himſelf. The Field being thus ordered
the King mounted upon a white Hobby, and
rode from rank to rank encouraging every one
to the performance of his Duty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Army was at leaſt twice more in
number, conſiſting of above 60000 Combatants,

that for the limmerneſs thereof, when

Action for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the Sun did ſhine

their Eyes, but on the Back of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> King
<hi>Edward</hi> being got into a <hi>Wind-mill</hi> all the while,

the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> were put to change their poſt,

rides about in a rage, crying out, <hi>Sa, Sa,</hi> lets
make way over the bellies of theſe <hi>Italians,</hi> for
they do but hinder us, ſo riding thorow them,
he came up to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wing where the Prince
of <hi>Wales</hi> was, the fight grew furious, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110026:21"/>
inſomuch that the Commanders about the
Prince ſent up to the King for a recruit of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the King asking the meſſenger, whether his
Son was wounded or ſlain, and being anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no, he replied, Then tell them who ſent
you, that as long as my Son is alive, they ſend
no more to me, for my will is, that he win
his Spurs, and have the honour of this day; ſo
the combattings on both ſides being wonderfully
eager, the <hi>French</hi> King had his Horſe killed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, and ſo with-drew, which being known
by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it added much to their Courage,
ſo that ſoon after they became maſters of the
Field, and being in heat of Blood, they made
no Priſoners but put all to the Sword, ſo that
the number of the <hi>French</hi> ſlain ſurmounted the
whole Army of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for there fell about
30000 of the <hi>Enemy,</hi> the chief whereof was the
Duke of <hi>Alanzon,</hi> the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Dauphine <hi>de Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennois</hi>
Son to <hi>Imbert,</hi> who afterwards gave the
Province of <hi>Dauphiny</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his firſt Son ſhould be called <hi>Dauphine in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum,</hi>
and as a Corollary to this mighty Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the next day ſending Scouts abroad, there
was another <hi>French</hi> Army diſcovered under the
conduct of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Roan,</hi> whom the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> encounter'd alſo and utterly defeated.
There was one paſſage very remarkable in this
Battle, whereof Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>That a day before the Engagement, the King
ſent one Captain</hi> David Gam <hi>a</hi> Welſhman <hi>to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110026:21"/>
and view the</hi> French <hi>Army, which he did with
no leſs danger than Fidelity, and brought word that
there were in the Enemies Army men enough to Kill,
enough to take Priſoners, and enough to run away,
which proved true, and ſo the</hi> Welſh <hi>Captain was
knighted in the Field.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This mighty Victory was ſeconded a few
years after by another more memorable, for the
<hi>Black Prince</hi> having now wun his Spurs, and
being taper'd up to his full growth was ſent to
<hi>Gaſcoigny,</hi> where the truce being expir'd, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruns
all the Country as far as <hi>Tourain,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>John</hi> the then <hi>French</hi> King rais'd a potent
Army, more numerous then that at <hi>Creſſy,</hi> and
going to find out the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> he heard
of him about <hi>Poictiers,</hi> having not above 10000
effective Men in his whole Army, and they alſo
having been tir'd with long Marches, whereas
the <hi>French</hi> were freſh, and were 6 times as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
whereupon the Prince being adviſed to
turn, falls about towards <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> when he was
ſuddenly ſurrounded by the <hi>French</hi> Army, upon
which a Battle being intended, there came two
<hi>Cardinals</hi> to mediate an Accommodation, but
the <hi>French</hi> King would hearken to none unleſs
the Prince, as a vanquiſh'd man would render
up himſelf, and his whole Army to diſcretion;
this was of hard digeſtion at a Prince of ſuch a
Courage, therefore he anſwered: That at the
Mediation of the Holy Father he was willing to
reſtore ſuch places which he had taken <hi>en bonne
Guerre,</hi> provided this might be done without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110026:22"/>
to his Honour, whereof he was accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the King his Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King not
hearkning to this, reſolved to fight, thereupon
the Prince alſo reſolv'd for his part to part with
his life at as high a rate as he could in ſuch a
ſtrait, wherefore making a vertue of neceſſity
by a happy providence, he makes choice of an
advantagious ground; for finding that the <hi>French</hi>
Army conſiſted moſt in <hi>Cavalry,</hi> he entrench'd
among the adjacent Vineyards, where when the
<hi>French</hi> Horſe furiouſly entred, being wrap'd and
entangled amongſt the Vines, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
did ſo ply, pelt and gall them, that being
thereby diſordered, unrank'd and routed; the
whole Army in a ſhort time was totally defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110026:22"/>
meet with the King, and ſeis'd upon
him, but ſuddenly in the hurly burly, there were
ſome <hi>Frenchmen</hi> of the Prince's Army ruſh'd in,
and the King knowing one of them, call'd to
him, whoſe name was <hi>Myrobrecht de Artois,</hi> who
going on with others to preſent the Priſoner to
the Prince, there was a conteſt who took him
firſt, and the King, was deſired to point at him,
ſo he pointed at <hi>Howel,</hi> and ſaid, this is the
Man who took me. There are authentick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
in ſome <hi>Welſh</hi> Manuſcripts that confirm
this; Moreover, they have a general Tradition,
and ſome Songs which continue freſh to this day,
how <hi>Howel</hi> did put a Bridle in the <hi>French</hi> King's
Mouth, with many other Expreſſions touching this
great Act. Now, for that ſignal exploit the
Prince knighted him in the Field, and he was
ever after call'd Sir <hi>Howel</hi> y Fuyall, Sir <hi>Howel</hi>
with the Axe; he had the Conſtableſhip of <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyth</hi>
Caſtle given him, with the farms of <hi>Cheſter</hi>
mills, and other conſiderable things conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, which ſurely would not have been but
for the merit of ſome high ſignal Service. The
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Records (beſides Tradition and common
Report) that mention this, were to be found in
Sir <hi>John Winn</hi>'s Library, an honourable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Knight, who was a curious collector of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other glorious exploits were
done by this King in <hi>France,</hi> who ceaſed not his
purſuits till he had got the Key of it hanging at

               <q>
                  <p>HERE I judge it no ways im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to be a little more
particular yet, touching the
claim of this King <hi>Edward</hi> to
the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and
what grounds the <hi>French</hi> had by vertue of this
<hi>Salique Law,</hi> for the excluſion of him claiming
from a Female; and firſt, we will briefly ſtate
his claim as it then ſtood, and then come to
the Law it ſelf, and it was thus. <hi>Phillip</hi> the
IV. ſurnamed the <hi>Fair</hi> had three Sons, <hi>Lewis</hi>
the <hi>Contentious, Phillip</hi> the <hi>Long,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi>
the <hi>Fair</hi> (all theſe ſucceſſively reigned after
him, and died without iſſue inheritable) he
had likewiſe a Daughter named <hi>Iſabel</hi> (I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
omit the other, being foreign to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
affair) married to <hi>Edward</hi> the II. King of
<hi>England,</hi> and ſo was Mother to <hi>Edward</hi> the III.
The iſſue male of <hi>Phillip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> thus failing,
<hi>Phillip</hi> Son and Heir of <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Valois
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110026:24"/>
Beaumont,</hi> &amp;c. (who was Brother to <hi>Phillip</hi>
the <hi>Fair)</hi> laid claim to the Crown as next
heir male againſt King <hi>Edward,</hi> who made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the objection of the <hi>Salique Law,</hi> that
(admitting it was as they aſſerted) yet he
was heir-male, though deſcended of a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and this in a publick aſſembly of the States
of <hi>France,</hi> firſt about the Protectorſhip of the
Womb (for Queen <hi>Joan</hi> Dowager of <hi>Charles</hi>
the <hi>Fair,</hi> was left with Child and delivered of
a Daughter named <hi>Blanch,</hi> afterwards Dutcheſs
of <hi>Orleans)</hi> was had in ſolemn diſpute by <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi>
on both ſides, and applied at length alſo
to the direct point of inheriting the Crown,
and ſo adjudged againſt King <hi>Edward.</hi> What
followed hereupon we have in ſome meaſure
traced in the Preceding Hiſtory of his Wars,
and are more at large recorded in <hi>Walſingham,
Froiſſart, Aemilius,</hi> and a multitude of more
modern Writers, whereby it appears, and will
in the Wars of this King's Succeſſors in <hi>France,</hi>
how the denial of this Soveraignty to him by
the <hi>French,</hi> coſt the lives of many thouſands of
their Men and involved that Country into
long and miſerable Calamities.</p>
                  <p>But as for the Law it ſelf whereby they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſuch an excluſion of him, it may well be
ſaid with <hi>Drayton</hi> in his <hi>Poly-Albion,</hi> that every
mouth ſpeaks of it, but few underſtand the
thing it ſelf, or ſo much as the <hi>Etymology</hi> of its
name, and therefore to clear this point as well
as we can, we are neceſſitated to aſcend a little
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110026:24"/>
higher then theſe times, wherein it was made
uſe of in prejudice to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> claim, and to
begin with the Original of the <hi>Francks,</hi> with
whom they affirm it was brought into <hi>France.</hi>
The <hi>Francks</hi> therefore (according to many
modern Hiſtorians) came originally from <hi>Aſia</hi>
into <hi>Germany,</hi> though others, and perhaps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
better grounds, make their original to be in
<hi>Germany</hi> it ſelf, but this is certain that upon the
decline of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they inhabited <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia,</hi>
a Province of <hi>Germany,</hi> and about the year
413, or according to <hi>Davila</hi> 119, invaded <hi>France</hi>
under <hi>Pharamond,</hi> whom they choſe to be their
King and Leader (which <hi>Pharamond</hi> they make
to be Son to <hi>Marcovir</hi> a Prince that governed
them in <hi>Franconia)</hi> but firſt, before they began
their Expedition, they held a general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
near unto a River named <hi>Sala,</hi> and there
by the advice of the <hi>Salij</hi> their Prieſts, or as
others of the <hi>Salians</hi> whom they make to be
the ſame with <hi>Francks,</hi> enacted Laws for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and amongſt the reſt, one for the
Excluſion of <hi>Females</hi> from inheriting the Crown,
which from the aforeſaid appellations (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one or all, it matters not) came to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated
the <hi>Salique Law.</hi> But <hi>Goropius</hi>
that fetches all our of <hi>Dutch,</hi> and this perhaps
more tollerably then many of his other <hi>Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies</hi>
(deriving the <hi>Salians</hi> name from <hi>Sal,</hi>
which in contraction he makes to be from <hi>Sadel</hi>
inventors whereof, ſays he, the <hi>Salians</hi> were)
interprets them to be as much as Horſe-men,

a name fitly applied to the War-like and moſt
noble Perſons of any Nation, as <hi>Equites</hi> in
<hi>Latin, Chevaliers</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Marchog</hi> in
<hi>Welch,</hi> do very well agree to, ſo that upon
the whole, the <hi>Salique Law</hi> is made by him to

given in the Parliament at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an ancient Will, deviſing all the <hi>Teſtator</hi>'s

interpreted to be a Fief; and who knows not
but that Fiefs were originally military Gifts,
but if things be ſo, how then comes <hi>Salique</hi> to
extend to the Crown, which is held to be

one Remark, that notwithſtanding the many

duſt that has been raiſed by the <hi>French</hi> under

to me, that the aforeſaid Dutcheſs of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

received with great Triumph between <hi>Aire</hi> and
the Camp, where he enters into the King's Pay,
and as a Teſtimony thereof, wore St. <hi>George</hi>'s
Croſs with a Roſe, the Town made no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
defence, for notwithſtanding the Garriſon
conſiſted of 4000, whereof were 600 good Horſe,
yet they capitulated the <hi>23d.</hi> and marched away
the day following; but the King did not think fit
to keep the place, and therefore raſed all the Works,
and burnt the Town, removing firſt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
that was in it to <hi>Aire;</hi> from hence he directs
his march towards the City of <hi>Turnay,</hi> and about
the <hi>21ſt.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> ſets down before it, it was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110026:40"/>
but weakly Garriſoned, but full of Inhabitants,

Capitulation ſurrendred; the Citizens which
were to the number of 60000 ſwearing Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to him. Here Sir <hi>Edward Poinings</hi> was made
Governour, and of this City <hi>Wolſey</hi> then the Kings

took the Field in Perſon, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> joining

great Army to ſuccour the Town, which was

a Battle, and ſo upon the approach of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
both Camps broke up.</p>
               <p>The Year following, the King raiſed a mighty
Army, the Front led by the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
the main Battle by the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> where the
King intended to be preſent himſelf alſo, and the
Rear by the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> attended with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

their march towards <hi>Muterell,</hi> and were as
they paſſed joined by the Emperors Forces under

extraordinarily well fortified and provided for its

wheels off towards <hi>Bolloign,</hi> where he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
<hi>July 19th.</hi> and pitched his Camp to the <hi>Eaſt</hi>

into a Valley after many ſharp skirmiſhes,
entred the lower Town deſerted by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
who under the covert of the Smoak, got
into the high Town undiſcovered; ſoon after
the Tower called, the <hi>Old Man</hi> was yielded up by
ſixteen Soldiers that kept it, which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcouraged not the Garriſon, who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make a vigorous Defence; on the <hi>26th.</hi> of
<hi>July</hi> the King arrives in Perſon, orders a Mount
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:110026:41"/>
to be raiſed upon the <hi>Eaſt-ſide</hi> planted with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
pieces of Cannon and Mortars, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
the Town very much, ſo that few
Houſes were left whole within it; in this diſtreſs
200 <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> under the conduct of
<hi>Joncurtio</hi> attempted to get into the Town in the
Night, and ſucceeded ſo well by the means of a
Prieſt that ſpoke <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that moſt of them were
got over the Trenches before diſcovered, and a
matter of 120 got in, the reſt being either ſlain
or taken; at length a peice of the Caſtle being
blown up, the King ſtormed the place, but did
not carry it; however the Cannon continuing
playing, and the Garriſon having loſt the beſt of
their Commanders and men in this Action, and
fearing as well as concluding that ſuch another
aſſault muſt carry the Town, thought it time
to Capitulate before things came to the laſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and ſo Articles were agreed upon, and the
Garriſon marched our with Bag and Baggage to
the number of 67 Horſe, 1563 Foot, 87 wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and 1927 Women and Children. On the
<hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> the King with the Sword bore
before him by the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> enters
<hi>Bolloign</hi> in Triumph, the Trumpets all the while
ſounding on the Walls, and two days after view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Place, cauſed St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church to be
pull'd down, and a mount to be made in the
Room of it for the ſtrengthning the Town, and
at his departure made Sir <hi>John Dudley</hi> Governor,
and on the firſt of <hi>October</hi> lands in <hi>England,</hi> next
year <hi>September 9th.</hi> Sir <hi>John Dudley</hi> then Admiral
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:110026:41"/>
lands with 6000 Men at <hi>Trey Port</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
burns the Town and Abby, and 30 Ships in the
Haven, with the loſs of 14 Men only. The
<hi>French</hi> attempted the recovery of <hi>Bulloign</hi> again
and again, but to little purpoſe, ſo that at length
a Peace was concluded, wherein it was agreed,
the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould pay King <hi>Henry</hi> 800000
Crowns within the term of Eight Years, and then
to have <hi>Bulloign</hi> reſtored to him; but whilſt the
Oath for Confirmation hereof was taken by both
Kings, Monſieur <hi>Chatillon</hi> began to make a new
<hi>Baſtillion</hi> at the very mouth of the Haven of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loign,</hi>
calling it <hi>Chatillon</hi>'s Garden; the Lord <hi>Grey</hi>
of <hi>Wilton</hi> then Governor of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> advertiſed
the King hereof by Sir <hi>Thomas Palmour,</hi> requiring
to know his pleaſure therein, the King adviſes
with his Councel, who all agree the Conditions
of Peace ought by no means to be infringed, and
therefore to let the <hi>Baſtilion</hi> ſtand, whereupon
the King ordered his Secretary to write to the
Lord <hi>Grey</hi> to that purpoſe, but then called to Sir
<hi>Thomas</hi> privily, and told him, that notwithſtanding
the Contents of that Letter, he ſhould from him
command the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> to raſe the Fortification
to the ground with all ſpeed, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> replyed,
That a meſſage by Word of Mouth contrary to
a Letter, would never be believed; well (ſaies
the King) tell him as I bid you, and leave the
doing of it to him. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> upon his arrival
at <hi>Bulloign,</hi> delivered the Governor the Letter,
and withall the Meſſage, who hereupon calls a
Council what to do, wherein they all agreed the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110026:42"/>
Letter ſhould be obey'd, to which the Lord <hi>Grey</hi>
himſelf ſaid nothing, but cauſed the Meſſage to
be written down <hi>verbatim</hi> from Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>
Mouth, and thoſe of the Council to ſet their
hands to it, and when this was done, the very
next Night he iſſues out and raſes the Fort to the
ground, and then ſent Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> back to the
King with Letters to acquaint him with what he
had done, who as ſoon as he ſaw him, asked aloud,
What will he do it or no? Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> delivering
the Letter, ſaid, Your Majeſty ſhall know by
theſe, but the King half angry, ſaid, Nay, Tell
me has he done it or no? and being told it was
done, he turn'd about to his Lords and ſaid, what
ſay you, my Lords, to this? <hi>Chatillon's</hi> Garden is raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down to the ground? whereunto one preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
anſwered, that he that had done it deſerved to
loſe his Head, to which the King immediately
replies, <hi>That he would rather loſe a dozen ſuch heads
as his was, then one ſuch ſervant that had done it,</hi>
and therewith commanded preſently the Lord
<hi>Grey</hi>'s Pardon to be drawn, which he ſent to him
with Letters full of thanks and promiſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
The cauſe why the King took this courſe
was this, leſt if he had given order in writing
for the raſing of the Fort, it might have come
to the knowledge of the <hi>French</hi> before it was
done, and ſo have been prevented. This may be
taken as an inſtance of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity;
and was the concluding act of
his Life as to Forreign Affairs, for he died not
long after, to wit, in the Year 1547. the Fifty

Sixth of his Life, and of his Reign the Eight and
Thirtieth.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of this War with <hi>France</hi> were partly reaſons

yet the deſign was purſued under the command
of the Earl of <hi>Linſey,</hi> who attempted ſeveral
times to force the Barricadoes of the River before
<hi>Rochel,</hi> but all in vain, or if he had, it had been
to no purpoſe, for the Victuals wherewith the
<hi>Rochellers</hi> ſhould have been relieved were all tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and 'twas well the <hi>French</hi> had no Fleet
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:110026:50"/>
there, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tackle and other matteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als

it in a manner all the Glory and Intereſt of the
reformed in <hi>France,</hi> but 'tis remarkable what
counſel concurred to the reducing of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
place, and what accidents followed after; The
<hi>French</hi> Army had been before it a long time, and
had made no conſiderable Progreſs in the Siege
when the Marqueſs <hi>Spinola</hi> returning from <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
into <hi>Spain,</hi> directed his courſe through
<hi>France,</hi> and hearing the King and Cardinal were
at the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> waited upon both, and
going to view the Works one day, asked the
Cardinal what they meant to do there, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
his Diſcourſe, ſaid, That as they mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
matters, there was no poſſibility of taking
the place, what muſt we do then ſaies the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,</hi>
Puſh! replies the Marqueſs, do as we have
done at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> make a Dyke at the Mouth of
the Harbour, and yo'll by that means ſtarve them
out; the Cardinal immediately takes up the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
ſets all hands on work, and with Immenſe
Labour and Celerity finiſhes the Dyke, which in
a ſhort time reduced the place to that ſtarving
Condition, that they were at length forced to
ſurrender at Diſcretion, and it is note-worthy
that as <hi>Leyden</hi> about 54 years before was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
preſerved from the hands of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
for being reduced to the laſt extremity, they
let looſe the Waters upon them, which the Dams
reſtrained before, and upon that the Army
march'd away, whereas had they ſtaid but two
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:110026:51"/>
or three days longer in the Neighbourhood,
they might have had an open paſſage to the
Town, for the Walls of it fell down to the
Ground, and a ſtrong <hi>Northerly</hi> Wind had clear'd
the Country of the Water, ſo <hi>Rochel</hi> by a quite
contrary fate had been ſurrendered but a very
few days, when the Dyke ſo far broke as that they
might have been relieved by Sea, had there been
a Fleet ready for that purpoſe. But when <hi>Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
came to the Council in <hi>Spain,</hi> he was ſo brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten
and ſnubb'd for his Adviſe to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
by the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> then prime Miniſter
of State and other Grandees, that he never after
could get his Money paid that was owing him,
and dyed a Begger and in utmoſt diſgrace; ſo
well did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> then underſtand their
true Intereſt, that as long as the Reformed could
make head in <hi>France,</hi> the Arms of that Kingdom
would be confined within its own limits, and
they and other Princes be leſs moleſted by thoſe
aſpiring and reſtleſs Neighbours, and this was the
unhappy end of this War between <hi>England</hi> and

once and that when the Fleet was divided; ſo
in this the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in all the Fights they had

and re-taken on each ſide, as <hi>Hall, Heye,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The King endeavouring to bring the <hi>French</hi> to a Battel,
they ſtrongly Encamped behind a Bullwork, beſides nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Paſſes, Hedges, and Breaſtworks before them, but the
undaunted <hi>Engliſh, Danes,</hi> and ſome others Encouraged
by His Majeſty's Heroick Example, and Lead on
by their Brave Commanders, had forced the Paſs,
and in all probability utterly Routed them, had
they been according to expectation Succoured by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations. But that neglected a great many Brave
Men, Officers, and Soldiers were Slain; as ſoon
after was the Worthy Lieutenant General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to force his Landing at <hi>Cameret</hi> Bay near <hi>Breſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> by this time, being made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Netherlands: The Duke of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi>
was ſent out with about 25000 Horſe and Foot
to Force the <hi>French</hi> Lines, which he Succeſsfully did,
and entering <hi>French Flanders,</hi> put it under Contribution,
and took great Booty. But the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the <hi>French</hi> main Army, taking this Advantage,
knowing our Camp was weakened by this large Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
bore down upon it near <hi>Landen</hi> to force the Lines,
where the Fight at a diſtance beginning by break of day,
and ſo coming on nearer, continued exceeding hot till
near Sun Set: When the <hi>French</hi> pouring on their great
Numbers, being double, ours forced a Paſſage into
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:110026:56"/>
the Camp, with the loſs of near 20000 of their beſt Men.
The King in this Bloody and long doubtful Fight, Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
the Conduct and Courage of an Experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
and Valiant Soldier, Leading up the Battalions
and Squadrons to the Face of the Enemy; but neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at laſt conſtrained him and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to
Retire, which they did in good Order, and the Army
being Recruited, ſoon took the Field again, and forced
the <hi>French</hi> to Retreat to their former Camp. And this
Year Died the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg;</hi> after which the
<hi>French</hi> did little of Moment, rather making in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
and on the <hi>Rhine</hi> a Defenſive, than Offenſive War. So
that <hi>Catinat</hi> was recalled from <hi>Savoy: Namure</hi> loſt and a
great many of their Party's cut off their Plots and Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems
likewiſe moſtly failing; ſo that being weary of
War they began earneſtly to ſeek for Peace; Imploring
the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to become a Mediator in it, and all
they have ſince done, as the laſt faint Stroak was to take
<hi>Barcelona</hi> in <hi>Catalonia;</hi> though it is thought had the
Vice-Roy been diligent in Succouring it, it could not
have fallen into their Hands: One part of it lying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and beſides this, Monſieur <hi>Ponti</hi> Plundered <hi>Cartage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
belonging to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and got
much Riches, having the Luck to Eſcape our Squadron
which was in Queſt of him.</p>
               <p>And now Peace being hearken'd to on all Sides, the
Ambaſſadors Plenipotentiaries met at the Kings Pallace
at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> and after many Memorials delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and Debates paſſing between them, came to a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Amicable Agreement. The <hi>French</hi> King by the
Treaty, being obliged to deliver up a great many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Places to the Confederates, and to comply with
many other advantageous Things; and particularly to
Reſtore the King of <hi>England</hi> the Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi>
with its Appendancies and Revenues, ſince it has been
Seized, and unjuſtly Detained: Alſo what has been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
during the War in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo the
Articles being Ratified, and Peace Proclaimed, the King
returned and paſſed through the City of <hi>London,</hi> in a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
manner on the 16th of <hi>November.</hi> 1697.</p>
