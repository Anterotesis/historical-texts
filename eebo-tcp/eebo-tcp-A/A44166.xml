            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We have indeed lately had dreadful <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations</hi> and <hi>Amazes, Stories</hi> of inſulting proud <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and their <hi>Curſes,</hi> more dreadful than <hi>Iſrael</hi> ever heard of all their 400 years of <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi> Nay, even amongſt our ſelves, we have had perfect and true <hi>Diſcoveries</hi> of whole <hi>Bands</hi> of <hi>Conſpirators; Gebal</hi> and <hi>Ammon, Amaleck</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtines, Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate, Turk</hi> and <hi>Jew, Atheiſt</hi> and <hi>True Proteſtant,</hi> all aſſociated, and threatning us with their <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Iſrael</hi> was oft delivered, and at the Expence of <hi>Wonders</hi> too; ſo have we been: And thoſe Old <hi>Egyptians</hi> grew but more deſperate when they ſaw thoſe <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi> and received ſuch confounding <hi>Defeats:</hi> So have we had Cauſe enough to ſuſpect of our <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that their <hi>Hearts</hi> were harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo, when we ſaw them go on ſo proudly, ſo impudently, notwithſtanding ſo clear <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries</hi> and <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> and continue ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in their <hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>Cruelty,</hi> of <hi>Flattery,</hi> of <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> of <hi>rebellious Obſtinacy;</hi> and that that

            <p>This ought to have been old <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Sence: For by unmanly <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>doubtings,</hi> we ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize our <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>diſhonour</hi> our God; when we make our ſelves <hi>Cowards</hi> inſtead of <hi>Conquerors,</hi> and dwindle our <hi>Chriſtian Courage</hi> into <hi>Fears</hi> and ſenceleſs <hi>Amazements,</hi> we fly from our Colours, we run away from our God; we disbelieve his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and diſtruſt his <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;</hi> we accuſe either his <hi>Power</hi> or his <hi>Will,</hi> and call in queſtion his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and ſeek <hi>help</hi> from our ſelves by our unworthy Doubts and Suſpitions of Evils; and conſequently we forfeit his <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance.</hi> Nay,

Without doubt, we have a very ſtrange <hi>Notion</hi> of God, if in any <hi>Danger</hi> we fly to the <hi>Devil</hi> to ſecure us: For all that is good God can beſtow on his Servants, and free them from all that is evil: Whatſoever is worth the having, the <hi>Sovereign</hi> of all has in Store for his Subjects: The goodneſs both of Himſelf and Creatures, the Forces of <hi>Heaven Earth</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> too, he rules as he pleaſes, to his own good purpoſes; and at eaſe can fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the moſt <hi>malicious Reſolves</hi> of the worſt of Men, and Correct all their <hi>noiſome Qualities:</hi> He can turn <hi>Fury</hi> into <hi>Peace, Malice</hi> into <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, Revenge</hi> into <hi>Love, miſchievous Deſigns</hi> into <hi>Order,</hi> and extract out of all, <hi>Glory</hi> to himſelf, <hi>Benefit</hi> to his Church, and true <hi>Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> to his Servants: And all this he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd.

            <p>Second, From thoſe many Inſtances of his <hi>care,</hi> in the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of this our Worſhip, this <hi>Religion</hi> reform'd and practis'd in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For the</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> God has reſolved to ſecure his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> in all Ages of the world. The <hi>Dragon</hi> and his <hi>Angels</hi> were quickly buſie to afflict and aſſault the <hi>righteous;</hi> but no ſooner began that <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but <hi>Michael,</hi> and his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> were raiſed, commiſſioned, and ſent againſt them; and they caſt out that great <hi>Dragon,</hi> overcame that old <hi>Serpent,</hi> called the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Sathan,</hi> which deceiveth the whole <hi>world,</hi>

and his <hi>Angels</hi> were caſt out with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12 8.</p>
            <p>Wonderfully remarkable has been the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> of God's People from the <hi>Creation;</hi> and that Inſtance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> none are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, when thoſe many, and ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Plagues were inflicted upon the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and ſtill they were free, brisk &amp; lively, not one feeble perſon among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And Chriſt has told his <hi>Diſciples, He will be with them to the end of the World:</hi> He walks in the midſt of the <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> and he that hath placed them, never ceaſes to watch them: He hath his <hi>Stars,</hi> his faithful <hi>Servants</hi> in his Right Hand, where they are ſafe, and is reſolved of all thoſe God hath given him, he will loſe none: But laſtly,</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> We have great Hopes and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to expect the <hi>Salvation of God,</hi> if we be true to our <hi>Religion,</hi> ſince we have ſo oft experienced his great <hi>care</hi> in the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of this our <hi>Reform'd Church.</hi> It has hitherto triumph'd over all thoſe ſo damnable <hi>Aſſaults,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97063:16"/>
thoſe deep helliſh <hi>Contrivances,</hi> and deſperate <hi>Attempts</hi> of its moſt ſubtle and malicious <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:</hi> That neither <hi>Invaſions,</hi> nor undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Plots,</hi> nor bloody <hi>Maſſacres,</hi> nor private <hi>Aſſaſſinations,</hi> nor (as was laſt deſigned us) all theſe aſſociated together, that not any thing, nor all that's deviliſh, tho' invented with the greateſt <hi>ſecurity,</hi> carried on with moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Secrecy,</hi> enforced by thoſe important <hi>motives</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> of <hi>Merit,</hi> of <hi>Envy</hi> of <hi>Pomp, Grandure</hi> and <hi>Conſcience;</hi> that theſe ſhould all be quaſh'd when there appeared the greateſt moral probability of ſucceeding, the Church remaining ſecure, not jealous, but otherwiſe charitably diſpoſed to moſt, if not all thoſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors;</hi> that notwithſtanding all theſe, this <hi>Church</hi> ſhould be maintained, its Honour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, the <hi>Plots</hi> diſcovered, the <hi>Enemies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and the <hi>Villany</hi> it ſelf hated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned: All this cannot be ſeen without a Wonder; this cannot be ſolv'd, but by the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of him, who only is able

to deliver us. It evidently proves, that God is not ſo weary of our more hearty fervent <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and ſounder <hi>Faith,</hi> as inſtead thereof to be willingly ſerv'd with falſe, formal, or ſloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careleſs <hi>Addreſſes.</hi> As he ſcatter'd that brave <hi>Armado</hi> with the <hi>Breath</hi> of his <hi>Mouth;</hi> as he ſate in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and laught at <hi>P owder</hi> and <hi>Faggots,</hi> and <hi>undermining,</hi> and brought to <hi>light</hi> thoſe <hi>deeds</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs:</hi> As by his great <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> he has ſince diſcover'd theſe late cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and dreadful <hi>Deſigns</hi> of <hi>men</hi> amongſt us: As he has diſſolv'd <hi>Covenants</hi> and <hi>Aſſociations,</hi> and brought to nought <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Excluſion;</hi> ſo we have great hopes he will go on <hi>conquering</hi> and to <hi>conquer:</hi> For he that keepeth <hi>Iſrael</hi> neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps: He ſees the <hi>Deſigns</hi> are againſt <hi>him,</hi> his <hi>Honor,</hi> his <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> He is challenged to the Field. <hi>I will up then, ſays God, and avenge me of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; thoſe that will not I ſhould reign over them ſhall be ſlain before me.</hi>

               <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Bowels</hi> of <hi>Compaſſion;</hi> while there is a God that judgeth in the <hi>Earth,</hi> he will be the <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Preſervation</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People:</hi> And 'tis only required of us to be godly, if we would be happy; to be true to our <hi>Religion,</hi> if we would have that ſecured to us: Then it would defend both it ſelf and us: Then we ſhould be for ever bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Then all our <hi>Enemies,</hi> the <hi>Enemies</hi> of our <hi>King,</hi> and of our <hi>Church, as by Law eſtabliſh'd,</hi> the <hi>Enemies</hi> of our <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> who under the ſpecious <hi>Pretexts</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>tenderneſs of Conſcience,</hi> thirſt after our <hi>Confuſion,</hi> our <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,</hi> and our <hi>Blood,</hi> would howl in envy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair in Solitarineſs; tho' they roar as <hi>Lyons,</hi> and raven it as <hi>Wolves,</hi> and reſt not Day nor Night, like the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Angels,</hi> ſhall in the end prove their own <hi>Tormentors,</hi> and vent their <hi>Curſes</hi> on themſelves.

            <p>There remains now only a <hi>Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of thoſe honeſt juſt Endeavors, to ſave our ſelves, and diſcover the Ginns of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, which we have expreſs <hi>Warrant</hi> for from <hi>Almighty God.</hi> There are <hi>evil, factious, diſcontented,</hi> and <hi>quarrelſom</hi> Spirits amongſt us, that are the <hi>Troublers</hi> of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that would tear us in pieces, diſſolve the <hi>Government,</hi> and ſhipwrack our <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Safety.</hi> They would do with our whole Nation as the evil <hi>Spirit</hi> did to that poor Man's Son, mentioned St. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 9.

words, when he was about to caſt out that unclean pernicious Spirit, <hi>This ſort</hi> (ſays he) <hi>comes not out but by prayer and faſting.</hi> Other things, 'tis true, are required of our <hi>Governors,</hi> the <hi>Prudence, Courage</hi> and <hi>Vigilance</hi> of whom at this time ſo honourably and eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, makes it impudent in any to pretend to directthem. But for us of the ſame <hi>Level</hi> with theſe diſcontented murmuring People, this is not only the moſt juſtifiable <hi>Method;</hi> but for this ſeaſon more eſpecially worthy of our <hi>Thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then continually beg of God, That his <hi>Protection,</hi> his <hi>Deliverance</hi> may be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to us: Let us all heartily pray, That he, who is the God of Peace, would maintain <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> amongſt us now and ever: That he would root up all thoſe <hi>Seeds of Sedition,</hi> of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> that are ſowed and grow up amongſt us: That he would diſpoſſeſs our Land of all thoſe evil Spirits that are enter'd into it, thoſe <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi>

that lurk in <hi>Dens,</hi> and <hi>Holes,</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of the Earth, on purpoſe to amuſe and affright us from our <hi>Duty,</hi> and then devour us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that Men amongſt us may ſit cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in their right Minds, <hi>glorifie God, and ſin no more:</hi> That <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> may kiſs each other amongſt us; that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Order, Love</hi> and <hi>Loyalty, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> might dwell with us to the laſt: And that he would grant to our Gracious Sovereign a long, glorious, and peaceable Reign here, with the <hi>Hearts, Affections,</hi> and <hi>conſtant Prayers</hi> of all his People, and hereafter <hi>eternal Reſt,</hi> with a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>immortal Glory.</hi>

            <p>And then for Faſting, would we be free from all Evils, the Evils of Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and ſtill live in Peace and Safety; would we enjoy our moſt excellent <hi>Religion,</hi> and un-interrupted <hi>Quiet,</hi> we muſt ſubdue all <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Paſſions,</hi> all inordinate Deſires, vain Love, and ſilly doating upon earthly things; that our Souls may not be darken'd or clouded
