            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For plaine explication of the truth, ye shall vnderstand that there be two Bulles. The one conteineth a power and forme to pardon, assoyle, and reconcile all such as would returne from the Christian Religion now taught in England, which they call veresie, and from obeying our Quéene &amp; her lawes, which they sclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derously call schisme, to the bosome of the Chirch of Rome which we may truely call Helles mouth.</p>
            <p>The dispensation publishing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of this Bull was committed to Doctor <hi>Harding,</hi> and to many other seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, not onely to relieue those Popish Patriarkes with the gaine of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but specially to send out those Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papistes with that Bull of reconcilement

            <p>With these Bulles and this proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of wages, they haue bene gathering of rebelles euer since the yeare 1567. and haue withall geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to very many of them prest money to be ready in rebellions, that is, certaine papers and badges of sundry formes, some with a figure of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, some with fiue woundes, and some other.</p>
            <p>Since which time, namely in the ende of Februarie 1569. when the late rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was redy layed and in hatching, the Popes holinesse hath decréed an other Bull, no dout at the speciall sute, procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, instance, and importunate calling on of our Englishe traitors, and among

other <hi>D. Harding</hi> and the rest that procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the other Bulles.</p>
            <p>In this is conteined an arrogant, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall, and blasphemous taking to himselfe the power, as committed to him from God, to destroy, transpose, and alter kingdomes at his pleasure, a number of vile and horrible sclanders and vncomely naminges of our Quéene, such as a good subiect can hardly heare with patience, the very effect of a great part of the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were translated, &amp; finally his lewd presumptuous sentence of her maiesties depriuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in so spitefull, abhomiable, villanous, and traitorous forme as is not to be rehersed. This is the Bull that was set vp at the Bishops gate.</p>
            <p>It seemeth by all probabilitie, and no dout vpon examinations it wil so fall out, that the originall of this Bull sealed was among our rebelles, and as it is thought) brought them by <hi>Markenfeld</hi> or some such other, or deliuered them vpon their conference with strangers, and kept close amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them ready to be published, so sone as they should haue bene able to get into their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany such a hed as they desired to set vp after our Quéene, or such strength

               </gap>ute of the olde tale of <hi>Cassandra</hi> kyng <hi>Pryames</hi> daughter of Troy.

            <p>Onely this I will say, that it may be that for our sinnes we haue <hi>Cassandraes</hi> plague, though truth be tolde vs, it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblie not beleued.

Their horse with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouyng shooke, and they might heare the very sound of the armour within hym. In this Bull the euidences are plaine of open treason, and the very effect of our rebelles proclamation tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Lay this to our case, I will compare no more.</p>
