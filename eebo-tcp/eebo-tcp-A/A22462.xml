            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therfore I maruel not that the faithfull there amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you should with so great diligence and deuotion as you write, gather vp such peeces of his body, or garmentes, as they could without daunger come by, for that was the maner of the first and best Christians towardes the Martyrs of their time, which caused their aduersaries, to throw their bones, and asshes into the sea, or other wise to desace them, <hi>Euseb. hist. li.</hi> 4 <hi>ca.</hi> 14. <hi>Sozom. li.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.

Where, if the reportes be trew that commeth out of England hither, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonned for the Catholike faith there, are often in great danger of staruing, through the feare the protestants put their charitable relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in, for their almeses bestowed vpon them: but to the matter.</p>
               <p>ABOVT two moneths since, there came to this Citie, one Richard Atkins borne or dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling latly in a towne named Rosse, foure miles from Chepstow, one that perchance you haue heard of before, for he had bene whipped o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and either thrust into Bridewell or Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in London for certaine lewde speaches against the Quene, and had suffered death as is thought, had he not bene deemed a mad man. He was of no great yeres, of a meane stature, an alborne buss he, and readiss he bearde, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation a nailer, or a nailesmithe, wherewith his handes were as hard and dried as might be, altogether vnlettered, sauing, that he could write his owne name, which it seemed he learned very lately, he did it so slowly and so rudely, and read a litle Englishe, specially of the booke which he was acquainted withall. which was a litle new testament tourned out of Beza his latin, into our tonge. For his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he said that till he was xix yeres old he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13023:5"/>
was a Catholike or papist, for he vsed the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes indifferently, after that xix yeres a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, after the Englishe vse, and now at last three yeres, of this forther faithe: some pointes whereof you shall heare anone. The mad fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low made him self as a prophet, and partly for shew thereof, put himself into strange and figuratiue attire. Next his body he had a ragged wollen garment, then a dublet and breeches of hard bourned rude lether, aboue that a leuse wede of a calues skinne like to a Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sock, or rather like a scapuler of the religious, reaching no farther then his midback behynd, and his nauill before, hauing the figure of a paire of gallowes sowde fast vpon the same in redde clothe bothe on the backe and the brest, aswell for signification that he sought to be persecuted for the gospel, as for prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that he should die vpon the gallowes for his faith. Aboue all this furniture he had a side beggers cloke of very course stuffe as a man should see. So that for this apparell only he was much gazed at in euery corner. And in that sort he went not long after his arriuall, into S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Church, where among all the people ther assembled he did raue and rage with lowe exclamations they could not tell against what or whom, and all in Englishe, none vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, but euery one pitying him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing him to be distract of his wit, some coniecturing him to be an Englisheman, mads speedy relation thereof to the Cardinall. of S. Sixtus who is the protector of our nation that by his order the miserable man might be

prouided for (as in this Citie thereis the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest relief, for all sortes, that is in the world.) Immediatly the Cardinall commaunded he should be brought to the Englishe College, and so he was the same forenone, hauing at the same time besides his other maladies of mind, a very feruent feuet. Where they cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed him with meate and other things plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, some of the elder sort also questioning with him of his meaning and the causes of his comming to Rome. To whom he vttered for answer many blasphemies against God, and furiously railed against the Pope and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and other holy things of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, professing that he came to that place purposely that he might be killed for Christ, and that he would from thence into Turkie if he could not attaine the same in Rome. All which the studentes attributed to furie and phrensie, and therfor made no matter of his execrable wordes, but made much of the miser till the next day towardes euenning, at which time order was giuen that he should be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the better curing of his agew to the Hospitall of S. Spirit, as he was, where he was kept well for certaine daies, till his feuer was past. But being from thence dimissed and fully recouered of his disease, he walked the streates and haunted publike places of resorte continually crying out in his owne language against the Catholike religion, the Pope, and he Citie, affirming to Englishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mett with all, &amp; others that vnderstoode our language, that he would tary so long in
