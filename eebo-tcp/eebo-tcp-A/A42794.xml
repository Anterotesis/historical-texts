            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the Vertues of Great Persons are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
dangerous to themselves, is too manifest
in the Liberty I have taken to prefer the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
History to your Graces Patronage, your
own Affability, and Bounty having procur'd
you that Inconvenience, and Encourag'd me
to a Dedication; I should not otherwise, and at a greater distance
of Favour, have presum'd to impose upon your Protection: a
Truth I have not only thought fit to put your Grace in mind of,
the better to excuse my Presumption; but have moreover been
prompted thereunto by an honest Vanity I have, the World
should take notice, that how private soever my Life has been,
I have not altogether convers'd with Obscurity: but that I have
had the Honour to be sometime known unto, and to have been
Favour'd by one of the greatest Prelates, and the best Men upon
Earth.</p>
                  <p>Thus (my Lord) by my own ill govern'd, though otherwise
not very Criminal Ambition, I am put upon a necessity of
seeming to accuse that Vertue, I have so just reason to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie;
and from whence I have deriv'd so many advantages, to
colour a boldness, that would otherwise admit of no Excuse.
Neither will this I fear serve me against the Censures of the
Time, by whom I expect notwithstanding to be accus'd of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
sort of Vanity, that something of mine may be worthy
your Graces Acceptation; which if I should absolutely deny,
the Dedication it self would then convince me of a premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
injury to your Name. I cannot therefore avoid confessing
<pb facs="tcp:63412:4"/>
I think this History so fine a thing in it self, that if I be not
the worst Translator that ever Writ (and there is no Triumph
due to the best) it may very well endure the light, and pass
amongst good natur'd men, with other things, that every
day sally from the Press; which is my true opinion of it, and
nothing more.</p>
                  <p>A more Illustrious Image of Vertue, and Honour than is
here represented in the Person of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> in my
little Reading I have no where met with, a more exemplary
Piety, a braver Courage, a more shining and unblemish'd
Loyalty, more inviolate Friendships, nor a nobler Constancy in
all the shocks of Fortune; so that I have sometimes thought,
had there not been a little mixture of Humane Frailty amongst
so many excellent Qualities as he was Master of to a very great
perfection, the Story would have look'd like an Idea of an Hero
only, and rather a Character of what a Brave man should be,
than what any man ever truly was. There are indeed some
Passages in his History, that are not altogether to be justified,
though none that may not (methinks) be slipt over amongst so
many better Pages of his Life, like a Counterfeit Piece in a great
Summe of Current Gold.</p>
                  <p>If (my Lord) I have been so successful as to make a tolerable
Copy of this brave Original, and that my endeavour be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
accepted, I have my end. I have learn'd that the Best men
are not always the hardest to please, and ever the aptest to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give;
which being granted, I shall appear in a good measure ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
in the great freedom I have taken to recommend my Book
to your Graces perusal: and it has so much the better Title to
your Acceptance, as it is the Fruit of the most innocent part of
my time; and offer'd with a Heart as grateful for the many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
I have receiv'd from your Graces Bounty, and as full of
Honour and Reverence for your Person, and Dignity as any
Man, who in a better, and more studied stile may take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to subscribe himself,</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving about three Years since, and in the Vacancy
of a Country Life, taken this Volume in hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I had gone through the three first Books, I
was call'd away first by Employment, and after dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd
from that, taken off by so long, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
a Sickness, that I found my self ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unfit for any undertaking of this, or any other kind, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
had almost given over all thoughts of proceeding in a work, which
at some melancholy times I believ'd I might not live to finish. Being since
restor'd to a better state of Health, and coming to review my Papers,
either the dislike of what I had already done, the shame of having been
so long in doing it, the indisposition my Disease left still hanging upon
me, the bulk of what I had undertaken, the little leisure I conceiv'd I
might have wherewith to perform it, or all together, had almost perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me to hold on the same resolution, and for ever to let it alone: till
recollecting my self, I remembred I had a greater Obligation upon me
(which nevertheless I do not think fit to publish in this place) to go
through with what I had already begun, than was to be dissolv'd by any
truant Humour, or private Aversion of my own. I therefore reassum'd
my former purpose, and some months since took the Book again in good
earnest in hand, which when I have said, any ingenious person may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
wonder, how a man in good earnest, and that has so little to do
in the world as I have, could be all this tedious time about such a piece of
Work as this: To which (if what I have already said will not serve for
an excuse) I shall answer, that although by my incapacity, my ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
or both, I stand excus'd from publick Employment, I have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
so much private concern of my own to divert me, and so few
moments to bestow upon my self, that I wonder 'tis done so soon: An
Apology I might how<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver have spar'd, since my haste will I fear be too le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
in every Line.</p>
                  <p>And now that I have told my Reader why I have proceeded so slowly
in the work, I conceive it time (as men in Prefaces usually do) to give
some account of the motives that induc'd me to undertake it at all;
which though they will arise to no better reasons than what other men
usually give for their Follies in such cases, will nevertheless serve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to satisfie such as are kindest to me, and who will not render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
over-hard to be satisfied in a thing wherein I presume they would
themselves be content to see me justified. It was not therefore out of any
<pb facs="tcp:63412:5"/>
ambition I had to be again in Print, I having suffer'd too much that way
already; nor to be reputed a good Translator, the best whereof sit in the
lowest Form of Writers, and no one can be proud of the meanest Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
neither shall I pretend to be put upon it by my Friends, for that
would tacitly imply something of opinion they must have of my ability
that way, and I must be so just to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the greater part of them being better <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> than I pretend to
be, such as have read the Original, could never wish to see it blemish'd
by so unskilful a hand: neither was I prompted to it by any design of
advantage, that consideration being ever very much below my
thoughts; nor to oblige the world, that being as much above my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation:
but having an incurable humour of scribling upon me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
I could not choose a braver Subject for my Friends diversion, and

as much Variety of Revolution, and accident as is any where in no larger

the Character of Honour that continues throughout the whole thred
of his Life) was the great example of uncorrupted Loyalty the Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi> ever retain'd in all his Exigencies, and Disgraces; a
Vertue which though none of the Nobility of this Kingdom (for whom
this is chiefly design'd) need to be informed in, 'tis nevertheless a glorious
Record, and ought to be in History, that succeeding times may see after
what manner a good Subject (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow powerful soever) ought to behave
himself, how; or how unkindly soever his Prince shall please to dispose
of his Person, and Fortune. This consideration it was, that after a first,
and second reading of this brave life (though every year of it contains
variety enough to furnish out a History) which I must confess to have
been the greatest temptation that decoy'd me into this undertaking, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when I reflected upon the times we our selves have too lately seen,
when Loyalty was not very much in fashion, or not to be owned withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

manifest ruine. And although I know very well we have Examples
enow of Vertue, Bravery, Wisdom, Fidelity, and Honour in persons of
our own Nation, as well Kings as Subjects, Princes of the Blood, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
Ecclesiasticks, and Statesmen, both of Former, and the present
Age, and the meanest of those Lives sufficient to create as beautiful a
Story; yet of those the Dead are many of them already recorded beyond
my imitation, and to Write in Praise of the Living (besides the danger
of standing suspected, either of Flattery, or Design) were to offend the
modesty natural to all generous minds.</p>

In the next place, I am to acquaint my Reader, that the Author of
this History <hi>Monsieur Girard</hi> was Secretary to the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
and a very extraordinary person in himself, as you will find in the
Texture, Disposition, and Elegancy of the whole, in despight of my ill
handling; by which advantages he must doubtless be able to give the best,
and truest account of any w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ever, both of his Masters private Affairs,
and the general Transactions of that time, he being (especially in the
Duke's later Years) continually employ'd by him, and the Duke himself
being so eternally upon the Scene of Action, that we shall seldom find
him retir'd, and alone in the whole course of his Life. And although his
dependence upon this great person may render his testimony suspected to
some, he is however so generally allow'd by the most Intelligent, and such
as are best read in the Affairs of that Kingdom, for a faithful Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
that the truth of the Story ought to Balance any other defect of
the work.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, in the behalf of my Bookseller Mr. <hi>Brome</hi> (to whose Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
I owe more, than I can pay him by this Impression) I am to say,
that although I dare not answer how far this History may suffer by my
Oversights, or Mistakes, or by the Faults escap'd the Press, which (I
know not by what accident) are very many, and some of them very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable;
yet I dare pronounce it one of the best things I have seen in
that Language, I do not mean for the Excellency, or Harmony of the
Stile, which in the Original it self, though the words there be very Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,
Elegant, and admirably well chosen, is notwithstanding none of
the smoothest I have read: but for the importance of the Subject,
wherein you will find much of the Policy of that time, not only of
<hi>France</hi> it self, but moreover of the Courts of <hi>England, Rome, Spain,
Savoy, Germany, Sweeden,</hi> and the <hi>States of the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
together with a Narrative of all the most celebrated Battles, Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes,
Rencounters, Combats, Sieges, Assaults, and Stratagems for
above threescore years together, with the Descriptions of the Strengths,
Situations, and distances of Cities, Towns, Castles, Cittadels, Forts,
Rivers, Countries, Seigneuries, Iurisdictions, and Provinces, and all
this collected, and deliver'd by a Iudicious, and Impartial Hand, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>raordinary
effect of a <hi>French</hi> Pen, that Nation (especially in Records
that immediately concern their own Honour) having been commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to be very civil to themselves: So that methinks the Dignity of the
Subject, and the Ingenuity of the Author consider'd, a work how unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
soever perform'd by me, undertaken nevertheless meerly for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
benefit, and delight, ought not to be discountenanc'd, nor very ill
receiv'd.</p>
                  <p>Yet do I not (though in the foregoing Paragraph, I have discover'd
something of the Charlatan in the behalf of my Bookseller) hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:63412:6"/>
to beg any favour for my self, or by these large promises to bribe
my Reader into milder Censures; neither do I think it fit to provoke him
by a defiance; for that were to be an ill Man, as well as an ill Writer. I
therefore franckly, and without condition expose my self to every mans
Iudgment, of which such as appear civil to me are my Friends, and I
shall owe them the same respect, when it shall be my turn to Iudg, as it
is now to be censur'd: Those who will not be so, I shall threaten no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than to put them in mind, that if ever they attempt any thing of
the same nature, they will then lie under the same disadvantage I now
do, and consequently may meet with the same Injustice.</p>

that I have not been sparing of a few words, to the end so many brave
and glorious Actions might be the better, and more truly known.</p>
                  <p>In treating of a Person so highly concern'd as the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>
was in the general Affairs of the Kingdom, I have been constrain'd to tip
up a great many passages already upon Record, and so ancient, as near an
hundred years ago; by which means my work will in many places be
stript of that grace of Novelty, which of it self would have been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Ornament to it: but having observ'd withal that many of the
things already publish'd, have not been deliver'd with that laudable can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
and indifferency (the principal Vertue of Historians) that the most
exact have omitted many circumstances (which are oft-times preferable
to the main scope of the thing it self) and that several Exploits, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
where of was absolutely, and indisputably due to him, whose Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
I have undertaken, have been either disguis'd, or unjustly, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to others who had no share in the execution, I conceiv'd that by the
reverence to truth I stood oblig'd to clear those mistakes, and in several
passages to vindicate the Duke's honest intentions, against such at were
evidently passionate against his person, and emulous of his Honour.</p>
                  <p>These indeed were the principal inducements that have sometimes
tempted me out of the precise limits of the Duke of <hi>Espernon's</hi> Life, and
that have administred occasion to stretch some of his Actions beyond
their natural extent, and beyond what directly touch'd his own person;
not that I needed notwithstanding to seek matter out of the way of my
design; for where could I possibly have chosen out a more ample or a
more illustrious Subject? there is hardly any so notable event, or so high
performance within the prospect of History, or in the vicissitude of
worldly revolution, of which glorious, and extraordinary Examples are
not here to be found Could any thing be imagin'd more active, or more
<pb facs="tcp:63412:7"/>
vigorous in his prosperity, or more constant, and even in all the disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that befel him, than this great man was? Since then upon these two
principles, Valour and Fortitude, all life depends, and that from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a man's Behaviour in Prosperities, and his manly supporting the
Adversities of Fortune, are extracted all the precepts for the conduct of
Humane Life, what utility may we not propose to our selves, from the
great examples both of the one, and the other, which are every where
to be met with in the current of this History?</p>
                  <p>It is not nevertheless, that we may not perhaps sometimes observe
some flying Clouds in this Serene Firmament of Vertue, that constancy
so much celebrated for the most eminent quality in him, of whose Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I have undertaken to give an account, having not always been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
from censure. He has been sometimes accus'd of too severe, and
too obstinate a humour, in that he would never give place to time, nor
accommodate himself to the necessity of Affairs; and that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yield, not even then when he saw he could not contend, but to his
own manifest Ruine. I cannot deny, but that in this particular there was
something to have been wish'd, if men would have the Vertue of the
Great confin'd within the narrow bounds of common Prudence: but
were it not in the mean time to offer violence to those great Souls, eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so much above the ordinary condition of men, to subject their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Rules of others? It is very true that this Duke could never
temporize in the least, nor ever gave way to any thing that justled his
Humour; that on the contrary he has often pusht things on to the last
extremes, and that from very trivial and light beginnings he has pull'd
upon himself many, and great Disgraces: but if in this particular any
thing may be found wherewith to reproach his Conduct, what Praises
are not due to his Courage, that could never bend, nor bow under the
highest Persecutions? Something essential would have been wanting
in his Life, had he been always happy; and he contributed no little to his
glory, in sometimes promoting his own Misfortunes, they having made
a discovery of Qualities in him, which in a continual prosperity would
have been totally buried, and conceal'd.</p>
                  <p>So brave an Argument does, I must confess, deserve a far better Pen
than mine to do it right, and I am sufficiently conscious of my own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
to think my self infinitely below the dignity of my Subject;
neither was it any vain design of publishing my own Name, that prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
me to this attempt; and had I had no greater a reverence to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of another, than any respect to my own, I had never embarqu'd
in this design. I very well understand to what a man exposes himself
who submits to a publick Judgment; but I have consider'd withal,
that it were a very great weakness to decline an honourable Undertaking
for fear of a little Censure. I do herein discharge a Debt, and I do it
with the best I have. I owe all things to him whose Life I have here
<pb facs="tcp:63412:7"/>
Written, he brought me up from my younger years by his bounty, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
me by his Favour, in the height of his Disgraces honour'd me
with his confidence, and trust; he moreover gratified me with several,
and those signal Benefits: Is it not just then, that at least I should mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
my gratitude by a few words?</p>
                  <p>Yet although I stand prepossess'd by so many Obligations, I am never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
more certain that no one shall find me out of that Consideration,
corrupted in my Benefactors Favour; who having undertaken to give
a true and sincere account of things, I shall by no means impose upon
the publick belief: Neither do I indeed design his Elegy herein, but
meerly to give an exact Narrative of his Actions, wherein the native
truth shall be the only part of History he shall receive from my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
all the rest shall be wanting, and I have had no little ado to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my self to give my Book so eminent a Title, knowing what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is due to that great Name, and to such, as in their better Writings
have given him his just Character of Honour.</p>
                  <p>I have not throughout my whole Work spoken to the disadvantage of
any one person, either out of Animosity or Design; and if m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

went hand in hand with the Interests of my Master in the time of his
Life, they also went out with his, when extinguish'd by the hand of
Death. I do not nevertheless pretend to have been so dextrous, as to have
satisfied all those of whom I have been oblig'd to speak in the order of
the following Treatise, some Historical Truths having perhaps slipt in,
which may not be very acceptable to such, as would have all things gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, and will not allow to others the liberty of a bare recital:
but I did not conceive my self oblig'd to submit to that magisterial Law,
and therefore have reserv'd the liberty (not extending to injury) an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man ought to be jealous of, that he may keep himself from being a
slave to other mens humours by a mean complacency.</p>
                  <p>I could some years ago have deliver'd this work to the Light, and had
then done it, had not the disorders of the time put all things into so great
confusion, that it was long before I could gather my <hi>Mesmoires,</hi> which
were dispers'd into several hands, together again. Now at last by the
command of those who have most Authority with me, and at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of my Friends, I here present them to your view. I wish they may
give satisfaction both to the one, and the other, and I could be content
that satisfaction might proceed further, and extend to the generality of
men: but being I cannot reasonably expect that good Fortune upon
any other account, than meerly as an act of Favour, I shall make no
difficulty to beg that grace of all such as shall have the Curiosiry, or the
Patience to read these followng Volumes.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>OHN Lewis de Nogaret,</hi> and <hi>de la Valette</hi> Duke
of <hi>Espernon,</hi> whose History I attempt to write,
though he were, in the Progress of a long Life,
for the most part the Favourite of Fortune, stood
notwithstanding no less oblig'd to Nature for
the advantages he came into the world withal
by his Noble Extraction.<note place="margin">The Dukes Extraction.</note> He was descended from an Illustrious
Family in the Higher <hi>Gascony,</hi> and so ancient, that it has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
above five hundred years from Male to Male, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
a truth I could without much difficulty prove, out of
the Records, and Evidences in my Custody, did not his Genealogy,
already drawn by a more skilful hand, render that pains unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in this place. I shall therefore only undertake a Narrative
of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rincipal Actions of his Life, without troubling my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or my self, with a superfluous Catalogue of his Ancestors.</p>
                  <p>The matter, of which I intend to treat, is of it self so ample, as might
find work enough for a better Pen; and although birth be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
by all to be the foundation, upon which all superstructures
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63412:13"/>
of Fortune do ordinarily erect themselves, I should not neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
make any mention of this Dukes, had not the merit and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Iohn de Valette</hi> his Father such a relation to the History of
his Son, as will not permit their names to be separated without
manifest injury to the one, or the other.</p>
                  <p>Finding my self then oblig'd to look a little back, and to say
something of his Father before I come to him, I shall tell you (with
the best Historians of that time) that he was rank'd amongst the
greatest Captains of this Kingdom; and that by the meer conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Prudence, and Valour, without any advantage of
Favour, he was made <hi>Camp-Master</hi> to the Light Horse of <hi>France,</hi>
and the Kings Lieutenant General in <hi>Guienne;</hi> a Province aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in Nobility, and Gentry, and men of such spirits, as would
have made a difficulty of their Obedience to any Superiour,
where there had not been an indisputable concurrence of Merit,
and Blood. But these two qualities, happily meeting in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Mounsier de la Valette,</hi> gave him so great an interest, if not
so absolute a power in that Countrey, that notwithstanding it was
during the time of his Government unquiet and mutinous in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places, and in some even to a contempt of the Kings Royal
Power; yet his Authority, never received in those very places the
least affront, or contradiction. He commanded Armies in chief,
which were led, paid, arm'd, provided for, and kept together
by his Conduct and Care; and I my self have seen many Acts and
Monuments of that time which sufficiently discover the Power
and Dignity he preserv'd entire, even in the most difficult functions
of his charge.</p>
                  <p>It was he, who in the Battels of <hi>Dreux,</hi> of <hi>Iarnac,</hi> and of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countour,</hi>
who in the Ski<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all the most signal actions of his time, exercising the Office of
<hi>Comp-Master</hi> to the Light Horse, by his courage and conduct won
to himself a principal share of the Honour due to the successes of
the Royal Arms; and chiefly in the Battel of <hi>Iarnac,</hi> which he
undertook with so much prudence, and fought it with so much
bravery, that<note n="*" place="margin">D' Avila.</note> they who write the Transactions of that time, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
supereminently to him the reputation of that dayes Victory.</p>
                  <p>It was he that made the brave Retreat of <hi>Houdan,</hi> one of the
most memorable Exploits of that Age, which, though it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
by other Writers, deserves to be recited here; and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
which I have several times heard repeated to the Duke
his Son, will not render a relation suspected that stands justified

                  <p>The <hi>Hugonot</hi> Army had laid siege to the City of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and

that of the King was dispos'd to relieve it; but that being a work
of greater preparation, and leisure, than the condition of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
could well admit, the Royal Party conceiv'd, that to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
the Enemies Camp with frequent Alarums would give the
defendants some convenient respite, till a sufficient succour
might be made ready to come. <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> was
he that would take upon him to execute this design,<note place="margin">Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of <hi>Iohn de la Valette</hi> the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

keeping himself for the most part on Horseback, he gave so
good an account of what he had undertaken, that few dayes past
wherein he obtain'd not some signal advantage over the Enemy:
Now beating up one quarter, now alarming another, with such an
active and unwearied diligence, as put the Enemy to an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
duty, and forc'd them continually to stand to their Arms.</p>
                  <p>The Admiral <hi>Coligny,</hi> who commanded at this Leaguer under
the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> nettled at the inconveniences his Army suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by these frequent inroads of <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette,</hi> medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
with himself a revenge, and to lay a Trap to catch him: to
which purpose he stole privately from his Camp with 3500 Horse;
<hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> having but 500 in all, lay baiting his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in a Wood for the execution of his enterprize. The Admiral,
who had observ'd his motion, surpriz'd him in this posture, set
upon him, and charg'd him, almost before perceiv'd: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all which, he found a brave resistance, and <hi>Mounsieur de
la Valette</hi> without being astonish't, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>either at the presence of so
great a Captain, or the inequality of their Armies, having given
his Souldiers time to mount, charg'd him several times with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and made good his Retreat for six Leagues together in
the open Countrey of <hi>Beausse,</hi> the Admiral never being able, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the retreat, either to break his order, or force him to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
engagement: an action of so high a repute, that there are few
Historians who have not set a particular mark upon it for one of
the most memorable of that time.</p>
                  <p>If we yet pass from his publick actions of Command, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the private engagements of his single person, I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
fit you with as remarkable a story of that kind as you have
read. <hi>Iane Albret</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> a great Fautress to those of
the Reformed Religion, of which she her self also made publick
Profession, desirous to draw all places within her demean into the
same perswasion, presented her self before <hi>Leitoure</hi> to be there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.
A Town of so advantageous a situation, and therefore so
considerable in <hi>Guienne,</hi> that the successive Governours of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
have ever had a particular regard to the preservation of that
place, <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> who had received private Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63412:14"/>
from King <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, to have an eye to the actions of
this Princess, and to frustrate her designs; but with all outward
shew of respect (the King being unwilling to break openly with
her) having intelligence, that she meant to attempt that place, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
her by his diligence, and at her coming refus'd her entrance
into that Town. The Queen highly incens'd at this affront, makes
her complaint to the King, who, to satisfie her, seem'd in publick
to condemn an action, which in his heart he highly approv'd,
commanding him to go as far as <hi>Pau,</hi> where the Queen then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided,
and there by all the submissive means imaginable to make
his excuse. <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> having received this command,
attended only by one Page very well mounted, and another infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
servant, takes his journey to the Queen; to whom he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
offer'd all the excuses, and submissions, that the dignity of the
offended party could reasonably exact from a meaner offender, and
for a higher of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ence: But this Princess, of a sex and condition not
apt to forget an Injury, was by no means satisfied with whatever
he could say to appease her; and whether it were, that she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
to two Gentlemen of her Court, whereof one was called
<hi>Pinsons,</hi> and the other <hi>Bisquerre,</hi> that nothing but the death of
<hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> could satisfie her; or that they of themselves
(as Courts ordinarily produce wicked instruments enough to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the passions of the Great) voluntarily meditated his ruine, is
yet to be discover'd: But so it was that these two combin'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to lie in wait for him by the way he was to return, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
him. <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> having taken his leave of <hi>Pau,</hi>
without being able with all the submission he could use, and with
all the Interest he could make, to reconcile himself to the Queen,
was now on his own way home in the same equipage he came,
when his servant, looking accidentally back, perceiv'd three men
rush out of a Wood hard by, and the two formost (who were
arm'd) to come upon the spur directly towards his Master, the
third it seems being (as it was afterward reported) one of the
Queens Domesticks, sent rather to be a witness of, than an assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in the intended assasinate. <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> at the first
sight apprehending them for what indeed they were, and their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
for what really it was, immediately commanded his Page to
alight, and having mounted his Horse, spur'd boldly upon them,
with so much gallantry and success, that he left them both dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place. I have often seen the Sword he made use of in this
occasion, and have often heard the manner of the action related
to the Duke in the very same terms I deliver it here.</p>
                  <p>From this wise and valiant Captain (the Epithetes with which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63412:14"/>
all the Historians of that time have honoured the Vertue of this
great man) and from <hi>Iane de Saint Lary de Bellegarde,</hi> Sister to
the <hi>Mareschal de Dellegarde,</hi> and Niece to the <hi>Mareschal de Termes,</hi>
were descended <hi>Bernard, Iean Louis,</hi> and another <hi>Iean de Nagaret,</hi>
and <hi>de la Valette,</hi> the eldest in the year 1553. <hi>Iean Louis</hi> in <hi>May,</hi>
1554, and the youngest died almost as soon as born. They had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
issue three Daughters, <hi>Helene, Catharine,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> the eldest
of which having engaged her affection, before her Brother rose to
favour, with the Marquess of <hi>Rouillac</hi> a young Gentleman of good
quality in the Countrey, preferr'd him to many others her Brother
afterwards offered to her: The second was married to the Count
<hi>de Bouchage</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> fellow Favourite with
<hi>Iean Louis,</hi> from which match sprung <hi>Catherine de Ioyeuse</hi> now
Dutchess of <hi>Guise.</hi> The last married the Count of <hi>Brienne,</hi> of the
House of <hi>Luxemberg,</hi> and she died without Issue, within a few
years after she was married.</p>
                  <p>The two Brothers <hi>Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Iean Louis,</hi> having been brought
up in their Fathers House till the ages of thirteen, and fourteen years,
were from thence sent to the Colledge of <hi>Navarre</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> there
to continue their studies; where, amongst other instructions, they
had particular charge often to see, and diligently to observe <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Villeroy,</hi> then Secretary of State, and a man lookt upon as
an extraordinary person in that imployment. <hi>Mounsieur de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi>
esteeming him for his intimate, and assured friend, hoped in
him to establish such a friendship for his Children in their greener
years, as might one day be of great use and advantage to them:
so hard it is, even for the wisest to foresee the events of things, this
very man proving at last, amongst all the great Ministers, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
the Affairs of that time, the only, or the greatest enemy to
their Advancement and Fortune.</p>
                  <p>After some years continuance of their studies at <hi>Paris,</hi>

of a War, spread from all parts, so enflam'd the noble coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of these two young Gentlemen, that it was impossible longer
to restrain them from the exercise of Arms. They considered Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
now as an obstacle to something nobler they conceiv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
oblig'd to profess; so that their Governour fearing some sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of youth, should he carry too rude a hand over them, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to give <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> timely notice of the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Sons.</p>
                  <p>Their Father either unwilling to cross them in their first desires,
or loth to discourage so early and so generous resolutions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering

call'd them home, to place them by his own side, there to share
with him the fortune of War, which chanc'd to be about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the troubles that happened in the year 1570.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette,</hi> having by the great services he had done
the King in his Armies attracted the envy or jealousie of the other
Chiefs, who were more diligent at Court than he, was by their
procurement sent away into his Government to oppose, as was
pretended, the designs and enterprizes, that those of the Reformed
Religion daily practised in several parts of that Province. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this were effectively the true, or but the pretended cause of his
dispatch into <hi>Guienne,</hi> so it was that he was commanded there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
which he accordingly did, and during that residence perform'd
many notable exploits, to the advantage of his Masters Interest:
amongst which I cannot omit the mention of one, that particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relates to the honour of his second Son, whose History I have
undertaken, and to whom his Father had given the name of <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The first Exploit of <hi>Iean Louis</hi> called <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
                     </note>
by which we shall for some time call him. In an encounter
that happened near to <hi>Mauvasin,</hi> whether <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi>
had carry'd his two Sons, he charg'd so far into the Enemies Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that his Horse being kill'd under him, he was himself in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
danger of his life, when <hi>Caumont</hi> seeing his Father in that
peril, threw himself desperately in amongst them, and being
well seconded by some few of the Troop, behav'd himself so well
as to disengage and bring him off; paying in this first trial of his
Arms, by an act of no less Piety than Valour, part of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
due to him from whom he had receiv'd his being. And this
was his first exploit.</p>
                  <p>He past some years at this rate under his Fathers Discipline,<note place="margin">Anno 1573.</note> but
a Province was a Theatre too narrow for the acts his courage was
likely to produce, ambition began already to make him aspire to
greater things; which his Father perceiving, and willing to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
so generous a passion, resolv'd to send him, together with his
elder Brother, to the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> that was then sitting down.
He was the rather enclin'd to send them to that place, because he
himself was to have no share in the honour of that action, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the jealousie of the <hi>Mareschals de Byron,</hi> and <hi>Bellegarde,</hi>
who although they were both of them his near relations, and the
best reputed Captains of their time, employ'd nevertheless their
utmost interest to hinder <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette,</hi> from serving in
that occasion. They very well knew his merit, with the favour,
and esteem, he had with the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
at that Siege, and foreseeing that such a concurrent, as he, was
likely not a little to eclipse the glory they intended to engross
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63412:15"/>
wholly to themselves,<note place="margin">Anno 1574.</note> they carried on their design with
that dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
that he was not so much as once call'd to that service. This
ill office was so much the more sensible to him, as it made him
lose the <hi>Mareschals</hi> Staff, which had been promis'd him before;
an injury that, no doubt, he would have discover'd, how highly
he had resented, had he not been prevented by Death, the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of all Humane Controversies. All he could at that time do (to
let them see he understood them to be no friends of his) was to
forbid his Sons to see them, or to be presented by either of them
to the Duke of <hi>Anjou;</hi> desiring rather they should receive that
favour from the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> a Prince with whom he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
a great interest, as having oftern serv'd under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
but most signally at the Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> where he fought
at the head of the Reserve, with which, when all other hopes were
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st, the Duke won that day, and wholly routed the Enemies
victorious Army. To him therefore he commanded his Sons to
address themselves, for their access to the Duke, an occasion the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> embrac'd with so much fervour, and presented them
after that obliging manner, with that honourable mention of the
Fathers great Merit, and the great hope of his Sons, that they
could not possibly have chosen out a man, that could more hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly,
more obligingly, or with greater integrity have perform'd
so important an Office. The infinite civility of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
together with the singular, and natural art he had to acquire men
to him, gain'd <hi>Caumont</hi> so absolutely to his service, that it was
with no little reluctancy, that he afterwards withdrew himself
from him; which nevertheless he was shortly after enforc't to do,
the divers interests that sway'd the one and the other, looking so
several wayes, that it was not possible longer to continue their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence.
Their friendship began to grow cold, before it came
to an open Rupture; <hi>Caumont</hi> not having receiv'd from the Duke,
that support, and assistance, he promis'd to himself, from so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,
and so sincere a frined, as he took him to be: But that
which strook the main blow was this: The death of <hi>Mounfieur
de la Valette</hi> immediately following the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Employments lay vacant by his decease, which made <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
repair to Court, in hopes by the Dukes favour at least to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the charge of <hi>Camp-Master</hi> to the Light Horse for his elder
Brother, (neither of them yet presuming by reason of their youth
to pretend to the Lieutenancy of <hi>Guienne</hi>) which the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> not only peremptorily refus'd to intermeddle in, but withal
carried on the interest of some other pretenders, with so much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and efficacy, that in fine he excluded both the Brothers from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63412:16"/>
all their Fathers employments. Upon which unexpected unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>Caumont</hi> retir'd so much dissatisfied with the Duke, that since
that time, neither his Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor he, ever had any complacency
for the house of <hi>Guise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Brothers after this repulse spent some time at home in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of that time (a general Peace being before concluded) gave
them leisure enough to do. But <hi>Caumont</hi>

for himself, which the memory of his Fathers great services had
not power to retain to his forgotten Family. It was about the end
of the Year 1574. that he undertook this journey, King <hi>Henry</hi>

quiet posture they then were, to the extinguishing of all old dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
and to the avoiding all possible occasions of new. They
knew very well that none had power to beget new mischiefs, or
to disturb the present Peace of the Kingdom, except the Duke of
<hi>Alanson,</hi> or the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> both which they politickly
made, as it were, prisoners to the Court, by the vigilancy of Spies,
though without Guards: or other visible marks of restraint. The
King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> as he whose Courage, and great Qualities were
more to be suspected, had the stricter eye upon him; and although
he profest himself a Catholick, yet his Fortune, and Confederates,
obliging him to the contrary Religion, they were in a perpetual
jealousie, lest he should at one time or another embrace the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and Party of those with whom his nearest concerns and
chiefest interests lay. The Queen Mother, one of the most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
Princesses of her time, and a Woman whose Prudence,
and subtlety extended to all the Arts of Government, knowing as
well how upon occasion to order the allurements of Peace, as to
guide and govern the more important Affairs in the Tumults of
War, being no stranger to the amorous inclinations of the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anno 1575. 1576.</note> by daily invitations to
Playes, Masques, Revels, and
other entertainments, made the Court continually to shine in all
the lustre and temptation of Beauty, if possible to divert the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
and to soften the Martial humour of this Prince, in the
more delicate delights of vacancy and peace: which kind of life,
it may easily be imagin'd, could not be unpleasant to a man so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63412:16"/>
young, and so enclin'd as the King then was. The Court being
now nothing but jollity, the whole Nobility of <hi>France</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to do, but to divide themselves according to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
inclinations into the Parties, and Factions of these two
young Princes; amongst which <hi>Caumonts</hi> particular liking, and
Affection to his person, and great vertues having enclin'd him to
the King of <hi>Navarres</hi> side, he was by him receiv'd with so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
respect and kindness, that in a very short time he stood equal
to the best in the highest degree of Favour, and trust. Of which
the King could not give him a greater testimony, than by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
to him his intended escape from Court, and by commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby so important a secret to his fidelity, and assistance.</p>
                  <p>Our Histories have glanc'd at the grounds upon which the
King took this resolution,<note place="margin">The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires of Queen <hi>Mar.</hi>
                     </note> which he shortly after executed with
great secresie, and a very slender train; For pretending to go hunt
in the Parks of Saint <hi>Germains,</hi> he thence with only four or five
of his greatest confidents (of which number <hi>Caumont</hi> was one)
made his escape. I have often heard him say, that he thought
himself so oblig'd by that favour, that he had never separated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from that Prince, had not he first separated himself from his
obedience to the Church.</p>
                  <p>He accompanied him in his retirement as far as
<hi>Alenson,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aubigné.</note> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King was no sooner come, but that his Physician invited
him to be God-father to one of his Children. The Ceremony was
performed in the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Congregation, and after their Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as it may be presum'd, it was beforehand determined it should
be. Whereupon <hi>Caumont,</hi> taking the usual liberty the King had
ever till that time freely allow'd him, converted all the passages of
that Ceremony into Mirth and Laughter: But the King, afraid
no doubt lest this should produce some effect that might hinder
his main designs, secretly chid him, for what he had already done,
giving him caution for the future to forbear such railleries, and to
behave himself with more respect in occasions wherein he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was so seriously concern'd. Which sharp reproof giving <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
sufficiently to understand, that although the King did not as
yet make publick profession of that Religion, yet that he was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
so moderate, and so lukewarm a Catholick, that he
only wanted a handsome opportunity to do it. He resolv'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to quit his service upon the first occasion that fairly presented it
self: An effect (besides his own Devotion to the Church) of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Promise his Brother and he had joyntly made to their dying
Father, never to serve other than a Catholick Prince. From thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
therefore, he sought all opportunities, civilly to disingage
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63412:17"/>
himself from the service of this King, which soon after a light
Indisposition of body gave him a handsome Pretense to do; for
finding himself not very well, and continuing fome few dayes in
the same distemper without any amendment,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Caumont.</hi> withdraws himself from the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre.</hi>
                     </note> he intreated leave
to retire into the privacy and convenience of his own house, for
the recovery of his health; which the King (though he doubtless
well enough understood the meaning of that request) without any
difficulty, or the least shew of unkindness, freely permitted him to
do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>France</hi> began now to see it self threatned with the approaching
troubles, which the Duke of <hi>Alenson</hi>'s, and the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s
departure from Court, (happening much about the same time)
shortly after produc'd in the Kingdom; neither could the Queen
Mother, notwithstanding her great vigilancy, and care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
those disorders, the discontents of these two Princes, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with those of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Faction, were likely to bring upon
the State, with all her industry and prudence hinder men, in that
<hi>Crisis</hi> of Affairs, from running into the tumult of Armes. It was
in this juncture of time, that <hi>Caumont</hi> prepar'd himself for a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
journey to Court:<note place="margin">

                           </gap>umont</hi>'s second journey to Court, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Favour.</note> He had had the honour to be known to
the King, first at the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and afterwards in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
upon the King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> so that these preceding ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes
and acquaintance, made him resolve to go, and tye him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
directly to his Majesties person and service. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
left his own house with this resolution, he takes his journey
to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> where the Marquess <hi>de Villars,</hi> a great friend and an
old companion in Armes of <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> his Father, and
now Governour of <hi>Guienne,</hi> then resided; and where he was not
a little busie to provide against the disorders which at that time
threatned that Province. <hi>Caumont</hi> at his arrival gives him a visit,
acquaints him with the true design of his journey, and withal
offers his service, if he had any to command him to Court <hi>Villars</hi>
readily accepts his offer, charges him with Letters of Credit to
the King, and, the wayes betwixt <hi>Burdeaux</hi> and <hi>Poitiers</hi> being
very difficult to pass by reason of the continual inroads of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot</hi>
party, he informs him of the particular state of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
instructs him in the safest wayes he was to pass, and finally
gives him a full accompt of the posture wherein his Majesties Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
then stood; that he might thereupon receive new orders from
the King and Council. <hi>Caumont,</hi> being glad to present himself to
their Majesties with the advantage of so considerable a service, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
throughly instructed in all the Affairs of <hi>Guienne,</hi> from <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
to <hi>Angoubesme;</hi> where he further discourses about his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63412:17"/>
with the Marquess of <hi>Rufee,</hi> Governour of that Town,
and Countrey, and by him findes matters there to be in no better
a condition, than those of <hi>Guienne. Rufee</hi> had made a late denial of
that place to the Heads of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> party, to whom by the
Treaty of <hi>Champigny,</hi> made with the Duke of <hi>Alenson,</hi> it should
have been delivered up for a Cautionary Town. He informs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the reasons of <hi>Rufees</hi> refusal in this case, with other things
that concern'd the Kings Service in that Countrey, and continues
his journey from thence to <hi>Poitiers,</hi> by the houses of Gentlemen
his acquaintance, sometimes with Convoys, but for the most
part in the slender guard of his own inconsiderable train. At last
by short and wary journeys he arrives at Court, which was then
at <hi>Blois,</hi> though with infinite difficulty and danger; such was the
disorder, and confusion, that rag'd in all the Provinces through
which he was to pass. I heard him a few dayes before his death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
all the particulars of this journey, without omitting the least
circumstance that befel him by the way; not without admiration,
that a man after threescore and odde years should retain so perfect
a memory of such petty accidents (if such ought to be call'd so)
as gave a beginning to the establishment of so prodigious a
Fortune.</p>
                  <p>Being come to Court,<note place="margin">Anno 1577.</note> he presented himself to the King, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the several dispatches he had from <hi>Villars,</hi> and <hi>Rufee,</hi> giving
his Majesty a particular account of all they had given him in
charge. The King immediately commanded him to address him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Queen Mother, and to inform her fully of the same
things, being at this first Conference highly satisfied with his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
and judgement, and mightily taken with his behaviour, and
the gracefulness he observ'd, in whatever he said, or did: neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
could there be a more accomplisht Gentleman, than he was
at that age of two and twenty, as I have heard men of great
judgement say, that very well knew him in those times. His
Conference with the Queen Mother prov'd no less to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
with her, than that he had had with the King had done with
him; she was pleas'd to give him a gracious audience, and to
take a great liking to his Person; so that the King coming (as it
was his constant custom) in the evening to confer about business
with her, and asking her if she had seen <hi>Caumont,</hi> and what her
opinion was of him? the Queen made answer, That she had
seen, and discours'd with him, and that it was upon men of his
condition and merit, that his Majesty ought to repose the Trust,
and Confidence of his most important Affairs: which she said as
not being unwilling (to the end she might still keep her dominion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63412:18"/>
over the Kings affections) that <hi>Caumont,</hi> though the King had
many Favourties already, should yet make one of that number;
that so his heart, being divided amongst many, might not too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
encline to one. The King told her he was of her opinion,
and the approbation he found in her judgement having justified
his own inclinations, after he had entertain'd her some time with
merits of the Father, and the good qualities of the Son, he from
thenceforward took a resolution to receive him into a degree of
favour, and to place him near his own person,</p>
                  <p>Yet was it not immediately, notwithstanding this auspicious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
that <hi>Caumont</hi>'s favour began to appear; neither did he on
his part cultivate his springing fortune with an assiduity, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
unbecoming his Spirit, and Blood, for whatever testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of favour and esteem the King daily discover'd to him, there
was nevertheless no occasion of action, which he did not greedily
embrace, and for which he did not continually neglect all Court
Interest, preferring his Honour and Duty before all other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Fortune. At his return from one of these expeditions,
he soon discern'd a coldness in his Majesty towards him; and his
Court Rivals, who very well saw how precipitiously the Kings
Affections were bent upon him, had not fail'd on their part, by
their ill offices to weaken that interest during his absence, with all
the Art, and Malice they had: but his brave services having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
his Masters Esteem, he soon recovered his former possession
of Grace, and at last settled himself so firm in the Kings Bosom,
that the favour, which had for a long time before been divided
amongst many pretenders, was at last establish'd without reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> and him, though he had still the greatest share.</p>
                  <p>I have already observ'd, what an effect <hi>Caumonts</hi> negotiation
about the Affairs of <hi>Guienne</hi> had produc'd with the King and
Queen; neither was he so blind to his own interest as not to see it,
nor so negligent as not to improve it with all the industry he had.
Nor was his diligence less effectual with the Queen Mother, who
bore the greatest sway of Affairs, than with the King himself, she
ever receiving him with great demonstration of Favour, and
Esteem; which he to continue, or to encrease, contracted great
Familiarities with some of the Maids of Honour of chiefest trust
about her, and from their Friendship receiv'd no few good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in this Foundation of his Fortune.</p>
                  <p>But neither these good Offices, nor the Favour he was by their
procurement seated in, had yet produc'd any thing to his benefit;
'tis true he was look'd upon with an Eye of Favour, the King
would often speak to him, and in all apparence he was in a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63412:18"/>
hopeful way, but still this was hitherto only apparence, and he
reap'd no other advantage by it until the Duke of <hi>Alenfon</hi>'s expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which was the first time he tasted of his Masters Bounty.
After the Treaty of <hi>Champigny,</hi> which was a little before this time,
the King having design'd absolutely to disingage his Brother the
Duke of <hi>Alenson</hi> from the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party, had to that purpose gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him the command of an Army against them. Upon which
occasion <hi>Caumont</hi> fail'd not to prepare himself to make one, which
the King so well approv'd of, that coming to take his leave, his
Majesty having first publickly commended his generous design,
order'd him twelve hundred Crowns of Gold,<note place="margin">The King's first Bounty to <hi>Caumont.</hi>
                     </note> out of his privy
Purse, to put him into a handsome posture: A largess so season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as enabled him to put himself into a better equipage, than
otherwise he could conveniently have done; and as he had a mind
above his present Fortune, he laid out all the Kings Bounty in
Horses, Arms, and other Furniture: but above all, he bought
himself the finest Tent, that could possibly be seen. The Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
of the Army being appointed to be at <hi>Romorentin,</hi> the King
and Queen Mother, being then at <hi>Blois,</hi> would themselves see it;
and there dismiss the Duke of <hi>Alenson,</hi> with all possible demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Honour, and Kindness. <hi>Caumont</hi> fail'd not to Muster up
his Equipage, upon this occasion; and for the better advantage,
caus'd his Tent to be set up in that part of the Camp, that lay
most in view of the Queens Lodgings, to the end chiefly, that her
Maids of Honour might more conveniently see it. The King who
never fail'd (as I have observ'd before) to visit his Mother once a
day, as he was one day leaning with her in her Chamber Window,
took particular notice of this Tent, which being for its fineness
remarkable above the rest, the King and Queen both fancied it
to be <hi>Caumont</hi>'s; and the better to be satisfied, sent one purposely
to enquire; at whose return, finding it to be so indeed, his gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was highly commended by them both. Soon after coming to
take his leave of the King, and to receive his Commands, he
was dismist with so high testimonies of Affection, as might for
the future give him just occasion to hope for greater things. These
observations may perhaps seem light to some upon such a subject;
but since Fortune suffers nothing to be lost to happy men, and that
she is industrious to collect, and improve the least of their actions
to make them succeed to their advantage, I thought it not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
improper, by her example, to make mention of these passages;

The Duke of <hi>Alensons</hi> expedition succeeded according to the
Kings desire, he took <hi>la Charité,</hi> and <hi>Issoire,</hi> and the Army was in
a condition to perform greater things, had not the over-strict
League, and Friendship betwixt the Duke of <hi>Alenson,</hi>

Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> (his Lieutenant General in this Employment) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
a suspicion in the King. To break then this Friendship, the
King began to hearken to overtures of Peace; which, although
they were not presently concluded, yet the meer proposition was
pretense enough to call home the Duke of <hi>Alenson,</hi> and to give
<hi>Caumont</hi> opportunity to return to Court. At his coming back he
was less favourably receiv'd, than he had reason to expect, through
the jealousie of those who had been more industrious to improve
the Kings Favour, than he had been: Yet could not this hinder
him (a new occasion of the Siege of <hi>Brouage</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He goes to the Siege of <hi>Brouage.</hi>
                     </note> presenting it self)
once more to expose, and abandon, his springing Favour to the
malicious Offices of his Court-Concurrents. He went to this
Siege, where he behav'd himself so well (as he had done before at
<hi>la Charit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> and <hi>Issoire</hi>) that in all these expeditions he still won the
great liking, and approbation of his Generals; who, being just
to his merit, in the testimony of his actions, confirm'd the King
more and more in the opinion, he had before conceiv'd, of his
Worth and Valour.</p>
                  <p>This esteem of <hi>Caumont</hi> took at last so deep root in this Princes
Breast, that it was no more in the power of Envy to shake it; and
he had him in so high consideration, that he never us'd him
with the least severity, nor ever gave him the least injurious word;
an indulgence not common to his other Favourites, who were
often subject to very passionate language: But the King in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
nature was pleas'd to spare a heart, which, he had before
observ'd, was too stout to submit to Injuries, what advantage
soever might accrue by such a patience. Of which (now we are
upon this discourse) I shall give you an instance in this place; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the thing happened not just at this time, but after <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s
more apparent Favour, not tying my self, in these youthful
relations of him, so much to the order of time, as to the truth of
things. The King his Master being an infinite lover of neatness in
Cloaths, and being none were admitted into the Bed-Chamber
without his white Shooes, black Velvet Galoches, his long Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and other Vestments wherein they were to observe a punctual
Decorum, no wonder if the Favourties, who were continually in the
Kings Eye, were especially ty'd to these strict rules of decency.
<hi>Caumont</hi> appearing one day before the King unbutton'd, his Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
untied, and in a greater negligence, and disorder, than he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63412:19"/>
was wont to be, receiv'd a sever check; nay his chiding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
so far, as that the King forbad him ever to appear before
him again in the like posture. <hi>Caumont</hi> in his heat interpreting this
for an absolute command, without condition, immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws
himself, resolv'd (as I have since heard him say) to take Post,
and for ever to retire himself from Court. But the King, who
very well knew what an impression his words had made with
his Favourite, and fearing lest the rashness of his Youth might
make him commit a fault to his own ruine, commanded him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to be call'd back; saying, <hi>That his heat and folly would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him, if he were left to himself; but that he had in him withal Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
of which good use might be made: and, that he would therefore have
an eye to his preservation.</hi> Upon his return the King having chang'd
his Humour, <hi>Caumont</hi> chang'd his Resolution, not without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
upon how light an occasion he was like to have forfeited
his Masters Favour, and to have destroyed the hopes of his own
rising Fortune; And from the knowledge of his fault drew this
advantage, to become less hot, and passionate for the future, and to
observe such an elegancy and neatness in his habit, even to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
old age, as might serve for an example to the younger sort
of men.</p>

                  <p>But as he had many Concurrents in the same Design,<note place="margin">Anno 1578.</note> so the
King for some time suspended the declaration of his Favour;
though <hi>Caumont</hi> was one of those to whom his Majesty shewed a
particular Inclination, and whose freedom, and boldness was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
displeasing to him: His Wit, fine Fashion, and a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Grace he had in performing all his exercises, gave him a great
advantage over the other young men of his condition; which he
managed so well, that he still out-shone all his equals, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
the true Favourite in mens opinion, though his Favour was
not yet so fully manifest. All this year 1578. past in this delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Court was in suspense which of all the pretenders to
favour would prove to be the Favourites indeed, when at last the
King in the beginning of the year 1579.<note place="margin">Anno 1579.</note> at the Ceremony of the
institution of the Knights of the Order of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        </gap>uc,</hi> and <hi>D'O</hi> in the same Livery with himself, there was then
no further dispute of their favour; and upon this discovery, all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63412:20"/>
the Courtiers according to their inclinations, or interest, divided
themselves into the several Parties, and dependencies of these four
great men.</p>
                  <p>We have now brought <hi>Caumont</hi> upon the great Theatre of the
World, expos'd, not only to the sight, but also to the censure and
envy of most men. We shall hereafter see how he disingag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from those snares, and designs that were laid by his Adversaries
to undermine his greatness, during the space of threescore and ten
years, which he liv'd after his first rise of Favour.</p>
                  <p>From the time of this establishment of his Fortune, he had the
good hap to have all the most eminent men about the Court, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Arts or Arms, to apply themselves to him. <hi>Mounsieur du
Perron,</hi> one of the greatest Ornaments of his Age, was of this
number, together with <hi>Rousard, Des Portes,</hi> and many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of great Merit, and Esteem. But amongst them all, <hi>Caumont</hi>
taking particular notice of the great worth of <hi>Mounsieur du Perron,</hi>
and considering his Vertue to be above all the advantages, he in
himself was able to procure for him; took an especial care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to the Kings knowledge, and at last, with the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>iduity and
recommendation of a true friend, plac'd him in his Majesties
chiefest confidence; an Office which he afterwards continued with
so constant a friendship, as contributed no little to that greatness,
to which he was sometime after advanc'd.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Blancard</hi> since <hi>Mareschal</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and Duke <hi>de Biron,</hi>
with the greatest part of the <hi>Gascon</hi> Nobility that then follow'd the
Court, put themselves also into his dependence: his Employments,
and the great credit he had with the King, having in a short time
afforded him means to gratifie a number of gallant Gentlemen, and
to acquire many Friends, and Servants, whose Valour and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
contributed much to the preservation of his Life, and Fortune.
But his youth, having been bred up in the rudeness of War, requir'd
some necessary improvements, the better to fit him for his Masters
conversation, who was himself the most accomplish'd Prince of
his time. The King would take care for his second Education, that
he might be the more proper for those Employments, which his
Majesties confidence in him, and the necessity of the present times,
were shortly to call him to; and to that purpose commanded <hi>Des
Portes</hi> to be continually about his Person, which he accordingly
obey'd; and not only by his diligence better'd him in the <hi>French</hi>
Tongue, which then first began to purge it self from the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism
of past Ages: but having withal found in him a capacity that
out-stript his Precepts, he in a short time infus'd into him such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
notions, as, having open'd his understanding, made him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63412:20"/>
of those important negotiations in which he was afterwards
imploy'd.</p>
                  <p>The same affection which had made the King so solicitous to
embellish his Mind, made him no less careful to establish his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
though he still conceal'd the daily progress of his Bounty
from him, not being willing it seems that he should so much as
trouble himself with the management of his own Domestick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
but commanded <hi>Fontenay Mareuil</hi> a Gentleman of quality,
and of whose integrity his Majesty had a particular Esteem, to take
upon him that care, and twice a week to bring him an account of
<hi>Caumonts</hi> business, as another Person of Quality did of that of
<hi>Ioyeuse.</hi> From these two Gentlemen the King had still advice, of
all Offices, and Revenues, that fell vacant; out of which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesty
made choice of such for his two Favourites, as he thought
most proper, and advantageous for them, and commanded their
dispatch; which afterward <hi>Caumont,</hi> and <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> were to solicit,
but without the least dispensation, notwithstanding their Favour,
from the due and customary forms of Law; where, if any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
or opposition chanc'd to arise, his Majesty ever interpos'd his
Justice to over-rule them, if justly they were to be over-ruled:
neither did they ever receive any Grace, or Largess, which did not
either first pass the Seal, the Chamber of Accounts, or an Act of
Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In these beginnings, the two young Favourites were continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call'd to all the Councils, not to give their advice, from which
by their immaturity, and inexperience, they were exempt, but
to inform, and to inure themselves to business: Which the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to exercise them in, the King himself was pleas'd often in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
to propose weighty questions to them, and to make them
debate them before him, without exposing their early Opinions to
the Experience of his graver Council initiating them with his own
Precepts, and forming them with his own hand; and that rather
with the tenderness and indulgence of a Father to his Children,
than with the authority of a Master over his Servants,</p>
                  <p>About this time (as I have already observ'd) the Order of the
Holy Ghost was instituted, and the first Ceremony was already
past: where, although <hi>Caumont</hi> had no share, by reason of his
Youth, but was deferred to the next Creation, which happened
a few years after; yet his Majesty, though he judg'd him too young
to be admitted into that honourable Fraternity, thought him not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
sufficient to treat with <hi>Philibert</hi> D. of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     </note> though
he were one of the most discreet, and most circumspect Princes
of his time. This Prince had rais'd a considerable Army, which he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63412:21"/>
intended to imploy against the <hi>Genoveses;</hi> and the King, who was
oblig'd to protect them, dispatch'd <hi>Caumont</hi> to the Duke to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him from that enterprize. His negotiation in this Affair met
with great difficulties, and infinite oppositions, both from the
House of <hi>Austria,</hi> the League, and the Pope; which nevertheless
he overcame with that dexterity, that having untied all those knots
of State, he obtain'd full satisfaction for the King his Master, and
acquir'd so much Reputation, and Esteem with the Duke, as at the
same time to obtain a signal Favour, and a timely assistance for
himself. The occasion this.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mareschal de Bellegarde</hi> his Uncle, having for some time
possest the Kings Favour, was at last, through the ill Offices of
some, fallen into disgrace, and had thereupon retir'd himself into
the Marquisate of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> of which Province he had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and whither being come, he had chas'd <hi>Charles Birague,</hi>
the Kings Lieutenant in that Marquisate, out of all the Places and
strong holds he had formerly possest; which he had taken upon
him to do, without any order from the King: and indeed <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde</hi>
unsatisfied with the Court, rather endeavour'd to fortifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and to secure his own interest, than to stand upon the nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and punctillio's of his duty. This disorder gave a hot alarm
to all <hi>Italy,</hi> who knew not to what <hi>Bellegardes</hi> designs might
tend; and the Queen Mother, desirous in time to prevent any ill
consequence, had her self taken a Journey to accommodate the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and had compos'd it to the Kings satisfaction, and seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>Mareschal</hi>'s too, who had receiv'd a ratification of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he had done: but the <hi>Mareschal</hi> was no sooner return'd into
his Government, than he fell immediately sick, and of so violent
a distemper, as in few dayes carried him away, not without vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
suspicion of poison. Many being perswaded, that his tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
spirit having given the Court an apprehension, that a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
man of his Courage, would be hard to be continued
in the due limits of his Obedience, they thought it better at once
to dispatch him out of the way, than to be at the continual trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
would be necessary to contain him in his duty.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63412:21"/>
that he soon supprest the Faction, plac'd <hi>Bellegarde</hi> secure in
his charge, and left him strong enough to defend himself; until the
King, whose interest requir'd a Minister of greater Experience in
that Countrey, call'd him from thence to place <hi>la Valette, Caumont</hi>'s
elder Brother in his stead, giving to <hi>Bellegarde</hi> in recompense the

                  <p>It was during the interim of this Voyage, that the disgrace of
St. <hi>Luc,</hi> one of the Favourites, was concluded. <hi>D' Aubigné</hi> tell us
that he learn'd the cause of this disgrace from St. <hi>Luc</hi>'s own mouth,
and thereupon tells an impudent Story: but they who well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this malevolent Author's way of writing, will easily judge it
his own invention, to bespatter the Kings reputation; against
whom (besides the interest of his Party) he had a particular spleen,
having been ill us'd, and slighted upon many occasions. Of
which he himself cannot forbear to complain in his History, and
which confession in it self is sufficient to discredit all the calumnies
he has forg'd against the Honour of this Prince. Here then take
the true reason of his disgrace.</p>
                  <p>The King, falling in love with a Lady of great Quality,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Luc</hi>'s disgrace.</note> had
made <hi>Caumont,</hi> and St. <hi>Luc</hi> the confidents of his Passion; shortly
after which <hi>Caumont</hi> was sent upon the Embassy of <hi>Savoy,</hi> spoke of
before: and St. <hi>Luc,</hi> in this interval of his absence, discovers the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
of the King's love to his Wife, who was of the Family of
<hi>Brissac,</hi> and his Wife immediately to the Queen, who could not
long dissemble her discontent to the King her Husband; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
him with his Love, and that with so many circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that in effect he could not much deny it. The King infinitely
concern'd at the infidelity of his Confidents, to whose discretion
he had only intrusted that secret, falls upon St. <hi>Luc, Caumont</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the reach of his anger, complains how basely he was
betray'd, and in fine, reproaches him with the discovery. St.
<hi>Luc</hi> excuses himself, and, that he might do it with the better colour,
charges <hi>Caumont</hi> (whose absence expos'd him to that ill office)
with the fault; but the King, who had before begun to distaste St.
<hi>Luc,</hi> ever since his Marriage with a Wife, who was very partial to
the House of <hi>Guise</hi> (a Family whose designs were every day more
and more suspected to him) was still in his own Judgement more
enclin'd to condemn him, than <hi>Caumont</hi> of the Treachery. Yet for
the better clearing of the truth, which he was impatient to know,
he addresses himself to the Queen, pressing, and conjuring her, to
tell him freely, from whom she had receiv'd the knowledge of his
Love, at the same time confessing on his part, the naked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disguis'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63412:22"/>
truth, the more to oblige her to deal clearly, and candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with him. The Queen though at first she defended her self with
many excuses, and was very loath to betray her intelligence, was
at last (as there are few secrets which are not communicative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
persons of so near relation) overcome, and confest that it
was from St. <hi>Luc</hi>'s Wife she had receiv'd that secret. There need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no more to confirm the King in the prejudice he had before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
against St. <hi>Luc:</hi> and his Majesty believing there was more of
design, than levity in this miscarriage, from thenceforth conceiv'd
a mortal animosity against him, and was resolute to his ruine;
yet would he defer the discovery of his displeasure till <hi>Caumont</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival,
who was now upon return, that he might first know, how
ill an office his companion, and friend had attempted to do him.
<hi>Caumont</hi> was no sooner return'd, than the King ask't him
what opinion he had of St. <hi>Luc</hi>'s friendship? who answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That he took him to be his best friend, as he knew himself to
be his; and that there was a particular, and strict friendship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. The King told him he must no longer continue in
that error, and thereupon acquainted him with the whole story,
and with the resolution he had taken against him. <hi>Caumont</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the ill Offices he had receiv'd) fail'd not in this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to perform all the duties of a true friend, but employ'd his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with the King, to perswade his Majesty into milder resolutions:
but not being able with all he could say to prevail against the just
indignation he had conceiv'd against him; and seeing him exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
to such a height, as was like enough to transport him to the
greatest extremities, he gave notice to St. <hi>Luc</hi> speedily to retire from
Court, which he accordingly did, and fled to <hi>Brouage.</hi> This is
the true story of his disgrace, which I have received from a more
faithful, and less passionate hand than that of <hi>Aubign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>It was at this same time of <hi>Caumont</hi>'s return from <hi>Savoy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anno 1580.</note> that
the King found himself engag'd in a more dangerous Affair, than
this before related. The <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party began now to break out
into open insurrection: and their Rebellion was of so much the
greater consequence, by how much it interrupted, and overthrew
all the designs he had laid, to establish the peace of his Kingdom.
The King having had, and with great reason, the greatness of the
House of <hi>Guise</hi> long suspected to him, had determin'd with
himself, but insensibly, and with all security, to abate that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greatness; and to bring his designs the better to pass, and with
the least noise, he continually dispos'd all the great employments,
and most considerable Offices, as they fell void, into the hands of
his own Creatures, without distributing any part into the power
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63412:22"/>
of the <hi>Guises,</hi> or of any that he knew depended upon them, or
that he suspected to be of their Faction. The House of <hi>Guise</hi> easily
enough penetrating into the depth of this design, had fortified
themselves more than ever, in their Confederates and Friends, to
oppose by strong hand this project of the Kings; and covering
with the pretence of the Catholick Religion (of which they had
long assum'd to themselves the titles of Protectors, either their
Ambition (or what they call'd by a more specious name) the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of their Defence, were ready to break out into open Arms.
The King, advertis'd of their designs, was resolv'd to prevent them,
and for a time to lay aside his milder Maxims, and to chastise their
insolence with an armed hand: but because he should have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
means, and strength, if at the same time, he should undertake
the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party (which he also intended to
cut off in due time) should appear in Arms, he tried to moderate
the last, by commanding all the Edicts that had been made in
their Favour, to be strictly, and inviolately observ'd. He granted
to the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> all he could reasonably desire, treating
with him like a Prince, that he neither thought it safe to raise too
high, nor that he had a desire absolutely to subdue. A proceeding
that in all apparence was likely to continue the Peace on that side.
And the King had very great reason to hope, that this Prince, and
those of his party, would at least give him leisure to suppress the
Family of <hi>Guise,</hi> who as they were dangerous to him, were also
their open, and declared Enemies. The suppression of which had
at this time been a matter easie, and inevitable, had Affairs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in this posture. But all these considerations were over-rul'd,
and overthrown by so little means, that certainly 'tis worthy our
astonishment to consider how light, and how contemptible things
will pervert the ordinary course of humane prudence.</p>
                  <p>The Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> in this juncture of time retir'd from
Court, much dissatisfied with the King her Brother, as she her self
declares in her own Commentaries; and as she was a Princess of a
dangerous Wit, a great Spirit, and one that conceiv'd the highest
point of generosity to consist in revenge, she thought she could not
do the King her Brother a more sensible injury, whose designs she
very well knew; nor consequently better satisfie her own revenge,
than by stirring up the King her Husband against him. Yet think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her own interest too weak of it self to prevail in a thing of this
consequence, she thought fit to assault him where he lay most
open to her, and where he had the least power to defend himself.
Having therefore in her train a great many very fine women, and
such as were well disciplin'd in Love Affairs, she won so far upon

ended in the surprisal of two important places. The first was

                  <p>The King advertized of this disorder, found himself necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to alter his first resolutions, and to turn his thoughts to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
danger; so that instead of pursuing the suppression<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the
House of <hi>Guise,</hi> and their League, he was constrain'd that time,
not only to wink at their Faults, but to employ their Persons, and
make use of their Interest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y to stop this unexpected Rupture. In
which he carried himself with that wisdom, and diligence, as gave
no little astonishment to his Enemies, when they saw he had in a
moment set three great Armies on foot, to attend their motion, and
to oppose and frustrate their attempts. They had principally built
their designs upon the opinion of the Kings negligence, which
they interpreted cowardise, and sloth. But they soon perceiv'd
themselves abus'd in that belief, and found in this occasion, that
the pleasure and ease, he was something addicted unto, had not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerv'd
him from vigorous action, when his Honour and Interest
call'd him abroad. There is one thing very remarkable in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
which is rarely observ'd in the order of Humane Affairs,
that all things succeeded absolutely according to the Kings Designs;
and Fortune, who is wont to delude the wisest Counsels, submitted
here to the Kings Prudence, and fore-sight. His Majesty had great
reasons not to oppress the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> in this conjuncture;
and though he had just cause to be angry with him, yet, he had
more to preserve him, to the end that he might in his person main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Party to make the League, who were directly opposite to
him. He therefore sent against him the <hi>Mareschal de Biron,</hi> rather
to spin out the War in exploits of little moment, than to end it at
one blow. Into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> where there was little, or nothing to be
done, no more than in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> he dispatch'd the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
Affairs being at this time in such a condition, that his Majesty
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63412:23"/>
was constrain'd to serve himself with some of those Heads of the
League, who were already sworn to it: but he did it withal in
an occasion of so little importance, that the Duke was therein
likely to acquire no great reputation to himself, nor no great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to his Faction. But on the contrary, for what concern'd
<hi>la Feré,</hi> as being a Town near to <hi>Paris,</hi> and in <hi>Picardy,</hi> where the
<hi>Hugonots</hi> had as yet no other footing, such troublesome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
standing highly suspected to his Majesty, he dispatch'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Mareschal de Matignon</hi> a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bject of great Merit, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
Fidelity, to labour in good earnest the recovery of that
place. In this Army march'd the Favourites, of which <hi>Caumont</hi> and
<hi>Ioyeuse</hi> in this expedition got the greatest name; the last by a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuss
shot he receiv'd in his Face, and the other by the taking of
the Town; of which success the Historians of that time attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to him the chiefest reputation. He had intreated of the King
the charge of <hi>Camp-Master</hi> to the Regiment of <hi>Champagne,</hi> that
he might have some remarkable employment in this occasion, and
with that had obtain'd the command of a Quarter; so that, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
necessary being wanting to the advancement of his work
he rais'd by the industry of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>talian Engineer, a Cavalier by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of which, having planted a battery,<note place="margin">Aubigné.</note> that look'd directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place, and that shot into the Enemies Defences, he reduc'd
them to that extremity, that not daring to shew their heads upon
the Walls, they were soon forc'd to a capitulation. The first over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Surrender were made to <hi>Caumont,</hi> who most prest upon
them; which the <hi>Mareschal de Matignon,</hi> being displeas'd at, as
jealous of the honour they had done him, to the prejudice (as he
conceiv'd) of the command he had at that Siege, he immediately
granted to the Deputies, which <hi>Caumont</hi> had out of respect whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
referr'd to him, their own conditions, without once calling
<hi>Caumont</hi> to the determination; an injury he so highly resented, that
he could not govern his passion from breaking out at the instant,
but smartly continued his Battery against the Town (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Articles agreed upon, and sign'd) and ceas'd not till
the Kings Troops were entred into it. But he shortly after had a
better revenge: for departing the Camp, without taking leave of
the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> and arriv'd at Court, he obtain'd from the King the
Government of that place, which the <hi>Mareschal</hi> had importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sued for, and kept it many years after. By this exploit the War
ended, which having been undertaken rather out of a capricious
humour, than mature deliberation, had the same success, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
attends precipitous and indigested Counsels. The Peace
that follow'd, kept <hi>Caumont</hi> at Court, where his favour daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63412:24"/>
till it came to such a height, that there was no employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or benefit, with which the King his Master was not highly
pleas'd to gratifie him.</p>
                  <p>Before he obtain'd the charge of <hi>Camp-Master</hi> to the Regiment
of <hi>Champagne</hi> for himself, he had procur'd for <hi>la Valette</hi> his elder
Brother, that of <hi>Camp-Master</hi> to the Light Horse; an Employment
that had been so worthily discharg'd by their Father; which I have
often heard him say, was the first grace he ever begg'd of the King,
having it seems a desire to retrive the Offices of his Family for his
Brother, and to give him the first advantages of his Favour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
nothing, save future hopes for himself: but those hopes
were not long suspended, for the esteem the King had of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
founded upon his courage, and fidelity, had begot in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
so great a passion for him,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The Historians of that age give him from henceforward an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
over <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> in the Kings Favour, and would make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it was so apparent, as to beget a jealousie in <hi>Ioyeuse;</hi> but that
is a secret I never learn'd from <hi>Caumont</hi>'s mouth; though it may be
presum'd that his carriage, and conduct, was more likely to please
the King; <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> having such a vanity to boast, and make a shew
of the credit he had with his Master, and of the favours and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities
he receiv'd from him by inordinate profusions, and expense,
as did not only bring many inconveniences upon himself, but
great murmurings and discontents upon the King: whereas <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
who had rather be powerful and esteem'd in effect, than in
outward shew, made a sober, and profitable use of the interest he
had in the King; and made his greatness more apparent to discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men, by the establish'd constancy that ty'd him fast to his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than by the exterior <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>opperies of pomp, which are but the faint
reflexions of a true shining lustre.</p>
                  <p>If this stability of his was commendable in any thing, it was
much more in the constant aversion he had to the League, to which
nothing could ever reconcile him; nor to the heads of that Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but on the contrary he took all occasions publickly to exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and affront the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> without regarding the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so great a man, or fearing the danger of so powerful an
Enemy; his animosity carrying him so far, as several times to beg
leave of the King, that he might fight him man to man, desiring
with all his soul to hazard his own life, that he might by an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
way deliver his Master, from the troubles, and apprehensions,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63412:24"/>
with which the practices of this Duke perpetually afflicted him,
though his Majesty would never consent to it. But <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> liv'd after
another manner, maintaining a greater intelligence with the House
of <hi>Guise,</hi> than ought to have been betwixt so oblig'd a Servant, and
his Master's open, and declared Enemies; which doubtless was the
chief cause of the diminution of his favour, and in truth either prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
by the sole ambition of seeing himself Brother-in-law to the
King, to which honour he thought he could not arrive without the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s assistance, or by the desire he had to secure his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
on all sides, which is very often a ruinous maxim, he ever indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously
labor'd the friendship of that Family. Some believe that he
at first treated with them unknown to the King about his Marriage
with a Princess of their House, and Name, Sister to the Queen. 'Tis
true he had afterwards the King's permission, and the overture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once made, was prest by the King himself to a consummation of
it: but it was his part to have foreseen the inconveniences of this
Alliance, and to have consider'd the consequences before he had
embark'd himself.</p>
                  <p>As one of the King's chiefest cares was to keep such an equality
towards his Favourites,<note place="margin">Anno 1581.</note> that they might have no occasion to trouble
the delight he took in their conversation, with complaints, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;
so had he no sooner concluded the Marriage of his Sister-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law
to the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse;</hi> but that he would bestow another call'd
<hi>Christina,</hi> upon the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi> I begin here to give him the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Duke,<note place="margin">A proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Marriage for the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> because he had it before, although the thred of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
permits me not to speak of his promotion to this dignity, till
the following page. A temptation delicate enough to flatter a mind
so great, and so ambitious, as that of the Duke; nevertheless he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
himself with a moderation, highly to be commended in an
occasion of this nature; neither was his prudence less to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd,
than his moderation: and all the world have believ'd, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all the actions of his life, this was of greatest importance to
the conservation of his Fortune. Upon this refusal of his, divers Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were made, all actions of great men, especially Favorites, never
wanting interpreters: such as were justest to the Duke highly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his conduct, that so prudently under the shadow of respect, had
rejected an advantage, that in it self carried only noise, and shew;
though otherwise it might render him capable of pretending to
more solid things, and at least make him rival the extraordinary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> had receiv'd; others that would less favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
interpret him, discommended his carriage, as if by this refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
he intended tacitly to condemn the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> his Vanity,
and Ambition; and these confirm'd themselves in their opinion,
by the great disproportion they saw betwixt the moderate expense
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63412:25"/>
at the Marriage of the Duke's elder Brother, and the prodigious
profusion that was made at that of the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</note> where the
expense was so great as amounted to above two millions of Livers,
an immense summe in those days, and especially at a time wherein
the State was in great necessities. This gave a great occasion of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
not only to the well and ill dispos'd <hi>French,</hi> but even to
such strangers as were affectionate to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
that of <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette,</hi> which was solemnized at the
same time with <hi>Anne de Batarnay,</hi> was past over with very little
noise; not but that the King would also in this occasion have
powr'd out his liberality: but the two Brothers, having discreetly
avoided an unnecessary expense, soberly husbanded their Masters
purse, to his and their own reputation.</p>
                  <p>From the time that his Majesty had determined to raise his two
Favourites to the honour of his Alliance,<note place="margin">Anno 1582.</note> he honoured them both
with the Dignity of Duke, and Peer; and purchas'd in <hi>Caumont</hi>'s
name the Manour of <hi>Espernon,</hi> to the end, he might bear that Title.

that having chosen <hi>Caumont,</hi> and <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> for his Brothers-in-law,
and intending to place them by this Alliance so near his own

being far inferiour to what he had already conferr'd upon
them by that choice: Upon which, there being no more contest,
the thing past according to his Majesties pleasure, and was recorded
without reservation.</p>
                  <p>Though the King seem'd to have his thoughts wholly taken
up with these little domestick Affairs,<note place="margin">Anno 1583.</note> and to intend nothing but the
advancement of his Favourites; yet was he not even in this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a further end, and design: for perceiving himself too weak by
fine force, to crush the two powerful Factions, that divided the
whole Kingdom, he try'd to accomplish that by policy, which he
could not effect by power, in depriving both sides of all kind of
authority and trust; advancing on the contrary his Favourites, and
such as he had confidence in, to all the Offices, and Employments
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63412:25"/>
he possibly could; neither was there any grace, or favour to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
but for them, or for such of their creatures, as wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
upon their fortune. Neither met this design of his with any
opposition from the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party; who, the more they were his
open and declared Enemies, the less were they in his way, and gave
him the less trouble: For the Court being suspected to the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

kept them at such a distance, as depriv'd them of the means to sue
for Governments, Offices, and commands of places; nay, it was
a favour to let them enjoy those they already had; so that living
retir'd, and at ease, but without credit, or consideration, their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
by degrees mouldred away, and grew weak of it self: which
was the posture the King would have them in. But the heads of
the League were in a far different condition, they had for many
years upheld their credit at Court, had discharg'd successively
from Father to Son, the greatest Offices of the Crown, were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of many important Governments, and very considerable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and by the greatness of their Birth, and Services, by the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

of, endeavour'd to eclipse the Majesty of the King; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and dangerous Subjects; to effect which (which was the chief
and most important Affair of State) the King first exhibited a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and general prohibition to all sorts of people, excepting the
Queen his Mother, and the Queen his Wife, not to presume to
ask any thing of his Majesty, whether Money, Offices, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
reserving wholly to himself the disposition of all such
things, and that of his own voluntary grace, and bounty, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
due consideration of the party's Merit. And to the end that the
over free access to his person, might not give occasion to those he
most suspected to exceed the limits of this prohibition, he secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that with another. That no person of what quality soever,
should come into his Cabinet, without he were call'd: but from
this general rule he made a particular exception for his Favourites,
whom he made free to enter at all hours, like enough on purpose
to nettle the House of <hi>Guise;</hi> though they were not the only men
offended at it, almost all the great men about the Court, being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
concern'd, to be depriv'd of a priviledge, that was now only
reserv'd for five or six of his Majesties Creatures.</p>
                  <p>The Lords of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> being by this means exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from all hope of encreasing their power by new acquisitions
of trust, the King began to contrive how he might gently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63412:26"/>
what they already had, out of their hands; and carried it so,
that so often as there was any vacancy, by the decease of any of
their creatures, he immediately conferr'd those places upon some
of his own; and if at any time any of their Partizans were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to take money for such charges, as they were seis'd of, the
King would stick at nothing that might satisfie them, to the end
he might dispose places, into secure, and faithful hands. The
Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> by these two ways, that is by the King's gift when
a Government fell void, or otherwise by Contract, had obtain'd
the Government of <hi>Normandy,</hi> with <hi>Haure de Grace, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aen,</hi> and
other places: the Government of <hi>Anjou</hi> for the <hi>Compte de Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chage,</hi>
his Brother; the Lieutenancy of <hi>Languedoc</hi> for his Father,
with many other important Governments and Places. The Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi> had also the Government of <hi>Metz,</hi> and the <hi>Messin</hi>
Countrey, that of <hi>Dauphine, Boulogne, Calice, la Fere, Loches,</hi> the
Citadel of <hi>Lions,</hi> and some others.</p>
                  <p>As it was necessary for these two great ment to find out assured
Friends, and faithful Servants, into whose hands they might safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commit so many several places of trust, as the King's bounty
had possest them of; so was it the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
himself of such persons; and supposing he could find none,
who were likely to be more faithful to him, than those of his own
Kindred and Relation, he to that purpose call'd the greatest part
of them about his person. His elder Brother had by his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
the Government of <hi>Dauphine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke advances his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</note> in which employment
he behav'd himself so well, that he preserved that Province entire

his Government; he passed over several times into <hi>Provence,</hi> and

<hi>Saluzzo. Montcasin</hi> the Dukes Cousin was put into <hi>Metz, Cajan</hi>
his Brother had the Regiment of <hi>Champagne,</hi> and soon after the
Lieutenancy of <hi>Xaintogne, Angomois,</hi> and the Countrey of <hi>Aulins.</hi>
And many other places were dispos'd into the hands of several men
of trust, and quality, who depended upon the Duke.</p>
                  <p>But he had yet a Kinsman in <hi>Gascony,</hi> to whom, next to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he had a particular regard above all others, which was <hi>Roger,</hi>
afterwards Duke <hi>de Bellegarde,</hi> Son to <hi>Mounsieur de Termes,</hi> the
Duke's Uncle by the Mothers side, and Heir to the House of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legarde.</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:63412:26"/>
This young Gentleman, being bred up according to his
condition, to all the exercises becoming a person of his Birth and
Quality, was by the Duke brought to Court; where he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the care of his Education in his own House, keeping him still
to his Exercises, till he was grown excellent in them all: but the
Duke was not content to oblige, him only in this, he further em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
his care, and good Offices to place him in the Kings esteem,
wherein he succeeded perhaps beyond his own desire; <hi>Bellegarde</hi>
arriving to such a degree of Favour, as grew at last suspected to
the Duke himself.</p>
                  <p>Some years past over in these Court practices;<note place="margin">Anno 1584.</note> neither from the
time of the Treaty of Peace with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
in the Year 1580. until the beginning of the Year 1584. were
there any Affairs of importance, save those of the Cabinet. The
King constant to his first Maxims, continually labour'd the ruine
of the League, and of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party; neither was he, in his
own nature, more inclin'd to advance those he had a kindness for,
than he was bent to weaken, and depress those who were suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to him. The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The first commotion of the League.</note> the Cardinal his Brother, their
Relations, and Confederates, seeing all things directed to this end,
and not being able to endure the condition of private persons to
which they saw the King endeavour'd to reduce them, set on foot
great practices, both within, and without the Kingdom, and try'd
all imaginable ways they thought might help to fortifie and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
themselves. And as they had hitherto been proceeded against
without violence, so had they carried on their practices without
noise: but at last finding the King more openly labour'd their
ruine, which was already almost inevitable, they would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
forbear to unmask themselves, nor to publish their long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated
designs by an open Rupture.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning then of the Year 1585.<note place="margin">Anno 1585.</note> the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
himself to <hi>Ioinville,</hi> and there receiv'd into his House the
King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Deputies, together with the <hi>Sieur de Meneville</hi>
Attorney to the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who did all the business of
the League in <hi>France.</hi> Where also the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and divers others of his Partizans, repair'd to him. At which
Assembly it was resolv'd to break out suddenly into open Arms,
upon such conditions, as the Historians of that time have already
declar'd, and which is nothing to my business.</p>
                  <p>The King, who was soon advertiz'd of this Conspiracy (which
was now no longer a secret) to hinder it from taking any dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
effect, and in due time to provide for the safety of the Kingdom,
assembled, together with the Queen his Mother, such persons as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63412:27"/>
were of chiefest trust about him, and whose Counsels he ever
made use of in debates of greatest importance, to deliberate, and
advise what, in this posture of Affairs, was best to be done.
These were the Dukes of <hi>Espernon,</hi> of <hi>Joyeuse,</hi> and of <hi>Retz,</hi> the
Chancellour <hi>Chiveruy, Bellieure, D'O, Villeroy,</hi> and <hi>Villequier.</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> as the youngest, being commanded to give his
opinion first of the Proposition in hand, freely Remonstrated.</p>
                  <p>That so long as the ambition of the House of <hi>Guise</hi> had contain'd it
self within some moderate limits of respect to their Sovereign, he
had infinitely commended his Majesties Clemency, that so long had
wink'd at their faults, expecting when Subjects of their quality
and merit should come to themselves, and see their own error.
That in the beginning of great Crimes, Patience was almost a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Vertue, and that it had often oblig'd such Offenders into
their duty, as it would have been a matter of some difficulty to
have reduc'd by force: but that this Patience had its bounds as
well as other Vertues, and that the excess of it degenerated into
Vices, of all other most pernicious to Princes. That he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
advise his Majesty to cruelty, because it was dreadful, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane,
though it often begot tht Sovereign power a more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
respect. That profuseness begot love, at least in the receivers;
and that the other mistakes of Princes were seldom altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful;
whereas an excessive toleration render'd them contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
to all the world. That from contempt men fell into hatred,
and from hatred ran headlong into attempts. That above all
things Princes should fear being despis'd, which is infallibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to Authority; as on the contrary, Fear and Respect sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
it. That it was his opinion, the King without further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
should have recourse to Arms. That his Enemies not
having yet the assistance of Strangers, and the Forces they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
at home not being yet united, would be easily supprest. That
his Majesty ought not to suspect his own strength in this occasion;
that so good a cause as his could want no Souldiers, and that his
own Royal Courage would give vigour, and encouragement to all
true <hi>Frenchmen</hi> to maintain his Authority, not only against his
Rebellious Subjects, but against all the World.</p>
                  <p>The Chancellour <hi>Chiveruy,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Retz,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>D'O,</hi> were of this opinion, and the King himself had too
much experience, and too much judgement, not to be of the
same; but the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse, Bellieure, Villeroy,</hi> and <hi>Villequier,</hi>
were of a contrary advice: to whom the Queen Mother adhering,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63412:27"/>
the King, who had ever a great deference to her Councils, cool'd
in the inclination he had to that of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and
was over-rul'd into mildness, and moderation; which as they are
usually, the ruine of all Affairs of this nature, so they prov'd to
be of this.</p>
                  <p>They thenceforward therefore began to treat about this War,
and that by propositions not like those of a Prince to his Subject;
but such as were more proper betwixt enemy, and enemy, that stood
upon equal ground. The King, before he would resolve upon the
last remedy of Arms, first caus'd the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to be soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to try, whether or no, he would by fair means be prevail'd
with to leave of those practices his Majesty very well knew he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
against his Service, and his own Duty: which having
in vain attempted, and finding his obstinacy to be such, as was
not to be overcome by gentle wayes, he presently dispatch'd away
into <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> to make speedy Leavies both of
Horse and Foot; and conceiving he could not in the present neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
receive so prompt, and so certain a succour from any, as from
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> his Majesty would try if he could not gain
him to his Interest, that they might joyntly oppose the first fury
of the League, that erected it self to their common prejudice. In
which deliberation there was notwithstanding an almost invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
difficulty, namely the difference of Religion; for the King,
what need soever he had of the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s assistance, could
never perswade himself to joyn with him in Arms, if he were not
first a Catholick; wherein the respect to his Conscience prevail'd
with him, above the consideration of his Fortune, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>This point therefore,<note place="margin">The King sends the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to treat with the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi>
                     </note> upon which so much depended, was to
be discreetly managed: and the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> as Supreme in
the Kings confidence, was, before all others chosen to treat with
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> about this great Affair; which, that it might
be carried with the greater secresie, the Duke pretended a visit to
Madam <hi>de la Valette,</hi> his Mother at <hi>Caumont,</hi> whom he had never
seen since his advancement to favour; nor whom (a rare
example of Vertue, and Moderation in a person of her Sex, and
Condition) he could ever, with all the instance he could use, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with, to come to Court, nor perswade to leave the sweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of her own House, nor the modesty, and retiredness of her
former life.</p>
                  <p>Things being thus ordered, the Duke began his Journey from
Court with a Train, and Magnificence; that is still remembred in
all the places, through which he past. He had above 500 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63412:28"/>
and many of those men of very great quality in his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
so great authority and esteem, he had already acquir'd;
neither did that authority and esteem ever decline, but were his
inseparable Companions during his whole life. The King writ to
all the places, through which he was to pass, to receive him with
the same respect, and to pay him the same honours they would do
to his own person: which was absolutely obey'd, if not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
the Duke receiving infinite and unusual civilities, both at
<hi>Orleans, Poitiers, Burdeaux, Tholouse,</hi> and in all the other Cities
through which he pass'd. At last he arriv'd at <hi>Caumont,</hi> where he
had the satisfaction of seeing his Mother, who was no more daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the immediate sight of her Son's greatness, than she had
been before elevated with the report of it. She discours'd with him
of Affairs of State, and of the advantages of his own Fortune,
with the Gravity and Authority of a Mother, but of a Vertuous
and Prudent Mother: and I have heard him say, That he receiv'd
more safe and solid Counsels from the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dent simplicity of that
good Lady, than from the subtlety, and experience, of the most
practis'd Courtiers.</p>
                  <p>After having staid some days in her company, and his chief
business being not to receive a dispatch there, he parted thence
towards the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was then in the County of
<hi>Foix.</hi> The King did him the honour to meet him as far as <hi>Saver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi>
where they had the first Conference. The second was at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miers,</hi>
in the same County of <hi>Foix,</hi> whither the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
(who could by no means avoid the great crowd of Nobility,
and Gentry that came from all parts of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc</hi> to
see him) came so extraordinarily accompanied; that the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> who (designing to continue the same honour to him)
intended to have met him a good way out of Town, was advised
to expect him on foot at the Gates of the City, his own Friends
and Retinue, being too few to make up a number, that might
hold any proportion with that the Duke brought along with him.</p>
                  <p>In these two Conferences the Duke deliver'd what he had in
Commission,<note place="margin">D' A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>igné.</note> fortifying the propositions he had to make with so
many, and so powerful Arguments; that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>
clearly satisfied of his own good, discover'd at last a great incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to perform what the King desir'd of him, <hi>viz.</hi> his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Roman Catholick Religion. He evidently saw the
eminent danger, whereinto this great conspiracy of the League
was likely to precipitate him; with the advantages he might have
by running the same fortune with the King, of defending himself,
and his Interest, by his Majesties Authority and Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:63412:28"/>
                     <hi>Requelaure,</hi> and many other persons of good quality about him,
fortifi'd him in this good deliberation; but he was disswaded from
it by a far greater number of the other opinion, who represented
to him, the hard usage he had receiv'd at Court, the hazards he
had run in his own person, and the persecution those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Religion, who were his Servants, and Friends, had suffer'd
from thence.</p>
                  <p>They did not stick further absolutely to impute all the hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party had receiv'd to this King; although the
greatest violencies had been exercised upon them in the Reign of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, expressing as passionate a hatred against him, as
the League so impudently manifested in their Rebellious Actions.
And certainly the Misfortune of this Prince is never too much to
be lamented, nor the unsteddiness of his condition too much to
be wondered at; having his Kingdom divided by two Factions,
so directly opposite to one another that he could never serve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by the one, to defend himself from the other; and both sides,
though implacable enemies betwixt themselves, concurr'd never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
always in this, that they both equally desired his Ruine.</p>
                  <p>At last, after many Conferences, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> gave the
Duke his final Answer at <hi>Pau,</hi> whither he had invited him to come,
to this effect.</p>
                  <p>That he was the Kings most humble Servant, that he would justifie
himself to be so upon all occasions, and that he would never separate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from his Service and Interests, if his Majesty did not constrain him
to it, by condescending too much to his Enemies Counsels: but that he
could not, for any consideration of Honour, Riches, or any other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
that could be propos'd to him, depart from the Religion he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd,
and was so firmly establish'd in.</p>
                  <p>It was in this pleasant Palace of <hi>Pau,</hi> and amongst the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficences
and delights, that place then abounded in, that the Duke
had first the honour to see the Lady <hi>Catharine,</hi> the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>'s
only Sister, since Dutchess of <hi>Bar;</hi> in whom the Duke's
Merit, who was then in the flower of his youth, and the meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
of his favour, made such an impression, that she began from
that time to honour him with her favour, which she continued
to him to her death. And it is certain that the King her Brother
(who perhaps did not think himself so near that height of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
to which he soon after arriv'd, and who doubtless would
have been glad to have engag'd the Duke absolutely to his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests)
made him some propositions of Marriage with this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
but the condition of the time, and intervening accidents,
permitting that Treaty to pass no further, the Duke was forc'd to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63412:29"/>
content himself with the advantage of so glorious a friendship,
which was ever after dear, and precious to him, the whole remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his life.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to multiply still more entertainments, and
favours upon the Duke, would needs have him yet to give him the
satisfaction of another visit at <hi>Nerac;</hi> which the Duke could not
handsomely deny, though the Kings commands were something
pressing for his return to Court: and as it is likely the King of
<hi>Navarre</hi> spun out the time, that he might more maturely delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
upon an Affair of so great importance; so was it the Duke's
interest to give him that leisure he desired, if possible to make his
negotiation succeed according to the King his Masters desire. But
in the end finding he could not overcome those traverses, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
that his Majesties enemies still strew'd in his way, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
himself for his departure; and then it was, that opening the
last, and most secret part of his Commission; he told the King of
<hi>Navarre, That though he had denied his Majesty the satisfaction he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
of him, yet that the King nevertheless considering him as his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and next Heir to the Crown, if God should please to dispose of
him without Issue, had given him in charge to let him know, that he
would be well pleas'd, he should use his best endeauour to preserve himself
in a condition to oppose the League, that was confederated to the ruine
of the Royal House and Line. That since they could not unite their Arms
to resist their common Enemies, he should at least assure himself of the
places already in his possession; which his Majesty took to be much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and much more at his devotion in his hands, than those that should
hereafter be possest by the League. And that although in the present state
of Affairs he could not openly favour his designs, by reason of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in Religion; nor avoid being instant for the restitution of those
cautionary places, that had been granted to him; yet that he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
be very well satisfied with whatever he should do to his own
advantage.</hi> After this Declaration, which was receiv'd by the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi> with infinite demonstrations of Obligation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
the Duke took post for the Court at <hi>Lions,</hi> where the King
impatiently expected his return.</p>
                  <p>He was now arriv'd within view of the City, and all the Court
were mounted to honour his arrival, the King himself having
much ado to forbear going out to meet him; when a strange,
and unexpected Accident was like to have turn'd all the Honours
prepar'd for his welcome into the Funeral Pomp of his Obsequies:
For one of the Gentlemen, who came out to meet him, having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
intangled the Chape of his Sword in the Duke's Bridle,
the Horse took such a fright at it, that he immediately ran away
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63412:29"/>
with his Master; nor could the Duke stop him with all the art, and
force he had, from throwing himself, and his Rider headlong
into a dreadful precipice; the place, very remarkable by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the fall, and the wonderful escape, is to this day call'd <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernons
Leap;</hi> neither was there any man present, who did not
confidently believe the Duke certainly bruis'd to pieces: an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so firmly grounded in every one, that the report of his Death
was immediately carried to <hi>Lions,</hi> which made as many several im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
in mens minds, as their inclinations were different, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. But the King was afflicted beyond imagination,
though his Majesty was not long in that error: For some of the
company, having immediately descended the precipice, found the
Horse, who by good fortune fell plum upon his feet, and bore
the whole weight of the fall, kill'd stone dead; but the Duke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously
escap'd, with only a slight hurt in the Shoulder. This
accident set all the Court Wits on work; neither was there any,
who did not write something upon this occasion; but that which
most pleas'd the Duke, was an Emblem, that was presented to
him. The body of the Emblem was a figure of the Duke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
hanging upon the brow of a precipice; so as that he seem'd
to be irrecoverably falling from that prodigious height; when For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
running to his succour, withdrew him from the danger, with
this Motto in Italian, the first words thereof expressing his name,
<hi>Eper non lasciarti mai.</hi> A Motto the Duke at first took for a good
<hi>Omen;</hi> which time, and his own good conduct after turn'd into a
kind of Prophesie; and causing it to be grav'd in a Cornelian, and
set in a Ring, he wore it many years upon his Finger, as a mark of
his gratitude to Fortune, or rather Providence, which is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that we call Fortune; to which he ever attributed all the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of his life, rather than to his own conduct.</p>
                  <p>By this accident the Kings affection to the Duke seem'd to be
augmented,<note place="margin">The League makes the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

during the time he was constrain'd to keep his Bed: and it
was in this condition that he gave the King a full account of his
Journey, and Negotiation; a thing that furnish'd the League
with a sufficient pretense to decry the Kings actions; neither did
the Chiefs of that Faction fail to cause it proclaim'd in the Pulpits
(as it is usual to make Holy Places and Religious men the Scenes,
and Instruments to blemish the Actions of Princes) that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
was strictly united with Hereticks: and that this slander
might the better be believ'd, the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Voyage
(whom they endeavour'd to render odious to the people, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63412:30"/>
him the Abetter of that Party) was first brought upon the
stage; they publish'd that Negotiation to be a conspiracy against
the Catholick Religion, which was no way to be oppos'd, but
with their Swords in their hands: So that this was the first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
they made use of, to colour their Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>But before they would proceed to the effects of so violent a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to win the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi> to his side by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him his Daughter.</note> the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who would have been glad to have
won the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to his Party, by that means to remove
those Obstacles which the Dukes Vigour and Fidelity ever had,
and were still likely to oppose to his Designs, caus'd him to be
treated with about a match with his Daughter, since Princess of
<hi>Conty:</hi> a Princess that for the beauty of her person, the vigour of
her mind, and many other endowments, and excellent qualities,
had few rivals in the Kingdom; neither was the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
so blind, as not to see the honour he should receive by this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,
had it been propos'd in a more quiet time; or had the
Duke her Father been upon better terms with the King: but
knowing he must by such a match abandon his duty, or at least be
oblig'd to favour designs he could by no means approve, the last
consideration so absolutely prevail'd above the other, that he scarce
deliberated upon a thing that was likely to stagger his fidelity; and
how dangerous soever it were to declare himself an open enemy to
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> which he must of necessity do by refusing his
alliance; he rather chose to run that hazard, than to faulter in the
least in the duty he ow'd to his Prince and Benefactor.</p>
                  <p>It is hard to judge, what passions of grief, and despite, the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was possest withal, to see his designs so frustrated,
and his offer so despis'd by this refusal, which was in it self no
light offense; neither did he afterwards meditate any thing more,
than his revenge; and how to destroy him he could neither by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,
nor by threats acquire unto him: but his fury was rais'd
to the height by a new Honour the Duke and conferr'd upon him:

out of his charge of Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> which the Duke
had the rather laid down in favour of the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse;</hi> and
his Majesty desirous to conferre upon the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> also
some Office of the Crown (to continue the same equality he had
ever observ'd in their Fortunes) propos'd to the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> a
very advantageous recompense in lieu of his Office of <hi>Grand-Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre</hi>
to the Kings Houshold; and it seem'd probable he would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the example of his Brother the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63412:30"/>
had not quitted so important a charge without his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
advice: but the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> notwithstanding would never
comply with his Majesties desire; and though the King would
never permit him to exercise any function of his charge, thereby
to make him weary of it; yet was he still more obstinately bent
to keep it, nor would ever consent (as he said) <hi>That his Enemy
should possess any of those charges he had exerciz'd, and been invested
withal.</hi> The King seeing him so obstinate, and perhaps not more
solicitous to advance the Fortune of his Favourite, than willing to
spite the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> resolv'd with himself to erect, purposely
for the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> an Office, so honourable, and so great,
as should by its authority and power infinitely surpass all other the
highest, and most important employments both of the State and
Crown:<note place="margin">The Office of Colonel General of <hi>France</hi> ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> and this was that of <hi>Colonel General of France;</hi> an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
formerly divided into two, on this side, and on that side the
Mountains, of which <hi>Andelot</hi> had possest the one, and <hi>Strozzi</hi>
the other; and after <hi>Andelot's</hi> death they were united in <hi>Strozzi,</hi>
who remain'd sole Colonel. After <hi>Strozzi</hi>'s decease, the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by an Edict re-united these two Offices into one, made it an
Office of the Crown, under the Title of <hi>Colonel General of France,</hi>
caus'd that Edict to be ratified in Parliament, attributing to it the
absolute power to name in general Officers for all the vacant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the <hi>French</hi> Militia, without so much as excepting from this
nomination, that of <hi>Camp-Master to the Regiment of Guards:</hi> He
establish'd for the Colonel a Sovereign Court of Justice, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of War, to determine of the Lives and Honours of Military
men, without calling any other to it, than his own Officers; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to it besides several Graunts, Priviledges, and Pensions, and
finally (to sum up all his bounty) his Majesty delivering the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
into the Dukes hands, told him, that nothing troubled him,
but that he knew not how to invest him into a more absolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and that he could not adde a part of the Royal Dignity to
his charge. And it is certain, that in giving the Duke the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> his Majesty would have given
them in Sovereignty, and have demis'd to him the Title of the
Crown: but the Duke displeas'd with this proposition, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
offer'd to his Obedience and Loyalty, complain'd to the King,
that his Majesty, honouring him with so noble an employment,
should go about to deprive him of the dearest Relation he had,
which was that of his Majesties most humble, and obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
an honour that in his soul he preferr'd before all titles of
Sovereignty, and all the advantages of Fortune his Majesty
could prefer him to; and thereupon receiv'd both the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63412:31"/>
and the charge of <hi>Colonel General,</hi> under the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                  <p>From this new advancement the League, as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
deriv'd their second pretense for the taking of Arms;
they look'd upon the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s new Honour, as an
offence to their whole Party; and the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> took it
for a particular injury to himself, and thereupon openly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd.</p>
                  <p>That there were now no more Employments,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s complaints.</note> Riches, or Honours, save
only for the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and <hi>la Valette</hi> his Brother. That
the State was only impoverish'd by profusions made in their favour.
That they were the true causes of the peoples oppression. That the
Treasure, set apart for the extirpation of Heresie, was by them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to their own uses, and particular profit. That the greatest
Dignities, the most important Places, and Governments of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
concern, were too many advantages for their ambition. That
whilst the Kings good Servants were neglected, and kept under,
there were new Offices, with unheard of Priviledges, contriv'd,
and erected for them. That if the power they had over the King
were longer suffer'd, they would equally ruine the State, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
That the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was therefore to be remov'd
from Court, if men desir'd to see an end of publick Miseries. That
his Majesty being deliver'd from his Counsels, which were equally
violent, and interessed, would doubtless for the future be more
favourable to his good Subjects, and better inclin'd to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Cause.</p>
                  <p>At the same time a <hi>Manifesto</hi> was publish'd by the Cardinal
of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who was the declared Head of that Faction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
principally the foregoing complaints, and immediately
after follow'd the rising into Arms.<note place="margin">The League takes up Arms.</note> The first design of the
League was upon <hi>Metz,</hi> as if they meant to strike at the heart
of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Fortune; a place so considerable,
that the Duke had reason to look upon it, as the surest founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his greatness: neither did he in his latter years conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to any thing with more unwillingness, and reluctancy,
than to the surrender of that place, that proposition seeming
to him, as though men were bent to the total ruine of his
House; nor could he ever have been perswaded to have stript
himself of such a defense, upon a less consideration, than the
investiture of his Son the Cardinal of <hi>la Valette</hi> into that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
who being younger by forty years, than himself,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63412:31"/>
he might reasonably hope, it would continue in his Family at
least during his life: but God was pleased to dispose it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
                  <p>To make a right judgment of the importance of this place,
it will be necessary to consider its Site, and condition; and the
share it has ever had in the Duke's Fortune does indeed require
it should be something insisted upon.<note place="margin">The descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the City of <hi>Metz,</hi> and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bigger than <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> or <hi>Orleans;</hi> that is to say, one of
the greatest, and the fairest in the Kingdom, full of Inhabitants,
and those a rich and industrious people; to whom the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of <hi>Germany</hi> gives great facility, to an advantageous
Commerce. She was in former times thought beautiful enough to
be the Metropolis of <hi>Austrasia,</hi> once the Inheritance of one of our
Kings: but when the Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> began to decline, and
that the Princes who were Subject to it began to withdraw
themselves from their obedience (every one being ambitious to
be Sovereign in his own Dominions) many Cities, which were
also in the same subjection, allur'd by the tempting sound of
Liberty, follow'd the same example. Of these <hi>Metz</hi> was one, who
for many years took leave to govern her self by her own Laws,
annually creating Sovereign Magistrates, disposing absolutely of
the Lives and Estates of her Subjects, Coyning Money, and in
all things taking upon her the Authority of a Sovereign Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
in which condition she maintain'd her self, till the Year
1552. that the Constable <hi>Montmorency,</hi> passing with the King's
Army that way, totally freed her from all kind of Homage to
the Empire, and settled it under the Protection of the Crown of
<hi>France.</hi> 'Tis true that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, in whose Reign
this Conquest was made, continued to this City her ancient pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges;
but withal to assure himself of his possession, he did
exceedingly fortifie it, establishing a Governour of his own, and
causing a Citadel to be built, which was mightily cryed up, for
one of the best, and most exact of that time: but this was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sieges were turn'd into a Science, and that the industry of
man had left little to Fortune, in this kind of War. It does not
now carry that Reputation; and in this condition it was when
the Duke entred upon his Government, only with this difference,
that what its own Laws had formerly perform'd by their own
Virtue, during its independency, was now executed by his order,
under the Authority of the Royal Name, the Duke (as I have said
before) absolutely refusing to accept it upon other terms. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
appointed, and created the Supreme Magistrate, whom they

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63412:32"/>
Judges, who were to determine in Sovereignty, upon the Lives,
Honours, and Estates of all the Inhabitants: but withal the
Duke had Authority upon occasion to censure them, had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to remove them from their Magistracy within their year, if
he saw cause; or to continue them beyond their term, if he
thought fit. It is then no wonder if he were infinitely respected
in a place, where all things so absolutely depended upon him:
but that which was indeed very rare, and very commendable,
was, that in so unlimited a power, and in the course of above
threescore years, that this City continued in his Custody, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
himself with that Justice, and Moderation, that not so
much as any one Citizen ever complain'd of his administration;
neither is there any now living, that do not yet remember, with a
kind of delight, the indulgence, and sweetness of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke stood seiz'd of a place of this consequence,
and so dispos'd to his service, it was no easie matter to cut him off;
such a retirement being a sufficient refuge from all sudden danger:
neither (the Town being intrusted in the hands of valiant, and
faithful friends) had it been convenient (even when he was most
remote from it) to provoke him; lest a place of that importance,
should have taken part in his disgrace, and follow'd the humour
of his discontents. It was therefore by the taking of this Town,
that the League would begin to labour the Duke's ruine, and in
that the advancement of their own Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The most considerable Forces, the League had then on foot,
were those of the Duke of <hi>Lorain;</hi> a Prince who having till
this time contain'd himself Neuter in all the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occasion thought fit, it seems, to declare himself partial to
his Family, in hopes nevertheless to joyn <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun</hi>
to his own Dukedom: neither was his design unlikely to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
for the two last having made no great difficulty of receiving
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> he had reason (considering the intelligence he
had in the City) to expect the same from <hi>Metz,</hi> had not the Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi> by his vigilancy prevented him, seasonably re-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Garrison, with divers Gentlemen his particular Servants,
and a good number of Souldiers; by whose coming it was so well
secur'd, that the League thought it not fit to attempt it.</p>
                  <p>This great storm, thus blown over, the Duke, alarm'd by the
late hazard this City had run, resolv'd to establish himself in that
important possession, so as that for the future it might be secur'd
from the like danger; and to that purpose some of his friends ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rendred the Governour suspected to him by some carriage of his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63412:32"/>
at such time as the Army of the League were approaching towards
him, though the grounds of this mistrust were not in the Dukes
opinion clear enough to countenance an open rupture with him;
yet were they sufficient to make the Duke remove him from that
trust, and to call him about his own person, instituting <hi>Sobole,</hi>
who before was only Lieutenant of the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> in the absolute
authority both of the <hi>City, Cittadel,</hi> and <hi>Messin</hi> Countrey; adding
withal ten thousand Crowns in Gold to mend his Equipage, that

he had seated him in; a bounty we shall hereafter see how <hi>Sobol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and one of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s firmest Adherents; who having
been formerly awed into his duty by the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> in which <hi>le

so important to his Majesties Service; he who before-hand had

both what I have receiv'd from the Dukes own mouth,
and what I have gather'd from the Commentaries of <hi>Mounsieur
de Villeroy</hi> himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mounsieur de Villeroy</hi> had been from the Dukes infancy Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and Minister of State; a friend to <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a man of great Credit, and Interest, in the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
he had seen the beginning, and encrease of the Dukes Favour,
at which he ought not in reason to repine: but on the contrary
had cause to believe, that such a friend as he, would fortifie him
with the King, and be no little assisting to support that Trust he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
possest in the management of Affairs. And in effect the
Duke had a true affection, and esteem for him, who as he was ever
very respective, and constantly fix'd to all his Fathers Interests
(whose memory he had in the greatest veneration) it is certain
had a particular consideration for all his Friends; of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Mounsieur Villeroy</hi> being one, the first years of the Duke's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
were past over in a strict correspondency with him: but at
last <hi>Villeroy</hi> perceiving the Dukes Credit proceeded so far, as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to possess that interest in the Kings Bosom he pretended to share,
he began in the end to grow jealous of a Prosperity, he ought so
much the more to have cherish'd, by how much it was likely to
be more useful to him; and thenceforward began openly to
thwart all his opinions in Council, rais'd up a party against him, to
lessen his Reputation there: and the Queen Mother nettled to see
her Authority weakned with the King, by the great power the
Duke had with him; desiring nothing more, than to have him
remov'd, that she might recover her former possession, could find
no one so ready as <hi>Mounsieur de Villeroy</hi> to second her Passion, and
the animosity she had conceiv'd against him. They joyntly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
that it was necessary to sacrifice the Duke to the malice of
the League; and that the King ought to abandon him for
the general satisfaction; a Counsel that had been voluntarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by the Duke himself: and I have heard him say, he would
as willingly have retir'd then from Court, as he did not long after,
could he have obtain'd the Kings permission: but his Majesty ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well perceiving that his Favourite was only a pretense the
League made use of to cover their own ambition, that it was the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63412:33"/>
Royal Authority they aim'd at, and that their design was only to
remove so good a Servant, with less difficulty to make themselves
<hi>Maisters</hi> of Affairs; the more obstinately they insisted upon that
Article, the more resolute his Majesty was to protect him.</p>
                  <p>The Duke very well inform'd that <hi>Villeroy</hi> was one of those,
who contributed most to his Persecution, and seeing how pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
he profess'd to desire his ruine, resented it with an Animosity
proportionable to the Injury receiv'd; which was the more violent,
by how much the offense came from a person he had never done
any ill Office to, and whom he had ever made it his business to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige.
They were in this posture of unkindness, on the one side,
and the other, when happned the taking of the <hi>Cittadel</hi> of <hi>Lions;</hi>
before which time it was thought, <hi>Villeroy</hi> had secretly treated of a
Marriage betwixt <hi>Alincourt</hi> his Son, and <hi>Mandelot</hi>'s only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
not having dar'd publickly to do it by reason of the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<hi>Mandelot</hi> held with those of the League: but having upon
this occasion taken up <hi>Mandelot</hi>'s Interests against <hi>le Passage;</hi>
that is to say, against the Duke himself, <hi>le Passage</hi> being his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he offer'd to undertake for <hi>Mandelot</hi>'s fidelity to the King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
his Majesty would please to consent to the Marriage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and settle upon <hi>Alincourt</hi> the Government of <hi>Lions</hi> in rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
in favour of the match; which the King, being reduc'd to
the necessity of taking all men for friends, who were not actually
otherwise, was sorc'd to allow of, and to ratifie what he could not
well impeach; by that means trying to draw <hi>Mandelot</hi> over to him:
but the Duke exasperated to the last degree could no longer smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his passion, nor dissemble his animosity against <hi>Villeroy;</hi> but
spoke freely, and aloud to his disadvantage, and of the Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
he held with the League, which was the first effect of their
open, and declared Hatred.</p>

(being but three little days Journey from thence) his presence
would be apt to fortifie the Citizens in their Devotion to him, and
secondly, the number of his Confederates being so great, and some
of them of so great Authority in the City, he could by their means
continually infuse into the people such dispositions, as might best
serve his purpose: hoping by this means, either to incline the
King, to satisfie all his demands; or at least to be able to raise
such mutiny and confusion in the City, as might give him oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
at one time, or another, to effect that by fine Force, he could
not obtain by the more moderate ways of Addresses, and Treaty.</p>

Person, and his Affairs were in, and then would he take up
Arms for his own defense; which he had no sooner resolv'd, but
that at the same time he saw it was too late, and impossible to be
done. The Reiters which he had rais'd in <hi>Germany</hi> could not come
to him, (the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> having deny'd them a passage through
his Countrey) and all the Forces within the Kingdom were either
engag'd with the League, or with the King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> so that
the King was left utterly naked of all defense, save of those few
Servants he had about his own person: Nay even those who, in
the beginning of these troubles, would with all their hearts have
assisted him to punish to Duke, whilst meerly in the condition of
a Rebel, durst not, now he was grown to that formidable height,
and become the head of a strong Party, attempt to succour a
weak, and disfurnish'd Prince, against an armed and prevailing
Subject.</p>
                  <p>The thoughts of War then being altogether fruitless, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
in the posture the King then was, he must of necessity
have recourse to the Treaties of Peace; to which resolution he was
further necessitated by the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s breaking into Arms,
at the same time, which I should not however have mention'd for
a second Motive his Majesty had to satisfie the League, had this
Prince pretended no further, than simply to defend his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
with those Forces he had already had in <hi>France;</hi> for then his
designs might have been favourable to the King, and either have
kept the Army of the League wholly imploy'd; or at least have
diverted their designs: but he fearing at once to be opprest by the
Union of two Catholick Armies, had recourse to strangers for
aid. The King knew he had treated with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
and with the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> who both of them assisted him
with Men, and Money, and that all the Protestant Princes of
<hi>Germany,</hi> made extraordinary Provision to send him a powerful
succour; so that he now evidently saw, he must in good earnest
close with the League, and joyn with one of the Factions, to
preserve himself from being a Prey to both.</p>
                  <p>The Queen Mother had for many years been employ'd Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix
in all the accomodations of Peace that had been concluded in
<hi>France;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Queen Mother sent to Treat of a Peace.</note> and it was commonly believed, she was not then altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without such an Interest in the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> as might have
establish'd this to the Kings satisfaction: I never heard the Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi> say she was partial to that Faction; and though he
receiv'd several ill Offices from her in his declining Favour, he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
ever retain'd a constant Respect for so great a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
who was his Masters Mother, and ever defended her Honour
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63412:35"/>
against all the calumnies of the time. 'Tis true he thought she
was not altogether displeas'd that there should ever be a party on
foot in <hi>France,</hi> such as might oblige the King her Son to make use
of her Counsels and Mediation; her great, and ambitious spirit
ill digesting the calms of peace; and worse enduring to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of an employment; in which she had ever been as success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as necessary. Her therefore the King passionately entreated to
labour an Accommodation with the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> an Office she as
chearfully undertook, and two dayes after began her Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Espernay,</hi> where she had appointed the Duke to meet, and
whither he accordingly came, together with the Cardinal of
<hi>Bourbon.</hi> In the first overtures she found a spirit puft up with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and wholly averse to Peace: but when he had more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
consider'd, that it was not yet time to weaken the King's
Authority (which he thought was absolutely at his mercy) that
there would afterwards remain the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> a powerful,
active, and diligent Enemy, back'd with great Forces within, and
ready to receive greater from without the Kingdom; he conceiv'd
it requisite to subdue him first, that he might afterwards dispose
of the Kings Affairs with less opposition: so that he altogether
fell from the extravagancy of his first demands, and only insisted
vpon the suppression of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which he call'd the
extirpation of Heresie; though it was in effect in order only to
the establishment of his own Power.</p>
                  <p>The King had so openly declared himself an Enemy (as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
he was) to this new Religion; and it so much imported
him to clear himself to his Subjects from those aspersions the
League had cast upon him, that he was now necessitated to declare
against the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> in the most severe Form, the League
could themselves invent; yet was it not without the greatest relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy
imaginable, that his Majesty was constrain'd to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
against a Prince, whom (as has been said before) it was not
his interest wholly to suppress: but having lost the opportunity he
once had, whilst they were weak, and inconsiderable, of chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Heads of the League, he saw himself now necessitated to
grant them that, he could no longer, without apparent Ruine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse.
His Wisdom then prompting him to submit to the necessity
of Affairs, he made a show of complying in all things with their
desires; and that he might with less difficulty encline the Duke of
<hi>Espernon</hi> to consent to a resolution he had ever before been so much
against, he privately told him, <hi>That he did not consent to those things
that were exacted from him without very great Aversion, but that he
hop'd to reap from thence a signal effect, and a very great advantage to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63412:36"/>
his Affairs; that the Party of the League was now too strong to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
by force: that they had brought their Armies to the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tes of</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
<hi>and that</hi> Paris <hi>it self was corrupted in their Favour: That he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well saw the time to chastise them was now past, and that he now knew
(but too late) what he had lost in letting the occasion slip, wherein they
might have been punish'd, when he had advis'd him to it; but that such
an opportunity would certainly return again, and that then his evil
Counsellors should never disswade him from making better use of his time:
That in the mean time it was necessary to dissemble, that they might the
better look into their Enemies Interests, to discover their weakness, and to
make use of that discovery to their ruine: That there was no Party so
strong that was not defective somewhere: That it was necessary to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
where that defect lay, and that it was impossible to make that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
without engaging with, and being interested in the cause they
meant to overthrow: That being Head of the League, as they would
have him declare himself to be, he should be able to strew such difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the way of their Designs, as that they would find themselues per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd
in every enterprize they should undertake.</hi> Though the Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi> had much rather his Majesty would have defended
his Honour, and trampled Authority, by the Arms of those
few good Catholick Servants he had, and to have joyn'd with the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> (with whom he did not think an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
impossible) and with such Foreign Forces, as were affectionate
to the Crown; yet seeing it was now expedient to submit to the
necessity of the time, he humbly acquiesc'd in the good Pleasure of
the King his Master.</p>
                  <p>In this posture of Affairs the King writ to the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that she might conclude the Treaty upon such Conditions, as
she thought fit; and, for a further testimony of his Candour, and
sincere intention herein, sent the dispatch by the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
whom all the world knew to have the greatest power with
him, and the greatest Antipathy for the League; to the end that
the Lords of <hi>Guise</hi> might not in the least doubt the observance of
a Treaty, that was ratifi'd on his part, by a person who liv'd in so
eminent a degree of favour with him.</p>
                  <p>This employment of the Duke's, though it was only intended
to countenance the Queens Negotiation, and to make it more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
succeed, did nevertheless incense her in the highest degree
against him. She look'd upon his interposition, as proceeding
from a diffidence the King had in her, and not daring to manifest
her dissatisfaction to him, she threw it wholly upon the Duke, and
took from thence a new occasion to augment the ill will she had
formerly conceiv'd against him. The Treaty was notwithstanding
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63412:36"/>
concluded at <hi>Nemours,</hi> wherein the Lords of <hi>Guise</hi> had the full of
their own demands, whether against those of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or in their own particular favour. They were to command
the Armies,<note place="margin">The Treaty concluded at <hi>Nemours.</hi>
                     </note> that should be set forth against the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> and
over and above the great, and advantageous Governments they
were already possest of, the King delivered over twelve, or fifteen
of the best Cities in the Kingdom into their hands; together
with vast summes of money: And then it was, that men were
undeceiv'd, and that all men plainly saw they minded more their
own private Interest, and the establishment of their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than they regarded the advancement of the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>The Treaty then being concluded, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> came to
kiss the Kings Hands at St. <hi>Maur des <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it purposely to defeat the Duke of the <hi>Parisians</hi> applause;
from whence after the Ratification of the Articles, the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
into his own Government of <hi>Champagne,</hi> dismiss'd with
some feign'd Demonstrations of Favour, which was also on his
part receiv'd with the same dissimulation.</p>
                  <p>From thence forward the King began with great artifice to spin
out the violent designs of the League,<note place="margin">The War begun by the King against the <hi>Hugonots.</hi>
                     </note> manifesting nevertheless
such an animosity against the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and so firm a resolution vigorously to effect what had been concluded against them, as he conceiv'd necessary to satisfie a people jealous of his sincerity, and
apt to take up new suspicions upon every instigation of their own
corrupted fansie: And in order thereunto he went to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in great Formality, and State, to cause an Edict to pass
against those of the Reform'd Religion; where after a revocation
of the cautionary Towns, of the <hi>Chambres Mi-parties,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chambres Mi-parties</hi> were Courts of Justice establish'd in divers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cities of <hi>France,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> of which Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been granted in their Favour, they were prescrib'd by a day
prefix'd, either to abjure their Religion; or to be declar'd enemies
to the State, and punishable to the last degree.</p>
                  <p>This first Act thus play'd, his Majesty assembled the Provost
<hi>des Marchands,</hi> and the <hi>Eschevins</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> to demand money of
them for the prosecution of the War they had so ardently desir'd;
which he also propos'd to the Clergy, who had shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
no less zealous than they: but finding both the one, and
the other equally cold in the business, after he had reproach'd
them with their unseasonable violence, which he said, had hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him from bringing about by easie, and infallible ways, the
utter extirpation of Heresie (a thing he more earnestly desir'd,
than any of them) he told them flatly, that since by them this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63412:37"/>
was first set on foot, it was reasonable, that they who had
been the promoters of it, should likewise be at the charge of the War.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty thought by grasping thus at their purses to take
off their edge of fighting, and by representing to them the charge,
and incommodities of War, he should at the same time imprint
in them a hatred, and aversion to it. But what reasons can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with a pre-possess'd, and exasperated multitude? The people
displeas'd at the difficulties the King laid before them, and suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

themselves to be seduc'd by the malepert Preachers of the
League, who by their seditious Sermons had soon perswaded them
into commotion, impos'd upon the King a necessity of beginning
the War; and forgetting the respect due to the Majesty of their
Prince, gave him in plain terms to understand, that he should
not be safe in his own <hi>Louvre,</hi> if he did not forthwith betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Arms.</p>
                  <p>The condition of the time, and the conditions of the Treaty
lately concluded with the League, equally obliging the King to fall
into speedy action, and also to serve himself with some of the
Heads of that Party in this Expedition; his Majesty to comply

                     <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> sent with an Army into <hi>Provence.</hi>
                     </note> A Government which being a little before left va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
by the Death of the Grand Prior of <hi>France,</hi> Bastard of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois,</hi>
had been conferr'd upon him; and a Province wherein (of
all other) his Majesties Authority had the greatest need of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
having formerly been much weakned by the two contrary
Factions that divided the State: Whereof one was commanded
by the <hi>Sieur de Lesdiguieres,</hi> Head of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party; and the
other by the <hi>Sieur de Vins,</hi> the Kings Lieutenant there, but a
man very partial to the League. His Majesty therefore desiring,
amidst the confusion that was made by these two Parties, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Countrey to himself, sent thither the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
with a good Army, appointing <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for his Lieutenant in that Service; neither was he deceiv'd
in his choice: for in less than four months time, <hi>Province,</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63412:37"/>
                     <hi>Dauphiné</hi> were wholly settled in his obedience, the only part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of the Kingdom, where his Majesty was effectively, and
truly serv'd; and had he had many more such Servants to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
his Affairs had certainly, and in a very little time, chang'd
their face, and the Royal Authority been rescued from the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Insolence, that trod it under foot in most Provinces of
<hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Office of <hi>Colonel General</hi> having given the Duke absolute
Authority over the Infantry, there was great contest amongst the
old Regiments, which should be preferr'd to follow him in this
action, in which he made shift to satisfie the ambition of the
greatest part; his Majesty (who gave him absolute power in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of greater difficulty) being content, that his best Souldiers
should serve under his trustiest Captain: so that he drew out a
good part of the Regiment of Guards, of that of <hi>Ficardy,</hi> and
<hi>Champagne,</hi> with other Companies out of other Regiments, to
the number of ten thousand Foot; to which was added twelve
hundred Horse, and twelve piece of Cannon, with their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page.</p>
                  <p>The Duke,<note place="margin">Anno 1586.</note> having about the end of Summer led his Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Provence,</hi> put them immediately into vigorous Action. <hi>Vins</hi>
was the first he undertook, who, having before been worsted by
<hi>Lesdiguieres,</hi> was in no condition of making any great resis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Lesdiguieres,</hi> though victorious over the League, finding yet
himself too weak to oppose the King's Army, conducted by so
experienc'd Commanders, by withdrawing into his own strength,
gave the two Brothers liberty to make themselves Masters of
<hi>Seynes, Breoules, Chorges,</hi> and many other Considerable places as
well in <hi>Provence,</hi> as <hi>Dauphiné</hi> with wonderful expedition: so that
by these successes the two Factions, which had so long afflicted
those two good Provinces, being equally supprest, the Duke had
leisure to return to Court, where his presence was not a little ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to countermine such Practices (of which <hi>Mounsieur de
Villeroy</hi> says in his <hi>Mesmoires</hi> the Duke suspected him to be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
as were by his Enemies set on foot against him. Neither
did the Duke need to make any great difficulty of retiring from
<hi>Provence,</hi> considering the good posture he had brought Affairs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and that he left his second self upon the place, not only in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
and zeal to the King's Service, but also in valour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
namely, <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> his Brother: a man
whose Vertues had acquir'd so great a Reputation with all worthy
men, that he is never to be spoke of, without very worthy men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the highest Characters of Honour. But the Duke had
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63412:38"/>
no sooner turn'd his back of <hi>Provence,</hi> and taken back part of the
Army with him, than the contrary Factions, encourag'd by this
Division of the Army, made head anew: so that it was necessary
to set another Army on foot to oppose them; the care of which
now wholly rested upon <hi>Valette:</hi> nor did there need a more active
and experienc'd Captain. His principal Exploits were against the
League, to whose succour the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> came in person, an
ambitious Prince, and one that watching all opportunities of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
his own Dominion, had from the Leagues first taking
Arms, joyn'd himself with the Countess of <hi>Saut,</hi> the <hi>Sieur d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
Vins,</hi> the <hi>Compte de Carses,</hi> and other persons of Quality of that
side; neither has he (what Treaties of Peace soever have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with the League) ever desisted from his first design of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Countrey by force of Arms. But <hi>la Valette</hi> after having
won from him the so celebrated Battel of <hi>Vignon,</hi> did so unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
press upon him, and in several other encounters obtain'd
so many advantages over him, that he forc'd him to retire beyond
the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and to let <hi>Provence</hi> alone. Neither did <hi>Dauphiné</hi> escape
his diligence, for <hi>Lesdiguieres</hi> finding himself too weak to meet
him in the Field, gave him opportunity to withdraw <hi>Geyssens</hi> from
the <hi>Cittadel</hi> of <hi>Valence,</hi> which he held in the name of the League,
having been plac'd in that command by the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and
to recover <hi>Gap</hi> into the King's Obedience. So that the two Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that of the League, and that of the Religion, being equally
weakned by his Valour and Conduct; he then so establish'd
those two Provinces in their duty, that it was afterwards no hard
matter for him to continue them in that posture of Obedience,
until the death of the King.</p>
                  <p>Whilst <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> was employ'd about these brave

he could contrive, to ruine both their Credits with the King:
Which though the Duke had long observ'd, and as long forborn
to take notice of; yet could he at last no longer restrain himself
from breaking out to a high, and publick Rupture with him. It
was at St, <hi>Aignan</hi> that it happened, at the time the Army of <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
were preparing to enter the Kingdom; and that the King
was consulting of the means to hinder their passage. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given an account of the Animosities betwixt these two
great Ministers, and the Causes that produc'd them, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I should not so punctually have done; neither should I now
do it, had not <hi>D'Avila</hi> an Authour of great Repute for the History
of that time enlarg'd himself more thatn ordinary upon this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63412:38"/>
as upon an accident very considerable, and of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to the general Affairs that were then in agitation.</p>
                  <p>The Duke then, and <hi>Villeroy</hi> being upon these ill terms, the
King at the especial instance of the Duke had assigned a summe of
20000 Crowns only, for the entertainment of <hi>Mounsieur de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi>'s
Army, a proportion very inconsiderable for the great end
to which it was design'd; but very great considering the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
the State was then in: which mony <hi>Villeroy</hi> (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Majesties Order) having diverted to the Payment of the
Grand Provost, and his Archers, the Duke discover'd it to the
King in open Council, complaining that a summe so dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to the utility of his Brothers Services should be diverted
to another use. To which Complaint <hi>Villeroy</hi> who was present
reply'd aloud in his Majesties Presence, <hi>That what the Duke had
said, was not true.</hi> It is easie to judge, whether the Duke, who was
then rais'd to the highest degree of Favour, were surpriz'd with
so tart, and so unexpected an Injury. I have heard him say, That
in his whole life, he was never so sensibly offended; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he had so much power over himself, as to forbear all kind of
violence in the Kings Presence, so much as from any extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of words: neither made he other reply to <hi>Mounsieur de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi>
but this, <hi>That the Presence of the King which had encourag'd him
to give that Language, oblig'd him to be Silent: but that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King both disquieted, and displeas'd at this Quarrel, and
willing to interrupt them from proceeding further, went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
out of the Closet, expecting the Duke should follow him;
but he staying behind, and being now no longer aw'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
due to his Majesties Person, fell very severely upon <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Villeroy</hi> for the words past: some say he proceeded to high
threats, that he had his hand up to have strook him, and that he
gave him some very unhandsome language; though I never heard
the Duke confess so much, in the many times he has discours'd of
that business: But <hi>Mounsieur de Villeroy</hi> immediately went and
complain'd to the King of the Duke's Threats, demanding Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and Protection from him; where receiving no very satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
answer, he waited time, and opportunity, by working his own
revenge to procure his own Safety, which happened not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when we shall see the Duke's Valour frustrate all his Enemies
Designs. But let us in the mean time return to the general Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>We have already observ'd, that from the first insurrection of the
League, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> not doubting, but that all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63412:39"/>
were chiefly intended against him, had earnestly solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the Confederates of his Religion, not only at home, but in
Foreign Parts to his aid: but when he understood, that, by the
mediation of the Queen Mother,<note place="margin">The entry of the Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into <hi>France,</hi> and the Kings prudent conduct in this War.</note> the Treaty of <hi>Nemours,</hi> had
been sign'd by the King himself at St. <hi>Maur;</hi> he, then foreseeing
the storm that was ready to break upon him, very well knew, that
he should infallibly be overwhelm'd, without a speedy succour.
He therefore again press'd his Allies immediately to send their
Forces, if they desir'd to find him in a condition to receive the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of their Assistance, his Enemies so passionately precipitating
his Ruine. The German Princes spurr'd on by this new Solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and having yet been ancient Allies to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
would, it should seem, proceed with some shew of respect, and
thereupon concluded amongst themselves to send first an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Embassy to the King, before they would engage in so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
a Quarrel. In this occurrence all the Court expected some
Civil Remonstrance on the German Princes part; but they soon
found themselves deceiv'd; for the Ambassadours either prevail'd
upon by their Confederates in <hi>France,</hi> or transported with their
own Zeal to Religion, and the passion they had for those of that
Party, having publickly reproach'd the King with his breach of
Faith towards his Protestant Subjects, it evidently appear'd, that
their design was not to mediate an Accommodation; but to push
things on to the decision of Arms, by giving the King a premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
Affront. I have heard the Duke say that he was present at the
delivery of this Oration, and that the King justly nettled at so sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
an Embassy, after having in the heat, and apprehension of so
great an injury, spoken with greater eloquence, than ever till that
time he had heard him do, he positively, and for a final answer,
return'd the lye to whoever should reproach him with the breach
of his Faith. The Ambassadors dismiss'd after this manner, fail'd
not at their return home, to exasperate their several Princes to the
last degree; who, being before resolv'd upon a War, made spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and great Leavies, and soon set such an Army on foot, as they
thought, joyn'd to that the King of <hi>Novarre</hi> had already of his
dependants, should be able absolutely to subdue the Catholick
Party in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King, as he very well foresaw what inconvenience the
entry of such a multitude of strangers must of necessity bring
upon his Kingdom, so did he by all imaginable ways try to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their coming: and seeing that nothing, but satisfying
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> could possibly divert that mischief, he once
more try'd by the means of the Queen his Mother, if possible to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63412:39"/>
win him to a timely accommodation. Which being by her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
after many delayes, scruples, and jealousies on both sides, a
Conference was at last concluded on at St. <hi>Brix,</hi> a private house
seated upon the Banks of <hi>Charente</hi> near <hi>Coynack:</hi> but this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
nevertheless being able to produce no good effect, by reason
of that invincible difficulty, the difference of Religion, and the
German Princes hasting away their Armies into <hi>France,</hi> his Majesty
was forc'd to prepare himself to oppose them. A Resolution that
he effected with so good orders, and so prudent a Conduct, that
their defeat ought to live for a perpetual Monument of this Princes
Wisdom, no man else having any voice in that deliberation. It was
he alone who by his own Wise Counsels rendred all the attempts
of his Enemies fruitless; it was he alone that overthrew them,
and that having by his own prudent orders made them suffer those
incommodities that unnerved them, and put them out of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense,
gave the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> an opportunity, to win a great deal
of Honour, with little trouble, and danger. So great an advantage
it is to live in the publick opinion.</p>
                  <p>The King having employ'd all his care, and art to hinder the
Reiters from entring into the Kingdom, and all to no purpose,
and finding all Treaties, and all moderate wayes ineffectual to
divert the blow, that was intended against him, he at last put on
his wonted resolution, and determined bravely to encounter that
danger, he then plainly saw he could not with all his dexterity
prevent. Having therefore in this determination assembled his
Council, to the end he might advise with his principal Ministers,
about an Affair of this important consequence; and having there
laid open the business to them, he found their opinions very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
neither is it strange that men of several judgments should
dissent in a resolution of this high nature: some advised him to
advance with his Army out of his own Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ines, and there to
expect, and fight the Enemy: others were of a contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
neither did the one, nor the other want reasons, or example
to justifie their advice. At last the King himself deliver'd his own
opinion, which was, <hi>To permit the Enemy quietly to enter the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but withal to make them pass through so many difficulties, and
to suffer so many necessities, that they should be already as good, as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
before they should come to fight. He remonstrated to them, that
to encounter them fresh, and in their trim, as they came out of their
own Country, animated to War by the Interest of Religion, and by the
compassion of their Confederates, were to expose things to a doubtful
event. That the loss of a Battel, in the flourishing condition those of
the Reformed Religion would be after such a Victory, would endanger</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:63412:40"/>
France, <hi>and the Catholick Religion. That he had a desire to preserve
both the one, and the other, and to ruine his Enemies more leisurely: but
withal more surely, and that there would nevertheless be Honour enough
in the Victory, provided it were absolute, and entire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being then the final Resolution, his Majesty gave order
forthwith, that his Armies should be all ready in <hi>Iuly</hi> following,
to appear at <hi>Meaux,</hi> which he assigned for the general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous;
and, besides the present Forces that he intended to set on foot,
he commanded that in every Province, the Nobility, and<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Arriere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> which upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation I find to be in effect the same thing with our Train-bands</note> Train-Bands
should be ready to march at the first Summons. He
dispatch'd also several Commissions for new Leavies, to the end,
they might either serve to fill up the old Troops, as they should
grow thin; or to stand for a reserve in case any thing should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
amiss to the main Army. He sent Commissaries on purpose to
beat down all the Ovens, and Mills that were in his Enemies way,
from the Frontier, as far as the place he had appointed for his own
Quarters. He caus'd all the Grain of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Country to be fetch'd in,
and stor'd up in the good Towns, with all Artificers, and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of what condition soever. He caus'd all the defensible Cities
to be fortified with Men, Victuals, and Ammunition; and on
the contrary, demolish'd all such places as were not tenable, nor
able to withstand a Siege. He commanded all the Bridges to be
broken down, all the Fords to be spoil'd, and generally all things
to be destroy'd, that might any way contribute to his Enemies
advantage, or subsistance. He further sent to the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi>
that it stood with his Interest, in this occasion, to do the same in
his Territories; and having thus dispos'd all things, and the Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi> having highly applauded what he had done, he told
the King with his wonted freedom, that there was one thing yet
left undone; which, though it were more in his Majesties Power,
and Royal Disposition, than all the rest, would nevertheless be
the hardest for him to execute. The King commanded him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
himself, and to tell him what that thing was, promising
withal to satisfie him in it; whereupon the Duke growing more
serious, told him, <hi>That he humbly besought his Majesty to command
his Army in Person, and alone without a Competitor that might dispute
with him the Honour of a Victory, that, by his Prudent disposition of
Affairs, was as good as certain to him.</hi> Which the King solemnly
promis'd him he would: but afterwards, according to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
giving too much ear to the Counsels of others, and not
enough relying upon his own wisdom, he alter'd that resolution,
and dividing his Army into two, gave the better part to the Duke
of <hi>Guise;</hi> and so depriv'd himself of the whole glory of that Action,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63412:40"/>
to bestow it upon another. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> expert, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
as any Prince of his time, had those Forces no sooner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his charge, but that he immediately march'd them away
to the Frontiers of <hi>Champagne,</hi> to observe the Enemies motion,
and to oblige them by his lying so near to march close together;
which, considering the spoil that had before been made of the
Country, was as great an inconvenience as they could suffer. The
Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> had also an Employment against the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> to hold him in play in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and to hinder him from
joyning with the Foreign Army, that came to his assistance. But
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was reserv'd by his Majesty to attend upon
his own person; as one in whom he repos'd an entire confidence,
and as a man whose sole and utmost aim, the King evidently
saw, was equally directed to his Majesties Honour, and to the
Kingdoms safety: To him the King gave the command of the
Vantguard of his own Army; in which Employment he so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
himself, both with his Valour, his Advice, and his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that the very Historians of that time,<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the greater part of men are, of the greatness of Favourites, could
not forbear notwithstanding to attribute to him a very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
share in the success of that memorable Defeat.</p>
                  <p>And here give me leave without being blam'd for a digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from my Subject,<note place="margin">Anno 1587.</note> and that upon the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s
word, a man better read than any whosoever in the business of
that time, to oppose his Testimony against a Scandal <hi>D'Avila</hi>
has publish'd; not only to the discredit of the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi>
his Favour: but also to the infinite prejudice of his Honour. He
says that the King, at the Duke's dismission to go to the Army his
Majesty had given him in command, gave him this reproach.
<hi>Che la Corte lo teneua in concetto di poltrone, é chegli era bene di levarsi
questo fregio dal viso:</hi> which is to say, <hi>That the Court look'd upon
him as a Poltron, and that he should do well to wipe off that blemish.</hi>
Towards the Dukes latter end, I read this History to him, which
was then newly publish'd in <hi>France;</hi> and the Duke had very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commended the Author, though in many particulars he had not
spoken very favourably of him: above all he infinitely commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the exact care he had taken to inform himself of the secret
motives, by which the several interests of that time were carried
on; of which he does in truth for the most part render a very
precise, and very often, a very true accompt: But when he
heard these words, which were so highly injurious to the Duke
of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> he could not forbear crying out, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> hat D'Avila was a
lyar, that he himself was present when the Duke of</hi> Joyeuse <hi>took his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63412:41"/>
leave of the King; that his Majesty could never have had so great a
kindness for a man of whom he had once entertain'd so mean an opinion;
that on the contrary be esteem'd him to be as valiant, and as brave a
Gentleman, as any was in his Kingdom:</hi> And where <hi>D'Avila</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
to say that he was become burthensome to the King, that
the King could no longer bear it; and that he therefore sent him
upon this expedition purposely to be cut off: the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>
bore witness, <hi>That he saw the King weep at the Duke of</hi> Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euse
<hi>his departure, than which there could not be a greater evidence of
his tenderness and affection to him. That had the King had a mind to
have been rid of him, and to have expos'd him to the King of</hi> Navarre's
<hi>Forces, he would never have set him out with an Army, almost twice as
strong, as that he was employ'd against, and made up of as good Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as any were in the Kingdom: so that if he lost the Battel of</hi> Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras,
<hi>it was rather through the chance of War, or through the Valour,
and good fortune of the King of</hi> Navarre, <hi>than by any default of his
Army.</hi> And to answer yet further to what has been writ concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Favour, of which <hi>D'Aubigné</hi> only speaks by hear-say, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
stories, as it is his custom at the random of his own passion,
and fancy: The Duke has told me that the King was indeed
grown colder towards the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> than he had formerly
observ'd him: but that he only attributed that to the Alliance the
Duke had contracted with the House of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and that it was
only a diminution of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avour, and never grew to a disgrace; and
indeed, had his Majesty conceiv'd a positive aversion to him,
would he have given such publick evidences of sorrow for his
Death as he did? would he have honour'd his dead Body with
that excessive Pomp, and those unusual Obsequies? which were
such as gave all the Nobility occasion to murmur, having never
before been allow'd to any, save to the Princes of the Blood, and
to the Constables of <hi>France,</hi> exclusively to all other great men of
the Kingdom. The Historians of that time have further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
of the jealousie betwixt the two Favourites: to which I
can answer on the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s behalf, that I could never
find by any thing I could ever gather from him, that he had been
in the least touch'd with that passion; neither is it very likely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the advantage the Duke visibly had in the Kings Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there could be any jealousie on his part; but if there had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been any such thing betwixt them (as it is hardly possible
but there must have been some emulation betwixt two concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in so high a pretense as that of a Kings Favour) the Death of
the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> and a long series of time having worn out
those impressions, there now remain'd nothing more in the Duke
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63412:41"/>
of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s memory, than the remembrance of their near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and former Friendship.</p>
                  <p>Some time before the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> his Death, the knot of
that Alliance had been broken by the death of <hi>Catherine de Noga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi>
and <hi>dela Valett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Favourites been married to the <hi>Count de Bouchage,</hi> younger
Brother to the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse;</hi> after they had for four or five

throughout the prosperities, and afflictions that have divided her
life. The <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the world either to allure him, or to comfort him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr'd
himself from it amongst the Father Capuchins; where he
took upon him the Habit of that Order, and there continued
some years, under the name of Father <hi>Ange de Ioyeuse.</hi> 'Tis true,
the Pope having since enjoyn'd his Superiours to perswade him
abroad again, to the end he might be Head of the League in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi>

opinion of Sanctity.</p>
                  <p>And since, upon occasion, I have been drawn aside to mention

made, and the assault ready to be given, he intreated the
Honour of the first Assault might be conferr'd upon his men,
who he desir'd might give immediate proof of their Valour. A
fatal request, which having been granted to him, his men went
on with very great courage to the assault; where, being as reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
receiv'd, they were at last beaten back: but the <hi>Compte de
Candalle,</hi> not being able to endure such a repulse, return'd to the
Assault, and putting himself in his Doublet only at the head of
his men, he repell'd the Enemy, and won the top of the Breach;
when being now upon the point to carry the Town, an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Musquet shot in his Throat laid him dead upon the place.
An accident, by which the Town, already as good as taken, was

one of the most excellent Men, not only of his own time, but

he were immeasurably addicted to it, hinder his due care of his
Niece, either as to the Education of her Person, or as to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement

young, to the <hi>Connestable de Montmorency</hi> her Aunt, a Lady of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Vertue, who had earnestly desir'd it, that she might bring
her up, as one of her own Daughters; which she accordingly
did: and under her excellent Tuition this young Lady grew up
to so great a perfection in all vertuous Qualities, that she won the
general Applause, and was admir'd above all others of her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the Kingdom. To these eminent endowments of Mind
she had yet the advantage of her Birth, and the reputation of her
Fortune: For the first I shall need to say no more, than that she

of the most eminent Leaders of their time. Their Estates had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
been very great, and there yet remain'd in fair demeasnes to the
value of above fourscore thousand Livers annual Rent; though
to say truth, the Affairs of that Family had of late years been so
ill managed, that there now remain'd but a very small part of
that vast Revenue clear, and unincumbred with Debts. Her
Estate therefore requir'd both a discreet manager to husband it,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63412:42"/>
and a man well furnish'd with money, to disengage it, and to
restore it to that Splendor, and Reputation, in which it had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been: And if the Person of this Lady I speak of, was not
endow'd with all those Criticisms of form the curious will have
concurre to the making up of a rare, and illustrious Beauty, she
had yet so much, and that set off with so graceful, and so winning a
Fashion, as oblig'd the Duke to become her Suitor; after which
it was not long before the King concluded the Marriage. The
Solemnity was held at <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> the 7th. day of <hi>August,</hi>
in the Year 1587. the King being then going against the Reiters,
who were already enter'd the Borders of <hi>France.</hi> It is not long
since I saw the Articles of that Contract, with the Inventories of

of the Countess <hi>de Ryberac,</hi> and a Gentleman sent for that
purpose on the behalf of the Bishop of <hi>Aire,</hi> and by his Letter of
Attorney authoriz'd to manage that business. For the Bishop,
what hopes soever they could give him of the obtaining of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
Hat, if he would come to Court, he could never be drawn
from his Books, nor tempted to leave his Study: and his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lying another way, that is, rather to search into the solid
Truth, than the vain Apparence of things, he found a greater
contentment of mind in his retirement, and solitude, than in
all the lustre and bustle of the Court. There were few Writers of
that time that do not make mention of the Dukes great Riches,
and of the Kings unlimited liberalities towards him; and yet
upon this occasion there was only found in Land,<note place="margin">The D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and other Furniture, to the value of thirteen hundred thousand
Crowns; which if a man consider the difference berwixt this
Fortune, and those of many others, that we have since known,
not only Favourites, but also men of very mean beginnings, that
have been rais'd to far greater Riches, in a much shorter time, than
the Duke was a Favourite, will appear no such prodigious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
His <hi>Hostel</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> was also part of this Estate, which I
have heard the Duke say, was then the best House next to the
Queen Mothers, now call'd <hi>l' Hostel de Soissons,</hi> and so little infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
even to that, that after the Queens death he might have had
it, advancing 10000. Crowns, in exchange for his own. I have
made this observation that we may consider to what a degree of
State, and Beauty the Structures of these latter times are got,
when this House, that was then the second in <hi>Paris,</hi> has now
scarce any name, amongst the many Structures that have been
erected since.</p>
                  <p>Men have since been very liberal in their censure of the Duke's
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63412:43"/>
Oeconomy, and which many unjust to his Honour, and not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
kind to him, have blemish'd with the name of Avarice: I
cannot deny but that the Oeconomy of his House was great, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I see why that should not have its due Honour amongst
his other Vertues; he being in this as much a Steward for the
publick, as for his own private Interests: for who does not know
that the Profusions of Princes, and the Prodigalities of Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
are ever to be repair'd by the Oppression of the People? He
was a good Husband 'tis true, but his good Husbandry, far from
the meanness of Avarice, serv'd only to maintain his greatness,
and to enable him the better to support the lustre of his Expense
without being chargeable to the King. It has ever been such, that
from his first rise to Favour, during the whole course of his life,
no man ever maintain'd a nobler Table at Court, a better Stable
of Horses, a more numerous train of Attendants, and those
men of Quality, and good Fashion, more stately Furniture, nor a
greater number of inferiour Servants than the Duke did. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
in Building infinitely exceeded all others of his condition,
and all this without the least abatement in his ordinary way of
living, without any visible incommodity in his Affairs, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever importuning the King his Master; which can only be
attributed to his Oeconomy, and the prudent government of his
Affairs, many other great Persons, of far greater Estates than he,
having never been able to do such things, as he did with great
ease, without apparent inconvenience, and great disorder.</p>
                  <p>The King, willing upon this occasion of the Dukes Marriage
to continue his Liberalities, made him then a gift of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Crowns: but the Duke had never other advantage
by it, than the bare testimony of his Masters good Inclinations
towards him: For the Treasury being either wholly exhausted, or
containing no more than was necessary to defray the immediate
War, the money could no ways have been rais'd, but by a new Tax
upon the People, which would have bred new Discontents; and
though his Majesty notwithstanding desir'd such an Imposition
might be laid; the Duke a truer Servant to his Masters Interests,
than a Friend to his own, would never consent, but obstinately
oppos'd it. The Papers are yet to be seen amongst those that
were found at his Death, for an eternal monument of this good
Masters Affection, and for a testimony of the small accompt the
Servant made of a Benefit, that must be exacted with the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the People, and that was likely to pull down a popular
<hi>Odium</hi> upon his Benefactor.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the preparations that were made for the Duke's
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63412:43"/>
Marriage, the King was still intent upon his business, not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any due care that might fit his Army to receive the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
who were now upon their March, under the command of
the <hi>Baron de Dona,</hi> and were already advanc'd to the Frontiers of
<hi>Lorain.</hi>

                     </note> There it was that the Germans first began to be sensible
of those inconveniences his Majesties prudent Conduct had
strew'd in their way, which still as they advanc'd further
into <hi>France,</hi> where they promis'd to themselves a great abundance
of all things (upon the false hopes wherewith their Leaders were
prepossest, that the whole Court favour'd the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
and that they had only the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to wrestle with) they
found more, and more to encrease upon them, all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
out of their way that should any ways contribute to the
support of so great a Body. And then it was that they plainly
saw the vanity of those aiery promises that had been made them;
they found themselves in a few days opprest with hunger, thirst,
and sickness, their Arms with rust dismounted, and useless, their
Horses unshod, and themselves expos'd to all the other miseries,
with which great Armies in long Marches, and in an Enemies
Countrey are usually afflicted: By which misfortunes their eyes
being opened, they began to fear, and to foresee those, that in a
short time fell upon them: but amongst all those difficulties,
that which troubled them the most, was their encounter with
the Duke of <hi>Espernon;</hi> who, whilst they were trying to find a
pass over the River <hi>Loire,</hi> having continually coasted them, and
attended their motion with eight hundred light Horse, and five
hundred Harquebusses on Horseback, and having by his activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">The Duke Beats up a Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and vigilancy found an opportunity to beat up a Quarter of

the contrary, were now undeceiv'd: and the more clearly they
were convinc'd of their error, the more did their fears encrease;
which begetting at first private mutterings, and growing on to
publick murmurs, proceeded at last to an open Mutiny.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, well enform'd of this disorder in the Enemies
Camp, began with great dexterity to manage their discontents to
the King's advantage; he treated therefore for an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both with the Reiters, and the Swisse: the latter of which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63412:44"/>
made up a considerable part of that Army, all their Infantry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
being rais'd out of the <hi>Swisse Cantons;</hi> pressing nevertheless
with his flying Army the Rear of the one, or the other; at the
same time that he disturb'd their March, and their Quarters with
his Armies entertaining them with overtures of Agreement, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them at once in fear of the King's Force, and in hopes of his
clemency: by which different ways of proceeding to one and the
same end, the two Nations, equally perplex'd, at last hearkned to
an Accommodation: which notwithstanding was concluded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the <hi>Swisse</hi> at that time, and with them the Articles were
agreed upon, and Sign'd under the King's good Pleasure, the 18.
of <hi>November</hi> 1587. Which being afterwards ratified by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
they immediately retir'd into their Confines.</p>
                  <p>This great body thus separated from the Reiters, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army was in such perplexity, that there was now nothing,
but disorder, and confusion amongst them; so that their courages
being abated, by the extreme necessities they suffer'd by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abandoned by their Confederates, who made up the best part
of their Army, and by the fear of worse michiefs to come, they
now thought of nothing more, than of retiring from the extreme
danger they saw themselves envellop'd in: and then it was that
they hearkened in good earnest to the Propositions which were
then offer'd to them afresh by the Duke, though much harder
than the former; neither could all the Intreaties, or Authority of
their Leaders, as well French, as those of their own Nation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
any thing, or disswade them from concluding a composition,
and from retiring at last into their own Country.<note place="margin">The Reiters come to Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</note> The Articles
with them were Sign'd the eighth day of <hi>December,</hi> in the same
year by the same Duke: by which it appears, that his courage, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy,
and Wisdom contributed not a little to the diversion of
this dangerous storm, and to the preservation of the Kingdom
from so powerful an invasion, as that of an Army consisting of
forty thousand fighting men. Yet is it not to be denyed but that
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> did also very brave service in this occasion; he
defeated great numbers of them both at <hi>Vilmory,</hi> and at <hi>Aulneau:</hi>
but in the condition they then were, ruin'd, and disarm'd by the
King's forecast, beaten, and Disunited by the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s
Skirmishing, and Practices, it infinitely much facilitated the Duke
of <hi>Guise</hi> his Victories, to have an Enemy reduc'd to such streights
before he came to engage them.</p>
                  <p>But if the War was carried on with good success to the King in
the forementioned engagements, things succeeded much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
on his Majesties part with the King of <hi>Navarre:</hi> for the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63412:44"/>
Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> having precipitated the Battel of <hi>Coutras,</hi> the
advantage of his Forces having blinded him even to a Contempt
of the Enemy (an ordinary presage of Ruine to whoever is too
secure of his Fortune) he there lost the Battel,<note place="margin">The loss of the Battel of <hi>Coutras.</hi>
                     </note> with his Life, the

a number of Nobility, and Gentry, as have almost fallen in

                  </p>
                  <p>Some have believ'd that the King was neither so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
at the loss of this Battel, nor conceiv'd himself so much
prejudic'd by it, as he imagin'd himself eclips'd by the Victory
he soon after obtain'd over the Strangers; a deplorable effect of
this Princes misfortune, who could neither be afflicted with his
losses, nor yet absolutely satisfied with his success. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told you the Reasons the King had not to desire the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Ruine; so that he enjoyed in part his own de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the loss of this Battel, which made for the support of the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and his Party; by whose assistance he thought with
less difficulty to mate the ambitious Designs of the League: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Victory obtain'd over the Reiters, only serv'd to augment
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s Glory, who was his real, and capital Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Hence therefore proceeded his disquiet, and affliction; and
this was it that turn'd even the prosperous successes of his Arms
to his vexation, and trouble.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty fearing left the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> puft up with the
vanity of the popular esteem, and the opinion of his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
should take upon him the assurance to ask some of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which were vacant by the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> his Decease, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd

                     <hi>Angoumois,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Aulnis,</hi> having there
receiv'd a mortal Wound, and dying soon after, the Duke had
also the Governments vacant by his decease conferr'd upon him:
which, as we shall hereafter see, at his departure from Court af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
him the benefit of a secure, and honourable Retreat.</p>
                  <p>Although the Victories obtain'd from the <hi>German</hi> Army were
very great, and of great moment; yet were not the Designs of
the Enemy utterly ruin'd by the Defeat, and Dissipation of those
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63412:45"/>
Forces beyond the <hi>Loire.</hi> For the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party, who were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
solicitous to adde all the vigour and encouragement they
possibly could to their cause, were principally careful to re-inforce
<hi>Mounsieur Lesdiguieres,</hi> who was effectually a very brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,

drive him out of that Province, a Force, like enough to cut out a

him an opportunity, wherein to share with the Duke his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

by the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and by <hi>la Valette</hi> his Brother, for the
publick safety; who would have imagin'd but that his Majesty
should have been welcom'd home with a thousand blessings of
his people, and that so good Subjects should have received the
praises due to their Fidelity, and Valour? Nevertheless all these
Victories, with the care, industry, and hazards that produc'd
them, wrought a quite contrary effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through the blind affection
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63412:45"/>
the giddy multitude had violently plac'd upon the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi>
There was now no other discourse at <hi>Paris</hi> but of him; the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
Courts, and Publick Assemblies rung with his Name: it is
to him only that they owe their Lives, and Liberties, and 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his presence they desire. The King's own Person, and those of
his most faithful Servants, are become odious to the <hi>Parisians.</hi>
They talk high of transferring the Regal Dignity to the Duke of
<hi>Guise.</hi> They scatter up and down Printed Libels, wherein from
railing against the King, proceeding on to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
they would have him declar'd incapable of succession to the
Crown, to the end there might remain no title to dispute the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s Possession. Nay to such a contempt of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Royal Dignity they were grown at last, that these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
were frequent, and loud in the Kings own Family; his
most oblig'd Servants not daring almost to reply; renouncing
by that poor and unmanly toleration, their own interest, whilst
they abandoned that of their Sovereign and Benefactor. Neither
was there any, save only the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> a man that slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his own danger, and despis'd the malice of all mankind,
when his Masters Honour lay in the Ballance, who generously
expos'd himself upon all occasions, to the publick violence, that
he might preserve the integrity of his Duty. Of which to give
you an instance, it hapned one day, in a great deal of company,
that the Archbishop of <hi>Lions,</hi> a Prelate of a ready Wit, and
great Elocution, but passionately zealous for the League, openly
maintain'd, <hi>That the Pope had Power to absolve Subjects from their
Allegiance to their lawful Prince:</hi> To which the Duke highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
as he had reason to be at so dangerous an Argument,
made answer before them all, <hi>That it would be as hard to perswade
him to that, as to make him believe that the Pope could grant a Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a Prelate to lie with his own Sister:</hi> Now you must know it
was generally believ'd at Court, that this Prelate was too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
with a person related to him in that degree; and as injuries
make the deeper impression, by how much nearer they approach
to truth: this so touch'd him to the quick, that he from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
conceiv'd against the Duke a mortal, and implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.
Neither was he long in finding out a way openly to express
it; for his Arms being his Tongue, and his Pen (reputed one of
the most eloquent of his time) he employ'd them both with all
the rancour imaginable, to blemish the Duke's Honour; he set
upon him with a thousand injurious Writings; nor did he fail,
for so much as in him lay, to stir up a popular Fury against his
Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:63412:46"/>
Neither did the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> labour his overthrow with less
vehemency on his part, than the Bishop did on his: and as he
knew the Duke's Interest to be very great, and his spirit inflexible,
and hardly to be reconcil'd; so was he not content to endeavour
his ruine obliquely, and underhand, but openly declar'd himself
the Author of what he did, the better to effect his desire. And see
the means he persu'd to work his purpose.</p>
                  <p>After the Reiters were driven out of the Kingdom, the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> accompanied with the principal Heads of his Party, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to <hi>Nancy;</hi> where seeing the great Forces he had about him,
and promising to himself wonders from the precipitous affection
of the People, he resolv'd to prepare some Articles, which should
be presented to the King in the Name of the League: Wherein,
as he conceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d himself in a condition to carry by a high hand,
whatsoever he should propose, he principally insisted upon the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s removal from Court; pretending him to be
a great abettor of the Hereticks, the better to colour the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he intended against him: interpreting after this sort the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
the Duke had for the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and for all the
Royal Family, though grounded upon principles far distant from
being any ways interested in that Princes Religion, as his actions
ever had, and then did most clearly demonstrate.</p>
                  <p>But as it was very unlikely that the King to satisfie his Enemies,
should consent to the disgrace of his beloved Favourite, the
Leaguers of <hi>Paris,</hi> to impose upon him a necessity of accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the desires of their Party, conspir'd thenceforward to seize
upon the person of the King, that so they might remove all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
difficulties that might lie in the way of their Designs: neither
did they fail much of executing that accursed Resolution. The
Council of sixteen was at that time first set up in <hi>Paris;</hi> neither
is any ignorant what that Council was, how impudent their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and how great their Authority with the People, even in
the very face of the King himself. In this Council it was one day
agreed upon to seize upon the King as he came from hunting from
the <hi>Bois de Vencennes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">D' Avila.</note> and it had accordingly been executed, had
not the King (advertiz'd of their purpose) doubled his Guards at
his return. That Plot therefore failing,<note place="margin">A Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the sixteen upon the Kings Person.</note> there were divers other
Ambuscado's laid for him during the Carnival, that often put
him in great danger of being made a Prisoner to his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
which being all happily evaded, by the timely informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one <hi>Nicholas Poulin,</hi> a Lieutenant in the Provosty of the
Isle of <hi>France,</hi> who was privy to all these Cabals: Many of the
Court, (who (as it is believ'd) favour'd the Designs of the League)
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63412:46"/>
endeavour'd to render <hi>Poulin</hi>'s Intelligence suspected, that the
King discrediting his report, might at one time or another fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Enemies snare: But the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> in an occasion
of this consequence, making no difficulty of hazarding his own
life, to search out the depth of these practices, franckly expos'd
himself to infinite danger, that so he might discover the certainty
of so necessary, and so important a truth. Being therefore adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
by the same <hi>Poulin,</hi> that the sixteen had concluded an Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
upon him himself at the Fair of St. <hi>Germains,</hi> whither the
Duke usually repair'd to divert himself,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Du journal de</hi> Henry III.</note> with the entertainments
of the season; he resolv'd to run the hazard, and accordingly
went. The Plot was to have been executed by the Scholars, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whose name the Inhabitants of the Suburbs of St. <hi>Germains</hi>
were order'd to slip in to fortifie the attempt; all which being
discover'd to the Duke, it was certainly a dangerous, and almost
desperate adventure, he thrust himself into; and which must
proceed from an unparallel'd affection, and a vertuous care he had
of his Princes safety, to run so great a hazard in so critical a time,
when even the Court it self was corrupted in the Conspirators
favour. And the Duke might excusably enough have forborn
going to a place where the danger was immediately directed
against his own person, and might have made the experiment, and
have penetrated into the bottom of this Conspiracy, by another,
without endangering his own life: and doubtless he had done so,
had he had only his own Interest to consider in the case; but then
things would afterwards have been left doubtful, and the King's
life had been still expos'd in the uncertainty of the truth of those
cautions had been given him; which the Duke resolv'd by all
wayes imaginable to put out of future danger. He went therefore
to the place where he knew himself to be threatned with death;
but that could not affright him, provided he might secure the life
of his Master; and being thither come, found the intelligence
had been given him, to be punctually true: neither did they fail
much of effecting their design; for a sort of young people being
gather'd about him, began to murmur, and from murmuring
grew lowder into clamours, making shew at last, as if they would
proceed to execute what they threatned: whereat the Duke not
frighted with their noise, put himself into a posture to resist the
violence intended against him; by which resolute carriage, having
with as much courage, as good fortune, disingag'd himself, he lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely
retyr'd towards the <hi>Louvre,</hi> not a man daring to attempt
any thing upon him, as if even his Enemies had been struck with
a kind of reverence due to so brave, and so honourable an Action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:63412:47"/>After there was no further doubt to be made, but that <hi>Poulin</hi>'s
intelligence was true; and by how much the King's danger still
encreas'd, by so much the greater was the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
zeal, and ardour for the security of his Majesties Person: so
that there passed not a night, wherein sometimes with two, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with three, or four Companies of the Regiment of Guards,
he walk'd not the Round into the most seditious Quarters of the
City: and if at any time he had notice of any extraordinary As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
thither it was that he immediately repair'd with a stronger
Party; nor did he ever go to rest, till he had first settled all things
quiet, and had carefully provided for his Masters safety. So that
it is not to be believ'd how many of the Enemies Conspiracies
against the King's Person, were countermin'd, and frustrated, by
his vigilancy and diligence. The sixteen seeing their Designs thus
travers'd, and fearing to be prevented (for they now no longer
doubted but that their Treasons were discover'd) dispatch'd away
in all haste to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> pressing him by all means, to
make what speed he could to <hi>Paris;</hi> hoping by his arrival in the
first place to be sheltred from the King's Justice, and in the next
to reap the fruits of their inordinate desires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither was the Duke
long deliberating upon this Journey; the time as he conceiv'd,
being as favourable, as he could possibly wish, for him to raise his
Fortune to that prodigious height, to which his ambition had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
design'd it: For the danger of the Foreign Army being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
blown over, and the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> so depress'd since,
that it was almost impossible for him ever to rise again, he thought
he could never meet with so happy an occasion, and consequently
prepar'd himself without further delay for his Journey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of which
resolution the King being advertis'd, and knowing that he was
now on his way, and already advanc'd as far as <hi>Soissons,</hi> he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
away the <hi>Sieur de Bellieure</hi> to meet him, and to forbid him
from coming to <hi>Paris;</hi> a command that added spurs to his desire,
which usually in great spirits grows most violent, where it meets
with most difficulty, and is most eager when most forbidden.
But by this message the Duke presently imagining that his Designs
were discover'd, and doubting that if he did longer defer to drive
them on to their intended end, he was in danger to be prevented,
and to see himself involv'd in the disaster, that commonly attends
men who deliberate too long upon the execution of great Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
he made all the haste he possibly could; and turning aside
from the ordinary Road, for fear of meeting another command,
which notwithstanding (his Ambition still presenting to him the
image of that greatness to which he aspir'd) he was resolute not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63412:47"/>
to obey; he came at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

surprizing all men with his sudden and unexpected arrival.</p>
                  <p>At this time (which made still better for the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>)
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was gone to take possession of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Normandy:</hi> where he had been receiv'd with great accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the people both at <hi>Rouen, Caen,</hi> and the other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Cities of that Province; so that all places there continued

                  <p>But before the Duke's departure into <hi>Normandy,</hi> the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                        </gap>resne,</hi> his Majesty there in a private Conference discover'd to
him the trouble, and disquiet the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s Resolution of
coming to <hi>Paris</hi> had put him into, with the danger, to which
his arrival (the absolute power the Duke had with the People
duly consider'd) would expose both his Person, and Affairs; and
there his mind equally possest with foresight, and jealousie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him penetrate into the events of things, as if they had been
present before him, he prophesied to the Duke almost all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
that befel him in a few days after. Whereupon the Duke
freely told him that he saw only one way to avoid those mischiefs
his Majesty foresaw, and that was to cause the Duke's Head to
be strook off, even in the <hi>Louvre</hi> it self, should he be so impudent
as to come to <hi>Paris</hi> contrary to his Majesties express command;
an advice which he fortified with so many reasons, that the King
bound himself with an Oath to do it; though when it came to
the test, his resolution appear'd no more constant in this than it
had done before in other occasions, as we shall presently see.</p>
                  <p>But if things were thus determin'd on the King's part, the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was no less diligent on his, and had omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might any way conduce to the effecting of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs:
and that he might not, at his coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> lie at the
mercy of his Enemies, he had secretly, and by several ways sent
thither divers of his best Commanders beforehand, with order to
prepare all those of his Faction in readiness to appear in Arms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the first occasion: and having thus provided for his safety,
came himself to the City the ninth of <hi>May,</hi> in the year 1588. and

the Queen Mothers Lodgings; who though infinitely surpriz'd
at his coming, went immediately along with him to the King: by
whom he was receiv'd (notwithstanding that his Majesty had
been before disswaded from his first resolution) with so great a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
in his countenance, as plainly denoted the contrary passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63412:48"/>
that were then strugling in his mind. Which the Queen
Mother perceiving, and knowing what a determination the King
had put on against him; the execution of which she perhaps
thought neither safe, nor easie; or perhaps willing to preserve the
Duke, she took the King aside, and wrought so effectually with
him, that she absolutely chang'd his mind (which was then wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
and irresolute) from his premeditated purpose. Yet could
she not so qualifie and appease him, but that he gave the Duke
of <hi>Guise</hi> very manifest tokens of the highest Indignation: but
after a few words, and those exceedingly bitter on the Kings part,
the Duke retyr'd to his own house, where he more than ever
continued his ambitious Designs, and seditio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his vast Courage, the excess of which had rais'd him above the
condition, and debauch'd him from the obedience of a Subject,
would (as it is believ'd) now perfect the work had been so long
before contriv'd, and strike home to the main Design. All which
though the King very well knew, and though he endeavour'd all
he could to prevent him, and to deprive him of those means by
which he was most likely to effect his purpose; yet those his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
employ'd, proving too weak to divert so great a mischief by
their vain oppositions, only made the Torrent to swell higher,
which soon after overflow'd the Banks with greater violence.</p>
                  <p>All the world has heard of the <hi>Barricades</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades.</hi>

which, to write the particulars, were to deviate impertinently
from my Subject: It shall therefore be sufficient to say, that the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was not at <hi>Paris,</hi> when this disorder fell; but
they there found his richest furniture, upon which the hatred, and
avarice of the people wreak'd their utmost spleen, and extremest
rancour.</p>
                  <p>This storm of popular fury having continued the space of three
days without intermission, or abatement; and the King, after the
disarming of his Guards, and some other Forces he had then in
<hi>Paris,</hi> having now no means left to defend his Person, which he
saw in danger every moment to fall into his Enemies hands; the
multitude preparing on every side to beset the <hi>Louvre,</hi> he made a

having above five hundred Gentlemen in his Train.</p>
                  <p>They who have undertaken the History of that time, variously
report the Duke's Reception at this place: <hi>D' Avila</hi> says his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
was very cold, and that the King looking upon him as
his Enemies Pretense, for all the mischiefs they did, began to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste
him; yet he says soon after with a kind of contradiction,
that his Majesty never went less in his affection to him, nor in
the confidence he repos'd in him, from the first beginning of his
Favour.<note place="margin">Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Historians about the Duke's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception at Court.</note> Others write that he was receiv'd with great demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Favour and Esteem: of which both the one and the other
say true; observing the due order of that little space betwixt the
Dukes Entertainment at his first arrival, and that he receiv'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had been two hours in private Conference with the King.</p>
                  <p>It is most certain that this Prince afflicted with his Misfortunes,
and reduc'd more than ever to the necessity of dissimulation, did
not at first receive him with that excess of kindness he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
done; and it is likewise true, that apprehending at first
sight some just reproach from the Duke's passionate affection to
his Service, for that his Majesty had not put in execution what he
had resolv'd upon at <hi>Fresne,</hi> his Majesty put on an unusual gravity
at his arrival: But after he had talked with him, and that the Duke
who was too discreet, at such a time, to offer the least syllable that
might afflict his Master, had on the contrary rais'd his Spirits with
new hopes, he then opened his Bosom to him more than ever; and
having receiv'd his wonted good Counsels, entertain'd again the
joy, and vigour, which seem'd to have been stifled in his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and began to meditate the means, and that with good hopes
of success, of restoring his Affairs to their former Condition. And
then it was that he caress'd the Duke with his accustomed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
honouring him in publick with as high demonstrations of
Favour, as ever. It was at this Conference, that the Duke gave his
Majesty an accompt of his Voyage, of the good condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he had left his Government, and what his Majesty might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from thence: How all things were so well dispos'd there,
that excepting <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> the League possess'd nothing in

given very good hopes of returning shortly to his Duty: That

that he presently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>esolv'd upon a Journey into that Province; it
seeming to him neither decent, nor suiting with his Honour to
continue at <hi>Chartres;</hi> where to make a longer stay, would look,
as if he were there shut up, and forbidden all the other parts of his
Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Neither was it without design, that the Duke spoke so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously
to the King of the Forces of <hi>Normandy:</hi> And he could
have wisht his Majesty had conceiv'd the same opinion of all his
other Provinces; to the end that growing confident of his own
Power, he might entertain the thoughts of Arms: For he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believ'd, that should his Majesty once undertake a War in good
earnest, it would succeed infinitely to his advantage; that he
would soon be in a condition to re-establish his neglected Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and to make himself fear'd of all his Subjects. But the King
had already form'd other Designs, and the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him so strongly supported, that he could not depress him by
open force, without endangering at once himself, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
he thought it safer, though less honourable, to lull him
asleep with the hopes of Peace, than by open War to provoke
his already approved Power.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> also seeing the King escap'd out of his
hands, and that he could no more impose upon him those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
he had propos'd to the Queen Mother during the <hi>Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades,</hi>
was likewise not averse to an Accommodation. So that
both Parties concurring in the same disposition, the business was
quickly set on foot by the Queen Mother; who as she had been
of the first, was now the Mediatrix of this Peace also. She had
continued at <hi>Paris</hi> after the King's departure, and had not fail'd
upon all occasions to possess the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> that the King
was willing to be reconcil'd to him, and to forgive the <hi>Parisians</hi>
upon their due Submission. Whereupon the Duke, the better to
sound the King's intention herein, order'd the Parliament to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his Majesty at <hi>Chartres,</hi> and there to offer him the first excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for a fault which in its own nature admitted none: But the
Provost <hi>des Marchands</hi> going before, and the <hi>Eschevins</hi> following
after, both the one, and the other return'd with great satisfaction:
Which the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> seeing, and interpreting this flexibility
in the King to an effect of Fear, he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>assum'd his former hopes,
and again set on foot the same propositions, which he had before
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63412:49"/>
so arrogantly insisted upon; to wit, that War should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
against the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that there should be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of the <hi>States General,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>
should be banish'd from Court, with a privation of all his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
Upon which last Article he chiefly insisted, openly declaring,
that there could be no durable Peace, nor no sincere reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so long as he had so great an Enemy as the Duke in the Kings
Bosom.</p>
                  <p>The Queen Mother, as has been said before, had long been jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Power, with the King her Son;
neither indeed could she well brook any Favourites, but those
who stood immediately oblig'd to her for their Fortune; an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
had made her so much the more impatient of the Duke's
greatness, because it was an advantage for which he was indebted
to none, but to his Masters bounty. She had often therefore prest
the King for his removal, as the only means to satisfie the League,
had propounded several honourable Employments to colour his
disgrace, and not long before would have had him sent Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
to <hi>Rome</hi> to justifie the King from the aspersions, the League
had cast upon him to the Holy Sea: but his Majesty who was as
perfect in the Nature, and Designs of the Queen his Mother, as
she was in his, had still been constant to his Servants Protection;
and the Duke, having been bred up in the School of so politick a
Master, had learn'd so much cunning, as had hitherto ever ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
all those Artifices ineffectual, by which she had so often, and
so industriously labour'd his Ruine.</p>
                  <p>But at last the Queen (knowing how important the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
was to the Kings Repose) embrac'd it with that fervour,
that in the end it procur'd the Dukes so long wish'd for removal.
She had the management of the Treaty in hand absolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to her, with the choice of any two of the King's Council
to assist her; of which, such as she knew were affectionate to the
Duke, you may be sure msut have nothing to do in this business;
so that it was no hard matter, all parties concurring in the same
design to conclude his disgrace: and in conclusion, the King was
plainly told, that it was absolutely necessary for him to dismiss
the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> if his Majesty intended to have that Peace,
he seem'd so passionately to desire.</p>
                  <p>To the same end there was then Printed a <hi>Manifest,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The League Print a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and his Brother.</note> subscrib'd

whole Faction were very importunate for the Duke's total Ruine,
together with <hi>Mounsieur de la Valette</hi> his Brother; his bare remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
from Court being now too little to satisfie their Malice: the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63412:50"/>
League in this sole point comprehending the suppression of the
<hi>Hugonot</hi> Party (of which they said the two Brothers were the
Protectors with the King) the redress of the people (opprest to
enrich them) and the satisfaction of the great ones; who might
easily be contented with those Offices, and Governments, which
the two Brothers now possest to their common prejudice.</p>
                  <p>The Duke who very well foresaw that he must either comply
with the time, or reduce the King to a necessity of taking up
Arms to protect him (which would have made him responsible
to his Majesty for any sinister event that might happen) chose the

own Fortune, than be any ways the occasion of so great a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
He saw the Kings mind perpetually fluctuating, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
alarm'd with the Counsels of his Enemies; which, in his
Majesties astonishment, grew still more, and more prevalent with
him; he saw the powerful Faction of the League wholly Arm'd
against his Person; neither was there any who did not conclude
his ruine inevitable in so dangerous a conjuncture, should he be
once, though but a moment, remov'd out of the King's Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
but he had courage enough to run the hazard, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
Spirit (notwithstanding he very well understood his
danger) made him resolute with his own single Interest to stand
the shock of all his Adversaries. I ought here to adde yet another
Motive the Duke had to retire from Court, a thing which will
perhaps hardly be believ'd, though it be precisely true: but it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
a due place in the Duke's History, as the noblest testimony of
a generous heart, and this it was. The Duke had understood
something of the King's intention to cut off the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
by those ways by which it was afterwards effected at <hi>Blois;</hi> and
not being able to divert that resolution, he chose rather to absent
himself, than to be present at an action he thought so unworthy
of his Masters Authority, and Greatness, though it redounded to
his own particular preservation. 'Tis true, that in the first moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the League, he had advis'd the King to take up Arms, to
chastise him; that he had afterwards counsell'd him to cut off his
Head at the very Gate of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> when the Duke came in
contempt of his command to raise that Commotion in <hi>Paris;</hi>
and that he had offer'd himself to fight him hand to hand in Duel;
but he could by no means consent that his Majesty should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
an Act so unworthy of his Name: And this in truth was as
powerful a Motive as any, to oblige him to retire.</p>
                  <p>There is great diversity of Opinions amongst the Historians of
that time about this retirement of the Dukes, whether, or no, it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63412:50"/>
were franckly; and of his own motion; whether he were dismist
with the King's good Opinion, and Favour; or whether he went
not away in a real disgrace; which they severally report,<note place="margin">Several opinions upon the Dukes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement.</note> every
man according to his particular passion: But <hi>D' Avila</hi> much better
inform'd in the Affairs of the Cabinet, than the rest, enclines to
the more favourable opinion, and says (very truly) that the Duke
resolv'd upon this retirement of his own voluntary inclination,
and that to the King's great grief; who notwithstanding, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
by the necessity of the conditions imposed upon him in the
Articles of Peace, consented to it: And of this truth there are two
evident proofs; One, the great familiarity, and privacy the Duke
had with the King some days before his departure: and the same
<hi>D'Avila</hi> records, a very remarkable, and a very true passage upon
this occasion. That the night preceding this separation, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
<hi>del Bene,</hi> a great confident of the Duke's, and a man in great
esteem with the King, for his excellent parts, (of which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
made continual use in his Politicks, a study in which he was
strictly regular) was shut up alone with the King in his Cabinet
for many hours; not so much as the Grooms of his Majesties
Chamber permitted to come in all the while; by which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
and very rightly, that his Conference was in order to
some Instructions, which were to be convey'd by the Abbot (who
was to accompany him in his retirement) to the Duke, for his
future Conduct, during the time of his absence: And I have
heard the Duke say, that he never in all his life receiv'd so many
Testimonies of his Masters Affection, as he did at this time. His
Majesty being pleas'd not only to chalk him out what he would
have him do, and what he would have him avoid, during his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement;
but also adding a thousand Protestations, that he
would sooner abandon his Crown, than his protection; and that
he had not consented to his departure, but with a resolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
him speedily back to Court with greater Honour, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
upon him greater advantages, than he had ever yet done: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
at the same time the Abbot <hi>del Bene,</hi> not to stir from him,
to have a care of his Person, and to be assisting to him with his
Counsels, in whatever Accidents might happen, and in all the
difficulties, and dangers he well foresaw would by his Enemies be
prepar'd against him. The other proof, that the Duke was dismist
in a high state of Favour, was this, that his Majesty made him at
his departure, <hi>Generalissimo</hi> of his Armies in the Provinces of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,
Maine, Perche, Poictou, Xaintonge, Angoumois,</hi> and the Country of
<hi>Aulnis,</hi> with absolute Power to command: which certainly he
would never have done, had his disgrace been really true, and not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63412:51"/>
meerly dissembled to satisfie the insolent demands of the League,
and to comply with the necessity of the time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Things being thus dispos'd, the Duke went to take his leave of
the King, and to receive his Majesties final Commands; where,
his affection in so great an extremity, suggesting to him the honest
liberty, a passionate, and faithful Subject may justly take, he
freely told him,</hi> That it was not without an extraordinary violence
upon himself, that he came to beg leave of his Majesty, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into his Governments, where he hop'd nevertheless to do his Majesty
better service, than if he should continue about his Person. That to his
extreme grief he saw of late his Majesties safest Determinations, and the
Counsels of his most faithful Servants perverted by the Artifices of those
evil Ministers, who had usurp'd a greater share in his Royal Trust, and
Confidence, than was consistent with the prosperity of his Affairs. That
the Queen his Mother (however an excellent and prudent Princess) was
notwithstanding abus'd, as his Majesty himself was. That seeing no cure
for this evil, he had rather chosen to deprive himself of the Honour of
being near his Majesties Person, than to be an unprofitable Spectator of
those inconveniences into which his evil Counsellors were about to precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
his Affairs. That as to that hour no man could reproach him that any
of his Actions had been contrary to his Majesties Service; so he would
not for the future, by a toleration unworthy a good Subject, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Man, draw any jealousie upon his Intentions. That by an excess of
bounty, and oftentimes contrary to his own desire, his Majesty had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
him with so many Possessions, Honours, and Offices, that he had
nothing left to desire of Heaven, but Moderation in a Prosperity rais'd
so infinitely beyond his Hopes. That having receiv'd these benefits to no
other end, than to employ them in his Majesties Service, he should be
ready to surrender all upon command, if by his Spoils any advantage
might accrue to his Majesties Affairs. That for the sum of all Obligation,
and for a final Testimony of his Majesties good Inclinations towards him,
he had only two Requests to make: the first, That his Majesty would
never confer any of his Offices upon any of the League; and the other,
that so often as his Enemies should by their Malice seek to ruine him in
his Majesties Favour, he would please to recollect the infinite Obligations
he had laid upon him; which was the greatest pledge of Fidelity, a good
Servant, and an honest Man, as he pretended to be, could in his absence
possibly leave with so good a Master.</p>
                  <p>The King though already prepar'd for the Duke's departure,
yet touch'd with so sad a Farewel, could not refrain from Tears;
and his friendship producing the usual effects that all true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
ordinarily do in such occasions, made him forget the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he was bound to perform, and once more to reiterate all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63412:51"/>
sorts of perswasion to make him stay: In which importunities,
though some have believ'd there was more of dissimulation, than
real truth; yet it is certain, that his Majesty in this proceeded with
a most sincere affection, and that looking more narrowly into the
condition of his Affairs, and considering he was about to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Person into the hands of his Enemies, by whom he saw
himself already environed, he could have been content to have
retain'd a Servant of so approved Valour, and Fidelity about him.
But the Duke having so often try'd, and so often found it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to settle the King's mind to such resolutions as were most
proper to secure his Dignity with Honour, could never delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to look on, and see the continuation of those evils, for which
he could neither see, nor hope for any possible Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Remaining then firm in his resolution to depart, he made a
voluntary surrender of his Government of <hi>Normandy</hi> into the
King's hands, which was as soon transferr'd to the Duke of
<hi>Montpensier,</hi> a Prince of the House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> very affectionate
to the King's Service, and Father to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> likewise
Duke of <hi>Montpensier;</hi> the same, who in succession of time came
to be the Duke's Nephew by a Marriage with <hi>Catherine de Ioyeuse</hi>
his Neece, she, who (as we have said before) is now Dutchess of
<hi>Guise.</hi> And this, of all those Offices the Duke stood seiz'd of,
was the only resignation the King would consent to, whatever
<hi>D' Auila</hi> is pleas'd to say to the contrary. He says that the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
the Duke to make a surrender of all his Employments at
once, excepting his Government of <hi>Provence:</hi> but that the Duke,
<hi>Who was a man of exceeding great understanding, and bred up by the
King himself in all the Stratagems of State,</hi> rais'd so many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and made so many exceptions against the persons of all those
who were propos'd to succeed him, that suddenly departing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any thing was concluded, he dexterously disingag'd himself
from so nice, and so dangerous a Proposition. It is certain not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that the Duke was never press'd to lay down any of
his Offices: and if he did surrender his Government of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
it was not only a voluntary act, but founded upon mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
and great judgment, as a Province that was near neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to <hi>Paris,</hi> separated many Leagues from all the rest of his
Governments, and in which his Enemies had so great Interest,
that his Presence would be necessary to secure it; neither consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the strong Faction they had within, was it certain to be
secur'd. So that not being able amongst so many persecutions, as
he saw prepar'd against him, to maintain all his Charges at once,
he rather chose to part with that he was not likely to keep, at least
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63412:52"/>
without exposing all the rest, than to abandon the other strong
Holds, and Places in his Possession; which though (particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd)
they seem'd to promise less, than so important a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as that of <hi>Normandy;</hi> yet that by their vicinity to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
were more likely to be kept, and to be more serviceable to
him.</p>
                  <p>Thus then parted the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> from Court in <hi>Iune</hi>
1588. and retir'd himself to <hi>Loches,</hi> though far otherwise than in
the equipage of a declining Minister, or attended like a Favourite
laps'd into disgrace; but with a numerous train of above three
hundred Gentlemen, and those of so good Quality, as that he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
the most of them for the raising of such Forces, as he had
order from his Majesty speedily to set on foot. But that which
rendred him every where more considerable, than this outward
shew of greatness, was his brave, and unbated Courage, of which
he had given so many signal testimonies in his Prosperity, that
there was nothing left, but such a disgrace as this, to give it the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
test,<note place="margin">The D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>Lochis,</hi> he presently set himself to look into the state of those
Provinces newly committed to his charge; where by establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such order as he thought convenient, by the dispatch of his
Levies, and by disposing his men into the most important places,
he prepar'd himself betimes to encounter such Accidents, as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of the time was likely to produce.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the Duke's departure, the King went his Journey
into <hi>Normandy:</hi> where the greatest Obstacle, being now remov'd,
the Treaty of Peace went on without any further impediment,
and was presently after concluded; the King (who had already
determin'd how to dispose of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>) making no
great difficulty to grant him what he was resolv'd he should not
long enjoy.</p>
                  <p>The Peace concluded, the Edict of Union was publish'd, first
at <hi>Rouen,</hi> and then in all parts of the Kingdom; after which they
immediately fell to the raising of Arms, for the utter suppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and his Party. But above all things,
the King was careful to hasten the necessary Dispatches for the
Convocation of the <hi>States General</hi> at <hi>Blois,</hi> in the beginning of
<hi>October</hi> next ensuing, an Assembly equally desir'd by the King,
and the Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi> but to different ends: The Duke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
there by the joynt suffrages of the several Orders of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to see himself plac'd in that degree of height, to which his
great Spirit, and vast Ambition, had so long aspir'd; and the King
resolving there, and at that time to quench his restless and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63412:52"/>
Ambition in a torrent of his own Blood. Thus do we often
see the purposes of the greatest Politicians deluded, who, when
they think they have brought their Designs by the most infallible
Rules, and Maxims of Humane Prudence to an almost certain
Issue, find themselves deceiv'd, and usually meet with effects
quite contrary to their expectation; giving us to understand,
that we ought not to commit our actions to the blind conduct of
our own frail and erroneous foresight, but into the hands of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that governs all, and that brings all things to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate end.</p>
                  <p>The Edict of Union being sworn, the Duke of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

powerful with the KIng) had nothing now to hinder his
coming to Court; so that upon his Majesties return out of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
he immediately repair'd to him, and having found him
at <hi>Chartres,</hi> he there in person deliver'd the same Apologies, he
had not long before presented by the Mediation of others. All
which his Majesty received with a Dissimulation, that was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
natural to him; but that by a long Practice, and by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
traverses, and difficulties of his Reign, was grown to such a
habit in him, that it was no hard matter for him to put on any
kind of Language, or Behaviour, on any occasion wherein he
was most likely to be surpriz'd: So that in outward shew the
King was so well pleas'd with no Company (as indeed it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all he had) as with the Duke's, his Relations, and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.
Amongst which the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who was now
also come to Court, was entertain'd with extraordinary marks
of Favour, and Respect; neither was there any Commands, or
Offices, Military or Civil, granted to any, but by their recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
insomuch that some have thought the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
by winning, and submissive carriage, had made some real impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
upon the Kings Inclinations, and that his Majesty was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
really to love him, as he had formerly done, if he could
have moderated his Ambition, and would have laid aside those
designs which rendred him suspected to him.</p>
                  <p>In a conjuncture so favourable to their Designs, neither the
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> nor those of his Faction slept in their Business;
but with all possible industry, still more, and more labour'd the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s total Ruine, as a thing that imported most of
all to the confirmation of that Authority, and Trust, to which
they saw themselves by his removal already advanc'd: So that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63412:53"/>
the King being daily afflicted with a thousand Accusations against
him, and wearied by their importunities, was at last so far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
as to consent that many of his Offices should be taken away,
being not yet to be prevail'd upon for his absolute Ruine. Whilst
the Duke was present, he continually by his good Services forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Masters mind, against all impressions of calumny, his
Enemies could invent, to the prejudice of his Fidelity, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and had ever triumph'd in his Majesties good Opinion,
over the Envy and Malice of his Detractors: but he was no
sooner remov'd out of his Eye, than that Confidence began to
stagger, his detractors representing him for an Enemy to the
Crown, a Friend to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and one that seducing
daily all the Garrisons in his Government to a Revolt, was upon
the point to Proclaim open War against the King himself.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Duke had very good Intelligence of all that
pass'd at Court; he very well knew that his Enemies made use of
all imaginable ways to destroy him, that the King was by them
perpetually socilited against him; and that consequently it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
him in common discretion to frustrate their Designs, and
to provide for his own safety in the strength of those places he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd:
Neither was he much surpriz'd at the unexpected news of
what the King had consented to against him, he was very well
acquainted with the constitution of the Court, and had very well
foreseen what would certainly be attempted against him; but he
could hardly perswade himself, that his Majesty could ever forget
his Fidelity, and good Services; yet did he not for all that neglect
his own preservation, that he might live to do him one day more,
and better Service: the only revenge this faithful honest Servant
meditated for the ingratitude of his Master.</p>
                  <p>He fell therefore presently into Consultation with his Friends,
what course he were best to take; a Debate wherein Opinions
were very different: some there were who advis'd him to return
to Court, representing that his presence would infallibly disperse
all those shadows of mistrust, which by his absence his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
had had opportunity to possess the King's mind withal; that
his tried Fidelity would soon recover its former place in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Opinion, and that then he would soon be in a condition to
return the mischiefs had been intended against him, upon the
heads of the first contrivers. Others there were who gave him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
to put himself into <hi>Metz,</hi> others to make immediately for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi>
and some of those there to joyn with the King of <hi>Navarre;</hi>
That to that purpose he should first go into <hi>Angoumois,</hi> whither
he might suddenly, and with great facility convey himself, where
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63412:53"/>
he had a strong City to retire unto, and where he would be in a
Country very convenient to favour his Passage into <hi>Provence,</hi> by
the way of <hi>Guienne</hi> and <hi>Languedoc;</hi> the Friends he had in those two
Provinces being enough to make his way, through the one, and
the other, should he be put upon a resolution of retiring thither.</p>
                  <p>The first propositions being accompanied with great, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
invincible difficulties, the Duke wholly adher'd to the last
advice, and so far follow'd it, as to retire to <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> without
joyning himself nevertheless (though infinitely solicited so to do)
with the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> A thing impossible for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
upon, had he been so enclin'd, for two Reasons; First, by
reason of that Princes Religion, and secondly, because being a
declared Enemy to the King his Master, the Duke would rather
have perish'd a thousand times, than appear to favour, much
less to engage with such, as he knew acted positively against his
Majesties Service.</p>
                  <p>One of the Duke's old Servants<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>De Guez</hi> was <hi>Bal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>De Guez</hi> by name, a man
of fourscore and eight years old, but notwithstanding so entire
in his Judgment as discover'd nothing of the infirmities of Age,
gave me not long since a full Relation of all these Circumstances.
He was at this time about the Duke's Person, and (as one of his
principal, and most trusty Servants) present at this Deliberation;
when the Duke asking his particular Opinion of all had been
propounded to him, <hi>De Guez</hi> told him, that he believ'd the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
he had already taken, to be without all dispute the best, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it were put i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>to speedy execution: but that it was to be
fear'd, that whilst he stood deliberating with his Friends what
was best to be done, his Enemies, who were very powerful, and
already resolv'd what to do, might effect something to the
prejudice of his Fortune; and that the least moments were to be
husbanded in a business of so great consequence as this. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that being soon consider'd of by the Duke, he immediately
commanded that every one should make himself ready to depart
within two days; neither did he longer defer it, but accordingly
put himself upon his way to <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> and that very seasonably,
as by the following discourse will suddenly appear.</p>
                  <p>But before the Duke left <hi>Loches,</hi> he was presented with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
by way of Apology in the behalf of himself, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
against the Calumnies contain'd in the forementioned <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,</hi>
of the League: a piece so eloquently couch'd, and set forth
with so many powerful, and so pertinent Arguments, that it is
certain the Leaguers could afterwards have wish'd they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
assaulted the Duke by the way of writing, that so they might
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63412:54"/>
not have drawn upon themselves so tart a Reply. I forbear to
transcribe it in this place, because it would swell this Volume
with things that are elsewhere, and in better language,<note place="margin">The Duke publishes an Answer to the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest</hi> of the League.</note> than I should
perhaps express it, to be found: But <hi>Mounsieur de Thou,</hi> one of
the most celebrated Historians of these latter times, thought it a
Discourse worth inserting at length in his History; and having
translated it out of the Original, into his own elegant Latine, has
commended it to all the Nations of Europe, where his works are
read with an universal applause. And although the Duke never
thought of justifying his actions that way, and that he had so
little a share in this answer, as neither then, nor ever since, to
know his name, who undertook his Quarrel and Interest with
so friendly a Zeal (a thing somewhat hard to believe, that a man
who would oblige the Duke at so kind a rate, should deprive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the thanks justly due to so great an obligation) he never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
took it upon him, and publish'd it in his own name, that
all the world might be satisfied both with his and his Brothers
Innocency: and certainly it wrought upon all disinterested spirits
impressions very disadvantageous to the covert practices of the
League.</p>

Forces into their City, without his express Order; whatever they
might pretend, or what Commissions soever they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the contrary. And indeed his Majesty had been so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
to exclude the Duke from this important place (being withal
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63412:54"/>
made to believe that he had only left <hi>Loches</hi> in order to a closing
with the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>) that being unwilling to have that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
strengthened, by so powerful, and so active a Confederate,
he had consented to this dispatch: but the Duke's diligence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
prevented this command,<note place="margin">But too late</note> so frustrated the execution of it,
that whereas it had before (had these orders come in time) been a
very easie matter to have kept him out, it was now impossible to
obey the Kings desire, he being got in, or to thrust him out again,
who had already made himself Master of the place.</p>
                  <p>The Consul notwithstanding communicated the Orders he had
receiv'd to some of his Relations, and most intimate Friends;
where the greater part of those he consulted about this business,
being enclin'd to the League (and it is hardly to be imagin'd how
strangely that contagion had diffus'd it self throughout the whole
Kingdom, no Family almost being without one, or more of their
Party; no City without some notorious Ring-leader of their
Faction; nor no Province wherein their Interest was not grown
to a formidable height) it was soon resolv'd upon, that (since the
Kings pleasure could not now be fulfill'd in the precise Form his
Letters prescrib'd) to propose to his Majesty other ways, by
which (as they conceiv'd) they might work as considerable, if
not a more advantageous effect, for his service, than they could
have done, by that it was now too late for them to perform. The
Consul therefore dispatch'd away to Court one <hi>Souch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law,
a notable Leaguer, and a bold Factious Fellow, to
acquaint the King with his Design; which was, to seize upon
the Duke's person, and to detain him Prisoner in the City, till his
Majesties further Order: who accordingly arriving at Court, and
addressing himself to <hi>Mounsieur de Villeroy,</hi> made this Proposition
to him, and was by him very well receiv'd. <hi>Villeroy</hi> promising
to acquaint the King with the good affection of the Inhabitants,
and to give him a speedy answer. I shall not here make shie of
delivering plainly what I have receiv'd from the Duke's own
mouth upon this occasion, and that without fear of reviving Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities
long ago extinct; the Duke, an <hi>Mounsieur de Villeroy</hi>
having often since (and that with some kind of delight) discours'd
themselves into a better intelligence about this Subject: So true it
is, that time is a Sovereign Remedy for the most violent passions,
no former unkindness betwixt these two great Ministers being of
force to hinder the mutual esteem they had of one anothers Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in their later years, from ending in a most sincere, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Friendship.</p>
                  <p>The King's answer to <hi>Villeroy</hi> was, that he should be glad to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63412:55"/>
have the Duke within his power,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1558.</note> that so he might hinder him
from joyning with the King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> but withal, if it could
not be done without endangering his Person, that they should by
no means attempt in, his Majesty being neither willing to have
him destroy'd, nor exasperated, but only restrain'd within the
bounds of his Duty: Which were the very words his Majesty
repeated to the Duke at his return to Court, graciously adding,
that it was in order to a speedy recalling of him about his own
Person, where he intended to use him like a Son (a title by which
his Majesty was ever pleas'd to Honour him in his Letters, and
ordinary Discourse) as hitherto he had ever done. But this was
too nice a Commission for his Enemies to work upon, who would
by all means make use of this occasion the hair-brain'd Citizens
presented to them, to take a full revenge of former injuries: for
after the business had been communicated to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
it was told <hi>Souchet</hi> by <hi>Mounsieur Villeroy,</hi> that it was the King's
desire, they should take the Duke Prisoner, and that they could
not do his Majesty a more acceptable service. Whereupon <hi>Souchet</hi>
having reply'd, that it would be an enterprize hard to execute so,
as to meet with no opposition; and that in such a case he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
to know how they were to behave themselves: he was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
order'd to take the Duke alive, or dead; that such was his
Majesties intention, and that it was a business of so great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that both he, and all others, who should be employ'd
therein, might certainly expect a recompense proportionable to
the merit of the Action. Some have further added, and it was a
common report, that a man utterly unknown to <hi>Souchet</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
in his Majesties Cloaths, and taught to pronounce this
Command, as if it had come from the King's own mouth: but
however it were carried, certain it is that <hi>Souchet</hi> could not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
more fully perswaded, than he did.</p>
                  <p>At his return he acquaints the Consul with his Instructions (at
a private place without the City) who hoping to do the King a
signal Service, communicated the Order he had receiv'd to forty, or
fifty, all active and resolute men, of his most intimate Friends, and
conferr'd yet further with some Gentlemen of the Duke of <hi>Guise's</hi>
Faction about it; so that having made himself as strong as he
could, and having writ to the Vicount <hi>Aubeterre,</hi> who was Head
of the League in that Province, to be ready to assist in an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so important to the Service of the King, and the Catholick
Union, he at last receiv'd the Deputy into the City upon <hi>St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
Eve, the day following without further delay being design'd
for the execution of the Enterprize.</p>

an action for the Novelty, and handsome performance of it,
worthy to be recorded amongst the general Transactions of that
time. <hi>Mounsieur de Thou, D' Aubigné,</hi> and <hi>D' Avila,</hi> have all made
long Relations of it; and there were many Printed Reports of
it current in <hi>France</hi> immediately after the thing was done, of which
several old Copies yet remain; to all which I could refer my
Reader, and spare my self the pains of repeating it over again,
could a business so highly important to the Duke's Honour be
left out of the recital of his Life, without making my self guilty
of an omission, Posterity might justly blame me for. Take here
therefore what I have collected, both from the Duke's own
mouth, and from some of his Servants; who, as they shar'd in
the danger of this Conspiracy, had also the Honour to do their
Master signal Service in so memorable an Action.</p>
                  <p>The Duke living in great security in the City, and behaving
himself very obligingly to all the Inhabitants in general, but more
particularly to those he saw bore the greatest sway amongst them,
spar'd no kind of good Entertainment, that he thought might
win the Consul over to his Devotion: a man, who besides the
addition of his Authority, was very considerable in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as being descended from one of the best Families in the City,
and a man of great sagacity and valour. The morning of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
therefore being St. <hi>Laurence</hi> day, he going early, as it
was usual, to give the Duke a Visit, was by him entertain'd with
extraordinary civility; the Duke not suffering him to depart, till
he had made him a promise to come again to Dinner: which
the Consul, thinking by that means to have his access into the
Castle more open, and free, for the effecting of his purpose, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
engag'd himself to do: And in the mean time returning
home, he found <hi>Souchet,</hi> and with him some dozen of the most
resolute Fellows, and fiercest Leaguers of all the Town, got thither
before him. These were to begin the work, and the others to the
number of five and forty, or fifty, were lodg'd in the Houses near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to the Castle, to be ready to second them, when they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the first Assault. Neither were these all in the Conspiracy,
for there were divers others dispos'd into the several Streets of the
City to alarm the rest of the people (altogether ignorant of the
Enterprize) by telling them that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had taken the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
by the Postern-gate that look'd into the Park, and to make
them by this device run to their Arms to repel them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:63412:56"/>Things being thus order'd, the Consul first entred the Castle,
taking along with him <hi>Souchet</hi> Booted, and Spurr'd, as if he new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arriv'd from Court, with another in the same Equipage; and
being come into the Hall, where he met with some of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Servants, he of them enquir'd for the Duke, saying, He had
there two Courriers to present to him, who brought him good
news from Court. Whereupon the Servants who saw him every
day with the Duke, and receiv'd with great Demonstrations of
Favour, and Respect, made no difficulty to tell him, that he was
in the Wardrobe: But whilst they were thus talking, six more of
the Inhabitants, who were also of the Plot, were come in under
pretense of paying their Service to the Duke, and to wait his
coming out to present themselves: And all of them, both the
Consul, and the rest, Arm'd under their Cloaks with Curasses,
or Coats of Mail, short Swords, and Pistols.</p>
                  <p>The three first having pass'd through the Hall, and the next
Chamber, without giving any suspicion, came into the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe,
where they expected to find the Duke, who by good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was just gone into his Closet, having taken in with him the
<hi>Abbot d' Elbene,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de l' Isle Marivault,</hi> two persons in
whom of all others he repos'd the greatest Confidence; and where
they were reading a Scandalous<note n="*" place="margin">In wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dishonour, that had been sent the Duke that morning. The
Conspirators, without taking notice who were in the Wardrobe,
vigorously assaulted the first they met; and at their first entrance
letting fly their Pistols, betook themselves to their Swords, crying
out as loud as they could, <hi>Kill, Kill:</hi> At this noise the other six
(who, dazled with the Cupboard of Plate in the Hall, had staid
behind to pilfer) ran presently to their Fellows, and all together
joyn'd in the Assault: The first that oppos'd their Fury in the
Wardrobe, was <hi>Signior Raphael Girolami, a Florentine</hi> Gentlemen,
and <hi>Sorlin</hi> the Duke's Chirurgion; the two Secretaries, who
were also in the Chamber being for want of Arms able to make
no resistance. But <hi>Sorlin</hi> drawing his Sword, gave the Consul a
slight hurt in the Head; and <hi>Girolami</hi> on his side, having first mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounded three of the Assailants, was at last by a Pistol shot
laid dead upon the place; so that he being dispatch'd, and <hi>Sorlin</hi>
desperately wounded, the Consul and the rest of the Conspirators,
had free access to the very door of the Closet, where they call'd
out aloud to the Duke to yield, or otherwise he was dead.</p>
                  <p>The Duke had already at the first uproar, not knowing by
whom he was assaulted, nor what security he might promise to
himself from the assistance of his Domesticks, and Friends, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricado'd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63412:56"/>
up the Door of his Closet, expecting a further light into
this disorder; <hi>D' Elbene,</hi> and <hi>Marivault,</hi> who were both with him,
having perswaded him so to do, and with-held him from going
out, until he first understood the cause of this Tumult, which
was yet utterly unknown. There were two Doors to this Closet,
one at the further end of a little Gallery, which was open; but
there was no way to the second, but through this Gallery, which
being dark, and so narrow as only to admit one a breast, made
the access to the inner Door very difficult, and dangerous: so that
by this means the Duke, and those that were with him, had a
conveniency of making some kind of resistance, till they might
be better inform'd of the business. And I have heard the Duke
say, when talking sometimes of this Mutiny, that in the heat of
the Action, he remov'd with one hand, and with great facility,
unwieldy Truncks, and Chests, to Barricado up the Door;
which, after he had a little compos'd himself, and thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to go out, they could not scarce all three, with all their
strength united, remove again to their places.</p>

throughout all the Churches in the City; at which Signal, the
people ran on all sides to Arms, lodging themselves in the Houses
nearest adjoyning to the Castle; mov'd so to do by the outcry of
the Conspirators, dispers'd into the several quarters of the Town,
that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had possest themselves of the Castle.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Conspirators immediately appointed for
this execution, and who were order'd to follow those already got
in with the Consul, attempting to possess themselves of the Gate
of the Castle, that they might let in the people, who came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in Arms from all parts, were oppos'd by some of the Duke's
Gentlemen, who were walking without in the base Court, to attend
his going abroad; of which the chief were <hi>Ambleville, Beaure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,
Sobole</hi> the elder, <hi>Lartigue,</hi> and some others. Neither was
their Design prevented without fighting; for <hi>Beaurepaire</hi> being
kill'd with the blow of an Halbert, and some of the Guards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
knock'd down by him, other of the Duke's Gentlemen, who
were walking at a further distance from the Gate, perceiving what
they were about, made all the haste they could, and came time
enough to get in before the Gate was quite shut; amongst whom
were the Count de <hi>Brienne,</hi> the Duke's Brother-in-law, <hi>Miran,
Gohas, la Coste,</hi> and <hi>Des Emars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All these Gentlemen being joyn'd together, and having with
much ado shut the outward Gate, and left a sufficient Guard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, ran up the Stairs to see what was become of the Duke;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63412:57"/>
where meeting no body to enquire of, they believ'd him to be
certainly dead, and all those that were with him: But after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a little recollected themselves from the astonishment so
strange a solitude had begot in them, and having gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such other Gentlemen, and Souldiers, of the Duke's Guard,
as they could find in the Castle, they resolv'd to set upon the
Consul, and his Associates, and to that purpose made directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Duke's Chamber, the only part of the House from
whence any noise was to be heard.</p>
                  <p>The Conspirators seeing themselves alone, the Gate of the
Castle shut, the Duke's Friends, and Servants got together, and
united, and (which most of all perplex'd them) that the people
could not force their entrance so soon as was requisite for their
safety, would yet try by the same Door by which they had entred,
to recover the principal Tower of the Castle, and to make that
good, till they might be reliev'd from without: But the passage
was so stoutly maintain'd by the Gentlemen, and those of the
Guard, who were joyn'd to them, that the Consul being mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wounded, and some other of his Complices more slightly
hurt, the ardour of their first resolution began apparently to cool,
their Enemies being possest of the only pass, by which they were
to expect a prompt, and necessary succour.</p>
                  <p>At this new uproar in the Wardrobe, the Duke having, amidst
so great a confusion of voices, distinguish'd some of them to be
his own people, sallied out of his Closset with the Abbot <hi>D' Elbene,</hi>
and <hi>Marivalt;</hi> so that these sallying out with Sword, and Pistol,
by the Door of the Closset, whilst the other Door towards the
Hall was made good by the Duke's Friends, the Consul and his
Complices found themselves beset on all sides; and seeing no
hopes of safety by the way they had in vain, and with many
wounds attempted to pass, they resolv'd to get out by a
third Door of the same Wardrobe, which yet remain'd free, and
that let by a back way to the forementioned Tower; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
carrying off the wounded Consul with them, recover'd a
little pair of stone Stairs, the only refuge was left them, and
where they intended to defend themselves to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ast man: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wanted they means so to do; for being all arm'd, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Duke nor any of his Followers were, and resolute Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
as they had sufficiently made it appear; and having only
a narrow pair of Stairs to make good, they were not to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted,
but with infinite hazard, in a place of so great advantage:
which made the Duke resolve upon putting fire to the Stairs, to
the end he might there, as it were besieg'd, keep them in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:63412:57"/>Whilst these things were doing within the Castle, a Maid came
running, and told the Duke, that the Consuls Brother, with a
great number of armed Men, were upon entring by a hole they
had made in the Wall, on that side next the Curtain; which
made him immediately repair thither, as where his presence was
most necessary, leaving only three of his Guard to make good
the Stair-foot, where the Consul and his Confederates were, that
they might attempt nothing in his absence. At his coming into
the Court he found the Consul's Brother, and another with
him, already enter'd the place, who both of them strove with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
valour, to make way for the rest: But the Duke having
soon kill'd the first with his own hand, the other being no better
handled by his Followers; and having left a sufficient Guard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place, he ran presently to another Alarm, no less dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
than this he had already taken so good order in: For the
Conspirators without having (as we have said before) been able
to force the great Gate, by reason of the vigorous resistance they
had met there, were run to another little Postern, that no body
dream'd of, with fire to burn it down; by which means, and by
a petard they had also got to blow it open, they doubted not to
force their entrance that way; but the Duke arriving opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the place, with some fifteen he had rallied together, after
a dangerous, and obstinate Conflict, beat back the Assailants, and
so fortified it for the future, that it was impossible for them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to force that pass.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke was thus busie without, those who were with
the Consul upon the Stairs, seeing the passage now guarded by
only the three Souldiers, who had been left to that purpose, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to make their way, and to escape, which they hop'd
they might do whilst the Duke, and his Servants, were elsewhere
employ'd, intending afterwards to force some of the Avenues (it
being impossible they should be all well guarded, the Duke ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so few about him) and to let in the rest of their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
to their succour: But the Duke, with marvellous diligence
presenting himself in all places where there was any suspicion of
danger, coming opportunely in, when they were already disputing
it with his Guards; and having, by the death of one of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
whom he dispatch'd with his own hand, beaten back the
rest, defeated them of all further hopes, of escaping out of his
Power. In which encounter he ran an exceeding great hazard, for
the Stairs upon which they fought having been already loosened
in the Joynts by the heat of the fire, and moreover shaken by
the agitation of the Comba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ants, could no longer support it self
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63412:58"/>
from falling down with a sudden ruine, the step whereon the
Duke stood only remaining firm, who without so miraculous a
fortune had certainly perish'd in the fall. <hi>Miran,</hi> a Gentleman of
good understanding and great courage, told me some years ago
this Story: in which as he had himself a particular share, so has
he often assur'd me, that without the Duke's personal courage,
great vigilancy, and noble resolution he did believe they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
escap'd that eminent peril; that in his life he never saw a man
so constant in all kinds of danger; and that as they who had
faithfully serv'd him in this occasion had doubtless deserv'd very
well at his hands, so stood they no less oblig'd to him for their
own preservation, than he to them for his, having done more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it in his own single person, than almost all the rest, all
their endeavours put together.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants, who had this while possest themselves of a
House call'd the <hi>Queens Castle,</hi> separated only from that wherein
the Duke was assaulted by a little Court, and of equal height
with it, by powring continual shot in at the Windows,
which were very large, and high, did not a little incommodate
the Duke; another inconvenience to be provided against, as it
speedily was, and (as that had already done for the other defects
of the place) so well, that it was almost impossible by strength of
hand to force him.</p>
                  <p>The toil, and bustle of this Action having been sudden, and
violent, and the Fight almost unintermitted from the beginning,
the Duke and those with him found themselves so weary, and
their strength so abated, that to refresh themselves, and to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a little breath, the Duke call'd for something to drink; but
upon examination there were but four Bottles of Wine, no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at all, and very little, and that course Bread, to be found in
all the Castle; neither was there any more to be hop'd for, the
Inhabitants being as they were Masters of all the Kitchins, and
other Offices, as also of a Well in the back Court, which could
not possibly be recover'd from them, an irreparable, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
inconvenience to the Duke and his Followers, who saw
themselves at once assaulted with Enemies, within, and without,
and more violently with hunger, and thirst; two Enemies they
could the worst defend themselves against; a condition in which
they continued for two dayes, and one night, and wherein the
Duke's constancy is no less to be admir'd, than in so gallantly
defending himself against the violence of his armed Adversaries,
the necessities of Nature being much harder to be contended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
than the most obstinate attempts of the most resolute Enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:63412:58"/>Hitherto the Duke saw no signs of succour; <hi>Tagent</hi> his Cousin,
and Lieutenant in that Government was at <hi>Xaintes,</hi> with the
Troops, and the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> wherein he had a trusty Servant, had
made no shew of standing for him, having not so much as made
one Cannon, or Musquet shot against the City: For the Consul
who was no less circumspect than valiant, having, when he first
plotted the Design of this Enterprize, forgot nothing, that
might any way contribute to the success, had cunningly drawn
<hi>Bordes</hi> Governour of the <hi>Cittadel</hi> into the Town, under colour
of some important Business he was to communicate to him, and
had there seiz'd of his Person; so that at the same time the Duke
was first assaulted in the Castle, they who had <hi>Bordes</hi> in custody,
brought him before the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> and with a Dagger at his Throat
commanded him to yield it up: but he scorn'd to do a thing so
unworthy of himself in so great an exigency, and his Lieutenant
remain'd also firm in his duty, though it be true that the regard
he had to his Captains safety made him forbear to shoot, till the
last extremity.</p>
                  <p>As if the Duke in so eminent a peril were not sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
with his own troubles, he had yet present before his eyes
the danger to which the Dutchess his Lady was expos'd; who,
being a little before the tumult began gone out of the Castle
towards the <hi>Iacobins,</hi> to hear Mass, was seiz'd upon by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
as she was retiring towards the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> the way to the
Castle being shut up: Her two Gentlemen Ushers, the one call'd
<hi>Piar,</hi> and the other <hi>Seguencio,</hi> bravely offer'd to make some resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
but were both wounded to death, whilst they held her by
the Arms; so that their Blood flew upon her Cloaths: Neither
was the Dutchess alone arrested after this manner, many of the
Dukes Gentlemen who were abroad in the Town, suspecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
being also taken prisoners; of which <hi>la Curée,</hi> since <hi>Camp-Master</hi>
to the Light Horse of <hi>France,</hi> was one, with St. <hi>Mesme,
Bleré,</hi> the Baron <hi>de Cose, de Ramel,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p>In these extremities, to which the Duke was reduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, he let a
Footman by a Rope down the Castle-Wall, on that side towards
the Park, to carry <hi>Tagent</hi> intelligence of the danger he was in:
but the Fellow was no sooner down, than intercepted by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
who had every where set Guards to that purpose: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which, two of the Duke's Gentlemen, being gone
early abroad a Hunting, and upon the noise of the <hi>Tocquesain</hi>
they heard from the City, being return'd upon the spur up
to the very Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e of the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> to know the meaning of it, were
soon enform'd, and as soon turn'd full speed to carry <hi>Tagent</hi> the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63412:59"/>
news, who by them receiv'd the first intimation of the Duke's
danger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tagent,</hi> upon the arrival of these two Gentlemen, caus'd the
Trumpets immediately to sound to Horse, and presently mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with what Cavalry he had, arriv'd with all possible diligence
at the Gates of <hi>Angoulesme:</hi> It was in a time when the Duke could
hardly hold out any longer against hunger and thirst, which for
two whole days he had sustain'd, without any kind of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that little provision before mentioned having been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divided amongst his Friends, the Duke disdaining to preserve
his own life longer than he could also support so many brave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as so franckly expos'd themselves to all hazards for his
safety.</p>
                  <p>The people had in the mean time continued their first
Fury, in which they had been assisted, and advis'd by
several Gentlemen of the Countrey, who took part with the
League; whereof those of chief note were <hi>Meré,</hi> a man
who was a particular Servant to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and who had
been bred up in his Family; <hi>la Messeliere, Les-Bouchaux, de Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queville,</hi>
and some others who were drawn into that Faction, by
the specious pretense of Religion, a Colour by which most men
of that time were pre-possess'd, and abus'd. These having inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
the Castle on all sides, had summon'd the Duke to Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with offers of free Quarter, and Bag, and Baggage to him,
and his; a Summons to which the Duke had smartly reply'd,
<hi>That he would rather choose to die, than to receive the least courtesie at
their hands; and that he hop'd e're long to reduce them to such a straight,
that they should be glad to receive conditions at his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It should seem that in this occasion the Duke's Enemies would
also give his Dutchess an opportunity wherein to manifest her ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Spirit, that she might share with her Husband in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of so handsome an Action; for having already found there
was no good to be done upon the Castle by any violent means
they could practise against it, they threatned the Dutchess, that
unless she did perswade the Duke her Husband to make a speedy
Surrender, they would make her serve for a Gabion before the
place, whither they accordingly led her; such were the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
wherewith a Lady of her Birth, and Quality was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by these rude people: but she, without being mov'd with
their threats, made answer to those who talk'd so impudently to
her, <hi>That did the Duke her Husband's Resolution stand in need of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
she should her self desire to be presented before him, that
she might fortifie him to persist in his defense: but that being altogether
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63412:59"/>
unnecessary, their menaces to her were much more impertinent; that
nevertheless she could not but wonder, at their insolence, and that she
durst venture to Prophesie, she should e're long make them repent it;</hi>
and afterwards turning towards <hi>Meré,</hi> who of all others had been
the most uncivil to her, she reproach'd him with his barbarous
carriage, in so handsome Language, with so masculine a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and so graceful an indignation, as if she had foreseen all
the good success, that soon after hapned in this business, contrary
to all humane expectation.</p>
                  <p>The enterprize of which we are now speaking had been carried
on with that secresie, and had so surpriz'd the Duke, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
that there were only eight of his Guards to be found in the
Castle, when this business began, all the rest having been trapt
in the Town; which small number were notwithstanding so
conveniently dispos'd into places of most danger, and were so
expert in the use of their fire Arms, that it was observ'd they
never shot in vain; a dexterity that has since grown to such a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
in all who have succeeded in that employment, that they have
ever signaliz'd themselves by their Activity, and Valour, above all
others upon all occasions, and by those qualities acquir'd so great
a reputation; that the late King intending to raise a Troop of
Dragoons (as he did) for the guard of his own person, did them
the honour to choose six out of the Duke's company, to settle the
Order, and Discipline of that Troop.</p>
                  <p>If the Duke were himself vigorously assaulted without, he no
less importun'd the Consul, and his Complices within the Castle,
who nevertheless defended themselves with great resolution; but
seeing themselves press'd upon by the fire, that by little and little
still encreas'd upon them; by hunger likewise, and the Sword,
and finding themselves weakned by their wounds to the last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
their Ring-leader at the point to die, and themselves out
of all hopes of relief, they let one of their company by cloath
cut into shreds, and tied together, down into the Castle Ditch,
to acquaint the Sub-Consul, whose name was <hi>Corlieu,</hi> with the
condition they were in; who presently assembling the people,
and consulting with them about their Friends necessity, it was
soon resolv'd upon, that they should come to Propositions of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation;
in order to which the Sub-C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>sul presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
before the Castle, and demanded a Conference; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
granted, the Abbot <hi>D' Elbene,</hi> and <hi>Ambleville</hi> drew near to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
with him.</p>
                  <p>But before they could come to any conclusion, the Consul,
and those with him being reduc'd to a final necessity, had surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63412:60"/>
themselves upon the Duke's word; which notwithstanding
he punctually observ'd to them without the least injury, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
(though the Consul died of his Wounds before the end of
the Action) yet as soon as he had them in his power, he order'd
them to write to those of the City, what danger their lives were
in, should they any more offer to assault the Castle: A Policy
that oblig'd their Relations so to importune the Sub-Consul to
conclude the Treaty, that he again return'd to the Castle to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Duke, that <hi>Ambleville,</hi> and <hi>D' Elbene</hi> might come into
the City to Treat with them, which <hi>Ambleville</hi> absolutely refus'd
to do; it being, as he conceiv'd, inconsistent with his Honour, to
abandon the Duke in a time of so great danger: So that the Abbot
(sufficient Hostages being first deliver'd in for his security)
was fain to go out alone, and was immediately conducted to the
Town-Hall.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot had by his dexterity brought things to so good a
forwardness, that the Accommodation was upon the point to be
concluded, to the Duke's Honour, and satisfaction, when <hi>le Meré,</hi>
who would by no means lose so fair an opportunity of sacrificing
the Duke, to his Master the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s hatred, broke off
the Treaty, by promising the people a speedy, and infallible suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
from the Vicount <hi>D' Aubeterre;</hi> who (as he said) having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
express Orders from the King, was with all possible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
coming in to their assistance.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot then must return to the Castle, which he did, not
without some danger; so high was the insolence of the people
rais'd by this little beam of hope, though false, and impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. Every one now ran again to his Arms, which they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
with greater violence than before; the Drums, the <hi>Tocque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sain,</hi>
and the clamours of the Seditious rabble, indifferently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling,
as well the Nobility, and Gentry, as the Commons, as
well those who were averse to the League, as the Leaguers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to joyn in the common mischief. The hop'd by a Petard
which they intended to apply to a part of the Castle-Wall, they
knew to be very weak, to make a sufficient breach to enter at;
which accordingly playing, and having wrought some effect, the
Gentry, and the people presented themselves with great courage
to the Assault; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>hey found greater in the Defendants, who,
though very few in comparison of the Assailants, after a long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
forc'd them to retire, with the loss of a great many very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
men.</p>
                  <p>The next day about three of the clock in the morning, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
heard the Trumpets of the Duke's Cavalry, who were
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63412:60"/>
led by the <hi>Sieur de Tagent</hi> to his Relief; the report of whose ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
having put life into the Commanders and Souldiers of the
<hi>Cittadel,</hi> they began to shoot against the City, which till then they
had never done: And if the arrival of this succour encouraged
the one party, it no less coold the fury, and obstinacy of the other;
who now began submissively to sue for a conclusion of the Treaty,
which they had so insolently broken off the day before, and sent
again to entreat that the Abbot <hi>D' Elbene</hi> might once more come
out to that purpose; a request the Duke made then some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to grant, though in truth he had the greatest reason to desire
it.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot nevertheless went out the second time into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but as vainly as before; for the Baron <hi>de Touverae,</hi> with many
other Gentlemen of the League being arriv'd, and amongst others
<hi>La-Caze,</hi> Quarter-Master to the Vicount <hi>D' Aubeterre</hi>'s Company
of <hi>Cuirassiers,</hi> put new vigour into the Inhabitants; <hi>La-Caze</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
them, that the next morning the Vicount would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
come to their succour, with three hundred Horse, and five
hundred Foot; by which the Citizens being re-assur'd, they now
breath'd nothing but War, the common people being ever as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to entertain rash and giddy resolutions, as they are usually
backwards, and cowardly in the execution of them.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot was therefore again to recover the Castle, and that
with greater danger than before, being first carried to the Gates
of the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> and there constrain'd with a Dagger at his Throat,
to forbid the Souldiers from shooting any more against the City,
which nevertheless they did not forbear to do: The Duke (press'd
upon now more than ever by those of the City) having found
means, from the high Tower of the Castle, to give a sign to the
Commanders of the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> who might easily see it, to shoot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
so to divert the fury of the Enemy, that so violently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
him; a Command so well understood, and so readily
obey'd, that the confusion was now far greater in all parts of the
City, than hitherto it had ever been. Neither had it ceased so
soon, had not the <hi>Sieur de Nesmond,</hi> chief Justice of the place, a
man of great authority amongst them, and no less considerable
for his quality, than his Employment, with such of the principal
Magistrates, as had not consented to this tumult, resolv'd to joyn
all their interests together to put an end to the business.</p>
                  <p>To that purpose therefore they assembled at the Bishops Palace.
This Prelate <hi>Charles de Bony</hi> by name, an Italian by birth, having
long govern'd that Diocess with great reputation of Vertue, and
Piety, could not without infinite sorrow behold these confusions,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63412:61"/>
though authoriz'd by the League, and palliated with the pretext
of Religion; so that in this Assembly, he, the Magistrates, and
some well dispos'd Citizens, having consider'd the peril the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was in, as also their own particular danger, who were likely
to be involv'd in the common ruine, uniting themselves against
the seditious, with some Gentlemen of Quality of the Country
(who being come in at the noise of this disorder, had stood neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
during the whole Action) sent two of the most eminent
amongst them to the Duke, to entreat him, that he would please
to consent that the Capitulation, which had been agreed upon
the day before with the Abbot <hi>D' Elbene,</hi> might be Sign'd, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ified
by <hi>Tagent,</hi> who was with his Cavalry in the Suburbs; a
request was readily granted by the Duke, who was now no longer
in a condition, had he been so dispos'd, to refuse it.</p>
                  <p>It had now been above forty hours since the Duke, or any of
those who were with him in the Castle had either drank, or
eaten; their powder was all spent, the men for the most part
wounded, and those who were not, so worn out with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
fasting, and continual labour, that it was their courage on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that did support them; a support that would soon have fail'd
them, with their lives, had the Besiegers known their necessities,
which were such as flesh and blood could no longer endure:
But God, who reserv'd the Duke for better occasions, was pleas'd
to deprive them of that knowledge, and so to order things, that
the impatience of two short hours deliver'd him from that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and apparent danger. The Abbot <hi>D' Elbene</hi> therefore
went out the third, and last time into the City; and, together
with the Inhabitants repair'd to <hi>Tagent;</hi> who, to the Duke's
great astonishment had all this while stood an idle Spectator,
without once endeavouring to enter the Town to his succour:
'Tis true, he sign'd the Capitulation, which was all the share he
had in this business: But the Articles were no sooner Sign'd,
than they immediately fell to breaking down the Barricadoes, the
people retir'd every one to their own Houses, and the Dutchess
of <hi>Espernon</hi> was conducted to the Castle by the aforesaid Abbot.
Where being come,<note place="margin">The end of the Action.</note> after she had given the Duke her Husband
some tender, and affectionate testimonies of joy for his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
the first thing she did, in return of the barbarous usage
she had receiv'd, was to mediate their Pardons, by whom she
had been so ill us'd, with the Duke; who, though he had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
a severe Revenge upon them, who had committed so great
an outrage against him, was notwithstanding content to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
his Animosities to the generous intercession of this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63412:61"/>
Lady. He moreover set those he had taken Prisoners with
the Consul at Liberty, consented that <hi>Meré,</hi> with the other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of his Party, should retire to their own Houses, giving
them a Convoy of Light Horse for their defense; and by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
effect of Generosity, and good Nature, having restor'd the
dead Bodies of the Consul, and his Brother to their Relations,
and Friends, he permitted them to be buried with publick Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequies.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he so franckly pardon'd all the rest of the Citizens, that
not any one of them, who would afterwards live in Peace,
could ever perceive in him the least memory of any former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness;
but on the contrary, receiv'd from him all the good
Offices, and gentle Usage they could expect from a man, they
had never offended: by which exceeding Clemency, and by the
protection both the City and Country receiv'd from him, for
the space of fifty years, which he afterwards held that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he so won the hearts of that people, that there was not
one of them who would not chearfully have ventur'd Life, and
Fortune for his Service, and who have not, to this hour, his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
in great Veneration, as the Father, Protector, and Restorer
of their Country.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>

                           </gap>varre</hi> endeavours to draw the Duke over to his Party.</note> who was ever so intent upon his own
Affairs, as to let no occasion slip, that he conceiv'd might any
way serve to advance them; foreseeing that after the Assembly
which was to be holden at <hi>Blois,</hi> he should certainly have
all the Forces both of the King, and the League bent joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against him, had not fail'd to send to the Duke upon his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from Court, (a time very proper to have taken his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
in the heat, had he been a Male-content) with offers
of as high, and honourable conditions, as he himself could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
have propos'd, if he would joyn with him. To which the
Duke equally firm in his Religion, and Loyalty, made answer,
that he did beseech his Majesty to reflect upon the infinite obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
he had to the King his Master; and then he did assure
himself, that his own generosity, would for ever condemn him
of ingratitude,<note place="margin">The Duke excuses himself.</note> should he abandon his Service for any persecution
his Enemies could practice against him: After which, and many
humble, and respective thanks for his gracious offer, he gave
him plainly, and freely to understand, that he would rather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish;
than to live oblig'd to any other for his protection, than to
him who was the sole Author of his Fortune.</p>
                  <p>But this Prince not checking, at this first refusal, would yet
try if in the business of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> by his own Actions, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63412:62"/>
Presence, he could not work more effectually upon the Duke,
than by the mediation of Agents, he had hitherto done; and
to that purpose, being advertis'd of this enterprize (though at a
time when he was upon the point to fall upon the City, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of <hi>Clisson,</hi> in the lower <hi>Poictou,</hi> very considerable places, and
which in all apparence he was likely to carry) he nevertheless
gave over the Design, to come to the Duke's Relief: A delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that some have believ'd, was not so much intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue
the Duke from the danger he was in, as to make use of that
occasion, in the Confusion the City then was, to seize upon it
to his own use, and to reduce so considerable a place into the
hands of his own Party: But whatever his Design was, he met
intelligence by the way, that the Duke had already disingag'd
himself from his Enemies, and was settled in a posture of safety:
by which though he found he should come too late to do the
Duke any Service, unwilling nevertheless to lose the thanks of
his good intention,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> tries again to perswade the Duke, but in vain.</note> he sent to congratulate with him for his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Deliverance, which he said was so much the more glorious to
him, as it was wrought out of himself, and effected by his own
Valour, and Constancy; advising him withal to consider how
many of the like attempts he was to expect from his Enemies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice;
withal once more offering to joyn his Interests with his,
and to run the same Fortune with him in all hazards. But the
Duke answering still with the same civility, and respect he had
done before, without suffering himself to be tempted from the
duty he ow'd to the King his Master, continued constant in his
Resolution, never to take part with any, who were his open and
declared Enemies.</p>
                  <p>In this place methinks the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> is chiefly to be
consider'd, to make thence a right judgment of the greatness and
constancy of his mind: He had scarce been seven years a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
when he saw the prodigious Engine of the League ready to
fall upon him; a body so formidable, and so great, as having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
constrain'd the King himself to bow before it, made all
those of the Reformed Religion to tremble at its motion; no
Authority was able to stop it, no Power to resist it, yet could it
never startle this young Dukes constancy: But on the contrary,
though he saw himself forsaken by the King, and expos'd to the
malice of his Enemies; though he saw the people, in his own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
rais'd in mutiny against him, and all things as it
were conspiring together to his Ruine; yet could he not even in
these extremities ever submit to the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though offer'd, and so handsomely offered to him: but
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63412:62"/>
though alone in his own Quarrel, at least without other assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
than of his Friends and Servants, he had yet the courage
to defend his own Interests, and the Service of his Prince, even
against his Prince himself, who was now become General of his
own Enemies; Yet had he ever so excellent a Government over
himself, as to do nothing contrary to his Conscience, or his Duty:
So that not being to be mov'd either by the Menaces of the
League, or by the Hopes he might reasonably conceive from the
assistance of those of the Reform'd Religion, he subdu'd those
two Passions that exercise the most absolute Empire over the
minds of men, and that bear the greatest sway in all Humane
Designs.</p>

all things in outward shew were dispos'd in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Duke of <hi>Guise:</hi> but still as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
nearer to his Object, the greater the height, and the
more difficult the access unto the place, to which he aspir'd, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
unto him: That one remaining step he was to climb, to
reach the height of his desires, seeming to rise still further from
him, as oft as he attempted to gain it. So that tir'd out with so
many present difficulties, and apprehending yet more those which
were to come,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> in suspense, whether or no he should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</note>
'tis said he was often almost resolv'd to leave off
his Designs, and to rely upon the King's Word, that had so often
assur'd him the enjoyment of his present greatness, wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he doubted not without any great difficulty to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> either jealous (as some have
thought) of his Brothers Greatness, or else of a more moderate
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63412:64"/>
temper, than the rest of his Family, had often advis'd him to
this Resolution; but the Cardinal their Brother, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Lyons,</hi> were the Incendiaries, that rekindled his dying
Ambition, and that hurried him on to that precipice, into which
they themselves at last fell with him: <q>They represented to him
by what infinite labours, and industry they had plac'd him in
that height to which he was already arriv'd; That if he ever
had resolv'd there to limit his desires, and to content himself
with a competent Fortune, he ought never to have undertaken
those pains, nor to have undergone those dangers he had so
gloriously, and so fortunately overcome; That the merit of his
Ancestors had left him greatness enough to satisfie an ordinary
Ambition: but that if he ever had the thought of rising above
them, as doubtless he had, the way was open to him, and that
he had already overcome the greatest difficulties: That the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of <hi>France</hi> stood for him, and that almost all Foreign
Princes, and States were favourable to him: That God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
seem'd to take his part, by giving him a negligent and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
Prince; whose nature being softned, and unnerv'd by
ease, and sloth, had laid him open to his Designs: That it was
an easie matter in the condition himself then was, to make him
sure: That not suddenly to do it, it was to be fear'd the King
might recover from his Lethargy; and, looking into himself,
might re-assume his former vigour, and recover his almost lost
Authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y: That the very fear the King then liv'd in, ought to
be highly suspected to him: That no Counsels were so violent
and dangerous, as those that proceeded from apprehension, or
extream necessity: That he infinitely deceiv'd himself, if he
thought there could be any safety for him (what promises soever
the King might make) in that height to which he had already
rais'd himself: That the Fortune of a Subject was never more
unstable, and unsafe, than when it rendred him suspected to
his Prince: That he must boldly therefore step out of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a Subject, if he would be out of the danger of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.
They further remonstrated to him what Opinion all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
who were joyn'd together in his Favour, what all good
<hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who were passionate in his cause, what all posterity
(to which he ought to have a greater regard, than to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
could have of his courage; if the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> only
should think himself unworthy of that Dignity, to which all
the world besides so passionately wish'd he might arrive: That
he ought then boldly to end, what he had so generously begun,
and so gloriously pursu'd; and that though death it self should
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63412:64"/>
follow (which was not in the least to be doubted) it were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

was apt enough to take fire at such Counsels, as these haughty,

fall on with greater violence, he presently sent new dispatches to

                     </gap>eing soon agreed upon with some of the Nobility,
his Majesty knew most faithful to him, had the execution of it
without further delay committed to eight of the five and forty.
These five and forty were all of them Gentlemen of approved
Valour, and for whose fidelity they who had recommended them
to the King, stood themselves engag'd; so that of this Company
(to which the number had given the name) his Majesty made his
most assured Guard (the greatest part of his Domesticks being
become suspected to him) and as it were wholly entrusted the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Person to their Fidelity, and care: They attended him
where-ever he went, they nightly kept Guard in his Anti-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and (as nothing is so powerful as benefits to win the hearts,
and affections of men) there was not one of them, who, besides
his Salary of an hundred Crowns of Gold a month (which
was very much in those times) had not over and above either
receiv'd, or had not very good reason to expect, great recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
from his Royal bounty: So that these men being absolutely
ty'd to all his Majesties Interests, it was no hard matter to induce
them to make an attempt upon the Person of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
against whom the King had conceiv'd a violent, and implacable
Hatred. I shall here say nothing of the manner and circumstances
of the Death of this Duke, nor of that of the Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi>
his Brother, who at the same time came to the same violent end,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63412:65"/>
most of our Historians being particular in that Relation: but I
can bear testimony that the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> did neither then, nor
ever since approve of that execution; and that although he had
receiv'd very hard measure from the Duke in his life, he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
had his great qualities in high esteem after his death. And
indeed he had so often, and so generously employ'd those rare
Endowments for the safety and honour of the Kingdom, that
his Vertue could never have been too highly commended, could
he have added the qualities of a good Subject, to those other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
which rendred him one of the greatest men of his time.</p>
                  <p>A little before the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s death, the King had dismist
from Court the High Chancellor <hi>Chiverny,</hi> and the <hi>

                        </gap>ieures de Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievre,</hi>
and <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> Secretaries of State, upon considerations
that were then variously interpreted; though the King would
have the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> believe, that the chief cause of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Villeroy</hi>'s disgrace was the business of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> which
his Majesty wholly laid to his charge;<note place="margin">New Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters chosen after the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s Death.</note> and that the Duke might
the better be confirm'd in this opinion, the <hi>Sieur de Révol,</hi> a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
creature of the Dukes, one that was, under him, Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the Exchequer of <hi>Provence,</hi> and that had no interest at
Court saving his Protection, was receiv'd into his Place.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty had no sooner absolutely determin'd the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi>'s Ruine, than that foreseeing the consequences so bloody an
execution was likely to draw after it, he dispatch'd away Colonel
<hi>Alphonso Corso,</hi> afterwards <hi>Mareschal d'Ornano,</hi> to seize upon the
Duke of <hi>Mayen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e</hi> at <hi>Lyons,</hi> where he then resided; which, if it
could have been in time effected, his Majesty had in all apparence
been secur'd from the greatest part of those mischiefs which this
action afterwards produc'd: but the Duke, having receiv'd the
news of his Brothers Deaths some hours before <hi>Alphonso</hi>'s arrival,
was already in great diligence got to Horse, and fled out at one
Gate of the City as <hi>Ornano</hi> entred at another to surprize him, and
by that means first recovered <hi>Dijon,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Paris,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any impediment: Where he was no sooner arriv'd, than that
laying aside that moderation he had euer manifested, during his
Brother's Life, he declar'd himself Head of that Party, he had ever
till then, to his great Reputation, seem'd to condemn; and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together all the Forces of the League that lay scatter'd up and
down in several places, he of them, without stirring from <hi>Paris,</hi>
made a very considerable Army.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty easily judg'd that this storm would suddenly break
upon him, and fail'd not, out of that foresight, to call all his
principal Servants about him, which nevertheless made up but an
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63412:65"/>
inconsiderable Body, and such as could no ways secure him from
any attempt of the Enemy: So that he was advis'd to send once
more to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> to intreat him to advance with his
Troops to his succour, which notwithstanding the King not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to perswade himself to do, (his regard to Religion, and

at that time sent Orders to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who had then a

himself upon his march, he should first go to this Prince, to
make the first overtures of this business to him. The <hi>Sieur de
Beaujeu</hi> was purposely dispatch'd to the Duke with these Orders,
which were no sooner receiv'd by him, than he departed from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goulesme</hi>
to go to St, <hi>Iean d' Angely,</hi> where the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>
then was; and where having found him well dispos'd, and very
ready to do his Majesty the Service he desired of his Person,
and Faction, he immediately made himself ready to go to the
King;<note place="margin">The Duke call'd back to Court.</note> who, seeing his Enemies now ready to fall upon him, had
sent a new, and instant Express to the Duke in all haste to come,
and joyn with him: which express Order to satisfie with the
greatest diligence, he rather chose to leave the Negotiation he had
already so successfully begun with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> to the
Dutchess of <hi>Angoulesme</hi> (who soon after brought it to effect) than
one moment to defer his attendance on his Master in so critical a
time, and on so urgent an occasion.</p>
                  <p>All these great transactions hapned at Court,<note place="margin">Anno 1589.</note> after the Duke of
<hi>Espernon</hi> had retir'd himself from thence into his Governments.
Neither was he in his retirement, or in his choice of the place he
retir'd unto, either unactive in himself, or in a Scene improper for
his Majesties Service; for he was no sooner disingag'd from the
enterprize of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> but that he put himself immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a condition to awe many of his ill Neighbours in the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Provinces, so as either to continue them in, or to make them
return unto their duty:<note place="margin">Some acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Duke du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement.</note> For which purpose having increas'd his

point to make themselves Masters of the place, at the Duke's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
rais'd the Siege in great disorder, and retir'd not without

                  <p>The Duke was after this preparing himself for greater enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
when <hi>Beaujeu</hi> brought him those foremention'd Orders

and knowing his Majesty almost naked of all defense, and as it
were, expos'd to the violence of his Enemies, he thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
upon the instant to move with all his Forces that way, and
at the same time by a Gentleman to give his Majesty notice of his
motion, that he might receive his Majesties Commands upon the
way: By which Gentleman the King sent him presently word,
that the most important service he could then do him, was to put
himself into <hi>Blois.</hi> For the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> having resolv'd to
make his first attempt upon that place, either by the ruine of the
Castle to revenge in part the death of his two Brothers, who
there last their lives; or to make that City (which by its vicinity
to <hi>Tours,</hi> was very proper to watch all advantages against the
King) his seat of War; his Majesty conceiv'd there would be
little security for him in <hi>Tours,</hi> should his Enemy possess himself
of that Post, and had therefore bent all his care, and endeavour
to preserve it out of the power of the League.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty would have put the <hi>Mareschal de Biron</hi> into that
place, and afterwards, he having excus'd himself, the <hi>Mareschal
d' Aumont;</hi> but both the one, and the other having refus'd the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of defending, and with unequal Forces, a place, that being in
it self open on all sides, was not well to be defended, and that
was to expect the first fury of the League to be bent against it,
his Majesty turn'd his thoughts towards the Duke of <hi>Espernon;</hi>
and knowing that the difficulty of the undertaking would be no
little motive to make the Duke embrace it, his Majesty sent him
word, that the <hi>Mareschals de Biron,</hi> and <hi>d' Aumont</hi> had both of
them already excus'd themselves from that Employment; and that
he only remain'd, from whose Valour and Fidelity he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to himself so signal, and so honourable a Service in so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult

of that City was of pressing, and immediate concern; but that
withal he should be infinitely glad to see him, and that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Enemy, and a man from whom of all others he had receiv'd the

to prepare himself. This block in the Duke of <hi>Mayen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was perhaps none of the least things that concurr'd to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Royal Affairs: but whether it were or no, the Duke
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63412:67"/>
was however infinitely condemn'd for having so wilfully set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon an Enterprize of so little moment, in a time when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be so advantageous as diligence to the execution of
his Designs.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> measuring by this first Essay the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
he was likely to meet withal from the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> at
<hi>Blois,</hi> alter'd his design of attempting that place, and resolv'd
without further delay to turn the torrent of his Arms upon the
King himself, and against the City of <hi>Tours,</hi> where his Majesty
then resided.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had joyn'd himself with his Majesty but
the day before, and had with his men taken up his Quarter in
one of the Suburbs of the City; whom his Majesty being gone
to visit in his Quarters, and walking with him abroad, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness
of their discourse had unawares drawn them so far out of
the Suburbs, that the Avant Coureurs of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>'s
Army mist very little of surprizing them both, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of making an end of the War, almost as soon as begun: but
the two Kings notwithstanding being happily retir'd within their
strength, the Skirmish grew hot on both sides, and then it was
that the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Troops signalized themselves. For

the presence of the King, who was himself Spectator of the Fight;
and who, during all which with a constancy far from any shew of
that effeminacy his Enemies had so often laid to his charge, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
gave the whole direction, and continued in the danger till
the end of the Action.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> being frustrated in his Design upon
<hi>Blois,</hi> and baffled before <hi>Tours,</hi> principally through the Duke's
opposition, and that of his Forces, seeing nothing was now to
be effected, resolv'd to retire without attempting any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at that time; upon which retreat hapned the total dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Army: whereas on the contrary, the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non's</hi>
Forces grew still greater in strength, and reputation; who
having lately receiv'd a recruit of fifteen hundred foot, and three
hundred Dragoons,<note place="margin">The Duke re-inforc'd by new Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</note>
the Royal Army receiv'd a greater increase
from those Regiments he had brought over to the service, than
from any other whatsoever. The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had not yet
had leisure to draw his Forces together, they being dispers'd into
several parts, as was most convenient for the preservation of such
places as were in the possession of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party; by which it
may easily be imagin'd, the King could have no very considerable
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63412:67"/>

                  <p>It was at this time that the Duke came up to the King,<note place="margin">The Duke's arrival at the Army, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable reception.</note> by
whom he was receiv'd with all the honour, and kindness he could
expect from his Majesties old Affection to him, now newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
by the important Services he had so lately receiv'd from his

thinking he could sufficiently evidence the esteem he had for him,
endeavour'd (till better times should render him capable of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
acknowledgement) principally to satisfie him concerning all
things that had past during his absence from Court, receiving him
into a degree of greater Privacy, and trust, than he had ever been
in, in his highest pitch of Favour.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, that he might make a grateful return to those infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
testimonies he receiv'd of the King his Masters great affection
to him, sought on his part all occasions to please him in all things;
and knowing very well he could not give him a greater, nor a
more signal satisfaction, than to reconcile himself to the <hi>Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal d'
Aumont,</hi> a man very acceptable to, and in great esteem
with his Majesty, but who had long been upon ill terms with the
Duke; he went one day franckly to his Lodging, and without
regarding the formalities usual in such Accommodations, there
made him offers of Reconciliation, and Friendship; the greatest
violence imaginable to his own nature, of it self not easie to be
reconciled (an humour in which he has ever since persisted, but
too obstinately for the advantage of his own Affairs) but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

whose great Interest it was, that those few Servants, who
continued about his Person, and were faithful to him, should
live in perfect intelligence with one another. The Duke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having embrac'd the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> told him, <q>That he was
come with all freedom, and candour, to desire his Friendship,
as also to make him a tender of his; that the evil intelligence
they had so long liv'd in could not but be prejudicial to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

That there had no o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ense past betwixt them, wherein
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63412:68"/>
their Honours could be any ways concern'd; that if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he had entertain'd some little discontents, he desir'd
him to forget them; as for his part, and that sincerely, he would
blot out all memory of his.</q> The <hi>Mareschal,</hi> overcome by this
generous, and unexpected freedom, as readily met the Duke in
his courtesie, like a true <hi>Frenchman,</hi> laying open his bosom to the
reconciliation with more sincerity, and affection than ever:
Whereupon they both of them went immediately to the King,
who was not a little pleas'd at an Accommodation so important
to his Service; and having been particularly inform'd of the
Duke's manner of proceeding, gave it the favourable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
due to so noble an Action; so that still more, and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
the esteem, and kindness he had for him, he made it so
highly,<note place="margin">He enters into higher favour than ever.</note> and so publickly appear, as gave <hi>D'Avila</hi> occasion to say,
he was re-establish'd in the highest degree of Favour he had ever
been, as it was effectually true, whatever <hi>D' Aubigné</hi> is pleas'd to
write to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The same <hi>D' Aubigné,</hi> a man very perfect in calumny, and
with which he continually bespatters all the King's Actions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the truth known and receiv'd by all the world, says fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That they had much ado to prevail with the King to march
his Army out of <hi>Tours</hi> towards <hi>Paris;</hi> that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>
was forc'd to use all manner of perswasion, and even a certain
kind of violence to bring him to it: but besides that all our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
are contrary to him in this, the King was observ'd after
the death of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> to be so vigorous in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">The King's generous Resolution.</note>
that at Court they would ordinarily say, he had now re-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
that Lions Courage, he had for some years supprest. His
whole discourse was nothing, but of reigning with Authority,
and of chastising such as would not acknowledge him in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
which his actions likewise confirm'd. In the attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Suburbs of <hi>Tours, Mounsieur de Thou</hi> (as being continually
with the King, and particularly all that day) gives this testimony,
That although in this occasion, which was very hot, his Majesty
was surpriz'd in his Doublet only, he nevertheless gave orders
with so much assurance, and gave so evident proofs of Valour and
Constancy in so great a danger, that the whole Army took it for
a happy <hi>Omen,</hi> and every man by his Example fortified himself
with Courage and Resolution. In fine (whatever men may say
of this Prince) 'tis most certain, that a Martial Disposition go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
in him, as he had sufficiently made it appear in his Youth,
when he was meerly led by his own natural inclination: but it
is likewise true, that being come to the Crown, and having learn'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63412:68"/>
by the miseries of War, that Peace is the greatest good with which
a Prince can gratifie his people; he endeavour'd by all means
(and doubtless too industriously) to establish that happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his Kingdom. To this end were all his Politicks (which
as I have said) he made his ordinary, and regular study directed:
but at last incens'd at the ill success of so good a Design, he abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
resolv'd upon the taking Arms, never to lay them down, till
he had re-establish'd his Authority, and that in the highest degree
any of his Predecessors had ever done.</p>
                  <p>With this resolution then he departed from <hi>Tours</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>May,</hi> 1589.<note place="margin">The King marches from <hi>Tours</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </note> The first Town upon his way that stood for
the League was <hi>Gergeau,</hi> and this little Town had the confidence
to shut their Gates against the Royal Army: So much were mens
minds infatuated with zeal to their Faction. The Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
was order'd to go before to block up this place, and to cast up
the first earth against it, which he accordingly did; and the whole
Army being a few days after come up to the Siege, the King of
<hi>Navarre</hi> advanc'd as far as the Trenches, to see what progress they
had made: A Prince whose Valour and Bravery were so general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, as that his Reputation was universally receiv'd, and
establish'd in the opinion of all: But the Duke, who till this
time had never had the honour to be near him in any occasion of
this kind, would now let him see that he also was no Novice in
matters of Warre: 'Tis true, he might have chosen a fitter oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of giving the King a testimony of his own Valour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exposing his Person to so great a danger; but the heat of
Youth transported him: and I have heard him discoursing of
this Action, and (alwayes accusing his own indiscretion) magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to the highest degree, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s courage, which
appear'd in great lustre upon this occasion. <hi>D' Aubigné,</hi> who was
himself then present, gives this Relation of it; and I shall make
use of his own words, being in this case not much to be suspected,
since every body knows he was never very partial to the Duke.
<q>
                        <hi>The King of</hi> Navarre (says he) <hi>being gone to visit the Duke of</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon's <hi>Trenches, the Duke shewing him-what he had done, leads
him through the middle of the space betwixt the Trenches, and the
Town, in his Doublet only, and that so unconcern'd, and so open to
the Enemies view, that</hi> Houeilles <hi>the Duke's Cousin, and Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Master,
as also another of his people fell dead at their feet; when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gain'd a Guard commanded by</hi> Belangreuille, <hi>they came out on
the back side of that, and pass'd within forty paces of the Courtine
which play'd upon them all the while, and laid two men more dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place. The King of</hi> Navarre, <hi>and the Duke having at last
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63412:69"/>
gain'd the blind of a Garden Door.</hi> Frontenack, <hi>and another (which
other must be</hi> D' Aubigné <hi>himself, who was Gentleman of the Horse
to the King of</hi> Navarre) <hi>earnestly solicited the Duke to retire, which
he was about to do by a way, perhaps likely to engage them in more
danger than before, when the King of</hi> Navarre <hi>staid him by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of his Doublet.</hi>
                     </q> This is that he says: but he adds after a
thing wherein he is not so good a testimony, as of the first, and
which is not so true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the King being enform'd of this
Action, spoke highly against the Duke, and in terms that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
tasted of Favour, and that so soon as he saw him, he severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reprehended him, and reproach'd him, that he would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
his Brother. 'Tis true that his Majesty chid the Duke for
his rashness, telling him, <hi>That he ought to reserve his Valour for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
occasions, and not so lightly to expose the Person of the King of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre <hi>his Brother, and his own;</hi> which were rather words of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
than distaste; and it is likewise very true, that the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Servants murmur'd highly at it, endeavouring to
possess the King, that the Duke had not engag'd him in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
without Design: nay himself manifested something at his
coming out of the Trenches; for it was told the Duke that he
should say to some of his people,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s first aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the Duke of Espernon.</note> 
                     <hi>I think this man would be content
to lose an Arm, to have my Brains beaten out;</hi> which was never the
Duke's intention, he being only spurr'd on by the inconsiderate
heat of Youth and Bravery, without any other Design.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Gergeau</hi> the Army advanc'd towyrds <hi>Piviers,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
open'd its Gates, as also the City of <hi>Chartres</hi> surrendred

being foon after taken by Assault, some of the King of <hi>Navarre's</hi>
Souldiers ran on in their prevailing Fury even to the Church of
that Town, there committing all sorts of insolence; which the
Duke being advertis'd of, by the Guards he had plac'd at the
Doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of this Church (wisely foreseeing that the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>'s
people, who for the greater part were men of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Religion, would not abstain from violation even of Holy
things) he ran thither himself to prevent further disorder; where
being come, and seeing the Chalices, and other Sacred Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Altars in the hands of the rude Souldier, not being
able to endure that things, dedicated to so Sacred Use, should be
profan'd after that manner, he furiously drew his Sword, and ran
the first Offender in his way quite through the Body; which by
chance hapning to be one of the Dragoons of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>'s
own Guard, and in his own Livery, the Complaint was
immediately carried to him, and by him as soon to the King; of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63412:69"/>
which the Duke having also notice, he presently repair'd to his
Majesties Quarter, to make his defense. There being come, and
his Majesty having demanded of him the reason for what he had
done, he gave him a particular accompt of the whole business:
Whereupon the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> told him with some bitterness,
<hi>That he had no Authority over his Souldiers, and less over his Domesticks;</hi>
to which the Duke made answer with a respective, but a manly
boldness, <q>That the trust wherewith the King was pleas'd to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him, and the command he had given him in the Army,
invested him with sufficient Authority to chastise Impious, and
Sacrilegious Persons; and that moreover every good man
ought to assume that Authority in Offenses of so high a Nature.</q>
Their Dispute was like to grow into hotter terms, when the
King impos'd silence both upon the one, and the other, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the Duke's action nevertheless; but desiring the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi> to take care for the future, that there might be no more
offenses committed of that kind.<note place="margin">Encrease at the Siege of <hi>Estampes:</hi>
                     </note> Thus by little and little secret
discontents against the Duke crept into the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s
bosom, which many, envious of the Duke's greatness, endeavour'd
to augment: neither was the Duke blind on that side, nor was it
without some affliction that he saw himself so ill requited for
the sincere and uninteressed affection he had ever manifested for
this Princes Service in his greatest adversity: but having found
by sufficient experience, that the best Offices are not always the
best recorded, he contented himself with the conscience of his
own integrity, and ever paying the respect due to the Birth, and
Vertues of this excellent Prince, in all other concerns of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

in it self criminal, if not excus'd by the violence of their
Affections, gave the Caitiffe an hundred Wounds; whereby in a
moment he vomited out a life, that ought not to have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
till after the horror of a thousand torments.</p>
                  <p>The King, feeling himself Wounded, commanded the Duke of
<hi>Espernon</hi> to be immediately sent for, who was then at the Post
nearest to the City, putting some Troops in order, which were to
fall into the Suburbs of <hi>Paris;</hi> but at this sad and unexpected
news he ran in great confusion to the King's Lodging, whom he
yet found in the same posture wherein he had receiv'd his hurt,
with his hand still upon the Wound: At which sight, the Duke
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63412:70"/>
bursting out in tears, as fearing a sinister event, his Majesty gave
him comfort, by telling him he hop'd the Wound would not
prove Mortal; and saying to him further these very words, <hi>Thou
seest here (my Friend) the effects of my Enemies Treachery and Malice;
but I hope God will shortly enable me to bring them to condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
To which the Duke returning no other answer, than his
tears, they laid his Majesty upon a bed, and search'd his Wound;
which the Chirurgeons at the first dressing, apprehended not to
be so dangerous, as it was; so that all that day was past over in
this error: but that night, and the morning following, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of his Wound encreasing, and at last growing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme,
it was then judg'd that his bowels were pierced, and that
Death must necessarily, and in a few hours ensue. The King of
<hi>Navarre</hi> had hasted with all diligence, at the first bruit of this
accident, and being come to his bedside, his Majesty said to him
almost the same things, he had said before to the Duke; and talk'd
of nothing the first day, save of the exemplary punishment he
would inflict upon his Enemies: but his Wound being at last
judg'd to be mortal, and feeling in himself that he drew near his
end, all his discourse of Punishment, and Revenge, was turn'd
into that of Pardon and Oblivion: and certainly no Prince ever
made a more Christian, or a more constant end. He declar'd
upon his death-bed the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> nearest of his Blood, and
and consequently right Heir to the Crown, provided he were a
Catholick; exhorting him at the same time to abjure his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to reconcile himself to the Holy Church, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewise the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> (whom he held by the hand)
to serve him upon that condition; after which, and a Pious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of himself, he gave up his last breath in the middle of
his victorious Army.</p>
                  <p>We are now entring upon a new Reign, and one the Duke
found very different, from that wherein he had hitherto liv'd;
for he now not only saw himself stript of all kind of Favour:
but he further saw the envy, and hatred of the whole Court di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
against him. He was now no more call'd to Council, nor
any longer entrusted with his Princes secrets; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
every one labour'd to diminish that greatness, to which his
own Vertue, and his Masters Royal bounty had already rais'd
him. But we shall see how he overcame all these difficulties: and
the Justice of this new Prince at last giving the Merits and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this vertuous man their due, we shall see him not only
support him in his own present Fortune, but also encrease it by
his daily bounty, and so establish it in him, as to empower him to
settle it in his own Posterity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:63412:71"/>
So soon as the King was dead, all the Roman Catholicks of
quality in the Army assembled themselves together, to advise
what in this occurrence was to be done for the maintenance of
the Catholick Religion in the Service of this new King: And
here their opinions were split into three several Councils;<note place="margin">Several Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the new King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Chiefs of the Army.</note> for
some there were who thought it fit absolutely to acknowledge the
King without condition, or reservation, but those were very
few: Others there were who would absolutely abandon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and joyn with the League; and those were fewer than the
first: But the third proposition, and that which was concluded
on by the most principal, and prudent Lords of the Army;
amongst which were the Dukes of <hi>Longueville,</hi> of <hi>Nevers,</hi> of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon,</hi>
and of <hi>Luxembourg;</hi> the <hi>Mareschals de Biron,</hi> and <hi>d' Aumont,</hi>

                        </gap>illet,</hi> and many others, was to serve
the King, and to tye themselves wholly to his Fortune, provided
his Majesty would please to give them some gracious assurance of
his speedy Conversion.<note place="margin">The Lords Catholick send his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty their Resolution.</note> Which being deliver'd to his Majesty as
their determinate Resolution, and the condition prescrib'd as it
were, by the King his Predecessor, he wisely chose such a mean as
seem'd necessary to him in this occasion, for the establishment of
the uncertain state of his Affairs; and would by all means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that moderation, and indifferency betwixt both parties, as
should by an equal hope in them both, keep both his Catholick
and <hi>Hugonot</hi> Subjects within the bounds of their duty. His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
therefore was,<note place="margin">His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note>
                     <q>That it would appear to all the world very
easie, and unhandsome in him to change his Religion, only to
satisfie his Subjects humour, and to receive a Law from them in
a thing, which in its self, of all other, ought to be most free:
That he desir'd to be instructed, and satisfied in his Conscience
before he proceeded so far, as to change his Religion: That to
this purpose he promis'd within six months to call an Assembly
of men of known Piety and Learning, and if occasion were,
a National Synod, to whose final Decree he would absolutely
submit, and that in the mean time he would be careful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
and maintain the Catholick Religion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After divers Messages of Treaty sent to,<note place="margin">The major part of the Catholick Lords sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the King.</note> and fro, on either part,
it at last ended in this, that many of the Catholick Lords submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to his Majesties first Proposition; what he had then promis'd
by word of mouth, was now only more formally drawn into a
writing interchangeably deliver'd betwixt the King, and his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Subjects, and Sign'd by the greatest part of Men of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that were then in the Army: But the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
this delay of six months propos'd by the King, to be no
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63412:71"/>
delay, intended only to win longer time, and that at last their
hopes, and expectations would be deluded, demanded some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

could he, notwithstanding the importunities of all the
Friends he had, be drawn upon other terms to seal to that Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
And this was the true, and only reason of his refusal, and
not what both <hi>Mounsieur de Thou,</hi> and <hi>D'Avila</hi> have reported of
it. They say that the thing which made him refuse to seal to that
Instrument, was a contest which hapned betwixt him, and the
<hi>Mareschals de Biron,</hi> and <hi>d' Aumont,</hi> who should sign first; these
as <hi>Mareschals</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and in immediate command in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
pretending a priority; and he claiming a precedence as Duke,
and Peer: a difficulty that might easily have been overcome, had
that been all. But the cause proceeded from a principle of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
moment, than the trivial contest of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>light Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>The King however caus'd him by several hands to be over and
over again solicited, and importun'd, to satisfie himself as other
good Catholicks had done; and as the Dukes were the best, and
the fullest Regiments of the Army, and as his person, and his
example (which were likely to be follow'd (as they afterwards
were) not only by those under his own command, but by many
others of good quality in the Army) altogether render'd him very
considerable: So did his Majesty by all sorts of perswasions and
promises, endeavour to detain him;<note place="margin">The Duke obstinate to leave the Army.</note> but all to no purpose. 'Tis
true, he acknowledg'd the King for lawful Successour to the
Crown, as he had sufficiently declar'd in a time when the greatest
persecutions were practis'd against him, and when he was only
King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> by which he had in part drawn the hatred of
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> upon him. And it is also true, that he had all
the reason in the world to desire that Prince should now become
his Master, whom he had all his life labour'd to raise to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to which he was now arriv'd: But he thought the Ruine of
the Catholick Religion inevitable, should things continue in the
posture they were now in; which made him rather choose to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himself to all those disgraces he knew his Enemies were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for him, than to serve his own interests (whose advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he likewise saw infallible in so favourable a juncture) to the
reproach, and prejudice of his own Conscience.</p>
                  <p>Fortified therefore still more and more in this resolution, he
caus'd his Troops to be made ready for his departure: these, at
his first coming to the King consisted of six thousand Foot, and
twelve hundred Horse; which though they were now much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish'd
in the Service, yet were they notwithstanding in such a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63412:72"/>
condition, as that there were hardly so many more <hi>French</hi> in the
whole Army, as he had under his sole command. The Marquis
<hi>de Rocquelaure,</hi> and other of his intimate friends labour'd by all
imaginable means, to disswade him from his ill taken up resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but not being able to prevail, his Enemies would have
perswaded the King,<note place="margin">The K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ng perswaded to cause the Duke to be stab'd.</note> to have met his obstinacy with a Stab, a
Counsel the Duke was as soon enform'd of. But whether it was,
that he thought this generous Prince, not to be perswaded into
so foul an action; or that he thought it at that time a thing not
easie to be executed, he had the assurance, notwithstanding the
caution had been given him, to go take his leave of the King,
before he left the Army, and to excuse his departure: A Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that was pass'd over in few words; and I have often heard
him repeat the manner of it to be thus.<note place="margin">The Duke goes to take his leave of the King.</note> The Duke took along
with him thirty Gentlemen of his Train, in whom he repos'd the
greatest confidence, and of these he left some at the Doors of the
King's Lodgings, and others upon the Stairs, to facilitate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,
if any foul play should be offer'd to him; and himself
with only two more in his company enter'd the Gallery. The last
Journey he made to <hi>Paris,</hi> he hapned to lie in the same house, and
shew'd ús the place where he took his leave of the King. This
house did at that time belong to <hi>Mademoiselle du Tillet,</hi> his old, and
intimate Friend; a Lady illustrious for her courage and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and passionate for the Duke's Interests to that degree, that he
has had few friends who have justified their affection by so great,
and so continued a fidelity. The King was at the one end of the
Gallery, when the Duke appear'd entring at the other; whom
the King no sooner perceiv'd, but that coming up to him, with
an angry countenance, and striking his stick with some vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
upon the floor,<note place="margin">The King's angry Speech to the Duke.</note> he said. <hi>What</hi> Mounsieur d' Espernon, <hi>it
seems you have refus'd to Sign the Writing, which has been Sign'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty by most persons of Quality in my Army, as good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
as your self! do not you, as well as they, acknowledge me for your
King?</hi> To which the Duke made answer, <q>That he was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
most humble Subject, and Servant; That there was not
a person in his Kingdom, who had more ardently desir'd to
see him in the place where he now was, should the King his
Master die, than himself had done; That he would never do
anything contrary to his Service; that he had rather die, than
once to entertain so dishonest a thought: but that he did humbly
beseech his Majesty to excuse him, if being of a Religion dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from that his Majesty profess'd, he could not attend his
person; that being a thing he could not do, without offering the
greatest violence to his own Conscience.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:63412:72"/>
The Duke had scarce made an end of speaking, when he heard
a noise of armed men behind him in the Gallery; and then it
was that he certainly believ'd, these were the men appointed to
kill him, as he had been pre-advis'd: but he was soon deliver'd
out of that fear, when he saw the King move forward with a
smiling countenance to embrace them. These were two Captains
of the King's Light Horse; the one call'd <hi>le Baron de Sainte Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
du Mont, a Norman;</hi> the others name I have forgot: who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
upon their Guard (which was at a good distance) receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> III. were come in all haste to
congratulate the King with his new Advancement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lighted
at the Door of his Lodging, were come up in the same posture
the news had surpriz'd them in upon their Guard to present their
Duty: The Duke taking this occasion to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etire, withdrew himself
forthwith to his own Quarter; but before he would absolutely
depart, he would first attend the Corps of the King his Master,
and Benefactor, as far as <hi>Compeigne,</hi> whither they were carried
with very little Ceremony, the disorders of the time not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
greater; and where having paid his last duty, he return'd to
overtake his Troops, which were now marching upon the Road
of <hi>Loches</hi> towards <hi>Angoumois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The example of the Duke's departure was followed by many
others, so that in a few days the Army was grown so thin, that
the King had scarce any save strangers left in his Camp, and
even they in the end, for want of pay, disbanded as well as the rest;
and then it was that the Duke's Enemies, with a redoubled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
spoke loudest in his disgrace, and did all they possibly could
to animate his Majesty in the highest degree against him. There
had already pass'd (as you have heard) some secret discontents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the King, and the Duke, during the life of the late King;
amongst which the business of <hi>Gergeau,</hi> and that of <hi>Estampes</hi> had
made no little noise; but to these many have added, and likewise
some endeavour'd to possess the King, that the Duke ever impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of a Rival in his Master's Favour, and less able to endure
his Majesty who was so much above him, had in that time done
all the ill offices he could invent to beget a mis-understanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the King, and him, such as might cause a separation; and
certainly so effectually had they labour'd with him, as to make him
believe too much; by which they had so incens'd his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
mind against him, that doubtless he would have bent his
whole endeavour to the Duke's Ruine, upon the late refusal he
had made of his assistance, had not the necessity of his own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
diverted his designs another way: but all these evil dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63412:73"/>
though they still threatned worse consequences, could not
hinder the Duke from persevering in his resolution to retire.</p>
                  <p>As his departure was of infinite importance, whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it as to the Fortune of the King, and Interest of the State;
or as to the Duke's own particular concern, and that there are few
Historians of that, or later times, who have not taken occasion to
blame the Dukes proceeding herein: I think it fit to say something
here in his vindication, and to discover the reasons upon which
he built that resolution; which having receiv'd from his own
mouth in the same terms that I shall faithfully deliver here, every
one may afterwards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> what judgment of the Action he shall
in his own discretion think most fit. He told me that a little before
his departure,<note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances of the Duke's Friends to perswade him to stay.</note> many of his intimate friends had endeavour'd to
disswade him from his Design, by presenting before him the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
juncture of Affairs, so favourable (as they said) to the support
of his immediate condition (so generally envy'd by all) that he
could not himself have wish'd a more advantageous conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture:
That as it was principally by his means, and assistance the
King could build any probable hopes of effecting what he desir'd;
so were there present no advan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ages (besides an indempnity, and
oblivion of all pass'd unkindnesses, a thing in it self highly to be
consider'd) to which he might not reasonably pretend: That he
might now establish his own greatness in so sure a condition, that
it would be no hard matter to maintain himself for the future in
the same height, should the Kings humour chance to come about:
That all men plainly saw how much upon his departure, or stay,
depended the standing, or dissolution of the Royal Army: That
upon his concurrence with his Majesty, depended that of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of the Catholicks, and the Ruine of the League, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were his most capital Enemies: That by his assistance men
might yet promise to themselves the reducing of <hi>Paris,</hi> and in
that the peace and settlement of the whole Kingdom: That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in his hands the disposition of things of so great utility to
the publick, and so great honour to himself, he neither ought to
envy his Country those advantages, not to deprive himself of the
glory of so admirable a success.</p>
                  <p>These were considerations that in their own weight, and laid
home to him by men he knew to be his Friends, were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
to prevail, and to have overcome his ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>inacy, as doubtless
they had done, had the Duke look'd no further, than his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
and so he told his Friends, who had so freely argu'd with
him: <q>He told them that he was not so little acquainted with
the business of the world, that he did not well enough discern
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63412:73"/>
all those advantages they had propos'd, as relating to himself:
That he did very well believe his Majesty, assisted by his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Subjects, might reduce his Enemies to the point he desir'd;
but that from thence would infallibly ensue the subversion of
the Catholick Religion, which would likewise bring on the
ruine of the State: That instead of the Peace they propos'd to
themselves, after the League were reduc'd to their obedience,
they would see themselves engag'd in a more violent, and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
War than before: That those of the Reform'd Religion being
grown more strong, and having a lawful, mighty, and active
King to head them, would doubtless establish their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in <hi>France,</hi> and constrain the Catholicks to submit to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Law they would impose upon them: That it was far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
betimes to refuse to countenance the evil, which lay conceal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
under the apparence of a present good, than to engage himself
in mischiefs of so inevitable consequence, and to forbear a while
the fruits of a specious, and alluring Peace, to enjoy it at better
leisure, more permanent and secure: That the King, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
soever he had made, and what real dispositions soever he
might have to cause himself to be satisfied within six months,
had nevertheless been prompted by those of his own perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to demand that respite for no other end, than to keep the
Catholick Forces about him, that he might make himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>Paris:</hi> That having done that, which must necessarily
put an end to the War, and being wholly possest by creatures
passionate for their ill receiv'd and new opinions, he would
certainly be continued in his Error by their restless practice:
That there was a necessity of a prompt, and sincere Conversion;
not such an one, as was to be hop'd for no man knew when,
and that then perhaps would be luke-warm, and unsound:
That whensoever that should come to pass, they should see him
stake his Fortune, his Friends, and his Life, for a Prince whom
he did ever acknowledge undoubted Successour to the Crown:
That in the mean time he made no doubt but his Enemies (as
they use to do) would lay all the disorders that should happen,
at his door, and hourly incense the King against him with all
the malice, and artifice they could invent; but that he hop'd his
Majesty would himself one day commend his Zeal to Religion,
which ought to be the first thing in every good man's prospect,
and which was also his sole object in that resolution, wherein
he would live and die: That he was retiring into his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where his Actions should justifie the integrity of his
heart, and that he would there serve the King to his utmost
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63412:74"/>
power, by making Warre upon those whom he knew to be
enemies to his Service.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the Duke's Declaration to his private Friends, to
which his Conduct afterwards was so conformable, as sufficiently
demonstrated to all the world, that he was possess'd with a better
spirit, than that of Ambition. 'Tis true, his determination was
in it self positive, and bold; and he had reason in all appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to apprehend a dangerous issue, and has himself ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
that according to the Maxims of humane Prudence,
he herein committed a dangerous error; but that having nothing
but the sole interest of Religion for his aim, he had reap'd greater
advantages by it, than he durst have propos'd to himself from
any other resolution; and that he did believe it was from this
fountain he since deriv'd all the successes of his Life; of which
the most signal was, that his Majesty himself after some time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pierc'd deeper into the candour of his intention, receiv'd him
into as high a degree of Favour, as any of his other Servants:
but it was not until he had first receiv'd many infallible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
proofs of his Loyalty and Affection.</p>
                  <p>Having after this manner deserted the Army, he soon arriv'd
at <hi>Angoulesme;</hi> where the first thing he did after his arrival, was to
send the Pope an accompt of his proceeding, and that he had
been constrain'd to quit the Army, being bound so to do, out of
his respect to the Catholick Religion: It was also requisite he
should by a Declaration purge himself from the Calumnies cast
upon him by the League, who had deliver'd him to the people
for a grand Confederate with the Hereticks: But other particular
correspondencies he had none; for of all Foreign Princes, the
Popes were only they with whom he ever held any intelligence;
and whatever has been said to the contrary, he ever preserv'd his
fidelity unspo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ted from the practices of other Princes, who daily
tempted him with no contemptible offers to an intelligence with
them; a vertue not to be pass'd over in this part of his Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a worthy mention, it being in a time when few of the great

the Kingdom, seeming as it were, to give every one liberty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie

he could make.</p>
                  <p>The Duke having engag'd himself before his retirement from
the Army to serve the King by all the ways he could, would now
sit no longer idle, but gave immediate order for the recruit of his
Troops; and the experience of what had formerly past, having
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63412:74"/>
given him sufficiently to understand what confidence was to be

to such commotions, as his Enemies might attempt to raise
amongst that credulous, and mutinous rabble. He therefore caus'd
a considerable Fortification to be speedily rais'd at the Castle of
<hi>Angoulesme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke fortifies the Castle of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> and the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel of <hi>Xaintes.</hi>
                     </note> the King having given him leave so to do, as also to
raise what mony was necessary to the perfecting that work, upon

<hi>Laurence:</hi> but he had scarce time to settle this good order in his

those very considerable, Affairs, that immediately concern'd the
safety of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>All the Provinces of the Kingdom being divided betwixt the
King, and the League, it was to be expected that the great Cities
would likewise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the one party, or the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as mens passions, or judgments enclin'd

by the <hi>Sieurs de Pompadou, de la Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Biron,</hi> and many other Gentlemen of Quality, favour'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by many of the Inhabitants, labour'd all he could to make the
Town, and City declare for the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
wherein nevertheless he at first met some difficulty: but
proceeding from perswasions to open force, he, by the assistance
of those Gentlemen, made himself Master of the City, and was
upon the point to have made himself also Master of the Town,
when the <hi>Count de la Voute</hi> eldest Son to the Duke of <hi>Ventadour,</hi>
put himself into it, and made all possible resistance to preserve it
out of their hands: Yet had he not (his Party being so much the
weaker) been able long to have held out, had not the Duke of
<hi>Espernon,</hi> advertis'd of this disorder, come in to his timely suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour:<note place="margin">The D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But at the report of the Duke's arrival, the Leaguers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
dispers'd themselves, abandoning the City they already
possess'd, as he afterwards turn'd all suspected persons out of
the Town, and settled it so well by the prudent order he establish'd
there, that it never after started from its duty; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
continued so firm, and maintained it self so well, that it was
almost the only City of the Kingdom which tasted not of those
miseries with which the Civil War by taking, re-taking, plunder,
and other mischiefs, infested all other Cities of <hi>France;</hi> a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that place principally owes to the timely succour it receiv'd

but that, declaring for the League,
constrain'd the Duke to turn his Forces that way to reduce it.
<hi>Puiferrat,</hi> a Gentleman of the Country, commanded there, who
after some vollies of Cannon shot, surrendred upon conditions,
that he, and his Souldiers should have free Quarter, and march
away with Bag, and Baggage; a capitulation notwithstanding
very ill observ'd, to the Duke's great displeasure; who having
appointed the elder <hi>Sobole</hi>'s Troop of Light Horse for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,
without considering their Officer had been kill'd at the Siege,
the Cavaliers, incens'd at the loss of their Captain, reveng'd his
Death upon these miserable people, and cut them almost all to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
A cruelty some Authors have laid to the Duke's charge,
though very unjustly; for had his generous heart been capable of
committing so dishonourable a crime, what advantage could he
have propos'd to himself, from so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And now was the Duke resolv'd to have clear'd all that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
when the disorders of his own Government call'd him
back to look after his own immediate concerns. We have already

day, and further an accompt of the Clemency the Duke
shew'd to those who had treated him after so barbarous a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
of which there yet remain'd some, who (as they were
most zealous for the League, and as they had been most guilty
of that sedition, mistrusting by the Conscience of their own
Crimes, that the Duke could never heartily pardon, and forget
them) chose rather, leaving the security and peace of their own
Houses, to commit their safeties to the guard of their own Arms,
than to rely upon a promise they knew they could not expect in
reason should be observ'd. The <hi>Chavalier d' Aubeterre,</hi> one of the
principal sticklers for the League in that Province, having put
himself in the Head of these Mutineers, and having gather'd
together some other discontented people of the Country, had of
these compos'd a Body of Light Horse, and some Companies of
Foot, with which in this time of the Duke's absence, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a thousand Insolencies: nay, to that confidence were they
grown of their own strength, having committed such Riots,
whilst there was none to oppose them, that they at last shut up
themselves in the Castle of <hi>Villebois,</hi> which they intended should
serve them upon all occasions for a secure retreat; a place indeed
of very advantageous situation, very proper for close Fight, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63412:75"/>
that had all the Avenues unto it of so difficult access, that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
without infinite labour was not to be brought up to force it.
In this place then they thought to remain in great security, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but three Leagues distant from <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> did by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
sallies very much incommodate that City. The Duke
call'd now home by their insolencies, sent them presently a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to Surrender; to which they return'd so haughty, and so
impudent an answer, that he saw he must be forc'd to Besiege
them, as he soon after did: and having, though with infinite
trouble, planted two pieces of Cannon upon the Hill where the
Castle stood, he caus'd them immediately to begin to play. The
besieg'd endur'd above two hundred shot, without shewing any
countenance of fear: but at last seeing a breach made, which
put them out of all hopes long to defend themselves, their inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
was turn'd into apprehension, and astonishment, and their
scornful language into terms of intreaty, and humble supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
submissively b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gging (as the utmost grace they could expect)
that they might be permitted to depart with the assurance of their
lives: to which the Duke would by no means consent, nor receive
them on other terms, than upon discretion; to which, after
many difficulties, which they had good reason to make, they were
in the end constrain'd to submit. Their Commander in Chief,
Lieutenant to the <hi>Chevalier d' Aubeterre,</hi> call'd <hi>Maumont,</hi> knowing
very well, that both by the Law of Arms, and by the terms of
the Capitulation, he was to expect nothing but death, try<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to
escape with the soonest, by causing himself to be let down by
Ropes into the Grasse of the Castle: but being pursu'd, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
he died more honourably than he expected, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
by a Pistol-shot in his head. As for his Complices, the
Duke separated those who had been concern'd in the Conspiracy
of <hi>Angoulesme</hi> from the rest, whom seeing to be men so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their malice, as neither reason could reduce, nor mercy
reclaim, he caus'd eighteen to be hang'd up before the Gates of
the Castle, and pardon'd all the rest. It is but a very little while
ago, that an old man of fourscore and two years old, told me this
story, wherein he himself had been no little concern'd, as being
one of those set apart for the Rope; for having before made one
in the business of <hi>Angoulesme;</hi> but his good fortune reserving him
for one of the last that was to die, and the Marquise <hi>de Mezieres</hi>
who was at that time Mistriss of the Castle of <hi>Villebois,</hi> being then
in the Country, and by some of the poor man's Friends apply'd
to, that she would intercede for him, she had so much time as to
entreat, and obtain his pardon; and this was I think the only
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63412:76"/>
man of those former Offenders, who escap'd that Execution;
neither indeed could such a mercy have been better plac'd, than on
a man who knew so well how to husband his life, when it was
once more his own, as to preserve it almost an age after. This
Castle with the demean and territory belonging to it (one of the
fairest of that Country) was soon after purchas'd by the Duke,
and since advanc'd into a Dutchy, and Peerdom, under the Title
of the Dutchy <hi>de la Valette:</hi> And I have often heard the Duke la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the ruines he was forc'd to make of this Castle, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a delicate Pile of Stone, and very capacious; but never after
wholly repair'd, there still remaining some monuments of the
Rebellion as also of the punishment, those desperate men suffer'd,
who were the Commoters of it.</p>
                  <p>This execution, that would have appear'd more like an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Cruelty, than Justice, had the Crimes of the Offenders
been less, or not repeated, strook such a terror into the rest of
that Party, that they were not now so hasty to appear for a side
they had seen so roughly handled; so that the Duke did now not
only enjoy the repose of his Government, but gave sanctuary to
many of the King's Party of the neighbouring Provinces, who
were overmatch'd, or oppress'd by the League. I have already
told you the occasion that call'd him into <hi>Limousin,</hi> and I shall
now tell you of another of the same nature, and of no less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
though it made not so great a noise in the world, that
call'd him into the Government of <hi>Guyenne.</hi> The <hi>Mareschal de
Matignon,</hi> the King's Lieutenant in that Province, had his hands
so full in, and about <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> that the impossibility of his being
present in all places, where his presence was requir'd, gave oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to <hi>Lussan,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Blaye,</hi> a man enclin'd to the
League, to lend some Gentlemen of that Party some Forces, in
order to the taking of <hi>Bourg;</hi> two little Leagues distant only
from <hi>Blaye.</hi> This Town, though of a very little circuit, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
of very advantageous situation; for besides that it
stands upon an eminence of very difficult access, it absolutely
commands the River of <hi>Dordongne,</hi> as it also at least awes that of
<hi>Garonne,</hi> being not above a quarter of a League from the <hi>Bec
d' Ambez,</hi> where these two Rivers meet to make the <hi>Gironde.</hi> It
must therefore needs be of great advantage to the League to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
this place, by which means <hi>Bordeaux</hi> would be absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of the succour of two so considerable Rivers, by which
the City was continually, and abundantly supply'd. The Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers
therefore, spurr'd on by these considerations, had laid Siege
to <hi>Bourg,</hi> and were by the favour of some of the Inhabitants of

in full liberty to dispose of themselves) from joyning either with
those Factions already form'd by his Enemies, or such as were
now (even by those who had hitherto follow'd his Fortune) form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against him. Nevertheless his Majesty knowing very well,
that the major part of those, who had separated themselves from
him, had done it meerly out of respect to Religion, and that they
would not easily be induc'd to return, unless he first gave them
some hopes, as to that particular; he sent to assure them, that he
desir'd nothing more ardently, than to be instructed in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion, to the end, that with the satisfaction and safety
of his Conscience, he might make open profession of it to all the
world. Upon this assurance of his speedy Conversion (which
notwithstanding was not accomplish'd till some years after) the
Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> with many other persons of Quality, came over
to him;<note place="margin">The D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Majesty having also invited to his Service, and who having only
forsook him at the first out of scruple of Conscience, that being
now overcome by the resolution his Majesty profess'd to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
he made no difficulty to return, and with a Train that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
denoted with what passion he embrac'd his Service;
bringing along with him three thousand five hundred Foot, four
hundred Light Horse, and four hundred Harquebusiers, on horse-back.
With which Forces (which the Duke had rais'd at his
own charge, and by his own credit) his Majesty being very well
recruited,<note place="margin">D'Avila.</note> he resolv'd to make a new attempt upon <hi>Paris</hi> it self, and
to assault it in four places at once: A Design he intended to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
by Ladders, and Petards, and to lead on one of the Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Assault in his own person, in which the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>
was appointed to attend him; and indeed of his men
chiefly consisted that Body his Majesty would in person lead on
to the Assault. A Design which, had not the <hi>Parisians</hi> had timely
information of, had been very likely to have taken effect: but
the preparation of Ladders, and other provisions for the attempt,
being made at St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and other adjacent places, almost in the

sight of <hi>Paris,</hi> the King's Forces no sooner appear'd, than the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risians</hi>
were also found ready upon their Walls, in a resolute po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of defense; which his Majesty perceiving, he retir'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making a fruitless attempt in a Design which could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
but in case of a surprize, succeed: So that this Stratagem
failing, he resolv'd upon the Siege of <hi>Chartres,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Chartres,</hi>
                     </note> which in the end
he took, but not without much difficulty, expense of much

                  <p>The Duke having consider'd that he might now have a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
during this Siege to go to <hi>Boulogne,</hi> of which he had
enjoy'd the Government during his time of Favour, to settle it in
a posture of safety, he entreated leave of his Majesty that he might
undertake that Journey. This place (a Town of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
had hitherto been commanded by the <hi>Sieur de Bernay,</hi>
whom the Duke had formerly plac'd Governour there, and in
whom he had for many years repos'd an intire confidence: but
at last <hi>Bernay,</hi> having by some odd carriage of his, rendre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
suspected to the Duke, he was resolv'd to withdraw him from
that trust: And forasmuch as <hi>Picardy,</hi> in the utmost borders of
which this Town was seated, was very partial to the Leaguers,
who were possess'd of most of the chief Cities of that Province,
the Duke entreated his Majesty,<note place="margin">The Duke goes into <hi>Picardy.</hi>
                     </note> that he might take five hundred
of those Horse he had brought with him to the Service, for his
Convoy in this expedition; a request the King made no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to grant, his Majesty having no great use of Horse in this
Siege: So that departing in this equipage, he perform'd his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
without the least opposition, or shew of an Enemy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
<hi>Bernay</hi> from <hi>Boulogne,</hi> and plac'd the Marquis <hi>de Roüillac,</hi>
his Brother-in-law, in his stead, who serv'd many years after in

had met no body to oppose him, as he went through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
the Duke <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> Governour general for the League in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi>
had nevertheless been meditating how to cut him off in his

of <hi>Montreüille,</hi> into his Design, where betwixt them it
was agreed, that <hi>Mini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Order been as well observ'd, as the Design was well laid, the

within almost Musquet-shot of his Rear, which (the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

trifled withal by his Enemy, commanded <hi>Montestruc</hi> his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to go charge them with forty Horse, himself at the same
time seconded by the <hi>Baron de Chasteliers</hi> (since <hi>Baron d' Ars)</hi> by
<hi>Gohas,</hi> and <hi>Miran</hi> the chief Officers of his Party, giving so brisk
a Charge into the Enemies Body, that they were instantly put to

and his Son, <hi>Conteval</hi> his Lieutenant, and fifteen, or twenty of
the chief Commanders were trodden under foot, and the rest
betook themselves to flight. The Duke, who would not engage
himself too far into a Country where he had no other business,
than to pass through it, thought it not convenient to follow the
pursuit; but contenting himself with those prisoners he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon the place, though they were exceedingly wounded, he
went on his way; but one of his Gentlemen <hi>(Bois Rufier</hi> by
name) being stragled out to discover the Country, fell into the
Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi>'s Ambuscado; who, being carried by those had
taken him before the Duke, was by him examin'd of his quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and who he was for? who answer'd, That he belong'd to the
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> shewing him at the same time the Duke's
Vant-Guard, which began to appear upon a little eminence hard
by. The Duke then further demanded of him, if he had seen
<hi>Minieux?</hi> to which he answer'd, That <hi>Minieux</hi> was the Duke of
<hi>Espernon</hi>'s Prisoner, and withal recounted to him the manner of
his Defeat; which the Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> was no sooner enform'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63412:79"/>
of, but that conceiving it was not convenient, to engage in an
uncertain Fight, where he had promis'd to himself a certain Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
he retyr'd, without once daring to attempt any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Duke, highly condemning and complaining of <hi>Minieux,</hi>
who by his rashness and impatience, had ruin'd so hopeful a
Design.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, having thus rid his hands of his Enemies, went to
put himself into the danger of his Friends; at least those who
ought to have been so, being engag'd in the same Service: but
I dare not here publish all I know of this business, lest I should
revive the memory of an Action, that was then condemn<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d by
the King himself, and that cannot be approved of now. I shall
only tell you,<note place="margin">The Duke's ill usage at <hi>Corbie.</hi>
                     </note> that the Duke having carried his Prisoners into
<hi>Corbie,</hi> they were there peremptorily demanded of him, and upon
his refusal violently taken and detained from him: A dispute that
was on both sides carried on with such heat, as brought the Duke's
Person, who could not with any thought of patience endure so
great an affront, into very great danger: and the odds against him
was so great, that nothing could have been expected, but certain
death, had not the <hi>Sieur de Humierres</hi> the King's Lieutenant in
the place, and the <hi>Sieur de la Boissiere</hi> his Brother-in-law inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
hinder'd the violence was preparing against him, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated
an Accommodation; which, though it could not oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the memory of the offense, kept matters notwithstanding
from proceeding to the last Extreams.</p>
                  <p>Neither was this the last danger the Duke escap'd in his return:
for as he proceeded on his way to <hi>Chartres,</hi> where the Siege still
continued, he heard the Marquis <hi>d' O</hi> his old friend was very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
at the Siege of <hi>Pierre Fonds,</hi> which he had undertaken; whom
the Duke going to visit, he was by him entreated to stay there a
few days, and by his Authority, and those Forces he had then
with him, to help him to bring his Enterprize to an honourable
issue; which the Duke as franckly consented to, and went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
into the Trenches, to take a view of the order of the
Siege: where presenting himself with his usual bravery to open
view of the Enemy, and without other Arms, than his Corsset
only,<note place="margin">The Duke shot into the mouth at <hi>Pierre Fonds.</hi>
                     </note> he receiv'd a Harquebuss-shot in his mouth, that passing
through one of his cheeks, shatter'd his right jaw, and coming
out at his chin, flatted upon his Gorget: A shot that every one
believ'd had certainly dispatch'd him. But being carried to his
Lodging, and his Wound search'd, it was found to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
dangerous; and in a few days he was in a condition to
mount on horse-back.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:63412:79"/>
After all these good and evil adventures, the Duke being at last
arriv'd at <hi>Chartres,</hi> he went presently to give the King an accompt
of his Voyage,<note place="margin">The Duke returns to the King.</note> not forgetting to make his complaint of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
done him at <hi>Corbie,</hi> withal humbly entreating his Majesty
would be pleas'd to do him Justice; which the King had in part
already done, having order'd his prisoners immediately to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd:
but their Wounds were such, that they all dy'd of them,
soon after they were left at <hi>Corbie;</hi> so that they who had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the injury not long surviving, the Duke's Quarrel was at an
end, and all thoughts of revenge were soon extinct, and for ever
buried in oblivion.</p>
                  <p>The Siege of <hi>Chartres</hi> continued yet some time after the Duke's
return, which <hi>la Bourdaisiere,</hi> Governour there for the League, had
so bravely defended, as often made the King to repent that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
having lost before it the <hi>Sieur de Chastillon,</hi> eighteen Camp-Masters,
and, as may well be imagin'd from thence, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of common Souldiers: Neither did those Forces the Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi> had left with the King scape better than the rest, the
King (willing to husband the lives of his own Servants in whom
he yet repos'd a greater trust, than in the Duke) continually expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them to the greatest danger. Of these <hi>Beaujeu, Mascaron,</hi>
and <hi>Blumet,</hi> three Colonels were there slain, and also many other
Officers; by whose valour, amongst the rest (who perhaps had
better fortune) the place was at last (notwithstanding their nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
resistance) reduc'd to the necessity of a surrender. From thence
his Majesty pass'd over into <hi>Picardy,</hi>

it being necessary to dispose the Army into several Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

wherein, 'tis true, he had made the Duke his Heir; but with so
little advantage to him, that the very particulars of the Will, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the value of his Estate. He had given great Legacies to all
his Friends, and to all his Servants, of which he had not omitted
one, who was not very liberally rewarded. He had moreover
given many pious Legacies for publick Buildings, Foundations of
Convents, and Hospitals; and with all this liberality, left so many
Debts behind him, that the Duke was advis'd not to meddle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
the Inheritance, as a thing that would certainly be a burthen to
him: But he, far from embracing an Advice, which, though
prudently enough given, he thought would not be honourable for
him to follow, could not think his Brothers intention sufficiently
fulfill'd, if he did not add something of his own to his Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:
A Resolution he so peremptorily executed, that all those
who were mentioned in the Will were satisfied, before the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's

                  <p>Having thus settled this business, whilst his Friends were busie
levying such Forces, as he intended to lead into <hi>Provence,</hi> he had
now nothing left to do, but to begin his Journey, except to take

breach than was nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

To whom the Duke sent word, There was now no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation
to be granted to them, that they had lost that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and that he would not receive them upon other terms,
than upon surrender to mercy; that they were best therefore to
deliberate, whether they would run the fortune of an Assault, or
presently submit to that Condition, it being the only, and final Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
they were to expect.</p>
                  <p>Whilst these matters were in agitation, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who
had engag'd these men in this desperate place, and knew, as well
as any, the danger they were in, was advancing with three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and five hundred Light Horse to relieve them; which
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was no sooner enform'd of, but that leaving
a sufficient Force to maintain the Siege, he went out to meet him,
and bravely offer'd him Battel: But the <hi>Savoyard,</hi> not daring to run
so great a hazard, retir'd without any further attempt; so that the
Besieg'd, being out of all hopes of Relief, were forc'd to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
to the Duke's discretion, where their Insolence, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
receiv'd their due reward, and that in as high a degree,
and with the greatest rigour, the Law of Arms does permit:
whereby they were made miserable examples of the greatest cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.

severity that ought not to have been practis'd, upon our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But the Duke would by this give the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that he, having violated the publick Faith, and his
League with the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> as he had done, he would have
no fair Quarter with him, nor use him otherwise than as a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Enemy to the Crown, and Kingdom.</p>

                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:63412:85"/>
After this Action, the Duke conceiving himself no less ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to protect his Majesties good Subjects, than to suppress his
Enemies; his first care was to secure the Officers of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Provence</hi> (such as had declar'd for the King from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and had retir'd themselves from <hi>Aix</hi> (the seat of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
from the time the City had revolted to the Duke of <hi>Savoy)</hi>
in some place of safety: For this purpose he could find no place
so fit for strength, and conveniency as <hi>Manosque,</hi> where he seated
them in great security, and honour. And that the time might
not pass away without some shew of Action, whilst the season
would not give him leave smartly to follow the War; he in this
dead time of the year, with a strong party of Horse scour'd the
Country all over the whole Province. Neither was this an unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or an unprofitable diligence, by which he confirm'd those
Cities, already declar'd for the King, in their duty; and also fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
those inclining to a Revolt into better Resolutions: But the
greatest advantage he reap'd by it was, that by this means, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
himself, upon the particular places themselves, of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
estate of the whole Province; and moreover, kept his men
in action, like a Captain that very well understood Order and
Discipline to be the only things, that establish, and support an
Army, and the pest of great Bodies to be sloath and liberty,
which debauch Souldiers from their Duty, and have often been
observ'd to dissolve, and disperse the greatest Armies, when the
Souldier has been suffer'd to enrich himself by idleness, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
upon the plunder of his Quarters. He therefore provided
for the subsistence of his men, by imposing Contributions upon
the Province, which nevertheless was not done without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and consent of the Officers of Parliament; by whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as well as his own, he order'd a certain rate of all things
in the Markets, and that at so indifferent a price, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
found a greater convenience in the Quartering of Souldiers,
than in being without; so quick a return they had for their Corn,
and other Provisions, and so certain was their pay. To this the
Assessments, design'd to defray these Provisions, were so equally
laid upon the whole Country, that no man could complain he
was opprest: nor was there any who did not find his advantage
in this necessary evil. In fine, all things were settled so much to
the general conveniency, and satisfaction of all, that I have an
hundred times heard the Duke wish for such an establishment in
<hi>Guienne:</hi> but the contagion was there already spread too far, and
had taken too deep root, to admit so happy a reformation. By
this prudent disposition of things, the Souldier found himself
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63412:85"/>
provided of his share of all things necessary where ever he came,
according to the order prescrib'd: Neither was he to exact more
upon pain of death; a penalty that without mercy follow'd the
offense: by which severe Discipline, the King's Party, in those
parts, were in a short time observ'd to be very much encreas'd.</p>
                  <p>The Duke,<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Arles.</hi>
                     </note> solicitous to maintain this Reputation of the Royal
Arms, by some notable enterprize, resolv'd to make an attempt
upon the City of <hi>Arles;</hi> neither did he herein make an ill choice,
it being one of the most considerable places of <hi>Provence,</hi> seated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Banks of <hi>Rosne,</hi> and inhabited by above three hundred
Families of very good quality, who here made their ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence;
besides a vast number of Citizens, and inferiour peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
This City, like all others which are situated upon Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
Rivers, and daily expect to be supply'd with fresh Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
kept very little before-hand in store; which the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well enform'd of, contented himself with shutting up the
River only above, and below, and cutting off the Succours of
the adjacent Countrey, by Quartering several Troops on both
sides the River: by which means, without much trouble, or any
considerable loss in a month, or five weeks time, this strong City
was reduc'd to a necessity of surrender, and to shake hands with
the League, for whom they had hitherto been zealous to the
highest degree.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arles</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note>
They came therefore to a Capitulation, in which
the Duke was content to accept of thirty Hostages for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
good behaviour, and with that caution to ease them of the
burthen of a Garrison; which in truth at that time, before he
was well settled in his Government, he could not well have
spar'd, nor without manifest prejudice to his Majesties, and his
own private Affairs. Nevertheless what good security soever the
Duke thought he had taken to bind them to their Duty, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
made no scruple afterwards, in the Revolt of the Cities
of <hi>Provence,</hi> by their Rebellion to expose the lives of so many
men of Quality, who had generously stak'd their persons for the
good of their fellow Citizens, to the Duke's just indignation;
though he by a clemency much more extraordinary, than the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
he had shew'd at <hi>Montauron,</hi> dismiss'd the Hostages to their
own houses, without so much as putting them to ransome; which
in an occasion of this nature is no usual Favour.</p>
                  <p>After this success, the Duke yet undertook the Siege of <hi>Antibe,</hi>

favour'd with a very good Port; which the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> since
his last taking of it, to assure his possession, had so fortified, and
mann'd, that he thought it impossible to be taken. The Duke of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63412:86"/>
                     <hi>Espernon</hi> notwithstanding presented himself before it, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Sick, and Wounded, brought them in fresh Souldiers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
all things necessary for them; which so continual Succour,
and seasonable Supplies, swell'd the Governour with an opinion,
that the Duke could never force him: Neither was the Duke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
at his confidence, hoping that this security of his would
at one time or another contribute to the success of his Design.
He therefore continued his approaches, and try'd all ways imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to effect his enterprize; when at last his Cannon having bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd
the Curtain in a place not much frequented, he perceiv'd,
that those within kept no guard there; by which he believ'd they
had not observ'd that breach, and immediately resolv'd to make
his advantage of that negligence. To this purpose therefore he
sent a Serjeant to discover the breach, who accordingly having
gone in, and return'd by a hole big enough for a man to pass at

order in the place, that no one so much as thought of repairing
that Breach, and that there was no Guard at all kept there. Upon
this intelligence the Duke resolv'd, that an Assault should the
next morning be made, on that side the Fortress; which, that it
might the better succeed, a general Assault was to be made shew
of, that the Defendants, being every where employ'd, whilst
they were deluded by false Alarms, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the purpose, seconded by an hundred more, and that hundred by
a greater number, might creep up to the Curtain, and slip in at
the Breach; a Design that took effect: In the execution of which,

And here, though by the Law of Arms all things were

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63412:86"/>
in that moderate way he had taken up, after his severity at
<hi>Montauron,</hi> absolutely forbad all unnecessary slaughter, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself with detaining the Governour, and some of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
prisoners. The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had made this place
his chiefest Arsenal, had furnish'd it so well with Artillery, that
the Duke there found thirty brass Pieces, of which fourteen were
Royal Culverines, or Bastards, with great store of Ammunition,
which did him no little service in the prosecution of that War,
against the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> himself.</p>
                  <p>The Gally from <hi>Nice</hi> fail'd not the next night to come accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

considerable for its circuit, and the seat of Parliament establish'd

Inhabitants; but principally for the Port, reputed one of the best

themselves, their Duty, and Allegiance, that after the death of
<hi>Henry</hi> the III. (animated by an indiscreet zeal to Religion, which
was ever the Leaguers Pretense, to abuse the simplicity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
they rather chose to create an Usurper in the person of the

of the <hi>Count de Carces,</hi> and some others of Quality in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who were fierce for the League, they sent a Deputation to

of Parliament, and many other Officers, and in the
name of the people, they made him a voluntary tender of the

in acknowledgment of so free, and unexpected an offer, had

his want of men, sufficient to block up the City. Betwixt

opposite to, and within a Musquet-shot of the old; where the
greatest part of his Infantry were bestow'd with great conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and from whence the Duke could so perfectly discover,
whatever could be practis'd against him by the Enemy, that it
was impossible so to surprize him, but that he would be ever
ready to relieve any of his Quarters with great facility, should any
thing be attempted against them. The Cavalry, that could by no
means subsist in the same place, were dispos'd into several Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,
some nearer, some further off, according as there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of Quarters, of which those under the command of
<hi>Chastelliers, du Passage, de Buous,</hi> and <hi>de Ramefort</hi> were the nearest,
where they wanted no opportunities of signalizing their Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Valour: An order so admirably establish'd, as in time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the City of <hi>Aix,</hi> to such extremities, that they must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have fall'n into the Duke's hands, had not the Inhabitants
declar'd a resolution of submitting themselves to none, but the
King; where notwithstanding the Duke was the only Author of
their submission, as he was of all other advantages the King ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in <hi>Provence,</hi> though still the artifice of his Enemies so
skreen'd his merits from his Majesties observation, that he receiv'd
very little thanks for his labour.</p>
                  <p>The Duke began to build his Fort in <hi>Iune</hi> 1593. The <hi>Count de

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63412:88"/>
where the Inhabitants under his command, back'd by some Foot
Companies belonging to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which yet remain'd
in that Country, were so brisk, as, at the Duke's first sitting down,
by frequent Sallies to disturb his Building;<note place="margin">The En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

back with so great loss, that they were at last content to sit still,
and suffer what they found they were not able to oppose. And
here I find my self upon a Scene of Honour, where the best Pen
might be worthily employ'd: where notwithstanding, should I
make particular mention of all the Skirmishes, Combats, and
brave actions that hapned upon this occasion, I should fall into
the error, which of all others I most pretend to shun, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my Reader with a long, and perhaps a tedious Narrative;
though some of them are of so shining a Reputation, as can, by
no means, be pass'd over in silence.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke therefore was very busie about raising his
Fort, the <hi>Count de Carces,</hi> who would try all possible ways to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that work, sallied out of the Town at broad noon-day with
400 Gentlemen, of which number was the <hi>Count de Suze, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaudun,</hi>
Camp-Mareschal, S. <hi>Marcelin,</hi> and <hi>Reglanette,</hi> with many
more Gentlemen of Quality, who followed by 2000 men, what
of the Inhabitants, and what of the Companies in Garrison, went
with a design to overthrow the Works already begun, and if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to compel the Duke to retire. A Design, that as it was brave
in it self, so was the time wherein it should be executed as prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chosen;<note place="margin">A great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made by the besieged</note> for at so unexpected an hour most part of the Duke's
Souldiers were either sleeping in their Huts, or gone abroad to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
so that the Duke had very few about him: Neither, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
were in such disorder, were the Horse in a greater readiness,
which constrain'd the Duke, who had mounted at the first noise
of the Alarm, being able to get but very few together, with
those few to expose himself to withstand the first fury of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
<hi>Chastelier</hi> (whom we have already begun to call the <hi>Baron
d' Ars)</hi> hearing in his Quarters a noise, and uproar, such as is
usually occasion'd by tumultuous Sallies, with the <hi>Sieur de Buous,</hi>
were the first, who with their Troops came in to the Duke's suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
whom, as soon as come, he commanded to charge the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
whilst himself, who had soon rallied all who were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to fight, following them close at the heels, fell so furiously
into the Body of the Assailants as made all give way before him.
The <hi>Count de Carces,</hi> seeing his men so roughly handled, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to recover an Hospital in the mid-way, betwixt the Fort,
and the City, with an intent there to rally his men, and to make
good the place: but the Duke falling in pell-mell amongst them,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63412:88"/>
forc'd him to continue his flight to the very Graffe of the City,
where many of his men were slain; by which ill success the
Enemy having lost above 400 men, they were for the future bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
advis'd, than to make any more such sallies, and suffer'd the
Duke, in great security, to continue his work under their noses.</p>
                  <p>Whilst every one thought the Duke wholly intent upon this
Design of <hi>Aix,</hi> and that mens minds were suspended in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the event of that enterprize, he conceiv'd there was an
advantage to be made of this general belief, that seem'd to falici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
an attempt upon <hi>Marselles</hi> it self; which, as it was very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
by open force to take any good effect, so was it to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with great prudence, and secresie, to make it succeed:
He therefore gave private Instructions to all such Commanders
as he intended to make use of in this Enterprize, to make ready
3000 chosen Foot, and 400 Light Horse,<note place="margin">An attempt upon <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles.</hi>
                     </note> as also to prepare
three Petards, with which in the beginning of a very dark night,
he silently rose from his Quarters, marching his men the direct
Road to <hi>Marselles.</hi> He had not as yet discover'd his Design to
any, when being advanc'd about half a League on his way, and
thinking it now high time to put his Friends out of suspense, who
knew nothing whither they were to go, he call'd all the Chief
Officers of his Party about him, and in a short Harangue, told
them, <q>That if he had not sooner discover'd his Design unto
them, it was not for any diffidence he had of their fidelity,
which was already sufficiently known unto him; that after the
many testimonies they had, upon all occasions, given him, of
their Worth, and Valour, he had more reason to seek opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
wherein he might manifest his gratitude, than to expect
any further proof from them: but that as secresie was the great
promoter of all Enterprizes of the nature of this, wherein he
now intended to employ them, he would not, should any disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
happen, that the least colour of blame should reflect upon
any of them; but much rather be wholly imputed to Fortune:
but nevertheless all things being so well order'd, as he conceiv'd
they were, there was no doubt to be made of a successful issue:
That he therefore conjur'd them resolutely to undertake an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the greatest advantage to the King, to his Majesties Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and to their own particular benefit, and honour, that
could possibly be propos'd: That every one there knew <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles</hi>
to be one of the most important Cities, whether consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
in the commodity of its Haven, or in its vicinity to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries, in the whole Kingdom: That this City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s promises, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63412:89"/>
together, had already put her self into their protection; and
persisting in her obstinacy, was ready to open her Gates to
Strangers, to receive their Garrisons, and to give away her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to them, after having violated her Faith, and Duty to her
lawful Sovereign: That should strangers once get entire pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of that City, it would be lost for ever, and that there
would be no hopes ever to drive them from so advantageous a
post, what attempts soever could be made, against a place so
strong, and so easie to be reliev'd: That next to the publick
concern he consider'd the reducing of this City as a certain and
firm establishment of his own interest in <hi>Provence;</hi> and that
they themselves ought to look upon it as a pledge, whereby that
fair, and rich Province would be assur'd unto them, and that
would give them an entire authority over the people, who after
so brave an exploit, would no more be able to vie Merit, or
Valour with them, as they had formerly done: That such as
had undertaken Enterprizes of this nature were wont to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
their companions with hopes of Booty; but that for his
part he should take a contrary way: That it was not his intent
to ruine <hi>Provence,</hi> nor the City of <hi>Marselles,</hi> but to preserve both
the one, and the other for the King, to establish himself there
in order to his Majesties Service, and to procure for them other
advantages, and by other means suiting to their great merit,
and the service they had perform'd: That this City once taken
there could be no more fear of wanting provisions for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the conveniency of the Port bringing in all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in great abundance, that the evil-affectedness of the people
would for the future be able to produce nothing to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
they having in their own hands either the Keyes of the
<hi>Province</hi> to let in all necessary Succours, or otherwise the Chains
that would tye them fast to their duty: That above all things
therefore he most earnestly desir'd them to restrain the insolence
of the Souldier, whom notwithstanding he did not thereby
intend to hinder of the benefit they might justly make of the
Inhabitants Estates, which were already forfeited to them by
by their Rebellion, and of which they should soon be possess'd
by the Victory: but that he desir'd they might be fairly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
amongst them, that they might the longer enjoy what they
got, and not lose, and destroy the spoil, as it otfen falls out in
the sack, and plunder of great Cities: That he would not upon
this occasion suggest unto them the remembrance of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
Valour, that he knew by good experience such exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
were altogether unnecessary to them in bold, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63412:89"/>
attempts; and that he only conjur'd them to follow his
example now, as hitherto they had follow'd his Person, and
Fortune.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke, having thus prepar'd his Friends for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
continued on his way; when, being come within sight of
the place, he himself, with those that had charge of the Petards,
advanc'd up to the Gate: Of these the first Petard play'd to as
good effect, as was to be expected, having made a hole in the
Gate wide enough for a man easily to get through; which, though
made wider by the second, yet did not the Gate fall down, being
supported by a great iron Bar behind: The Duke therefore call'd
for the third Petard, but in vain; no Petard being to be heard of,
no more than the man to whose trust it was committed; which
made them try to break the Bar with Axes, that they might have
the passage more free to relieve some of their men, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
got in by the hole of the Gate: But the Inhabitants, rouz'd
at the first noise of the Petards, running to their Arms, made a
stout opposition; where, having but few to deal withal, the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants
were with great ease beaten back, and the Gate as sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Barricado'd up. It is not to be imagin'd how infinitely the
Duke was afflicted at this ill success, and the more, because he
thought he had made himself, as it were, Master of the event by
the prudent conduct of his Design; though he has since thought
himself happy in failing of his purpose (so much should men sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
their own desires in the choice of things that concern the
conduct of their lives) it being to be fear'd, that had the Duke
been establish'd in the power t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have seated him in, and receiv'd those affronts, and that ill usage

sense of those injuries might have prompted him to do things no
ways suiting with his Duty, as we shall see he was soon after tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
to do. I do much wonder that none of our Historians have
so much as mention'd this Enterprize, who have some of them
been very particular about many others of the Duke's of much
less importance; whose omission of this has engag'd me to insist
longer upon it, than otherwise I should have done; that so brave
an Action might not be buried in oblivion: of which the bare
Project could not have been meditated by a mean courage, nor the
Design carried on so far by an ordinary prudence.</p>

                     </note> being retir'd to his Fort very much discontented at
his evil success, would revenge himself of that disgrace by new,
and brisker attempts upon the City of <hi>Aix:</hi> Wherefore having
intelligence that the Inhabitants already began to feel themselves
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63412:90"/>
straightned for want of Victuals, he, to take from them all future
hopes of supply, immediately fell to destroying all the Fruits, and
Corn of the Country round about; and, not content to do them
this mischief without, plai'd so many Cannon-shot into the Town,
that not a man durst appear in the streets, or abide in the upper
rooms of their houses: But the besieg'd, ingenious in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
contriv'd a way to pay him back some of his Balls by a
Counter-battery from the great Tower of the Church of <hi>Nostre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame;</hi>
a Pile of great note, and fame, as well for its exceeding
height, as for the excellency of its Architecture, and Beauty. To
the top therefore of this Tower, they made shift to crane up two
Culverines, and had a Cannoneer so expert, as not only levell'd
them right against the Fort, but even against the Duke's own
Tent within it, where he made the strangest shot, that perhaps
ever flew from such an Engine. This Cannoneer, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of some little Truce (of which there happen many in
such Sieges, either for the carrying off their Dead, or some other
occasion) had, unknown, crept into the Fort, and had there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
observ'd every part of the Duke's Quarter: He had also
discover'd that the Duke every afternoon us'd to play at Cards in
the Parlour of his Tent, and had observ'd so much as the place
where his Chair was constantly set. Having thus inform'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of all these circumstances, he return'd to the City, where,
after he had levell'd his two Guns to his own desire, he was so
confident of his skill, as to offer odds, that in one of two shots
he was about to make, he would either kill the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
or very much endanger his life; when immediately giving
fire, he prov'd in part as good as his word, the shot lighting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
into the place, to which it had been by his eye before direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Duke was at this time playing at <hi>Primero,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke's miraculous escape.</note> and set betwixt
two Gentlemen, one called <hi>le Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

learn, who were both of them beaten to pieces, one over, and
the other under the Duke; who by an incredible vigilancy of
Fortune, being at that instant bow'd down upon the Table, to
draw the money he had newly won upon a rest, escap'd that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
blow; yet though he escap'd death, it was not without two
great wounds, one by a piece of one of the poor Gentlemen's
Bones, that pierc'd deep into his Belly; and the other, by another
piece of a Bone, in his hip; of both which he carried the marks
along with him to his Grave.</p>
                  <p>Those of the Town who were soon aware of the lucky hit
their Cannoneer had made, believing the effect of it to be greater,
than indeed it was, would not let slip an opportunity, wherein
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63412:90"/>
they conceiv'd something might be executed to their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
wherefore they immediately sent out St. <hi>Romans,</hi> one of
their <hi>Mareschals de Camp,</hi> with an hundred and fifty Light Horse
at one Gate,<note place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Aix,</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the Duke slain, make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other sally.</note> and <hi>Bezaudun</hi> with the like number at another, to try,
if in the confusion they heard in the Fort something might not
be attempted with success, who, had they found a fit advantage,
were to have been seconded by the entire Forces of the City; but
the Duke, notwithstanding the pain of his Wounds, omitting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his usual care, was no sooner taken up from the ground,
where the sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> had beaten him down, than he commanded every
one to stand to his Arms; by which means the Enemy, whose
design it was to have come upon the Surprize, seeing the Duke's
Forces ready to receive them, retir'd without fighting, being soon
undeceiv'd in their false hopes, both of the Duke's death, and of
the Defeat of his Army.</p>
                  <p>The Duke's Wounds, which every one at first judg'd to be
mortal, made his Chirurgeons resolve upon removing him out
of the noise, and tumult of the Fort, into a Farm hard by; a
place which to them seem'd to be very secure from any practice
of the Enemy: But this opinion, instead of giving him that
quiet, and repose they kindly intended, had once more like to
have cost him his life;<note place="margin">The Duke in a new danger.</note> for the besieg'd, who watch'd all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of making continual attempts upon the Duke's person,
having observ'd that the place to which he was retir'd, although
covered by the Fort, was nevertheless at a good distance from his
Camp, and only guarded by a small party of Horse, resolv'd to
try, either to take him alive, or at least to kill him in his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
To this purpose therefore, sallying out of the Town with
400 of their best Horse, they furiously set upon the Duke's Horse-Guard;
who were all presently cut to pieces, and <hi>Camseque</hi> who
commanded them laid dead upon the place. <hi>D' Ars,</hi> whose duty it
was to relieve them coming fortunately in upon their Defeat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
the Fight, where he so bravely withstood the Enemies fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that after his Brother <hi>Ceré,</hi> had been wounded and maim'd
with infinite Blows, and himself beaten from his Horse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
by one of his Compagnions, he gave <hi>du Passage,</hi> one of
the Duke's <hi>Mareschals de Camp,</hi> time to come in to his succour; by
whose assistance the Enemy was at last forc'd to retire, leaving ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their men dead upon the place, as the <hi>Baron d' Ars</hi> in this
conflict lost the most part of his Troop.</p>
                  <p>This Cannon-shot which at the little distance of 200 paces had
only wounded the Duke, was not so favourable to the Dutchess
his Wife, whom it kill'd out-right at the distance of 200 Leagues.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63412:91"/>
This Lady had been brought to bed (as has been said before) this
same year 1593 of <hi>Lewis,</hi> since Cardinal <hi>de la Valette)</hi> whom the
grief for her Husbands absence (which was nothing diminished
by the course of time) had still so far kept back from the recovery
of her former strength, after her lying in; that what was only a
little indisposition at first, being much encreas'd by her melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
grew to such a distemper, as made her Friends at last begin
to apprehend a mortal consequence from her disconsolate life. To
divert this ill humour therefore, they often perswaded her to go
abroad, sometimes to Church, sometimes on Visits; when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gone out one day to hear Mass, at her return she espied one of
the Duke's Foot-men, who, unknown to him, had been, by
some of his Officers dispatch'd away to <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> on purpose to
prevent any false rumors, that might there be spread concerning
the Duke's accident, and so discreetly to acquaint the Dutchess
with what had hapned, that she might not unseasonably be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
with the news of his mischance; an honest, and a prudent
care in them, though her destiny rendred all these precautions
fruitless, and vain: for she had no sooner cast her eye on the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
who, being but newly arriv'd, had as yet spoke to none, but
that she call'd him to her, suddenly demanding of him her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the Duke: to whom, the poor Lacquy surpriz'd, and
da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nted at her demand, innocently related that the Duke was
wounded, and by a Cannon-shot: But, as if that word had been
the shot it self, the Dutchess sunk down in a swoon, as one,
that, apprehending a Cannon shot could be no less than mortal,
would not survive him she concluded to be dead, and who was
far dearer to her, than her own life. In which condition she was
presently taken up by her people, and carried home; where all
possible means was us'd to bring her to her self, as at last she was;
though it was only to make her more sensible of death, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the ninth day after she had heard the unhappy news. Before
her Death she made a Will,<note place="margin">The Death of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> wherein she bequeath'd whatever
was in her gift to the Duke her Husband; to whom, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
her Children, as the common pledges of their mutual
affection, she conjur'd him, for their sakes, never to marry again.
Thus died this young, and excellent Lady, in the six and twentieth
Year of her Age, after having manifested an indifferency for life,
becoming her masculine Courage, and Resignation unto Death,
worthy her great Piety, and Vertue.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sieur du-Masses,</hi> Lieutenant for the King under the Duke

his affliction, than which nothing could be greater, he vow'd to
observe what she expected from his fidelity to the last hour of his
Life: A promise that he as faithfully observ'd, though in the
space of fifty years, that he surviv'd this excellent Lady, he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd

                  <p>Fortune had hitherto so favour'd the Duke in almost all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes,<note place="margin">Anno 1594.</note>
that his Affairs had been carried on with great prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

so suspected to the people, as made them at last refuse to pay

these undiscerning spirits, by how much a certain emulation has
ever been observ'd to be betwixt the <hi>Provencials</hi> and <hi>Gascons,</hi> as
seems to have been hereditary, if not natural, to those two people:
So that the <hi>Provencials</hi> not being able to endure the dominion of
those with whom they had ever disputed the prize of Glory, and
Valour, were easily tempted to shake off the yoke that either was,
or was pretended to be impos'd upon them: After therefore (as
has been said) they had denied the Duke those Contributions,
which, until then, they had willingly paid, most of the Souldiers
of the Country who were in his Army retir'd themselves, and
some of the chief Nobility pretended to favour at Court by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
him of inordinate Ambition; though all his endeavour to
make himself considerable in <hi>Provence,</hi> was only in order to his
Majesties Service. The Duke seeing things in this ill condition,
would by force have reduc'd them to their former posture: but
this remedy (which was by no means proper for the constitution
of that people) ripping up the memory of the severe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he had in such cases inflicted upon several men in divers
places, serv'd only to make them desperate in their disobedience,
and to incen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:63412:92"/>
Thus did all those, who had manifested an animosity against
the Duke, begin to apprehend falling into his power, amongst
which the Leaguers were in the greatest fear; who, as their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
Rebellion had made their fault much greater, than theirs,
who like Souldiers had defended <hi>Montauron,</hi> so did they fear a
worse punishment, if worse could be, than had been inflicted
upon them. They saw their City of <hi>Aix</hi> reduc'd to the last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;
neither would those within stay till they could come to
their Relief. The <hi>Count de Carces,</hi> a particular Enemy to the
Duke (besides the hatred that diversity of interest does usually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get)
above all things dreaded to fall into his hands: so that
Friends, and Enemies, those who pretended to be Royallists, and
Leaguers conspiring together to hinder the Duke's further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
he saw, almost in a moment, all <hi>Provence</hi> in Mutiny,
and Insurrection.</p>
                  <p>The King had already publickly embrac'd the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">King <hi>Henry</hi> the IIII. turns Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</note>
of which he had made open profession at St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> the

having taken away all manner of pretense from such as had
declar'd they forsook his Majesties Service upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
than the Interest of Religion; the Inhabitants of <hi>Aix</hi>
conceiv'd they could now no longer continue in their Rebellion,
without manifesting to all the world that they were sway'd by
other considerations, than those they had already declar'd; to
which the <hi>Count de Carces</hi> (making use of this time, and occasion)
adding his perswasions, one while representing to them their
Duty to their Prince, and another the severity they were to expect
from the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> animated, as he must of necessity be,
by the hatred they had in this Siege express'd against his Person,
he at last prevail'd with them to send away speedily to the King,
to assure his Majesty of their Fidelity and Obedience.<note place="margin">Mounsieur de Thou.</note> This
was the first thing that discover'd a disunion in the League:
of which, though the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> highly complain'd to the
<hi>Count de Carces,</hi> reproaching him with weakness, and charging
him with all the miscarriages that should after happen to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
yet was he deaf to his reproaches, and the fear of falling
into the Duke's hands, as he was upon the point to do (the City
of <hi>Aix,</hi> not being able longer to hold out) being more prevalent
upon him, than the respect of his Alliance, he resolutely persisted
in his first Design.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Count de Carces</hi> was not satisfied with hindering the
Duke from making himself Master of the City of <hi>Aix</hi> only, the
hatred he implacably bore him proceeding yet further, and to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63412:92"/>
contrivances of more dangerous consequence against him. There
was none who did not believe the King had a jealousie of the
Duke's Designs; amongst whom, the <hi>Count de Carces,</hi>

it better than the rest, easily perswaded himself that his
Majesty would not suffer the Duke to encrease his Reputation,
and Power in <hi>Provence,</hi> by the taking of <hi>Aix,</hi> one of the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
places of that Province: And he further knew the Duke
would as hardly consent to have his Conquest, so near effected,
forestall'd, and the prey snatch'd out of his hands: So that in
this diversity of pretensions, he doubted not, but that the King's
aversion to the Duke, as also his mistrust of him, would be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
encreas'd; which in the end succeeded as he had foreseen,
and projected. The Estates of the Country, assembled at <hi>Aix,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Deputies to go make a tender to the King of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of their City, provided his Majesty would please to protect
them against the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> whose power, they said, was
grown formidable, and his insolence not to be endur'd. 'Tis true,
he had acted vigorously against them, but they would not say,
That had he proceeded with greater moderation, they would ever
have return'd to their obedience, or departed from the Faction,
whose interest they had so precipitously, and rebelliously em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd.</p>
                  <p>The Deputies found it no hard matter to obtain from the King
what they desir'd,<note place="margin">Anno 1595.</note> as to the acceptation of their City, which his
Majesty was very glad should return into his obedience: but for
what concern'd the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> against whom their depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was chiefly directed, they could nothing prevail at this
time; not that they fail'd on their parts with their utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and eloquence, to render his Actions, and fidelity suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
to set the Kings heart more, and more against him: But
whether it were that his Majesty would not give credit to so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
and so passionate accusers; or (which is more likely) that in
the present posture of his Affairs, not yet well settled, he thought
it not convenient to disoblige the Duke to such a degree; he would
by no means gratifie them in that part of their deputation, that
pointed at the Duke's removal from his Government. He saw
him powerful in the Country, supported with great Relations,
and possess'd of many strong holds; in which condition it had
been dangerous to provoke him to the height: wherefore he
thought it best to choose a mean betwixt these extremes, and to
give the Deputies some satisfaction, without touching the Duke's
Authority in <hi>Provence,</hi> excepting in the City of <hi>Aix</hi> only; which,
at the Deputies request his Majesty would not absolutely leave at
his discretion.</p>

carried, but that the Duke had immediate knowledge thereof;
at which unexpected unkindness being infinitely surpriz'd, and
wounded to the quick, to see his Services, and good Intentions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by so apparent a mistrust, he took up Resolutions, which
though I shall by no means pretend to justifie, yet that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and misfortune of the time may something serve to excuse:
There was scarce a great man of that Age that was not of opinion
a man might lawfully defend his own Fortune, even against his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63412:93"/>
Prince, an error with which the Duke also, having been pre-pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd,
and therein, by a number of ill examples, confirm'd, he
was resolv'd not to refer the Controversie about <hi>Aix,</hi> nor the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
he had in <hi>Provence</hi> to arbitration; but to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in that Interest, and Authority, with all the Force, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
he had: which made <hi>l' Esdiguieres,</hi> who was soon enform'd
how little the Duke was dispos'd to submit to the King's order,
after having conferr'd with <hi>Seignior Alphonso,</hi> and concluded about
the course they were to take, to retire into <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> there to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himself to pass over with all expedition, and with all the Force
he could make into <hi>Provence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilst these little contests in <hi>Provence</hi> had been thus carried on,
which had taken up some time, the King's Affairs about his own
Person were advanc'd into a much better condition: The Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Provence</hi> had been dispatch'd to Court in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> at which
time the League being at their height, his Majesty thought it not
convenient to give the Duke any publick discontent: but from
that time three months were now elaps'd (for this hapned at the
end of <hi>April)</hi> in which time the King had found a way to possess
himself of the City of <hi>Paris.</hi> The possession of this great and
populous City had drawn many others along with it into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Obedience, and divers persons of great quality had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the examples of those Cities: the <hi>Spaniard</hi> now was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
of few, or no Towns in the Kingdom, and the League
was so strangely declin'd, as to be only now almost supported by
the single Family of <hi>Lorain,</hi> which was it self also upon the
point to disunite; so that the King being no longer necessitated to
dissemble, began now to require of the Duke a more absolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
than hitherto he had done; when having rais'd him
many enemies in the Country, and appointed <hi>l' Esdiguieres,</hi> and
<hi>Ornano</hi> with great Forces to make head against him, he did not
now so much fear his revolt, as formerly; nor consequently so
much care to disoblige him.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, who by the commotions of the people, by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
positive command, and by the preparations that were
made against him, very well saw what he was to expect, would,
notwithstanding how great soever his danger seem'd to be, rather
choose to perish in <hi>Provence</hi> in the defense of his Honour, and
Command,<note place="margin">The Duke is resolute to maintain himself in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
than to go to Court, there to expose himself to the
malicious Offices of his Enemies. He very well saw the best he
was there to expect, was to be stript of his Government; to
which he conceiv'd he had a better Title, than to any other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his Fortune. He had, in the time of his Favour, purg'd
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63412:94"/>
that Province of the Factions of the League, and the Reform'd
Religion; he had since maintain'd it against the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
and the League combin'd together: It had cost him his Brother's
Life, much of his own Blood, and many of his Friends, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
so that what propositions soever could be made unto him,
he intended never to quit claim to his title there, and stood reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
to bury himself in <hi>Provence,</hi> rather than by leaving it, to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Enemies longing, who were hourly importunate with his
Majesty to remove him thence. In which resolution being every
day more and more confirm'd, he gave the Constable (who as I
have said was to mediate the differences betwixt the <hi>Provencials,</hi>
and him) plainly to understand his determination; entreating
him at the same time not to take it ill, if he did not submit a thing
to Arbitration, which he could by no means ever consent to part
withal. Neither was it any hard matter for him to satisfie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
who was infinitely affectionate to his person, and who had
much rather have had him for his Neighbour in <hi>Provence,</hi> than
any other; a consideration that perhaps especially mov'd the King

supposing that to shew himself with his Forces upon the
Frontiers of his Government, would sooner encline the Duke to
that resolution, advanc'd as far as the Banks of the River <hi>Durance,</hi>
which separates <hi>Provence</hi> from <hi>Dauphiné;</hi> where what he design'd
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63412:94"/>
to hasten an Accommodation, he soon saw serv'd only to put
things into a worse condition, and to make the Rupture wider
than before.</p>
                  <p>There had been of old a certain emulation betwixt these two
great men, and their Vertue having begot in each of them a great

which by his merit could get the start in the race of Honour, and

something of feud in the case, the Duke complaining that he

were never observ'd to promote Accommodations, nor to unite

to Quarter in a very ill Country, as at <hi>Eguiere, Sennas,
Lambescq,</hi> and other places thereabouts, his men suffer'd great
want, and inconvenience; A consideration that besides the
promptness of his nature, made him eage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to come to the trial of
Arms: In which resolution advancing still towards the Enemy,
he at last discover'd him, standing in a place of singular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
behind a great Ditch, which the torrent of Land floods had
worn, and hollow'd into the form of a regular entrenchment.
<hi>L' Esdiguieres</hi> at the Duke's first appearance immediately drew up
into Battalia behind the Ditch, sending out his Vant-guard only to
fight, wherein he had indeed dispos'd his best men, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of his Nephew <hi>Morges,</hi> in whose company (to his own
misfortune) was <hi>Bezaudun,</hi> who had formerly been <hi>Mareschal de
Camp</hi> for the League in <hi>Provence.</hi> The Duke, seeing this Vant-guard
come up with a countenance to fight, made his also advance to
meet them; which he would himself in person lead up, as he did,
and made so gallant, and so fortunate a charge, that after a short,
but brisk dispute, himself bravely fighting at the head of his men,
they totally routed the party, and drove <hi>Morges</hi> wounded into
the very Ditch, that parted the two main Bodies, kill'd a great
many men (as he also lost some) and carried away very many Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
without leaving so much as one of his own men in the
Enemies hands: Yet had <hi>Mounsieur l' Esdiguieres</hi> the patience all
this while to see his men beaten, and trodden under foot, without
once offering to come out of his Trench; or, though he made
some light skirmishes about the skirts of the Ditch, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
any inclination to a total engagement; A coldness that
the Duke very well observing, and satisfied with his own success,
which he had infinitely hazarded, should he have made any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63412:95"/>
attempt upon the Enemy in a place of so great advantage,
contented himself with only facing some hours in the Field, to try
if <hi>l' Esdiguieres</hi> had any mind to repair his loss; but to no purpose,
he still keeping the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>empted, out of the advantage of his Post. And this is the
truth of what pass'd at this occasion, as I received it from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and not to be suspected, testimony, who were present at
the engagement, and who impartially related the story: though the
sequel it self makes it plain enough; for had <hi>Mounsieur l' Esdigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres</hi>
had the least imaginable advantage, is it to be suppos'd that he
would have suffer'd the Duke to have carried away so many, and
so considerable Pris'ners before his face, as the Historians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
confess to be taken in this Battel? No doubtless! neither
was it such a triumph for him to remain Master of the Field, the
Duke never intending to stay upon the place of Battel; the ill
Quarters he had been enforc'd to take up withal, upon his March,
in a very unfruitful Country, not permitting him to stay long
there without he intended to destroy his men: to which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
was also added, that he was in danger of losing his Fort
at <hi>Aix,</hi> left but slenderly guarded, by drawing so many men from
thence upon this occasion; and therefore it especially concern'd
him not longer to expose a place of that importance, which was
indeed the main cause that made him to return, but not retreat.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the Prisoners taken at this Battel was the <hi>Mareschal de
Camp Bezaudun,</hi> whom I nam'd but now; a Gentleman for his
Parts and Courage of high repute amongst those of his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
but he would yet make himself more remarkable, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing,
and that in publick, an implacable hatred to the Duke's
Person; neither were words sufficient to express his Malice, nor
did he think it enough that he had by divers calumnies bespatter'd
the Duke's Honour,<note place="margin">The Duke'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note>
unless he made his injuries more publick, by
printing several Libels, of which he declar'd himself to be the
Author, which indeed, was one thing that had cherish'd in the
Duke an animosity against him: but there was yet another by
which he was more justly provok'd, and of which, those who
have condemn'd the Duke, for causing him to be, as they say, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsomely
slain, have made no mention. I think it therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fit to insert it here, to vindicate the Duke from the aspersion has
been unjustly cast upon him, about this Gentleman's death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bezaudun,</hi> formerly in some engagement had the fortune to
take a Gentleman Prisoner, whose name was <hi>D' Estampes,</hi> a man
for whom the Duke had an exceeding kindness, and whom in the
beginning of his restraint <hi>Bezaudun</hi> had us'd with great civility;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63412:96"/>
but suspecting soon after, and perhaps upon too light grounds,
that his Prisoner had not observ'd a due regard to the honour of
his house, he forthwith resolv'd to take a severe revenge: To
which purpose causing himself to be carried in a Chair into the
Market-place of <hi>Aix,</hi> being unable to walk by reason of some
Wounds he had receiv'd, he there caus'd his Prisoner to be
brought before him; where having demanded of him, in the
presence of a great many people, whom the novelty of the action
had assembled together, if he complain'd of his usage, <hi>D' Estam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi>
made answer, that he was so far from complaining, that he
had highly commended it, and should do so as long as he had
life. You should not then have given me cause to complain of you,
says <hi>Bezaudun,</hi> and withal cry'd, kill him; which inhumane Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was scarce pronounc'd, but that the poor Gentleman was,
by some <hi>Bezaudun</hi> had brought along for that purpose, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
run through, and through, and laid dead upon the place.
This barbarous act, that possess'd with horror all such as beheld
it, being soon brought to the Duke's ear, he then made a vow,
that if ever the Murtherer fell into his hands he should receive the
same measure: And such was <hi>Bezaudun's</hi> ill fortune, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the Duke in a time when the murther of his Friend was
yet fresh in his memory; for the Prisoners taken in the Battel,
being immediately, and upon the place brought before him, and
amongst the rest <hi>Bezaudun,</hi> completely arm'd, with his Bever
down; and the Duke asking (as he had of the rest) who he was,
the Prisoner himself made answer, that he was <hi>Bezaudun;</hi> at
which the Duke turning aside his head, as loathing the sight of a
man so odious to him, and against whom he had so often pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
an implacable hatred, could not forbear to express some
dissatisfaction with those who had receiv'd him to Quarter:
whereupon one of them, without more express order, discharg'd a
Pistol in his head, by which he was laid upon the ground; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
was discharg'd by a Brother-in-law of his own, and both
mortal. Thus have you the truth of this business; which, had it
been carried with less cruelty, had doubtless been more to be
commended, though the many offences and injuries the Duke had
receiv'd being duly consider'd, it may in some sort pretend to an
excuse; especially the fact having been committed by no order
from the Duke, but by Servants of his, who conceiv'd it would
be an acceptable service to him: Neither is it to be denied, but
that the War has produc'd many other actions of this nature,
wherein as great severity has been practis'd upon far less provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</p>

The Duke after this Battel perceiving <hi>l' Esdiguier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

favour'd by almost all who had formerly stood for the League
in <hi>Provence,</hi> (many of them having listed themselves under this
<hi>Hugonot</hi> Captain) as also by those who were affectionate to the
King, seeing an Army likewise on foot against him twice as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
as his own, and not knowing in whom he might confide,
even his own Friends, and Servants being startled, to see the King's
Authority, and name made use of against them; began now to
see that, to keep those few friends, and places he had left, from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting
from him, it was absolutely necessary to submit to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation:
and to this he was the rather induc'd by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
he saw of abandoning his Fort of <hi>Aix,</hi> it being impossible
for him to keep that, without putting the other places he held in
the Province to manifest hazard, his Forces being too few to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them all against so many enemies,<note place="margin">The Duke at last is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.</note> as were conspir'd to his
ruine. He therefore at last hearkened to <hi>Lafin,</hi> who from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
had made himself an importunate Mediator for an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
and in conclusion wholly referr'd himself to the
Constables award; by whose determination, which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
in <hi>Iune,</hi> the Duke was oblig'd to give up the Fort of <hi>Aix</hi>
(the main thing in contest) into the hands of <hi>Lafin</hi> himself, by
whom it was to be kept with 400 men, to be sent out of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi>
until it should please his Majesty further to signifie his
Royal Pleasure, as to the maintaining or slighting of that Fort,
that in the mean time there should be a general suspension of Arms
in <hi>Provence,</hi> during which all things should continue in the same
posture they then were.</p>
                  <p>The Duke submitting absolutely, and without reserve, to this
Decree, accordingly deliver'd up the Fort of <hi>Aix</hi> unto <hi>Lafin,</hi> who
enter'd into it with the appointed number of men: but whether
it were through the Officers foul play in their Musters, or that the
treachery of <hi>Lafin</hi> himself (of both which the Duke complain'd)
made him neglect to keep his Garrison in its full appointment, so
it was that in a few days they were reduc'd to half their number;
neither does <hi>Mounsieur l' Esdiguieres</hi> stick to confess, that he himself
had a hand in the business, that he had privately supply'd the Fort
with Souldiers of his own, who still were to run away by his
private order.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> under the assurance of
this Truce, liv'd in great security, and believing that nothing was

as it were in the presence of all men, took this opportunity, a little
to divert, and repose himself, after the continual action he had
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63412:97"/>
been turmoil'd in since his first arrival in <hi>Provence,</hi> and to that
purpose took a Journey into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> either as he himself pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make a visit to the Constable;<note place="margin">The Duke goes over to <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc.</hi>
                     </note> or, as it was said by
others, upon an amorous accompt to visit a Lady he had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
withal in that Country: but whatever was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
the absence of their Leader, together with his example,
made most of his Souldiers to take the same liberty, rambling
every one a several way: an advantage that <hi>Mounsieur l' Esdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres</hi>
very well knew how to manage; neither did he neglect it,
though what he did would have been interpreted breach of faith,
had less than the King's command stept in to excuse it.</p>
                  <p>In this Journey to <hi>Languedoc,</hi> there hapned a very remarkable
quarrel betwixt two Officers of the Duke's Army,<note place="margin">A remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Duel betwixt two of the Duke's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains.</note> who went
along to attend him; the one was <hi>Lioux,</hi> a <hi>Gascon,</hi> the other St.
<hi>Andiol</hi> a <hi>Provencial,</hi> both of them Captains of Horse, and equal
in quality, and esteem; though in this occasion the chance of
Arms shewed it self partial to St. <hi>Andiol</hi>'s side. These two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
upon some slight dispute, having agreed to fight, went out
of the Town together, to end their difference; where St. <hi>Andiol</hi>
being the stronger man, after some wounds given, and receiv'd
on both sides, closing with his Enemy, trip'd up his heels, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd
him, and made him ask his life; which being done, he was
so far from the insolence of a conquerour, that, desiring no other
triumph than his own private satisfaction, he restor'd <hi>Lioux</hi> his
Sword upon the place, with all the complement, and civility usual
amongst men of honour upon such occasions. But how modest
soever St. <hi>Andiol</hi> was in his Victory, the business could not be so
secretly carried (they returning both bloody from the Field) that
their friends took not notice of what they had been about, who as
soon enform'd the Duke thereof; desiring withal, that he would
interpose his Authority to make them friends: But the Duke, out
of respect to the Constable would transfer that good office to
him, who as readily undertook it, and who having his two Sons
in Law the <hi>Count de Auvergne</hi> (since Duke of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> and the
Duke <hi>de Vantadour</hi> in the house with him, sent for them, and the
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> to be present at the reconciliation, <hi>Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diol</hi>
was the first call'd in, who, being examin'd what had pass'd
betwixt <hi>Lioux</hi> and him, made answer, <q>That it was true, some
little dispute had hapned betwixt them, which had oblig'd him
to seek the satisfaction of a Cavalier; but that it was already
determin'd, without any advantage on the one side, or the
other, that he was satisfied that he must ever declare <hi>Lioux</hi> to be
a very brave Gentleman, and that he was his Friend, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63412:97"/>
Servant.</q> After this Declaration, every one concluded it
would be a matter of no great difficulty to reconcile them, and
expected <hi>Lioux</hi> would as readily embrace his adversaries friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as he had franckly offer'd his, <hi>Saint Andiol</hi> being reputed one
of the bravest Gentlemen in the Army. He therefore was next
call'd in, and that rather to hear himself commended upon <hi>Saint
Andiol's</hi> testimony of his Valour, than to be question'd about a
thing, of the truth whereof they thought themselves already suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
enform'd. They therefore, upon his coming in, told
him, that <hi>Saint Andiol</hi> had given an account of what had pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, that he had assur'd them, they parted upon equal
terms, that he was his Friend and Servant, and that therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
now remain'd, but that they should embrace, and be good
friends. To which <hi>Lioux</hi> made answer, <q>That before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
so far, there must be a truer relation given of the issue of
their dispute, than, for as much as he yet heard, he could consent
unto.</q> An answer that surpriz'd the whole company, who fear'd
it might beget a new quarrel; when <hi>Lioux</hi> continuing his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
declar'd how every thing had truly pass'd; acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he ow'd his life to his enemies courtesie; but complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
withal, that <hi>Saint Andiol</hi> should make so light of his Victory,
as to deprive himself of the due honour of it; yet magnifying
his noble behaviour towards him after so ingenuous a manner,
that having by his franck, and generous confession wip'd off all
disesteem, that usually (how brave soever) cleaves to the losing
side, he won himself, by his handsome carriage, as great a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if he had been more fortunate, and shar'd in the glory of
a victory had been obtain'd in single dispute over his own
person.</p>
                  <p>From the time that the Fort of <hi>Aix</hi> had been deliver'd into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin's</hi>
hands, <hi>Mounsieur de l' Esdiguieres</hi> had retir'd himself into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
where he had been receiv'd with all the reputation, and respect
due to the Deliverer of a people, as they look'd upon him to be,
and where, whilst he lay watching all occasions wherein he might
weaken the Duke's power, or lessen his repute (which he call'd
executing his Majestices Orders, and advancing his Service) he had
intelligence of the slender, and careless Guard was kept by <hi>Lafin</hi>
in the Fort of <hi>Aix,</hi> as also in many other places, which as yet were
in the Duke's possession:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Fort of</hi> Aix <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by</hi> Mounsieur l' Esdiguieres.</note> wherefore making use of this negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and pretending some of the Duke's people had broken the
Truce (in having (as he said) taken some of his prisoners) he took
the Field upon the sixth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and without resistance took the
Fort of <hi>Aix,</hi> and favouring the revolt of <hi>Frejus, St. Paul, Troy,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63412:98"/>
Mirabel,</hi> and <hi>Cannes,</hi> gave the Inhabitants of all those Cities
opportunity, to drive out the Duke's Garrisons, and to withdraw
themselves wholly from his Party, and Obedience. As for the Fort
of <hi>Aix,</hi> it was no sooner in <hi>Mounsieur de l' Esdiguieres</hi> hands, but
that he deliver'd it up to the discretion of the Inhabitants, who
were so diligent in the demolishing of it,<note place="margin">The Fort of <hi>Aix</hi> demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd.</note> that in two days time
there scarce remain'd any footsteps of a work the Duke's whole
Army had for three months together, with great, and continual
labour, been industrious to raise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Toulon</hi> soon after follow'd the revolt of the other forenamed
places,<note place="margin">Many other places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from the Duke.</note> which was, of all others, a loss of the greatest importance
to the Duke. <hi>Esgarrebaques</hi> was Governour of the place, a man
that had long serv'd in that employment, both under <hi>Mounsieur
de la Valette,</hi> and under the Duke himself in great esteem of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and Fidelity: but at last the alliance he had contracted
with the House of <hi>Souliés,</hi> a Family that were nothing kind to
the Duke's Interests, having given his Adversaries, or rather his
Envyers a pretense to render him suspected to the Duke, he, to
secure the place, and to keep <hi>Esgarrebaques</hi> within the bounds of
his duty, caus'd a Cittadel to be drawn out, and to be begun in his
own presence, wherein he plac'd <hi>Signac,</hi> the Governours Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and Mortal Enemy, with a sufficient Garrison both to secure
the Cittadel, and to awe the City: But <hi>Esgarrebaques,</hi> either really
provok'd by this ill usage, or else in this declining condition of the
Duke's Affairs, willing to disingage himself from his Service,
making that his pretense, so soon as the Duke's back was turn'd,
assaulted <hi>Signac</hi> in his new Cittadel; where, the Fortifications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imperfect, and the access open, and easie on all sides, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much opposition took the Governour prisoner, and made
himself master of the place; putting himself immediately after
into <hi>Mounsieur l' Esdiguieres</hi> protection, which, in the Language of
the Country, was to submit himself to the King.</p>
                  <p>The Duke having intelligence of these disorders, of which his
own absence had chiefly been the cause, upon the first report
thereof left <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and made all the haste he could into <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi>
to apply, if possible, some remedy in this untoward posture
of Affairs; though all he could do at his return, was only to stop
the Gangreen from going further,<note place="margin">The Duke returns into <hi>Provence.</hi>
                     </note> and to keep the Province from a
general revolt: yet either not believing, or not seeming to believe,
that his Majesties Order was in any of these transactions, he began
to prepare himself to recover by force of Arms, what by treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and surprize had been taken from him, when finding his
Friends and Followers startled, and wavering at the very sound
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63412:98"/>
of the Royal Name, which his Enemies had made use of in all
their designs, he thought it necessary, before he fell to action first
to undeceive them, and to clear that error. In an eloquent Speech
therefore he briefly laid before them, <q>The signal Services both
his Brother and himself had done for the King in the conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Province, and that in the greatest confusion of the
Kingdom, and at the lowest ebb of his Majesties Affairs; the
Obedience he had manifested to all his Majesties Orders, and
Commands, how severe soever they had been, and how preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
soever to his own private Fortune. That as an evidence
of his Duty, and submission to his Majesties Royal Pleasure, he
had but lately surrendred the Fort of <hi>Aix,</hi> that is to say, had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
himself of the possession of that fair City; the Conquest
of which, was, by their Valours made certain to him. That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
so many, and so recent testimonies of his Loyalty
and Obedience, with which he knew his Majesty to be very
well satisfied, his Enemies still shrowding their malice under
the shadow of the Royal Name, the better to effect their own
designs, had debauch'd, and reduc'd from him most of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he had lately been possess'd of. That this affront reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, indifferently with himself, since it had been with their
Blood, together with his Brothers, and his own, that those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
had been dearly bought. That therefore the injury being
equal both to him, and them, he hop'd they would assist to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
them, and to maintain his Fortune; which, as he ow'd it
in part to their Valour, so did he not so passionately desire its
support for any interest of his own, as to have means thereby to
shew himself grateful to those who had been constant, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him, in all the disgraces he had fall'n into, and in all the
attempts had been practis'd against him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Friends being by this short speech reassur'd and confirm'd
in their Fidelity and Obedience, and having thereupon express'd
as great a Devotion to his Service, as he could expect from men
who had long been affectionate to him; he forthwith took the
Field to go seek out <hi>l' Esdiguieres:</hi> but he, after he had deliver'd
<hi>Aix</hi> from the Fort, that had so long kept them in subjection, and
clear'd the neighbouring Campagne by the revolt he had procur'd
of the foremention'd places, retir'd into his Government of <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiné,</hi>
without engaging himself further at this time in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of <hi>Provence;</hi> by whose retreat, the Duke, having none left
to oppose his designs, seem'd to be now in a condition not only
to redeem his late losses, but also to make a new, and a further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
into the Country, than he yet had done; and doubtless he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63412:99"/>
had done so, had things continued in this posture: but something
new, and unforeseen fell out, which gave the last blow to the ruine
of his Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> at last undeceiv'd, and better read in the
<hi>Spanish</hi> artifice, which had so long abus'd him with vain proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Marriage with their <hi>Infanta</hi> so soon as they could procure
his Election to the Crown, and perceiving also the declining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the League, which every day went less in reputation, was
in the end, with his Brothers return'd into the King's Obedience:

was in it self at least equal with the other) had, by this mutation a
great opportunity, under the shadow of the Royal Authority, to
depress one of the most powerful, and profess'd enemies of his

that Country, and so soon again to put a Sword into the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi>'s hand, who was so lately return'd into his obedience, had
first try'd the way of negotiation (as you have heard) and after
made use of Arms under the conduct of <hi>Mounsieur l' Esdiguieres;</hi>
by which various ways having found he could neither reduce the
Duke by reason, nor so depress him by force, but that he was still in
a condition there long to subsist, he at last took a resolution to put
an end to the work, and to effect that by fine force, which he saw
was neither by Treaty, nor by indifferent Forces to be brought

His Majesty had in the beginning of this year proclaim'd a
War with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which notwithstanding, before he
would begin, or advance into the Enemies Country, he would
first settle his own Affairs at home, and visit some parts of his
Kingdom, which as yet he had never seen since they were reduc'd
to his Obedience, by his presence to encourage and confirm them
in their duty to him; of which the City of <hi>Lyons</hi> was one, and
thither it was, that his Majesty, after having chas'd the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne</hi> out of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> repair'd, and where he arriv'd in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
1595. To this place <hi>Mounsieur de l' Esdiguieres</hi> being also
come to kiss his Majesties Hand, and to give him an accompt of
the Affairs of <hi>Provence,</hi> he was thither follow'd by the Deputies
of that Parliament, and of some other Cities of that Province, in
hopes that under his countenance, and Interest at Court, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
against the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> would be the better heard, by
which his Majesty being tyr'd, vext at the continuations of these
troubles, and animated against the Duke by the reiterated ill Offices
of his enemies, fearing also that the ill usage the Duke had receiv'd
from them, might during his rupture with <hi>Spain,</hi> provoke him to
joyn with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> so as to receive them into those Garrisons
he held in <hi>Provence,</hi> he then took up that final resolution to suppress
him by Force, and by Arms to reduce him to his Duty. Of this
War the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>

made choice of <hi>Mounsieur l' Esdiguieres</hi> for that purpose, by the
title of Lieutenant General in <hi>Provence,</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi>
Neither could his Majesty have made choice of two Captains
more animated against the Enemy they were to undertake, the first
being prompted on, besides the interest of his establishment in
that Province, by the antiquated and irreconcilable hatred of his
Family, the other by his jealousie already mention'd, and by the
conscience of those recent injuries the Duke had receiv'd at his
hands.</p>
                  <p>And here, though every one might reasonably conclude that
this torrent of Arms was likely to overwhelm the Duke beyond

affliction to see his Majesty so positively bent to his ruine, with

he had entrusted the chiefest of his Castles and Towns ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the Faith they had sworn unto him: but their revolt soon
made him understand, the influence of the Royal Name, and how
unhappy a thing it is, to have that appear against a man, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
soever his intentions may be, and how well soever dispos'd
to his Princes Service: for the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and <hi>Mounsieur de
l' Esdiguieres</hi> no sooner appear'd in <hi>Provence,</hi> but that there was a
contest amongst the Duke's greatest Confidents, who should first
go over to them. Amongst these the <hi>Sieurs de Buous</hi> Brothers, the
men of all others in that Country to whom the Duke had given
the highest testimonies of Honour,<note place="margin">The Duke abandoned by most of his friends.</note> and Friendship, were the first
who forsook him, and who, besides the prejudice they did him by
their ill example, carried over with them the two Regiments
they commanded in his Army, which was no little blow to his
Affairs in a time when it was no easie matter for him to raise new
Forces.</p>
                  <p>The next in order that follow'd this vertuous example was
<hi>Ramefort,</hi> one who had been of longest acquaintance, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
with the Duke, and whom he in his time of favour had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
by many benefits, and had since in <hi>Provence</hi> committed <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steron,</hi>
one of the chiefest places he held there to his trust. This
man nevertheless no sooner knew the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to be come
into the Country, but that he sent to treat with him about the
surrender of the place, upon condition that he should still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

Governour there for the King. <hi>Peyroles</hi> did the same for his

                  </p>
                  <p>The loss of these two places having infinitely surpriz'd the
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who by this carriage plainly saw how little as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
he could promise to himself from the rest of his Friends,
he began to apprehend an universal Revolt;<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> enters into a general mistrust of all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</note> and in this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
scarce knowing any more in whom he might confide, or

the fidelity of <hi>Mesplés</hi> the Governour of <hi>Tropés,</hi> one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
places that remain'd in his power, and in which upon the
worst of accidents he thought to find his chiefest refuge, and
safety. This Gentleman a <hi>Bearnois</hi> by Birth, and a man of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Valour, had, by his gallant behaviour in several occasions,
wrought himself much into the Kings opinion, and esteem; from
whence the Duke apprehending (perhaps too lightly) that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
he might quit his Interests, to be allur'd over to his Enemies
side by the sound of the Royal Name, he resolv'd to remove him
from that command, as he presently did; and that, as he conceiv'd,
without any injury, or offense, having done it without noise, or
giving the least evidence that his Faith was any way suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him: but <hi>Mesplés</hi> (perhaps glad of so good a pretense to
abandon the Duke, whose Affairs he saw daily declining) taking
his unjust suspicion for the highest injury, and the removing him
from his Government for the greatest Affront and Indignity he
could po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that time forwards he became one of his most violent and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
enemies. He went upon the very instant to seek out the
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> where being arriv'd, he immediately put himself
into his Service, and having long commanded in St. <hi>Tropés,</hi> and
at leisure consider'd all the weaknesses of the place, advis'd the
Duke presently to besiege it, assuring him that it would infallibly
be taken; which the Duke giving credit to, immediately order'd
him Men, and Cannon, to force the place, whilst he himself went
upon the enterprize of <hi>Marselles,</hi> which he likewise brought to a
fortunate issue. This Design upon St. <hi>Tropés</hi> had like to have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
betwixt these two Dukes a memorable engagement; for
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> not being able to suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er such a place to be
lost, without endeavouring at least to relieve it, had suddenly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
together all the Forces he could make thereabouts to that
purpose; but all those amounting to no more, than about some
300. Light Horse, 60. of his Guards, and betwixt four or five
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63412:101"/>
hundred Foot, he was like to do no great execution; yet was he
resolute, notwithstanding the infinite danger, to have made a
brave attempt; when those about him, seeing that only the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
condition of his Affairs prompted him to that precipitous
resolution, not only disswaded him from his purpose; but in a
manner constrain'd him to think of making his retreat: In
which also the danger was exceeding great; for St. <hi>Tropés</hi> being
but four Leagues distant from <hi>Marselles,</hi> whilst <hi>Mesplés</hi> was busie
about this petty Siege, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had made himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of that great, and populous City; where, having a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
at his Devotion, and receiving intelligence from <hi>Mesplés,</hi> that
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was with a very inconsiderable Party about
St. <hi>Tropés,</hi> he made with all possible diligence to find him out, and
to fight him. As the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was advancing with this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was upon his Retreat, which (that
craggy and mountainous Country affording him no other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage)
he was forc'd to make by the same way, by which the Duke
of <hi>Guise</hi> was coming against him. The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn-Hope
was that day led by <hi>St. Andr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e,</hi> who, so soon as he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
the Enemy, gave the Duke present notice thereof; who,
not so much as dreaming of any such Encounter, was a little
surpriz'd, and in some perplexity, what course he had best to take.
His design before was to have refresh'd his men in the Village <hi>Du
Val;</hi> but that being now possess'd by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and he
not being in a condition to dislodge him, who was much stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than himself, he was forc'd to lay aside his thoughts of repose,
and to think of a speedy retreat. Neither was this without great
difficulty to be effected, there being no place near he expected
should receive him, and the Enemy being already in sight. In
which general confusion and astonishment, a Souldier of the
Country who was then with the Duke, advis'd him to retire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Berjau,</hi> undertaking himself at the same time, to be his
Guide. <hi>Berjau</hi> was a little Town in the Duke's possession, but it
was four long Leagues from the place where they then were, and
the River <hi>Argence</hi> was betwixt them and it, which was no where
passable but at <hi>Pont de Carces,</hi> the Lord of which was no friend
to the Duke, as may be gather'd from what has gone before:
Yet was the Souldier's proposition nevertheless embrac'd (for in
extreme necessities and dangers, the first Counsels whatever they
be are commonly accepted) the Guide therefore put himself in the
Front, and the Duke followed after, leaving the <hi>Baron d' Ars,</hi> and
<hi>Miran</hi> to bring up the Rear. In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
advertis'd, by the Avant-Coureurs of his Army, that the Duke
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63412:101"/>
of <hi>Espernon</hi> was so near, made all the haste he could to overtake
him; which notwithstanding he could not so suddenly do, but
that the Duke had already pass'd the River without difficulty, or
danger, which the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> perceiving, and attempting to
follow after, that he might engage him before he could put his
men into order,<note place="margin">A Skirmish betwixt the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> was receiv'd on the Duke's part by a counterfeit
charge, which was put so briskly home, that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s
Forces, who were not half got over the Bridge, astonish'd at so
unexpected a resistance, fell foul upon one another, in which
confusion above thirty Troopers threw themselves headlong for
fear into the River, and were there drown'd, some also were
slain; and certainly had the Duke engag'd with all his Forces, he
had put <hi>Mounsieur de Guise</hi> into a very great disorder: but he
conceiving he had nothing more to do, than to make good his
own retreat, thought it sufficient by charging, and amusing the
Enemies Van, to win time for those few Foot he had to get the
start; wherein if the Duke committed an oversight, <hi>Mounsieur de
Guise</hi> committed afterwards a greater; when after this little skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
having without opposition march'd over the rest of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
it had been no hard matter for him, had he made any haste,
to have overtaken the Duke, who march'd no faster than a trot;
whilst following leisurely after, without pressing him to fight, he
gave him leave to make his retreat in great security without the
loss of any, save some few of his worst mounted men. Thus the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> lost at once both the Town of <hi>St. Tropés,</hi> which
was a very good one, and the Governour, who was a Gentleman
of great worth and merit; the one by the prevailing Arms of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his
Enemies, and the other perhaps by his own fault: he was at least
condemn'd by his Friends, and Servants, for entring upon too light
grounds into a jealousie of this Gentleman's faith: And certainly if
ever we should make head against our diffidences, and mistrusts,
it ought chiefly to be, when we most labour under affliction and
disgrace; every thing at those times being suspected to us, and
our judgments, weakned by grief and disaster, being then most
apt to be impos'd upon by the lightest impressions.</p>
                  <p>After the taking in of these places, the Duke of <hi>Guise, l' Esdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres,</hi>
the <hi>Count de Carces,</hi> and the other Chiefs of the Enemies
Army retir'd themselves to <hi>Aix,</hi> there to deliberate about the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of <hi>Provence,</hi> and of the means by which they were to work
the Duke of <hi>Espernon's</hi> absolute, and final ruine. He had
at this time upon his hands at once the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>

and (which was of more dangerous consequence
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63412:102"/>
than all these known, and declared Enemies) his own Friends
and Followers were wavering and uncertain to him: yet, as if
all these, who were all men of great quality, and many of them
of great interest, and reputation in the Country, had been too
few to do his business, a wretched Fellow, bred from the Lees of
the common people, obscure, and of no name till then, would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
put his helping hand to the work; who alone, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible,
as he was, put the Duke into more manifest danger of his
life, than so many, and so powerful enemies arm'd, and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
to his ruine, as yet had ever done. His name was <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew
Bigne.</hi> a native of the fore-mentioned Village <hi>du Val,</hi> and a
near neighbour to <hi>Brignoles;</hi> whither the Duke having retir'd
himself after the loss of the before-mention'd places, and having
there assembled all his Forces together, to make head against what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
new attempts might be preparing against him;<note place="margin">A Plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s life.</note> this cursed
Villain, who had never received any particular injury from the
Duke, but meerly prompted on by the malignity of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and a national hatred against him, having long deliberated
by what way he might infallibly destroy the Duke, bethought
himself at last of this impious, and abominable mischief. He
shut up in two Chests three Quintals of Powder,<note place="margin">A Quintal is an hundred weight.</note> to purchase
which he had laid out all the mony he had, or could procure; and
having observ'd the place where the Duke usually kneeled at
Mass in the Church of <hi>Brignoles,</hi> he entreated the Curate thereof
to give him leave to bring the two Chests into his Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he pretended he had lock'd up the best of his Goods, to preserve
them from the hands of the Souldier: which the Curate readily
promis'd him he should, provided he might first search them, to
see what they contain'd: but <hi>Bigne</hi> finding that to be a condition,
that by no means suited with his Design, left off the Curate, and
seeing some other way was to be found out to bring his purpose to
pass, fell to hammering out new projects; which were the less
hard for him to contrive, by how much the same evil spirit, who
had suggested to him the heart, and boldness to meditate so great
a wickedness, was now also ready to prompt his invention, and
to instruct him how to execute his execrable purpose by a new
way, where his first design had fail'd. Out of hopes then of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
his business in the Church, he by the means of the Mistriss
of the House where the Duke lay, and with whom <hi>Bigne</hi> had
been formerly acquainted, wriggles himself into the company of
the Duke's Baker, and in discourse offers him three Sacks of Corn
to sell, where betwixt them the Bargain was soon strook up, and
that being done, the Traytor losing no time, the next day brings
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63412:102"/>
his three Sacks to the Duke's Lodgings, about the time he was to
come from Mass, and to go to dinner, and sets them in a little
place under the Chamber where the Duke us'd to eat. Where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had dispos'd them as he thought most conveniently for the
execution they were to do, he goes to seek out the Baker to come
look upon his Bargain. In every one of these Sacks he had put an
hundred pound of powder, with only a little Corn at the mouth
to serve for shew, that if by chance the first Sack that was open'd
should fail of its effect, no discovery might be made of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
but that they might go to the next. Amongst the powder in
every Sack he had convey'd the wheel-lock of a Pistol, ready
wound up, and tyed to the string of the Sack, after such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that it was impossible to open any one without pulling
down the spring that was fastned to the Cord, and giving fire to
the powder; the three Sacks also were set so near to one another,
that any one of them taking fire, the others would also blow up,
and so the three Quintals of Powder must infallibly play at once.
Things being thus order'd, <hi>Bigne</hi> waits near to the Duke's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
untill he was come in, and had the patience to stay till he saw
him set down to dinner; when having him now in the Trap, and
that the Duke, as he thought, could not possibly escape, he then
went to seek out the Baker, to make him at once the Traitor, and
the betrayed, and the innocent instrument of his own, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
ruine. The poor Baker was not hard to be found, at a time
of the day when usually all the Duke's domesticks met together;
so that having presently met him, <hi>Bigne</hi> goes along with him to
the Mistriss of the house, desiring her to open the door where
the Corn stood; which she accordingly doing, and he seeing
things now brought to that pass, that the effect was, as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable,
himself insensibly, and unobserv'd slips out of the House,
and got into the Fields, making with all diligence for <hi>Aix.</hi> The
Baker in the mean time, with two young fellows that belong'd to
him in his Office, went to visit the Sacks, where going to untye
the first, he had scarce toucht the string, but he was immediately
consum'd by the devouring flame: Neither did his men es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
any better; and the violence of the powder was so great,

was, that the Windows being all open, the flame found a passage
that way, and by that lost much of its force within; otherwise

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bigne,</hi> who from without the Town had seen his mine play,
believing the effect to be infallibly such, as he had propos'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
ran in all hast to <hi>Aix</hi> to carry the news of the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s certain death to the Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi> to whom withal he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
at large the whole circumstance of his design, not without
the amazement and horror of all that heard him, that any man
could be guilty of so barbarous and inhumane a fact. As for the
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> he was a man so well prepar'd beforehand
against all the accidents of fortune, that he soon recover'd the asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
this surprize had put him into; and doubting it might
be a stratagem of the Enemy in the disorder, and confusion, that
must necessarily attend so sudden a mischief, to make himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the place, made all the Souldiers he had in the Town imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to repair to their Arms; whilst himself mounted on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and attended by some Gentlemen his friends, went to visit
the several Posts of the City, to see that all was quiet there: where
having found all things right within, and that nothing of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
appear'd from without, it must of necessity be concluded
that the mischief arose, and that the Conspiracy must have been
made within the Walls of his own Lodgings. Diligent search
was there therefore presently made, and the woman of the house
examin'd, who ingenuously confess'd the bargain about the Corn
betwixt <hi>Bigne</hi> and the Baker by her means: whereupon they
desir'd to see the place where the Sacks had been set, but there
was neither Sacks, nor the men who had open'd them to be seen,
the fire having so consum'd them, that scarcely their bones could
be found. They then sent to <hi>Bigne</hi>'s house, who was fled, and
his house left void, his Goods and Family being remov'd to <hi>Aix</hi>
the night before: So that no further doubt being to be made of
the Author of the Fact, the Duke's heart began to be at rest;
which before was a little unquiet with the suspicion, that some of
his own people might have had a hand in the Plot.</p>
                  <p>Some who have made reflections upon the Duke's life, and the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63412:103"/>
many Accidents by which it had often been brought into extreme
danger (which were at least as many as any other great mans of
his time) have sometimes drawn the several hazards he has run,<note place="margin">Reflections upon the several dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s life.</note> into comparison with one another, as he himself amongst his
private friends (so pleasant is the memory of dangers past) upon
occasion delighted to do; though he ever declar'd the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> to be the greatest peril he had ever been in; next
to which he plac'd that of <hi>Corbie,</hi> where he confest his fear to
have been much greater, than in the former, though the business
never arriv'd at that degree of danger, that was manifest in the
other accidents of his life. As for the precipice of <hi>Lyons,</hi> the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-shot
before <hi>Aix,</hi> and the Mine of <hi>Brignoles</hi> but now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
though he acknowledg'd his danger in all those to have
been extreme, and that in all apperance, it was hardly possible
he could escape; yet the suddenness of them took away the sense,
and his good fortune, opportunely interposing betwixt him and
those mortal accidents, prevented his apprehension, and gave
him no time to fear; whereas in the other two, he had had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to see his approaching ruine, and death coming upon him in
all his ugly shapes, especially in the business of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> which
he could not consider as one, but a concatenation of many, and
those mortal dangers, that succeeded one another for above forty
hours together.</p>

<hi>Mounsieur d' Ossat,</hi> since Cardinal (a person equally to be
commended for the integrity of his life, and the excellency of his
learning) writ very bitter things to the prejudice of the Duke's
Loyalty and Honour; which, though by the care of some of the
Duke's Friends, they were supprest in the first impression of his

my self oblig'd not to suffer the publick to be impos'd upon by so
gross calumnies, and that it is my duty to interpose the truth in

enough to the King concerning the Duke, in his Letter of
the 22. of <hi>December,</hi> 1594. that having given Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the

concerning <hi>Mounsieur de Guise,</hi> and the Government of <hi>Provence,</hi>

bearing date the 17. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1596, writes thus, <q>

puts me in mind of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> concerning

he has sent to the King to make a tender of his submission, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63412:104"/>
obedience: but they do not know that at the same time he
he sent to <hi>Turin</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and to <hi>Milan</hi> to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
of <hi>Castile,</hi> of whom he had obtain'd 6000. Crowns,
that is to say, 5000. down, with which his Agents buy Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and Arms at <hi>Milan,</hi> and 55000 more by Bill of Exchange
to be return'd at <hi>Genoa;</hi> which is said to be two months ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of 30000. Crowns a month, given him by the Crown
of <hi>Spain,</hi> for being a good <hi>Frenchman,</hi> as he writes into these
parts, he will be so long as he has life, causing it to be reported
that the mony he receives at <hi>Milan</hi> is mony of his own, that he
has there in Bank; as if even to have a Bank of mony in a
Town belonging to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to think it there se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
were not a sign of no very good <hi>Frenchman.</hi> There has
been a rumor in these parts for some days that he has promis'd
<hi>Boulogne</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Thus writes the Cardinal <hi>d' Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat,</hi>
with many other things of the like injurious nature.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> saw all these invectives as soon almost
as they appear'd in Print, and though in his own nature he was a
man not much enclin'd to Books; yet the quality of the Author
having given a great reputation to this, he had a great desire to see
it, when, having it brought before him, and the place being turn'd
unto wherein he himself was concern'd, it could not be perceiv'd
that he was at all mov'd at the many reproaches he there found
against him: but on the contrary was so moderate and calm as
to say, <q>That he could by no means blame the Cardinal <hi>d' Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat</hi>
for what he had written; and that being employ'd, as he
was, by the King in the most weighty Affairs of the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> he had done no more, than his duty in giving his Majesty
a faithful accompt of what ever was reported to him: That
he knew very well many others at the same time talk'd of him
at the same rate, some out of spleen, and others perhaps out
of a belief the common bruit his Enemies had spread amongst
the people had begot in them: but that neither the one nor
the other said true. That indeed the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> (measuring his discontents
by the provocations he had received) had all of them often sent
to him, the first to offer him his protection, and the two last
their friendship and alliance. That he had been solicited by a
Religious of the Order of St. <hi>Francis</hi> on the behalf of the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> by a woman of quality, the world believ'd had a
great interest in him, from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and by the
Abbot of <hi>Cornac,</hi> since Abbot of <hi>Ville-Loin,</hi> a man of great dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
and prudence, from the Duke of <hi>Mayenne:</hi> but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declar'd,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63412:104"/>
and bound it with an Oath, that he had never hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
to any such practice; That in truth, seeing himself press'd
by his own particular enemies under the King's Authority, and
in his name, and that alone he could not long be able to make a
head against them, he had sometimes been in suspense what he
should do; and a little tempted by the advantageous conditions
these Princes had offer'd to him: but that notwithstanding
his Fidelity, and Duty, had ever so stoutly oppos'd his Interest,
and Passion, that he rather chose to surrender his Right to the
Government of <hi>Provence,</hi> and (which was far more insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
unto him) to quit the Field to his Enemies, than to
make a longer resistance, by joyning himself with Parties, and
Factions, contrary to his Majesties Service, and Interest.</q> All
which in the end he made so evident, that I cannot but admire, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so manifest a justification by his Actions, any body could be
so unjust, as to tax him with any intelligence with <hi>Spain.</hi> To
fortifie which so odious a Calumny, they ought at least to have
prov'd, that he had receiv'd from thence, or by their means,
some kind of Assistance in his Affairs; by whom had he been
secretly favour'd, would they have husbanded their favour so ill,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> not to have drawn from him some effectual acknowledgement,
and return, by the giving up some one at least of those places in
his custody into their hands? The same Cardinal says that he
had promis'd them <hi>Boulogne,</hi> though it was plain enough after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
how far he was from any such purpose; that he had receiv'd
mony from <hi>Spain,</hi> and that he pretended for his excuse, it came
out of his own Bank at <hi>Milan,</hi> where himself had before laid it up;
and that the one, and the other were almost equally criminal:
which were it true, no one could deny it to be a Crime. But to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this point, I would fain know what he did contrary to his
Majesties Service, after he receiv'd this mony; and whether he was
afterwards observ'd to favour that Faction more than before? No, it
was so much otherwise, that almost at the very same time the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
sent this intelligence against him, he went in person to the
King, where he put himself into his Majesties hands, without Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
or Reservation, to be absolutely at his disposal. Would the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> have been thus tamely cheated of his mony, without
speaking, had he parted with such a Sum? would he not have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
to all the world the Duke's infidelity, and unhandsome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage?
and would he not at least have seiz'd upon that Bank, the
Cardinal <hi>d' Ossat</hi> writes of at <hi>Milan,</hi> for his reimbursement?</p>
                  <p>Others have further added, that the Duke had a design to take
this opportunity of the Kingdoms distraction, to make himself
a Sovereign Prince in <hi>Provence:</hi> but let any one consider, whether
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63412:105"/>
after having conceiv'd so unjust, and so unruly an ambition, he
would not betimes, and before he had proceeded to matter of
Fact,<note place="margin">Other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies against the Duke.</note> have fortified himself by a correspondency, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with Foreign Princes, to have justified his usurpation? or
whether, in common discretion, he would not have confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself with those Factions at home that already brav'd the
lawful Authority? Yet is it most true, and it was evident to all the
world, that instead of doing the one, or the other, he fought with
all the power he had, and maintain'd the sharpest War he could
possibly maintain, both against the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> though back'd
with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces, and also against the League, of it self suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to have amaz'd man of less conduct and resolution. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true, that he would fain have kept, and maintain'd his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Provence</hi> against all pretenders, had it stood with the Kings
good liking; and that he was the longer before he could perswade
himself to give it up, hoping at some time or other, that his Majesty
reflecting upon his Services, might think him as worthy as any of
that Command: but at last, finding his expectation vain, and all he
could do, or say, ineffectual to the procuring of his Royal Consent,
he rather chose to quit claim to a Title his Majesty would not be
prevail'd with to approve, than by a longer obstinacy to oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

his Masters pleasure to the prejudice of his own duty.</p>
                  <p>Some who can endure no truths, but such as are couch'd in the
worst Characters, and that call all things flattery, which are not
offence, may perhaps think me too zealous in the Duke's justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but let such, before they too liberally determine, examine
the Arguments I have us'd in his behalf, whether there be in them
any thing forc'd, or uneasie to an unbyas'd judgment, or whether
any thing can be contradicted in all I have said. It has been an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
(almost to a rule) that the lives of great Favourites have
ever been the objects of the hatred, and envy of their own times;
an injustice that descending upon the Duke, not only in the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
forms of Calumny, but in an extraordinary stile, and with
greater demonstrations of malice to him, and his reputation,
than to any other of this, or of almost any other time before
him, I thought it a duty to truth, to him, and to posterity (now
that time has laid open the falsity of those slanders, that have been
publish'd against him) to discover the true causes, and reasons why
he so long persisted in the defence of his Government; and as far
as I am able, at least to rescue those actions from obloquy, which
all disinterested, and worthy men will, upon mature deliberation,
think worthy of all commendation and honour. A design, which
as I have impartially undertaken, so have I not herein made use
of my own Arguments but only made a faithful report of what I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63412:105"/>
have learn'd from the most unsuspected testimony, gather'd out
of the best Historians, or receiv'd from the Duke's own mouth,
who must of necessity know the truth as well as any, and much
better than those who writ at random of affairs: Neither do I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
why, what he himself reported for the justification of
those actions which were so unhappily interpreted should not be
of as good authority for him, as what was publish'd to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
by men who were profestly haters of his Person, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
emulous of his Name, and Fortune.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>

propositions made him by those who were enemies to the King,
would accept of no other protection, than what he expected from
his Majesties Justice, and Bounty, however incens'd against
him. In which resolution having set up his rest, he dispatch'd
away <hi>Guez</hi> his principal Secretary to the King, to carry him an
assurance of his Fidelity, and Obedience; who being arriv'd at
Court, was presented to his Majesty by the Marquiss <hi>de Roque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laure;</hi>
a man who in the Duke's severest persecution, and when
the tongue of calumny was most bitter against him, had ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
for him a most entire, and constant Friendship, and who
had made no difficulty in his Majesties greatest Passions (a time of
all other the most dangerous to dispute with Princes) to justifie,
and undertake for his Friends integrity, and to uphold his interest
with an admirable, and never enough to be commended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.
<hi>Guez</hi> then was by him no sooner brought into the Kings
presence, than his Majesty with a stern look presently told him,
that if himself to whom he was sent had no greater a kindness
for him, than his Master had, who had sent him, he should that
hour cause his head to be struck from his shoulders, and that he
much wonder'd a man of sense, as he was, durst come to him
from the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> whom he himself knew very well to
hold intelligence with his Enemies: To which <hi>Guez,</hi> who was
very well assur'd of the contrary, reply'd, that he would willingly
submit to the punishment his Majesty was pleas'd to threaten, if
the Duke was guilty of those things whereof he stood accus'd:
and that he came to his Majesty on the behalf of a Loyal Subject,
his most humble, and faithful Servant, who had rather chosen
to depend upon his Majesties Grace, and Favour, and to throw
himself at his feet without condition, than to accept of the most
advantageous offers, could by his Majesties Enemies be propos'd
unto him. After which the King having ask'd him if he might
rely upon his word, and <hi>Guez</hi> having by many protestations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
what he before had said, his Majesty resolv'd to receive
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63412:106"/>
the Duke into his favour, and a few days after dispatch'd away
<hi>Mounsieur de Roquelaure</hi> himself, the Duke's most intimate Friend,
to give him assurance, that he might with all freedom come to
Court, where from his Majesty he should receive all the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he could expect, or desire,</p>
                  <p>The Duke, without insisting upon greater precaution, or other
security, than what he found in his own Conscience, took his
journey to Court, and that with so absolute a confidence in his
Majesties Royal Word, that he would not so much as open the
Letters <hi>Mounsieur de Roquelaure</hi> brought him from the King;
but at his arrival restor'd them to his Majesty, seal'd up as they
were sent: by which generous behaviour, excuses, and reasons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given his Majesty full satisfaction in all things, he receiv'd
him into an honourable degree of Favour,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Favour.</note> and soon after gave
him the Government of the higher, and lower <hi>Limousin,</hi> in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
of that of <hi>Provence:</hi> A charge in truth that held no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with the other; but that nevertheless bordering upon
<hi>Xaintonge, Angoumois,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Aulins,</hi> which the Duke
already had, lay very convenient for him; and besides, by being
newly conferr'd upon him, gave the world to see, that his Majesty
did not look upon him as a Rebel. The King gave him moreover
100000 Crowns to defray part of the expense he had been at in
<hi>Provence;</hi> by which his Majesty seem'd to acknowledge it had
been there well employ'd, and it was assign'd him upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Thus did the Duke quit all his pretenses in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> and remain'd at Court with the King.</p>
                  <p>I could here speak of the enterprize of <hi>Marselles</hi> without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of digression, it having been executed by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
whilst the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was yet in <hi>Provence,</hi> and the rather
because the Sieges of <hi>St. Tropés,</hi> and <hi>Oriol,</hi> which were then in
his possession, serv'd much to palliate the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s Design:
but having no need to seek elsewhere, than in the particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

I shall, how great and shining soever that action was, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to make a further mention of it; the Historians of that time
having given accompts of it at large. And yet, whilst I omit the
main thing so pertinent to my Story, I cannot forbear to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a remarkable circumstance, which I have from a very good
hand, and that I doubt not will be acceptable to my Reader,
though it be utterly from the matter of my Subject.</p>
                  <p>After the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had put an end to his enterprize,<note place="margin">A digression upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable passage.</note> a
success of the greatest glory to himself, and importance to the
State, that could possibly have hapned at that time; he thought it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63412:106"/>
but reasonable to enjoy the fruits of his Victory, by giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a vacation from the hardships of War, to the softer delights
of Liberty and Ease; which made him seek out all the Diversions
the Town could afford, that any way suited with the appetite of
his youth and pleasure. The chiefest of which was the frequenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Gentlewoman in the City, of but moderate beauty, but
of so admirable a wit, as gave her, for a distinction of excellency
above the other women of the City, the name of the <hi>Marselles.</hi>
This Lady had formerly been a Mistriss of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s,
and was at this time highly courted by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> with
whom the Duke being one night very pleasant in her Lodging,
they there contriv'd a piece of mirth, which in the issue very much
fail'd their expectation. <hi>Grillon</hi> Camp-Master to the Regiment of

men of his time, and with good reason, the signal testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
he had in a thousand occasions given of his Valour approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

History. This Gentleman, after the recovery of <hi>Marselles,</hi> was
dismiss'd from the King to the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to be assisting to
him in his reputation, advice, and valour, for the conservation of
that place: for his Majesty well knowing what a longing, and
watchful eye his Enemies had upon that City, and himself also
being very tender of so important a place, would spare no cost,
not omit no care to preserve i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the door of his Lodging, runs himself up stairs into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where with a counterfeited distraction he hastily told him that
all was lost, that the Enemy had made himself Master of the
Port, and of the City, that they had forc'd the Guards, dispers'd
and beaten all that could make head against him; and that no
more resistance being to be made, he thought it better to retire,
than to add to their Enemies Victory by their own Ruine: that
therefore he was come to call him out, that they might make their
retreat together; to which purpose two Horses waited ready at
the door of his Lodging, and that he desir'd him to make hast,
lest they should be surpriz'd by the Enemy before they could find
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:63412:107"/>
means to escape. <hi>Grillon,</hi> though he had been fast asleep at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this false Alarm, and was yet scarce awake when the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> told him this story; yet, without being at all sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
he call'd for his cloaths, and his Arms, saying withal, that
too easie credit was not to be given to reports in the tumult, and
confusion of Alarms; but, that should the intelligence prove
true, it were far more honourable to die with their Swords in
their hands, than to survive the loss of such a City: which being
all the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> could get from him, he not being to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
out of that resolution, they went together out of the
Chamber; when being in the middle of the stairs, the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to hold no longer, burst out into laughter: by which
<hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

grasping the Duke by the Arm, and rapping out a terrible Oath,
the usual preface to all his discourses, he said, <hi>Young man, never
make it your sport to try the Courage of a man of Honour; for by the
Death, hadst thou made in me a discovery of fear, or surprize, I would
have stabh'd my Dagger into thy heart;</hi> and so return'd back into
his Chamber, without more words. This Story which I have
from a very good hand, a person of Quality, who had it from the
Duke of <hi>Guise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s</hi> own mouth, I thought too remarkable to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slipt:
Neither do I think <hi>Grillon</hi> to be less esteem'd for this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ally of
fury, which appears however to be wrap'd up in very good sense,
than in the constancy of his courage, that would not consent he
should retire from, or out-live the loss of so important a City.
And since I have spoken of the blasphemies that were so frequent
in his mouth, I shall tell you what I have heard the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>
say, who had him long under his command; which is,
that many years before his death, though he had a perfect strength
and vigour in all his other parts, he had nevertheless so great a
weakness in his tongue, that he could not articulate, or bring out
one word that any body could understand. God b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pleas'd by a manifest judgment to punish him in that part, which
by so many Oaths and Blasphemies had so often offended against
his Divine Honour, and most Holy Name.</p>

                  <p>Amongst the many opinions that were deliver'd in the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
Council abovt this Affair, the ill Fortune of <hi>France</hi> would
have the counsel of a <hi>Frenchman</hi> to prevail; that by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one of her own Sons, this Kingdom might receive the
greatest dishonour it could possibly sustain. And this was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Rhosne</hi> a Gentleman born in <hi>Champagne</hi> upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Lorain,</hi> one, who having in the infancy of the League
devoted himself to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and done him many sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
services in his life; after his death persevering in the evil cause
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63412:109"/>
he had before embrac'd, had put himself under the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> and so far his too violent zeal to Religion; or the error
of his judgment (which might be deluded amongst the rest) were
rather to be excus'd, and pittied, than his carriage absolutely to be
condemn'd: but after the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> was reduc'd to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and had given up his cause, his yet engaging himself with
the King's most implacable enemies made it manifest to all, that
his turbulent spirit would stick at no mischief he could any ways
effect against his Prince and Country. This man then discredit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Cardinals Council all the diversions had been there
propos'd, as by making an attempt upon <hi>St. Quintin, Montreuille,
Boulogne,</hi> or <hi>Guise,</hi> gave advice to fall upon <hi>Calice,</hi> at the same
time offering himself to be the man that would undertake, and
accomplish the design. A proposition of so high,<note place="margin">A design up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Calice.</hi>
                     </note> and generous
a nature, that the Cardinals ambition, which was bent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

some noble atchievement, being fir'd thereby, he was afterwards
deaf to all other Counsels, and so wholly bent upon an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
so suitable to the greatness of his mind, that without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay he gave immediate order to dispose all things for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of that design. To which end his Army was forthwith
drawn into the Field, and there divided into three several bodies,
to amuse the King, and to keep him in doubt of the course he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to steer: a policy not very necessary to the concealment
of his design, it being impossible any one could imagine he durst
so much as meditate the thoughts of an enterprize, which, to
all mens astonishment, he so suddenly effected, that the King had
no sooner intelligence of his motion, but that withal news was
brought him of the loss of the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bidossan</hi> Governour of <hi>Calice,</hi> surpriz'd with so unexpected a
Siege, was in a few days reduc'd to so great an extremity, that he
was forc'd to dispatch a Post to the King, to acquaint his Majesty
with the Articles of his capitulation, which was to make a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
surrender, if within six days he was not reliev'd: at which
unhappy, and unexpected news, his Majesty being beyond all
expression afflicted, he advanc'd with all diligence as far as <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi>
in hope that the convenient vicinity of that place would
give him some opportunity or other to send in some relief to the
besieged before the time of limitation should expire: neither did
he fail to try all possible ways by which he conceiv'd it might be
done; but all in vain, the contrary winds by Sea, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
vigilancy by Land still frustrating what ever endeavour he
could use: when one sole Servant of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s
had the good hap beyond all humane expectation to put himself
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63412:110"/>
into the place, Fortune being (it should seem) resolv'd by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

this occasion. The man whose resolution was so eminent in this
affair, was commonly call'd the black<note n="*" place="margin">Or youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Cadet, a Gentleman of
the house of <hi>Campagnol,</hi> who bravely undertook, and as bravely
perform'd the Action. His elder Brother by the Duke's Favour,
was preferr'd to be Captain of a Company in the Regiment of
Guards, and his own Lieutenant in the Government of <hi>Boulogne,</hi>
as this also had a Company in the Regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> with
which he had likewise been gratified by the Dukes Bounty. This
Gentleman no sooner receiv'd intelligence of the Enemies motion
towards <hi>Calice,</hi> but that he immediately repair'd to his Brother at
<hi>Boulogne,</hi> where he was at his Majesties arrival there, and where
his courage not permitting him to sit still in so general a conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
as appear'd in all persons about the King, he made a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
offer of himself to pass through the Enemies Guards into
the Town of <hi>Calice,</hi> with any number of men his Majesty
would please to commit to his charge, or to perish in the attempt.
The valour of the man was so well try'd, and known, that the
King doubted not in the least of his performance to the utmost of
what could by man be done: but the danger was such,<note n="*" place="margin">

                        </gap>o De Thou.</note> that
his Majesty was very unwilling to expose so brave a Gentleman to
so manifest a ruine; yet such was his importunity, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of such importance, that at last three hundred men only were
assign'd him, with which, by the favour of the night, and his own
good conduct, he arriv'd safe at <hi>Calice,</hi> without the loss of so much
as any one man; so that certainly had he carried a more consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
number of men, the Town had been sav'd: but as the case
then stood the must content himself with the honour of his own
bravery, without reaping any other benefit from the success of
his attempt. The term of six days being expir'd, the Enemy sent
to summon the Town to a surrender, according to the Articles of
Capitulation betwixt them; to which summons they had no
other return than this, that the besieg'd were now acquit of their
promise, and that they had receiv'd a relief; an answer at which
<hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>osne</hi> being more enrag'd than the Arch-Duke himself, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
caus'd the Cannon to play with greater fury, than at any
time before during the Siege; when a sufficient breach being made,
he prepar'd the Army for a general assault. The assault was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
given, in the beginning of which <hi>Bedossan</hi> being slain,
<hi>Campagnol</hi> took upon him his Authority, and Command, giving
the Enemy after two hours sharp fight a brave, and notable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:63412:110"/>
which notwithstanding the breach was so wide as was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
long to be defended, by so few men as he had left; which
made the Enemy by frequent Messages often put him in mind of
what he himself knew as well as they, by representing to him the
desperate condition the place was in, and his own inevitable ruine
should be longer persist in his defense; offering him at the same
time conditions of Honour, and Advantage if he would deliver
up the Town: but all to no purpose, he had not put himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that place with so much hazard of his life to depart thence in so
great security: the assault therefore was again renew'd, and the
Enemy again beaten back: but coming up the third time with
greater fury than ever before, and bringing up still fresh Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to succeed those who were beaten off, <hi>Campagnol</hi>'s men were
in fine overcome by numbers, and constrain'd to retire; a thing
their Captain scorn'd to do, who, though alone and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
by all, still fought with the same courage, and vigour, when
his resistance, how brave soever, being too weak to stop the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of a victorious crowd, he was at last rather overwhelm'd
than overcome, and by a multitude taken prisoner: with this
resemblance nevertheless betwixt his honour and disgrace, that, as
he had appear'd single in the defense of the Town, so was he also
alone in his imprisonment, the Enemy killing all that fled before
them without humanity, or respect of persons, excepting of his,
who had so undauntedly stood alone in his defense, wherein his
Vertue was his refuge. <hi>D' Avila</hi> attributes this Action to the <hi>Sieur
de Matelet,</hi> whom he qualifies Governour of <hi>Foix,</hi> although
Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> in his description of this Siege, <hi>Mounsieur de
Thou,</hi> and <hi>D' Aubigné</hi> make no mention of any such man. Yet it
is true that <hi>Matelet</hi> had so great a share in the business, as ought
not to be pass'd over without its due report of honour; for the
King having commanded him with an hundred Gentlemen of
his Court to cut his way through the Enemies Army during the
heat of the Assault, and to put himself into the Town, it was no
fault of his that his Majesty fail'd of his desire: he did what was
by valour to be done, though he was not so fortunate as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his Majesties command; neither was the Enemies Army so
thin, but that they had men enough to maintain the Assault, and
at the same time to intercept such petty succours as those: so that
those hundred Gentlemen were almost all cut to pieces with very
little resistance; a panick fear having made them blind to their
own safety, and honour, excepting <hi>Matelet,</hi> who bravely fighting
as fortunately escap'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus was <hi>Calice</hi> lost, the King himself in a manner looking
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:63412:111"/>
on; after which <hi>Guines</hi> and <hi>Ham</hi> were carried without resistance:
successes with which <hi>Rhosne</hi> being yet unsatisfied, he had moreover
the confidence to undertake the Siege of <hi>Ardres,</hi> which the same
day that <hi>la Fere</hi> was surrendred to the King, surrendred also to
him; as if he had been in fee with Fortune, and that she had been
oblig'd to give him all the respite was necessary for the execution
of his Designs: for in effect, the same day that concluded the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
Conquests, had in all probability determin'd of his honour,
and put a ruinous period to all his Affairs, had his successes gone
on with never so little a slower pace.</p>
                  <p>The King in the whole course of his life,<note place="margin">Anno 1597.</note> was never perhaps
more astonish'd, and afflicted, than at these disgraces; and his
great spirit was prone enough to prompt him on to an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
revenge, by obstinately settling himself to the recovery of the
Places he had lately lost, since the Cardinal's sudden retreat had
put him out of all possibility of fighting: but his prudence lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before him the difficulty of the enterprize, he rather chose to
give his Army some refreshment, which had been tir'd out with
the tedious Siege of <hi>la Fere,</hi> than anew to expose them to other
dangers, and such as were like enough to be the ruine of them all.
Wherefore having distributed them into the most commodious
quarters upon the Frontier, to be in readiness against the next fair
season, he left the <hi>Mareschal de Biron</hi> to command them, with
order upon the first opportunity, to enter into the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and to make them feel his Majesties Arms, whilst himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to <hi>Paris,</hi> to consult with his Subjects, about the means he
was to pursue in the vindication of his own, and the Nations ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
for the Attempts the Enemy had made upon his Crown,
and Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The King being come to <hi>Paris,</hi> and either not expecting, or
not finding that readiness, or ability he expected in his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
who having been harrass'd, and impoverish'd with past mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
were now very unfit to supply him with mony, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to the greatness of his designs: he saw he must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
have recourse to Strangers, his ancient Consederates, and
Allies: to which purpose he dispatch'd away Ambassadors to
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and to
some Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> during which Negotiations, the
Pope, who from the month of <hi>September,</hi> 1595. had given the
King Absolution in the persons of <hi>Messieurs du Perron,</hi> and <hi>d' Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat,</hi> his Majesties Agents at <hi>Rome,</hi> desiring now to see an effectual
re-establishment of the Catholick Religion in <hi>France,</hi> and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of such abuses as were crept into the Church, during
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:63412:111"/>
the disorders of the Kingdom, resolv'd upon sending a Legat at
this time, to appoint what was necessary to be done for his entire
satisfaction.<note place="margin">The Pope sends his Legat into <hi>France.</hi>
                     </note> Neither was this the only, though the principal end
of this dispatch, this good, and holy Pope having further a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to set on foot a Treaty of Accommodation betwixt the two
Crowns; conceiving he did not fully discharge the Duty of the
Common Father of Christians, if, after having given repose to
the King's Conscience, he did not also procure a good, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>To this good end Cardinal <hi>de Medicis</hi> the Pope's Legat fail'd
not, according to his Instructions, so soon as he arriv'd in
<hi>France,</hi> to offer some propositions of Reconciliation betwixt the
two Crowns; which, though well receiv'd by the King, yet did
they not hinder him from making his preparations for a smart, and
vindictive War: he had (as has been said) renew'd his Alliances
with his Confederates, and had further call'd an Assembly of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
the most intelligent persons of his Kingdom, by their joynt
advice to find out the most easie, and indifferent ways of raising
mony upon his people for the prosecution of the War; which As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
by reason of the Plague which was that year exceeding
rise in <hi>Paris,</hi> being not conveniently there to be Assembled, his
Majesty transferr'd it to <hi>Roan,</hi>

                     </note> where they opened their Session in
<hi>October,</hi> and continued it to the beginning of the ensuing year.
The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had the honour to attend his Majesty in
this Voyage, and was also made privy to whatsoever pass'd in
the Assembly, where many grave directions were propos'd for
the Reformation of several Abuses that were practis'd in all parts
of the Kingdom; but very little satisfaction to the King concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mony, which was the main design in calling that Assembly,
rather than reformation of abuses: which notwithstanding his
Majesty wounded with the grief of his losses, what by husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Revenue, what by lessening his Expense, by augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon his Farms, and other extraordinary ways made shift to
get up such a stock, as was enough to set a powerful Army on
foot, and such a one as should be sufficient to repair all his former
disgraces.</p>
                  <p>After the dissolution of this Assembly, his Majesty retiring
himself for some indisposition into the Air of the Country, the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> conceiv'd he could not take a fitter opportunity
than this, to ask leave to go look after his own particular Affairs,
and to settle his Governments in a posture of Security, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
a request no sooner made to the King, but that he gave
his free consent, dismissing the Duke with all demonstration of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63412:112"/>
respect and kindness; and then it was that his Patent was seal'd
for the Government of <hi>Limousin,</hi> instead of <hi>Provence,</hi> and dated
at <hi>Folembray,</hi> a house of Pleasure, to which his Majesty had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
himself to provide for his health at greater liberty and ease.
With this new Commission the Duke then departed from Court
towards <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> where his Children were bred, which he
had scarce seen since their Birth, especially the youngest whom he
had never seen; a motive of it self sufficient for a longer Journey:
but neither the repose the Duke intended to take, nor the vacati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Majesty intended to give, were of any long continuance;
for he was scarce arriv'd at <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> when he receiv'd a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
under the Kings own hand (his Majesty not at all thinking
it below his Greatness, that his Nobility should receive the Honour
of his Commands immediately from himself) wherein he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with the surprizal of <hi>Amiens,</hi> as also of his resolution
suddenly to sit down before it, for the recovery of so important
a place: at the same time conjuring him to make all possible
haste to come, and serve him in so glorious an occasion.</p>

wherein they all agree that it was a design the best contriv'd,
the braveliest carried on, and the most fortunately perform'd of
any whatever of that kind.</p>
                  <p>The nearness of this place to <hi>Paris,</hi> it being but three little days
journey from thence, having alarm'd the <hi>Parisians</hi> to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that they thought the <hi>Spaniard</hi> already at their Gates, begat
such clamours, and publick complaints amongst the people, that
every one made very bold with the Royal Name, accusing the
King, as if he had held intelligence with the Enemy, and as if
he alone were the Author of this mischance: so that as if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
had not been sufficiently afflicted with the loss of this City
(which more concern'd him, than them all) he must also endure
the unjust reproaches of his Subjects; the little respite he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the recovery of his health, passing, in minds prepossess'd
with fear, for supineness, and sloth; and his love to the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess
of <hi>Beaufort</hi> giving every one occasion to censure, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn

and pleasure, whilst the Enemy was in action, taking, and
surprizing his best Towns, and Cities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:63412:112"/>It was therefore necessary for the King without further delay to
betake himself again to Arms, and that (equally stirr'd up by
his own immediate danger, and the clamours of his people) he
should abandon the care of his health, to go expose his life to
the hazards of War and Sickness. It was upon the tenth day of
<hi>March,</hi> that <hi>Amiens</hi> had been surpriz'd, upon notice whereof, his
Majesty without loss of time, had writ to the <hi>Mareschal de Biron,</hi>
(who (as has been said) he had left upon the Frontier) that he
should with all expedition, gather the Army together, and to sit
down before <hi>Amiens</hi> to begin the Siege. A command that could
not have been sent to a more diligent, a braver, or more able
Souldier; and one, who so well knew how to manage such En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
and provisions of War, as the King (who himself was
advanc'd as far as <hi>Corbie</hi>) had taken care to send him; that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

                     </gap> his arrival before the place found nothing wanting, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
he could at a distance have desir'd; or have order'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
had he been there in person. A diligence his Majesty did
highly, and publickly commend, giving the <hi>Mareschal</hi> a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Character for the progress he had made in his works, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
which could not have been perform'd by any with
greater care, courage, and conduct, according to all the Rules
and Discipline of War. Neither is it to be denied, but that <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
serv'd the King as bravely, as is to be imagin'd upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion:
wherein he also knew well enough, if not too well, his
own merit; his brave Service in this, and other occasions having
rais'd him to that degree of presumption, and insolence, that he
afterwards, by his saucy reproaches to the King his Master, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
himself of those Honours, and Rewards, his Valour might
otherwise, with great justice have expected; and his vanity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
those actions, which modestly carried would have been his
immortal glory, into the instruments of his disgrace, and ruine:
of which in its due place I shall give a more full accompt, as also
of every circumstance that helpt to precipitate him into those
misfortunes whereinto he afterwards fell: and that because his
Interests went, for many years hand in hand, with those of the
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> they two being link'd together in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
strict League of Affection, and Friendship.</p>
                  <p>The King during his abode at <hi>Corbie,</hi> having taken care to send
such numbers of men, as the <hi>Mareschal de Biron</hi> stood in need
of for carrying on the Siege, return'd back to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to take
order about Artillery for the Leaguer, and mony for the support
of his Army; when all things being ready in <hi>Iune,</hi> his Majesty
accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> the <hi>Count de Soissons,</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:63412:113"/>
the Constable <hi>de Montmorency,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> the
Prince of <hi>Ioinville,</hi> and many other Lords of great quality,
advanc'd himself to the Siege. Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> who is very
exact in the description of this Leaguer, has, amongst the rest,
nam'd the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> for one of those who attended his
Majesty in this expedition: a mistake I do not so much wonder
at in him, who of necessity must take many things upon trust, as
I do at <hi>d'Avila,</hi> who says the same thing, and yet pretends to have
been present, and wounded at this Siege; when it is most certain
the Duke was not there. I would not willingly deprive him of
any honour is his due; neither would I attribute to him contrary
to the known truth, things wherein he had no share: but the
truth is, the Duke was so long in making his preparation, and
would come in so handsome an equipage to the Army, that it
was two days after the surrender of the place, before he came up to
the King:<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> comes to the King at <hi>Amiens.</hi>
                     </note> perhaps one of the worst occurrences, and that did
him the greatest prejudice of any that befel him in his whole life;
it being certain, that if, in this expedition, he had by greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
express'd to his Majesty the real Passion he had for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he had so blotted out of his memory, all former jealousies,
and discontents, that no ill office could ever after have done him
harm: whereas his Enemies took now occasion to possess the King,
that he had either staid to expect the issue of this Siege, to make
his own use of such disorders in the State, as must necessarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any ill success; or that (at the best) he had a mind the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Affairs should fall into the last necessity, by that means to put
a greater value upon his own Service: So that although he arriv'd
very seasonably for the recruit of the Royal Army, very much
tir'd, and worn out with the length of the Siege, and that he
brought along with him 300. Horse, an hundred and fifty Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebusiers
on horseback, and four Regiments of Foot, as well
equipt as men could be: yet was not his reception such, as he
had good reason to expect, his zeal to the Service having made
him lose the honour of the Service it self. It was nevertheless but
two days after the King's entry into <hi>Amiens,</hi> that the Duke came
up to the Army; by which it appears he did not in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lie expecting the event of the Siege, having been a month
upon his March; neither did he long lie idle after he was come,
for ambitious by some notable Action to make amends for his
former default,<note place="margin">A surprize design'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Arras.</hi>

                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:63412:113"/>His Majesty after the surrender of <hi>Amiens</hi> staid no longer there
than was requisite for the ceremony of his entry, but put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
immediately in pursuit of the Enemy; to let them see, that
notwithstanding he had been so drain'd of men, he was yet
strong enough to remove the Scene of War to their own doors;
when, being advanc'd with his Army as far as <hi>Arras,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi> took those Forces he had brought, and advanc'd to
give a Scalado to a Fort, that was a little separated from the main
wall of the City; which he assaulted with such vigour and
bravery in his own person, that his men encourag'd by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
soon made themselves masters of the place. A success that
gave the Inhabitants, and Garrison of <hi>Arras</hi> so great an Alarm,
that they all ran to that side to beat the Duke back, and to secure
that part of their Walls; where betwixt them the conflict grew
so hot, that the <hi>Mareschal de Biron,</hi> who was at the same time to
Petarre one of the Gates of the City, had all leisure to perform it,
without any danger from the Curtain. And accordingly his first
Petard play'd, and to so good effect, that it laid all flat, which
shut up the Raveline: The second beat down the Draw-Bridge,
and carried away the bottom of the Portcullice it self, though by
the Petard's being fixt too low, the perpendicular Bars remain'd
yet long enough to defend the passage, when the third Petard being
brought up (which doubtless had it play'd, had put an end to the
Dispute) and the Engineer just ready to give fire, he was from
the top of the Gate taken upon the head with a stone; by which
blow Man and Engine were both beaten headlong into the
Ditch: an accident by which they were put to look out for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
but in vain. there being never another to be found. In the
mean time the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who was still fighting with the
Enemy, had no little to do to make head against the Forces of so
great, and populous a City; which nevertheless he bravely did
until the <hi>Mareschal de Biron</hi> sending him word of his misfortune,
desir'd him to retire, as himself was constrain'd to do for want of
a fourth Petard.</p>

of this Enterprize, where he adds one thing that is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and very true, and that is, that the Mareschal enrag'd to the
last degree, at the miscarriage of so brave a design, went up and
down cursing, and swearing, and railing at the King before all the
Army, and almost to his own face, that he had made him fail
in the conquest of so important a place for want of a Petard, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
him of Avarice, where his Honour and Safety were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
whilst he was prodigiously Profuse in the entertainment
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63412:114"/>
of his Mistrisses, and in the procurements of his own desires: Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
that, how indiscreetly soever spoken, was maliciously
enough soon convey'd to the King's ear, and which I have heard
the Duke say, perhaps sowed the first seeds of hatred in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
heart against him: Neither did the Duke fail, like a true
friend, to conjure him into a better government of his passion,
left his wild tongue might at some time or other, be the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his own ruine; although whatever power he might have
with him in other things, (as with a man that still mindful of the
Duke's past obligations, when his favour had given him many
opportunities to express his affection to him, was much at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion)
yet could he never so govern the unbridled fierceness of

of that kind.</p>
                  <p>As the surprizal of <hi>Amiens</hi> had suspended all propositions of
Peace,<note place="margin">Anno 1598.</note> that had before been preferr'd by the Pope's Legat, so did
the retaking of it (almost of course) set them again on foot; for
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> seeing he had not been able to keep a place of that
importance when he had it in his hands, and apprehending by
that, the King's Power (which had been sufficiently manifested at
this Siege) would now extend it self into their own Territories,
to the danger of their strongest, and best Towns, of themselves

Persons of great Quality, that were also solemniz'd at the same

the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was not immediately concern'd, I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insist upon that of the Duke of <hi>Montpensier</hi> who contracting
himself to so near a Relation of the Duke's, that he, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
supply'd the place of a Father to her, it will be necessary I
should say something of the reasons, and conclusion of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Match.</p>
                  <p>The King since the Duke's return from <hi>Provence,</hi> had never
exceeded to him the favour of meer justice; he had, it is true, left
him free in the enjoyment of his Offices, his Estate, and Degree,
without doing him any the least injury in any thing that was his
just, and immediate right: But as to the rest, his Majesty not
being able to forget his formention'd discontents against him,
he thought he did him a signal favour, in that he forbore to do
him any publick disgrace. In this condition, the Duke, who saw
himself seated at Court in a station far inferiour to that wherein
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63412:115"/>
he had formerly been, suffer'd not a little in his own bosom from
the King's coldness, and indifferency to him: yet concealing his
discontent with the true respect he ought to pay his Prince, and
Master, he avoided, at least, all occasions (the only refuge of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
Minister) that might any way bring him into a greater
disgrace: Yet even in this condition his fortune would not forsake
him, who, when all other means seem'd to be lost, that could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
restore him to any degree of his former prosperity, sprung
him a new tide to his stranded greatness, and such an one, as not
only lifted him off those sands wherein he was like to sink, and
perish, but rais'd him again to such a reputation, as was no little
support to his declining name, and power.</p>

added that of the great Favourite the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> as she also
was in expectation of that of the Cardinal <hi>de Ioyeuse</hi> her Uncle;
which reckon'd altogether must needs make up so vast an estate,
as must without dispute, entitle her the greatest Fortune of
<hi>France.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Montpensier</hi> likewise, as born a Prince of the
Blood, was also in high consideration, wherein the advantage of
his Fortune concurr'd with the eminency of his Birth, he having
alone a greater Revenue, than all the other Princes of the Blood: to
which his Valour, Liberality, and Courtesie, with other good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
he was Master of, had rais'd him to a very great esteem with
the King, and made him no less a Favourite to the People: so
that he was not only the Aim and Ambition of the best Matches
of <hi>France;</hi> but stood also in the prospect of some Forein Princes:
Amongst these the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> proceeded so far, as to offer
him his Daughter (who was afterwards Married to the Duke of
<hi>Cleve</hi>'s) with eight hundred thousand Crowns to her Dowry: a
proposition that, being debated in the Duke of <hi>Montpensier</hi>'s
Council, was very much lik'd of by some of his Servants, who
advis'd him to prefer this Match to the other Inheretrix of the
House of <hi>Ioyeuse;</hi> the fortune of the last, being part of it yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending;
whereas the offers of the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> being present,
and effectual, would very much advance his Affairs, and establish
his greatness at great liberty and ease. I have been inform'd, and
that by a person of Quality, who was consulted about this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that one main reason which induc'd this Prince to prefer
<hi>Madam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Duke of <hi>Esperno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

should at the same time espouse her Uncles Interests; from whose
Authority he promis'd to himself greater assistance, and support,
than from any other Peer of the Kingdom. A consideration that,
prevailing above all other with the Duke of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> dispos'd
him determinately to resolve upon this Match, to which, by a
particular li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing, he was before enclin'd. Wherefore having
without further deliberation caus'd it, by some Friends of his,
to be propos'd to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> the motion was by him,
who took it for a great honour, receiv'd with all imaginable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and as readily consented to; by which the Duke being
encourag'd, proceeded further to move it to the King himself;
not without some apprehension nevertheless, that the aversion
his Majesty daily discover'd to the Duke might raise some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
at the first overture of his design, though his fear prov'd
vain: for his Majesty seeing it would be a Match of considerable
advantage to his Kinsman, and in his heart acknowledging the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to be a Subject of great merit, though, for
some private discontents, not very acceptable to himself, was not
unwilling to oblige both the one, and the other, by giving his
free consent.</p>
                  <p>By this Marriage the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Affairs were not a
little improv'd, and if, on the one side, he (by the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his desert) had preferr'd his Niece before the Daughter of a
Sovereign Prince; she on the other side, by a very good return
was acquit of that obligation, by introducing her Uncle into the
relation and support of a great Prince of the Blood, by whose
means he was soon after honour'd with a very near alliance to
the Royal Family.</p>
                  <p>The Feasting,<note place="margin">Anno 1599.</note> and other entertainments of the Court, did
not so wholly take up the King, that his Majesty was not never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
very intent upon his Affairs, he had a mind to see an end
of the Treaty with <hi>Savoy,</hi> which was not yet dispatch'd, though
it had been compriz'd in the Peace concluded betwixt the two
Crowns at <hi>Vervins:</hi> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had desir'd some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
to consider before he would Seal; which having been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, and he not being able to perswade himself to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of those places he had, contrary to the publick Faith,
surpriz'd during the disorders of the State, as by the Articles of
the Treaty he had been oblig'd to do: he had no mind, to put a
thing to Arbitration he was certain that way never to obtain, and
that he was likewise resolv'd never to part withal. The Pope
whom himself had nam'd Arbiter of all differences betwixt the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63412:116"/>
King, and him, was so far disoblig'd by the diffidence he
had manifested of his equal judgment (which the Duke had cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
published to that end) that his Holiness had excus'd himself
from intermedling any more betwixt them; a thing that having
fall'n out according to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s hearts desire, he resolv'd
now upon a Journey into <hi>France,</hi> to try if by his submissions to
the King, his dexterity with his Ministers, or his liberalities in
his Court, he could not procure, or purchase that, to which he
could with no shew of equity otherwise pretend: but all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
prov'd vain, and his hopes were deluded, as they were like
to be in a Court where the King himself was alone the greatest,
and wisest part of the Council; he must first corrupt him, or at
least very much deceive him, before he could perswade him to
consent to any thing prejudicial to his Crown, and Honour. The
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> then, being able to effect nothing by artifice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
at last upon returning into his own Dukedom: yet, that
his Journey might not be altogether without fruit, he first caus'd
the <hi>Mareschal de Biron</hi> to be dealt withal, a man whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
his many discontents had laid open to his temptation; and
him he first tasted by <hi>Lafin,</hi> the same who had made himself a
Mediator betwixt the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> and <hi>l'Esdiguieres</hi> in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> begins to practice with the <hi>Mareschal de Biron.</hi>
                     </note> and who therein had abus'd them both. This fellow of a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent unquiet Spirit, and one of those who had rather be doing
mischief, than not to be doing at all, was of late wrigled into the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Favour, and had tasted of his bounty; by which he
was qualified to offer from the Duke one of his Daughters to the
<hi>Mareschal de Biron</hi> in Marriage, and with her several Seigniories to
be held in Sovereignty, with the assistance of the Forces both of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> to maintain him in <hi>Burgundy:</hi> A Province con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
to their own Territories. Allurements so fitted to <hi>Birons</hi>
ambitious and mutinous nature, that he lent a willing ear to those
dangerous propositions, and, as some have believ'd, engag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without much Ceremony in the Treason, which prov'd at last
his dishonour and ruine.</p>
                  <p>This practice with <hi>Biron</hi> was the only thing the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
with all his policy, effected in <hi>France:</hi> which nevertheless he
thought to be of such moment, as made him afterwards refuse
to give the King that satisfaction he had promis'd, and so to build
upon the confidence of <hi>Biron</hi>'s revolt, that having, before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from <hi>Paris,</hi> engag'd either to surrender to his Majesty the
Marquisate of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> or <hi>la Bresse,</hi> with other Dominions at his
own choice in lieu thereof, and within three months time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it; he had now no more regard to his word: neither would
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63412:116"/>
do the one nor the other, which oblig'd the King to seek that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
by force of Arms, he could by no other means obtain,
as he evidently saw by the delays and equivocations of this subtle
Prince.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty had before he resolv'd upon this expedition been
sufficiently enform'd of what means had been us'd to corrupt the
<hi>Mareschal de Biron:</hi> but whether it were that he really believ'd the
<hi>Mareschal</hi> had been deaf to all such propositions; or that by the
testimony of an entire confidence in his Loyalty this generous
Prince would oblige a Subject to continue firm in his duty, who
by his brave Service had deserv'd so well of the Crown, and to
look back into his error, before he was gone too far; he gave
him the Command of an Army against the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with orders to enter by the way of his own Government of
<hi>Burgundy</hi> into <hi>Bress;</hi> in which employment <hi>Biron</hi> so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
his practice, and so smartly pursu'd the War, that no action
of his confess'd, the least intelligence with the Enemy. <hi>L'Esdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres</hi> also, who at the same time enter'd by the way of <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiné</hi> into <hi>Savoy,</hi> by his Valour, and conduct made so consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
advances into that Dutchy, that betwixt them in few days
all the Territories the <hi>Savoyard</hi> possess'd on this side the <hi>Alpes,</hi> were
over-run by the Royal Arms, except <hi>Montmelian,</hi> which was not
but by Siege to be reduc'd.</p>
                  <p>It was in this occasion of <hi>Montmelian</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>
did the King a very signal service: A place reputed so strong,
and that had been so fortified, and furnish'd, with all provisions
of War by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that he was nothing startled at his
other losses, as supposing this City to be an inexpugnable Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
against whatever could be attempted against him. A confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
wherein he found himself very much mistaken; for the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> having the command of one quarter at this
Siege, as <hi>Biron</hi> and <hi>L' Esdiguieres</hi> had of the other two, whilst
they were on all hands busie in their approaches, found opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
sometimes to confer with the <hi>Count de Brandis</hi> Governour of
the place, interviews, that being frequent, and allow'd by the
King, wrought at last so good an effect, that the Governour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to surrender the City to the King, if within a month the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did not raise the Siege. A Capitulation of that
dangerous importance to the Duke that he labour'd by all possible
ways, during the limited term to perswade the Governour into a
better resolution, and had so wrought upon him, what by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
promises, and threats, that he was grown infinitely waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and uncertain what to do; which notwithstanding the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:63412:117"/>
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> who had drawn the first plot of this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, happily brought it to perfection in the end; he absolutely
confirm'd by his perswasion the anxious Count in the terms of
his first Treaty, and thereupon receiv'd new Hostages from him:
by which dexterity he rendred himself the principal, and most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
instrument of his Majesties victories in that Country, as
also of the Peace which immediately follow'd the Surrender of
this important City.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the King's Designs succeeded at this fortunate rate in
this little Dukedom, the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> apprehending, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ruine of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the sweetness, and facility of
that Conquest would tempt the King to advance further into
the Country to seek new Victories, were instant with the Pope to
interpose his Authority with the King, to dispose his Majesty to
accept of satisfaction from the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> for what had past,
that an Accommodation might ensue: to which his Holiness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enclin'd, both by his own interests (which could by no means
admit of a War in Italy) and by the importunity of the Princes
of the Country,<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Aldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandino</hi> sent by the Pope into <hi>France.</hi>
                     </note> he dispatch'd away Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> his
own Nephew to the King, to be in his name the Mediator of
this Peace, as the Cardinal <hi>de Medicis</hi> had been before of that
which had been concluded with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never Prince came from that Country in a prouder Equipage,
nor with a more honourable train, than did this Cardinal; a
Magnificence to which his Majesty being willing to hold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both in regard to his own greatness, as also to express there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a greater respect to the Pope (to whom he was highly oblig'd)
in the person of a Kinsman so near, and dear unto him, he made
choice of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> amongst all the other Grandees of
his Court, to be the man should receive him; and that because he
both knew him to be a person very acceptable to the Holy Sea, as
also one who knew as well how to behave himself for his Masters
honour, as any whoever, that was about his person. Neither did
the Duke deceive his Majesty in his choice; he receiv'd the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
at the head of the Army, which before had been drawn up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Battalia for that purpose, accompanied with the most sprightly
and gay Nobility, and Gentry of the Court, conducting him
with infinite demonstrations of Honour, and Respect through
the several divisions, until he brought him into the presence of
the King himself; and though I must tell you by the way, that
the Duke's imperious, and haughty humour was naturally very
averse to the humility of Complement, and the submission of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Civilities; yet when such an occasion as this oblig'd him
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63412:117"/>
to it; no man of his time could perform such a Ceremony with
a better grace: and doubtless, if at ordinary times he would
have been more liberal of his courtesie, and have added that to
those other excellent qualities, which made him admir'd by all,
he might have acquir'd thereby what Friends and Servants he had
pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the Legat's arrival the Peace of <hi>Savoy</hi> was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">The Peace with <hi>Savoy</hi> concluded.</note> wherein a Prince, whose interest it was to recover his own

and contrary to the publick Faith snatch'd from the King,
during the disorders of his Kingdom, and which his Majesty
was now also ready to force from him, as he had already done
the greatest part of his own hereditary Territories in pursuit of
that Quarrel: So that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> bought his Peace at a
cheap rate through the Pope's timely mediation, and all things
were accommodated that were in dispute betwixt the King, and
him: although his Majesty, who very well knew what little
trust was to be repos'd in the Faith of this Prince (a man that
would never keep his word when it was for his advantage to
break it) would by no means be perswaded to withdraw his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

at the same time the command of Lieutenant General to the Duke

                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke's journey into that Country gave him opportunity
to pass over into <hi>Gascony</hi> to view the Progress of his Building
there,<note place="margin">Anno 1600.</note> of which he had laid the foundation at <hi>Cadillac</hi> in the year
1598. For the King, after he had concluded the Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi>
from that time forwards, not only wholly bent his own thoughts
to the Embellishment of his Kingdom (in which his principal
design was first to Build his Houses, and to Beautifie <hi>Paris</hi> with
many great and noble Structures; for at this time the Buildings of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63412:118"/>
the <hi>Louvre, Fountain-bleau,</hi> and other Royal Palaces were begun;
as also the designs of the <hi>Pont-neuf,</hi> the Place Royal, with other
proud and stately AEdifices were continued) but would likewise
that other men should fall in love with the same humour; and
whether it were that his Majesty had a mind his greatest Subjects
should by his example employ themselves in the same designs, or
that he intended (as some have suppos'd) insensibly to drein their
purses by this chargeable employment; fearing perhaps that too
great abundance of wealth might make them more apt to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thoughts, and practices, that might discompose the calm of
Peace his Kingdom was now settled in: but so it was, that for one
or both these reasons, he engag'd the greatest part of his Nobility,
whom he knew to be monied men, in vast designs of this kind:
amongst whom his Majesty conceiving the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to
be one the most at his ease, he was so importunate with him, as
to cause a plot for <hi>Cadillac</hi> to be design'd in his own Presence, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the charge of the whole to be cast up, and made one of his
own Architects to undertake for an hundred thousand Crowns to
begin, and perfect the work; upon which assurance the Duke (as
has been said) in the year 1598 began the foundation; concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that such a summe, as that, he might without inconvenience
spare to gratifie his Masters humour; though time afterwards
gave him to understand how hard a thing it is to contain a
man's self within a determinate charge, after he has once set his
hand to so tempting a work as Building: this Pile, before it
was finish'd, having cost him above two millions of Livres. 'Tis
very true, (and which seldom happens to undertakers of such
vast designs) that with this infinite expense, he brought the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
and most stately pile of Building (the Royal Houses excepted)
in <hi>France,</hi> very near to perfection, the whole body of the Building
being perfected before his death, and nothing, save some few Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
left to finish; neither had he left those to his Successors,
had not the disgrace of being withdrawn from his Government,
which still afflicted him, diverted his thoughts from the sole care
of that design.</p>
                  <p>The Duke (as has been said) being come into <hi>Guienne</hi> to take

of the <hi>Mareschal de Matignon,</hi> who died of an Apoplexy, and
where their old Animosities, though great, were nevertheless on

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63412:118"/>
from breaking out upon the first occasion into a new and
open rupture. This <hi>Mareschal</hi> though an Alien born, had yet by
his Valour and Fidelity acquir'd so great a reputation in <hi>France,</hi> as
in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the III. to be a great confident to that Prince;
to whom the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> having been a principal Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
it is nothing strange, that a man of inferiour credit should
envy another in a higher degree of Favour: neither if the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal</hi>
were prepossess'd with this antiquated jealousie, was the
Duke on his part insensible of the recent traverses he had in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi>
receiv'd from him; the greatest part of the disgraces he had
met with in that Country having been laid in his way by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of <hi>l' Esdiguieres,</hi> and him: all which put together, it
may easily be imagin'd were likely to beget no very good blood
between them. To this the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> a man of an imperious, and
haughty temper, and who only under a forc'd smoothness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
a natural arrogance, could with no patience endure a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour;
an humour that made him with great anxiety look upon
the Honours, which at the Duke's arrival at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from the Parliament, with the other Orders of the City,
and which were also continued to him by the Nobility at <hi>Cadillac,</hi>
who from all parts came in to do him Honour: But if his impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
were great before, it was rais'd up to the height, when he
knew the Duke (who well enform'd of his dissatisfaction, to
make it yet more) had invited all the Nobility, and Gentry of the
Country to <hi>Bordeaux</hi> to a publick running at the Ring; a solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that being there to be kept where he was in Supreme Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
the Duke knew would much more nettle, and afflict
him.</p>
                  <p>It is very true, that the Duke might have forborn this Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado
to a man, whom he knew to be so tender of his Honour,
as the <hi>Mareschal d' Ornano</hi> was; and perhaps it was not well done
to offer that to another, he himself would never have endur'd
from any man living in a place where he had commanded in
Chief: but having once engag'd in the business, his great spirit
(whatever might succeed) would by no means give him leave to
desist, especially when he knew the <hi>Mareschal</hi> was resolv'd by open
force to oppose him. This was that, which made what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
only a private discontent, to break out into open quarrel,
which grew so high that the <hi>Mareschal</hi> address'd himself to the
Parliament; where, in the presence of them all, he complain'd
what a commotion the Duke went about to stir up amongst the
people, to the prejudice, as he pretended, of his Majesties Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
acquainting them at the same time with his resolution to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:63412:119"/>
make his Garrison stand to their Arms, to play his Cannon, and
in fine to do what in him lay, with all the power, and authority
he had to break that appointment, and to drive the Duke from
the City. This declaration from a man of his furious spirit, as it
very much troubled the whole Assembly, so it gave the first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
<hi>D' Affis</hi> (one of the greatest men that Society ever had since
its first institution, and a particular friend of the Duke's, having
by him in his times of favour been rais'd to that dignity) occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to make use of his Eloquence in the best Arguments he could
contrive to disswade the <hi>Mareschal</hi> from that determination; but
all in vain, he had already given out his orders, and summon'd the
Gentry to come in to his assistance, though not a man, save only
one call'd <hi>Ruat,</hi> would appear: a thing, which though perfectly
true, appears almost incredible, that a Governour of so great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Repute should be able to procure no more than one
single man, to serve him against the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> in his
own Government. Neither were the people better dispos'd, than
the Nobility and Gentry, to take Arms against the Duke; all men
on the contrary, of any note, both within, and without the City,
so manifestly appearing for him, that the Governour was forc'd
to arm his Garrison of <hi>Corses,</hi> and to call his Company of <hi>Gens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'
Armes</hi> out of their Country Quarters into the Town, which
were yet apparently too weak to execute the <hi>Mareschal</hi>'s design.
And this was in effect the main cause that hindred things from
proceeding into a greater disorder, the Duke, satisfied with the
advantage every one plainly saw he had over his Enemy, being
the more easily enclin'd to the Parliaments solicitations; who had
sent their second President <hi>Nesmond</hi> to him, to entreat he would
not persist in his first resolution: at whose instance, and being
loath to disturb the Peace of his Country, as also to expose the
great number of Gentlemen of Quality, who were about him
against a Garrison in his own particular quarrel, and having a
greater inclination to decide it in his own person (when it might
be done with less noise and tumult) with the <hi>Mareschal</hi> man to
man, he was content to let things rest, till a fitter opportunity,
and quietly departed the City to his own house.</p>
                  <p>In this Journey to <hi>Cadillac</hi> he was accompanied with President
<hi>Nesmond,</hi> a Gentleman of great merit, and his particular friend
(for whom after the death of President <hi>D' Affis</hi> he obtained the
Dignity of first President during the Regency of the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
with many other Principal Members of that Parliament
and City; whither he was no sooner come, but that the Gentry
of the Higher <hi>Gascony,</hi> at the report of this Quarrel, flock'd to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:63412:119"/>
him in so great a number, that scarce any occasion could have
hapned, wherein his interest in that Country could have been
more manifestly seen. And here the Duke, environ'd with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Friends, pass'd his time in that jollity and mirth, and
appear'd so little concern'd at any thing that had pass'd betwixt the
<hi>Mareschal d' Ornano</hi> and him, as made every one certainly believe
all had been absolutely forgot: where, after having spent some days,
and his company being retir'd to their own houses, he himself
also departed to go visit his paternal estate, and from thence to
<hi>Tholouse.</hi> From hence it was, that whilst every one thought him
more intent upon his recreations, than mindful of his quarrel, he
dispatch'd away a Page of his call'd <hi>Talanges,</hi> who continued long
after in his Service, to the <hi>Mareschal d' Ornano</hi> with a Challenge,
which I will here present my Reader word for word, as I tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
it from the original draught under the Duke's own hand;
wherein, though there be no studied stile, there is nevertheless
something of a natural, and easie bluntness, that methinks sounds
better, than if it had been couch'd with greater care and art: the
words are these.

                  <p>It was not without many difficulties that matters were thus
compos'd betwixt them, the Duke desiring something more for
his satisfaction, and the <hi>Mareschal</hi> on his part ill digesting the
distinction the King had made betwixt <hi>to serve you,</hi> and <hi>to do
you service:</hi> but that which touch'd him most to the quick was,
that his Majesty by one of the conditions of Accommodation,
gave the Duke, liberty when ever he thought fit, to call together
the same Assembly in <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> which had begot the former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute;
commanding the <hi>Mareschal</hi> not to oppose it: A Licence
without which the Duke conceiv'd his affront could not be wip'd
off. And accordingly he some time after return'd to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi>
to have made use of his Priviledge, though it was then also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by an accident, of which in its due place we shall give
a further accompt.</p>
                  <p>This satisfaction the King order'd for the Duke, though very
sufficient of it self, was not however the only testimony his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
gave him of his Royal Bounty and Justice in this occasion;
for the offence having been publick, his Majesty thought fit that
beside the satisfaction had been given in private, the <hi>Mareschal</hi>
should moreover pay the Duke some publick civilities, to evidence
an absolute disowning of the Act: it was therefore order'd, that
the Duke going to <hi>Loches,</hi> as it was determined he should do, (I
believe for that purpose) the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> who at the same time was
upon his Journey into his Government, should give him a visit by
the way, as he did<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; by whom the King writ a very obliging
Letter to the Duke, wherein he commanded him to entertain the
<hi>Mareschal</hi> as His Friend; a command that was also on the Duke's
part so punctually obey'd, that the visit was pass'd over with great
civility on both sides: wherein the justice of this generous, and
excellent Prince was eminently manifest, who would use a man
at this obliging rate, that had no share in his Royal Favour.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this Accommodation, the 11th. of <hi>September</hi> the
same year, the Court was wholly possess'd with the joy all good
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:63412:121"/>
                     <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were full of, for the Birth of the young <hi>Dolphin,</hi> whom

importance that could at that time possibly have hapned to the
King, and Kingdom: in him all pretense of past disturbances
being determined, as the publick Peace seem'd to be for ever se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd.
There was now no mutinous Subject, nor no ambitious
Neighbour, who seeing themselves fall'n from their unjust, and
imaginary pretensions to the Crown, did not covet the favour,
and friendship of a Prince so apparently favour'd by the care of
Heaven: but if on that side the Duke with other vertuous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of his condition, was in a high rapture of joy, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to him soon after great occasions of affliction, that involv'd
him in no few, not no little inconveniencies, which befel him by
the discovery of the Conspiracy of the <hi>Mareschal Biron,</hi> that
came to light in the beginning of the ensuing year; wherein we
shall notwithstanding see, that although this business begat him
trouble, and disgrace in the beginning, yet it brought him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and satisfaction in the end: having given him opportunity
at once to express his constant affection to his friend, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate
Fidelity to the King his Master.</p>
                  <p>I have already made mention of the great friendship that was

being one, and the same, and their affections so united in all
things, that nothing was a secret betwixt them, if not in what
concern'd the interest of the King and Kingdom: but as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of that nature, what confidence soever the <hi>Mareschal</hi> had in
the Duke's friendship it is certain, he had ever so great a respect
to his fidelity, and did believe him so impossible to be debauch'd
from his duty, that he never communicated to him the least
syllable of any thought he had conceiv'd to the prejudice of the
one, or the other: though it is to be wish'd, for the preservation
of so brave a man he had done it, because then the Duke would
doubtless have perswaded him into better resolutions. The King,
who was very well acquainted with all his designs, would himself
sometimes talk to him in terms easie enough to be understood, on
purpose to make him come to himself, to see his error, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
himself sincerely to a Prince, who proceeded with that
tenderness towards him, and who was pleas'd in his behalf to
moderate the absolute Authority, the knowledge of his Crime,
and his own Royal Power gave him over his Life, and Fortune;
but that would not reclaim him: That way then failing, and his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:63412:121"/>
Majesties obliging language to him wanting force to make that
impression upon his obstinate spirit, he could have desir'd, his
Majesty try'd yet further to overcome him by testimonies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in his Loyalty, and to divert him from criminal thoughts
by conferring upon him his employments of Trust, and Honour;
amongst which that of Ambassador into <hi>England</hi> was one.</p>
                  <p>The King being in <hi>Picardy,</hi> receiv'd a Complement from <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
Queen of <hi>England,</hi> wherein she earnestly solicited the King
for an enterview betwixt them, at any place he himself would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point;
a request that his Majesty not thinking it convenient to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
her in, he dispatch'd away to her the <hi>Mareschal Biron,</hi> as it were
his second self, to make his excuse, and to Treat with her with all
freedom of their most private Affairs. An employment wherein
<hi>Biron</hi> receiv'd extraordinary Honours, as also several cautions
from this prudent Princess, enough to have diverted him from
his evil designs, had not his destiny already blinded his judgment,
and rendred him incapable of counsel. She often laid before him
the recent, and sad example of the late Earl of <hi>Essex;</hi> she repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto him what a Subject ought to apprehend even from
the greatness of his own Service, and Merit, if his Ambition was
not moderated by prudence, and whether it were that she had had
some inckling (as many have believ'd) of <hi>Biron</hi>'s designs, or that
she only intended by such discourses to justifie the execution of that
unfortunate Earl, she laid before him a perfect image of his own
unhappy destiny; though all was lost to a man obstinately bent
to his own ruine.</p>
                  <p>This Queen also having heard of the strict friendship betwixt
the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> desir'd him at parting to
tell the Duke from her, that if, of his three Sons (which she
own'd for her Kinsmen, and Princes of her Kingdom) he would
send her one, she should gladly receive him upon his accompt;
and that the world might see the esteem she had of the Fathers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
would not deprive his Posterity of that place in her Kingdom,
which was due to the House of <hi>Candale;</hi> wherein she had only
one condition to make, which was, that the Duke should give
way, that a Son of his so sent, should be bred up in her Religion;
the only one she could by any means suffer in her Kingdom: A
Complement that the Duke thinking himself oblig'd to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, he presented her Majesty with his most humble thanks for
the Honour she was pleas'd to do him, and his Family in so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
an offer; but that he should ever prefer any Fortune or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
his Children could attain unto in <hi>France,</hi> making profession
of the Catholick Religion, before any advantages could derive to
them in a belief contrary to his own.</p>

of those imaginary Principalities, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> had baited their practices withal to catch him, could now
no longer contain himself within the simple meditation of his
Treason, but began to deal with some persons of Quality in the

where the best part of his Estate, his Relations, and chiefest
Friendships lay: amongst whom the Duke <hi>de Bouillion</hi> is said to
be invited into his party to introduce those of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
into that Country: Intelligence whereof being brought
to the King, his Majesty concern'd at the importance of the thing,
and justly provok'd at the <hi>Mareschals</hi> ingratitude, immediately
took the Field, with a resolution to stifle these disorders in their
birth; when considering with himself, that if he should fail of
securing the Head of the Faction, whatever he could do besides,
would signifie nothing to the remedy of the disease, and that
whilst he should be upon his March, his own promptitude and
vigilancy would but serve to alarm Subjects already made jealous
by the conscience of their own Crimes; he broke off his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
expedition, and return'd back again to <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> from

page 978.</note> and a very important Commission,
to go renew an Alliance with the <hi>Swisse:</hi> an Affair wherein,
though many difficulties arose, yet the King who would by no
means have <hi>Biron</hi> baffled in his Negotiation, by sending a million
of Livers along with him, put him into a condition of making
all things succeed according to his Majesties own desire. This was
the last Service this <hi>Mareschal</hi> perform'd for the Crown, wherein
he acquitted himself very much to his Honour, and wherein the
reputation of his Valour prevail'd much upon that warlike Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
it has been said his dexterity did no less. And here I shall
insert by the way, that those who have believ'd the <hi>Mareschal</hi> to
have no more in his conduct, than the meer brutality of a rough
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:63412:122"/>
humourous Souldier, were not at all acquainted with him: he was
read to a sufficient knowledge of Latin, and Greek Letters; and
when ever he would make use of his Judgment and Eloquence,
whether in Negotiations, or Councils, in War or Affairs of State,
he ever express'd himself to be a man of no common qualities.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty had thought by these testimonies of his trust, the
<hi>Mareschal</hi> would have been allur'd to Court, to have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of the good success of his Negotiation; where he hop'd,
without further trouble, he might easily secure his Person; but
with what gentle language soever the King could flatter his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
it was impossible to perswade him into that Journey, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Accusers, and Witnesses of his Guilt he found in his own
Conscience against him. His Majesty therefore not being able
to bring about his design by this way, and unwilling to live any
longer in the apprehensions he had been put into by the <hi>Mareschal</hi>'s
practice, resolv'd at last by a manifest disobedience to extract from
him a confession of his fault, which should either give him a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
colour to proceed against the <hi>Mareschal</hi> as a Criminal, and
a Rebel; or otherwise oblige him to come, and deliver himself
into his hands. He therefore first dispatch'd away to him the <hi>Sieur
d' Escures,</hi> Quartermaster-General of his Armies; a man very
acceptable to the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> and in great credit with him, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
long serv'd under his Command, and immediately after
President <hi>Ianin,</hi> who also by his wisdom, and experience had won
so great an esteem with the foresaid <hi>Mareschal,</hi> that he would sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
undertake any business of any great moment without first
consulting this politick Minister.</p>
                  <p>These two were sent with express Orders to represent to <hi>Biron</hi>
part of the ill Offices had been done him to the King; to which
they added, <q>That all the endeavour of his best Friends could
not so justifie his actions to the King, that his Majesty had not
his fidelity in suspicion, until he should receive his justification
from his own mouth: that since only himself could defend
himself from Calumny, there was nothing to be deliberated
of in the case, and that he must suddenly resolve, either to give
an accompt of his actions to the King, or declare himself his
Majesties open Enemy, maintain an impudent War against his
Prince, and have himself and his Posterity branded with the
durtiest and most hateful of all Crimes, to wit, a Traytor to his
Benefactor, King, and Country, that he had to do with a
Prince, whose Clemency was so well known to none, as to
himself, who had his great Services fresh in his memory, who
expected no less from his Courage and Fidelity for the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63412:123"/>
time to come, and whose interest it was as much to preserve
him (knowing, as his Majesty very well did, the utility of his
Service) as it was to preserve himself, whose authority was to
be maintain'd, and establish'd by men of his Conduct and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</q>
Remonstrances from men he lov'd, and esteem'd, by
which <hi>Biron</hi> was so encourag'd, and believing that <hi>Lafin</hi> had
said nothing against him (as he had often, and fasly assur'd
him) that he resolv'd upon going to Court; in order whereunto
he presently set forth, taking the Road of <hi>Paris</hi> in the Company
of President <hi>Ianin</hi> only, <hi>d' Escures</hi> having been sent away before
to carry news of his coming.</p>
                  <p>The strict, and inviolate Friendship that all the world knew to
be betwixt the Duke, and the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> soon rendred the first
suspected of having a hand in the other's designs; neither was the
Duke ignorant that his Enemies labour'd with all the Artifice
they had, to involve him in his Friends Treason; but how perfect
soever he was in their malicious practice, and how clearly soever
he foresaw the dangerous consequences were likely to attend a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of this nature, he was resolute nevertheless, with a genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
hardly to be parallel'd in so critical an occasion, to be no ways
wanting to his friend: wherefore having notice that the <hi>Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi>
was drawing near to <hi>Paris,</hi> and that a caution, which would
now come too late to divert him from coming to the King (a
thing he would by no means have advis'd him from) might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
awake his judgment, and make him appeal to his Majesties
mercy, he sent the <hi>Sieur du Plessis Baussonniere,</hi> a man in whom he
had an absolute confidence, to meet him upon the way.</p>
                  <p>This Gentleman had put himself into the Duke's dependence
in his younger years, and having left his Studies, wherein he had
made a considerable progress, had follow'd, and serv'd him in
<hi>Provence,</hi> commanding the Regiment of <hi>Pernes</hi> his Brother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law,
all the while the Duke was there in action; after which, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole time of the Duke's life, which was very long, he
was by him continually employ'd in his greatest, and most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Affairs; in which he ever gave so good an accompt of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and Fidelity, that there was scarce any Gentleman of his
time in a higher reputation for Valour, Prudence, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity;
insomuch that I have often heard the Duke say, if he were
to corrupt <hi>le Plessis,</hi> he should be to seek on which side to assault
him, his soul was so bravely fortified throughout. This <hi>le Plessis,</hi>
according to his Masters order, puts himself upon his way to go
meet the <hi>Mareschal:</hi> but as his Errand could not but be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
both for the Master, and the Servant, the one, and the other
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63412:123"/>
sufficiently knowing the violent suspicion the King had of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal</hi>'s
proceeding; so did he endeavour with all imaginable cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if possible, to entertain him alone. I have often heard him
tell the story, and do very well remember every circumstance,
which put altogether will make this appear an affair of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
difficulty, and the best carried on, that perhaps you shall meet
with in the Duke's whole History; and wherein the generous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
an innocent Servant, and the Clemency and Justice of a
good Master, will as evidently appear. <hi>Le Plessis,</hi> perceiving the
<hi>Mareschal</hi>'s Equipage coming at a pretty distance, lighted at a
Barn a little wide of the High-way, where, having with him one
of the Duke's Footmen without a Livery, he commanded him
to call the first of the <hi>Mareschal</hi>'s that appear'd upon the Road;
which he having done, and <hi>le Plessis</hi> being not unknown to the
fellow, he sent him to tell his Master in his ear, that <hi>le Plessis</hi> staid
to speak with him a word or two in private. The Footman ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
deliver'd his Message, whereupon <hi>Biron</hi> stragling from
his company upon some pretense or other, came to the place where
<hi>le Plessis</hi> stood to expect him, and where without being observ'd
by any, he had all liberty to discourse at leisure. <hi>Le Plessis</hi> had
in charge to tell him, <q>That the Journey he was now upon
to the King requir'd his most serious deliberation, and that he
was now in good earnest to reflect upon his own condition:
That if he came with a confidence, some possibly might have
possess'd him withal, that <hi>Lafin</hi> had not spoken to the King,
he was abus'd: That the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> did not know what
had pass'd betwixt <hi>Lafin</hi> and him; neither did he desire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himself: but that he might be assur'd, that whatever he
had done, or negotiated with him, or by him, was every tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
discover'd to the King; acquainting him with the several
times and places, and how oft <hi>Lafin</hi> had been in private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with him: That he was herein to be advis'd by his own
Conscience, and to rely upon his Majesties Grace, and Bounty,
if he conceiv'd there was any thing that might justly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
in his former Actions; there being much better to be
hop'd for, from his Majesties Clemency, and noble nature, than
from the secresie of what had pass'd betwixt <hi>Lafin</hi> and him.</q>
This obliging and prudent advice, which ought to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by the <hi>Mareschal</hi> with so much the greater tenderness, by
how much it was preferr'd with the infinite hazard of him that
sent it, did on the contrary put him into so great a rage, that I
have heard <hi>le Plessis</hi> say, he never in his life saw any thing in so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
a fury. <hi>Biron</hi> ask'd him first of all, <q>If the Duke of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63412:124"/>
                        <hi>Espernon</hi> esteem'd him for other, than an honest man?</q> To
whom <hi>du Plessis</hi> having reply'd, <q>That had he had any other
opinion of him, he would not have persisted in his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
so long;</q> he proceeded to tell him, <q>That he was come to
give the lye, and to be the death of all those, who durst blemish
his Actions: That he was the same the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> and he
<hi>Plessis</hi> himself had ever known him to be: That for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
him, <hi>Mounsieur d' Espernon</hi> might set his heart at rest.</q> And
then clapping his hand upon his Sword, after a hundred wild po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
he further told <hi>du Plessis,</hi> 
                     <q>That if any one durst make an
attempt upon his Person, he would make more arms and heads
flie, than would stand before him:</q> So that instead of making
use of his Friend's caution, and good advice, he continued his
way in his first obstinacy, and the same night arriv'd at <hi>Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At his arrival the King spoke to him of the business himself,
gently admonishing him withal to make an ingenuous confession
of his fault: a thing he was so far from being perswaded to do,
that he seem'd discontented and angry at the motion.</p>
                  <p>Soon after he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and din'd at the <hi>Hostel d' Espernon,</hi>
when the King returning the same day from <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> the
Duke and he went together in the afternoon to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his Majesty; who having notice of their coming went to
the Window, through the glass to observe their carriage, and
countenance; which a friend of the Duke's, who was then with
the King, gave the Duke timely caution of, to the end he might
comport himself so, as that his Majesty might not by any beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of his be fortified in those evil impressions, with which
he had before by his Enemies been prepossess'd: though the
Duke carried himself quite contrary to his advice; and being
more and more confirm'd, in the testimony of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and full of a just and generous indignation to see his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
suspected, walk'd with his face erect, and his eyes fix'd upon
the Window where he knew the King stood: A carriage the
King very well observ'd, as he made others about him to do also.
They were no sooner come both of them into his Majesties
Chamber, who as yet had express'd no publick dissatisfaction
with <hi>Biron</hi> (as being still in hope to regain him, and to have an
occasion to pardon him by the confession of his fault) but that he
presently made a Match at Tennis, wherein the King and the
<hi>Count de Soissons</hi> were to play against the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and
the <hi>Mareschal:</hi> and upon this occasion it was that the Historians
of that time make the Duke say, as a piece of wit, speaking to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63412:124"/>
the <hi>Mareschal, That he played well, but that he made his matches ill;</hi> as
if by those words, which may admit of a double interpretation,
he would obliquely condemn <hi>Biron</hi>'s designs, which never came
into his thought; it being his custom when ever he talk'd with
the <hi>Mareschal</hi> about that business, not to do it in such ambiguous
terms; nor so out of season, but seriously and plainly, and in a
secresie, the safest for him he would advise. He several times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to him the ill Offices he had receiv'd, he confirm'd to
him the same thing he had sent him word of before concerning
<hi>Lafin,</hi> conjuring him not to rely upon his Faith, which would
certainly deceive him: But these second admonitions were as
fruitless as the first; and the King seeing that he could neither by
himself, nor by the <hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> the <hi>Mareschals</hi> intimate
Friend, who had dealt with him by his Majesties absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and in his name, reclaim this obstinate spirit, nor make
him reconcile himself to his duty, by acknowledging his offence;
he gave him over at last to the rigor of Law, and Justice, who
punish'd his Crime, by the forfeiture of his Head.</p>
                  <p>Whilst they were drawing up the <hi>Mareschal</hi>'s Charge, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
well enform'd of <hi>le Plessis</hi> Envoy (it being a thing hard to
be kept secret, in an Affair where all things were so narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd)
referr'd the intelligence to the deliberation of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
The Cabinet Council at that time consisted of the <hi>Count de
Soissons, de Sillery</hi> Keeper of the Seal, <hi>Sully</hi> superintendent of the
Exchequer, President <hi>Ianin, Bellieure,</hi> and <hi>Villeroy:</hi> In which
Assembly divers conjectures being set on foot, to fortifie the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
his Majesty had been perswaded into against the Duke, it
was by the major part voted necessary to secure his person, or at
least to make sure of <hi>le Plessis,</hi> and to put him to the wrack, that
from a confession extorted from him sufficient evidence might be
drawn to convince his Master: A result so approv'd by all, that
the King was himself almost the only man that oppos'd those two
propositions. <q>He told them that as for the Duke, a man of his
quality was never to be arrested, unless to be condemn'd, that
as yet there was nothing but suspicion, and conjectures against
him; which should they prove idle, and vain, he was never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to repose any trust in a man, so undeservedly, and so unjustly
offended: That for <hi>le Plessis</hi> he was no more to be meddled
withal than the other, without giving a manifest distaste to his
Master: That if one of them were to be secur'd, he should
rather begin with the Master, than the Servant; because the
confinement of the last would be an equal injury to the other;
but that the effect would by no means be the same, being the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63412:125"/>
Duke, if he knew himself guilty, would by the seizing of <hi>le
Plessis</hi> be forwarn'd to make his escape: That he was therefore
of opinion to expect if in the Tryal of <hi>Mareschal Biron,</hi> nothing
would come to light that might justly bring the Duke in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
which if there did, and that he should be found a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,
there was no place he could fly to so remote, where his
arm would not be long enough to reach him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the King had intelligence of <hi>le Plessis</hi>'s Envoy to the <hi>Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Biron,</hi> the Duke was no less faithfully inform'd of what had
pass'd in the Cabinet Council concerning him; by which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that <hi>le Plessis</hi> Journey was not so great a secret, as it had
been convenient for both their safeties it had been, which made
him consult with <hi>le Plessis</hi> what was best to be done in so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
an occasion. The Duke was not secure, the King would
continue so constant in his favour, that his Majesty might not at
another Council be over-rul'd into other resolutions, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at last to put <hi>le Plessis</hi> to the question; a doubt that made him
think it expedient he should retire; that he being gone, no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
might appear against him, he having been alone entrusted
with the secret of this Affair: but <hi>le Plessis,</hi> who very well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
his flight, though it might procure his own particular safety,
would certainly be his Master's ruine, could by no means consent
to the motion. He rather chose to run the hazard of the Wrack,
(which he was ready to undergo, and of which, I have heard
him say, he had already the terrors in his imagination) than to
expose the Life, and Honour of his Master, which, after so strong
a presumption, as his withdrawing himself must of necessity
give, would be in an apparent danger. He therefore humbly
entreated the Duke not to concern himself at the thought of any
thing that threatned him; assuring him withal, that as he had
done nothing contrary to his Majesties Service, so all the Wracks
and Tortures in the world could never force him to say any thing
contrary to the truth. Settled then in this resolution, from which
I do believe nothing upon earth could have remov'd him, his wit
suggested to him an expedient, by which in the end he secur'd
both his Masters Person and his own. He advis'd the Duke to
prevent his Majesty by an ingenuous confession of the truth, and
to tell him himself what he had done: for as the King could not
imagine that the Duke could have had any notice of that secret, it
being improbable, the result of a Council held but that morning,
and consisting of men of so approv'd Fidelity and Trust, could
be so suddenly reveal'd; so was it not to be believ'd, that the
Duke's voluntary discovery of what he had done, could pass in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63412:125"/>
his Majesties opinion for a premeditated thing. The Duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of this advice, put it as speedily into execution; and
the King intending to hunt in the afternoon, he mounted on
horseback, as he us'd to do, to attend him; where having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
and observ'd his Majesties motion with an extraordinary
diligence, that he might find an opportunity for his purpose,
they light by chance into a solitary place, into which his Majesty
being insensibly stragled from the gross of his Train, there were
very few left about him. And here it was that the King turning
towards the Duke, fell upon the Discoure of <hi>Mareschal Biron,</hi>
who was now in the heat of his Tryal, complaining how ill he
had us'd him, and how ungrateful a man he was: To which the
Duke reply'd, <q>That as a Relation, and a Friend to the <hi>Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,</hi>
he could not without great affliction see so evident testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of his guilt, that he had been at first very unwilling to
believe he could be guilty of so foul a Crime: but that now it
did so manifestly appear, he could not think any punishment
enough to chastise so foul an Offence:</q> To whom the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
return'd, <q>What, it seems then you know nothing of the
business?</q> The Duke made answer, <q>Sir, I knew so little of it,
that at his coming to this Town, I sent <hi>le Plessis</hi> to meet him,
and to welcome him to Court, which I should never have
done, had I thought him guilty.</q> At which words, which touch'd
the King to the quick, his Majesty set spurs to his Horse, with an
extravagance not very natural to him, but which that unexpected
answer had put him into: when having taken a Career, and
turning again to the Duke, with a countenance that sufficiently
express'd that he was angry at a discovery he had no mind should
have come from the Duke's own mouth. <q>It seems then, said
he, you sent to <hi>Mareschal Biron</hi> without my knowledge?</q> To
whom the Duke reply'd again, <q>That he did not conceive it
necessary to ask his Majestie's leave to send a meer Complement
to his Friend: That seeing him come without a Guard, or any
apparent marks of disgrace, and his Majesty treating him with
the same favour he us'd to do, he had on his part us'd him at
the same rate he had ever done: That it had been a custom
long observ'd betwixt them, that which of them soever had
been any time absent from Court, was at his return by some
Servant of trust enform'd by the other of all the little passages
had hapned during his absence: That it was true, he had in
this occasion continued this custom: That he humbly besought
his Majesty to believe nothing more particular had pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, and that he had rather dye, than once conceive a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:63412:126"/>
thought to the prejudice of his Majesties Service, or his own
duty: That he hop'd the event would more clearly evidence
the integrity of his actions; but that nevertheless he thought it
fit to give his Majesty that security in hand.</q> The King being
well satisfied with the Duke's Reasons, but much more with the
Confidence he perceiv'd him to repose in his Justice, and his own
Innocency, all jealousies, that before had been infus'd into him, to
the prejudice of the Duke's Fidelity, and Honour, vanish'd away,
and he with the greatest care and assiduity, was more than ever
about his Majesties Person. His Children (which a little before
he had brought to Court) had order to continue about the young
<hi>Dolphin's</hi> Person, to be as it were Hostages of their Father's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
and the <hi>Mareschal</hi>'s Tryal being at last over, all Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Parties examin'd, and heard without the least mention of
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s name in all their practice, his Majesty
was not a little satisfied with himself, that he had carried things
with that moderation towards the Duke upon this occasion.</p>
                  <p>This untoward business was soon after seconded by another,
which, though of far less dangerous consequence, bega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Duke
nevertheless as much trouble as the first. The Duke as he was ever
very circumspect in his duty, to preserve his Fidelity entire to the
King, so was he no less solicitous to maintain himself in all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
deriving to him as particles of any of his Commands.
That of Colonel therefore having been conferr'd upon him by
<hi>Henry</hi> III. with extraordinary priviledges, as by his Patent does
appear, he could not endure the least violation of his Interest;
but with a stiffness (that doubtless would have offended a less
equitable Prince, than that under whom he had the honour to
serve) was ever obstinate to maintain every punctilio of his right.
One of the greatest, and of the greatest Honour that was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd
to this Command, was the power he had to name the Camp-Master
to the Regiment of Guards when ever that place should
be void; and it hapned now that <hi>Grillon,</hi> who had been possess'd
of this Command before the Duke was created Colonel, was
fail'n into infirmities, that rendred him incapable of his Charge:
Yet had his former Services been such as made it very reasonable
he should however make his best advantage of it, as his Majesty
was content he should; but having a singular, and a very just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
for the <hi>Mareschal de l' Esdiguieres,</hi> and a very great affection for
his Son-in-law <hi>Crequy,</hi> he intended the latter, having first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with <hi>Grillon,</hi> should be preferr'd to that Command, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
perhaps hereby, as much to clip the wings of the Duke's
Authority, which he had as Colonel over the Regiment of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63412:126"/>
Guards, as altogether to oblige <hi>Crequy.</hi> The Duke, advertis'd of
his Majesties purpose, could not forbear giving out aloud, that
he would never consent to it, and the King on the contrary was
resolv'd his pleasure should prevail: But in the end after many
oppositions (which this good Prince was pleas'd to endure from
a Servant) the Duke, who had never discover'd his mind to the
King, but by the mediation of others, was resolv'd to deliver it
to his Majesty with his own mouth, as accordingly he did; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
to him with a liberty (which to his Subjects was none
of the least felicities of his happy Reign) the Justice of his Cause.
All which, notwithstanding his reasons, could not so prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Majesties temper, but that he remain'd as firm as ever in
his first resolution. Which the Duke seeing, and conceiving he
could not consent to his Majesties desire, without going less in
the dignity of his place, he rather chose to absent himself from
Court, than to be compell'd by an express, and positive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to do a thing so much to the prejudice of his Authority,
and Honour; and accordingly very much dissatisfied, retir'd
himself to <hi>Angoulesme.</hi> The King, who was not yet totally cur'd
of a jealousie, still kept awake by the practices, the remainder
of <hi>Biron</hi>'s Faction (not quiet extinct) yet kept on foot in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
gave manifest signs of discontent at the Duke's departure;
and as he knew the alliance the Duke of <hi>Montpensier</hi> had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with his Family, by his Match, had begot a strict friendship
betwixt them, so was it to him especially that he spoke of it with
the greatest freedom, and in terms (not without threats) of the
highest indignation. This Prince, who concern'd himself as
much at the Duke's Interest, as his own, dispatch'd away to him
in great diligence the <hi>Sieur de la Chetardie,</hi> in whom he had an
especial confidence, to let him understand the King's displeasure,
and to remonstrate to him the danger he would expose himself
unto, should he longer persist in opposition to his Majesties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
who would herein be absolutely obey'd: A caution by
which the Duke plainly seeing he was reduc'd to a necessity either
to bow, or break; he indeed chose the latter, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
high complaints of the injustice was done him, which were
neither so modest, nor so private, that they were not soon carried
to the King's ear: And though so stubborn an opposition in the
Duke might reasonably enough have more exasperated the King
against him, yet such was the noble nature of this great Prince,
that it would not suffer him long to bear in mind the memory of
his offense; for the Duke had no sooner given his consent to <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy</hi>'s
admission, but that his Majesty commanded him the first
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63412:127"/>
thing he did, to take a Journey a hundred Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi>
to see his Colonel, to take his Oath betwixt his hands, to obtain
his hand to his Commission, and to receive his Order for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
into his place: Civilities by which although the King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to give the Duke all satisfaction; yet could they not
so far reconcile him, but that at <hi>Crequy</hi>'s arrival, he made him
wait a whole day together at his Chamber door, and expect some
days after before he would receive his Oath, or Sign his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
And although he was himself very sensible that so many
manifest aversions were sufficient to beget new distastes in the
King against him; yet was he not so much master of himself,
nor had so much command over his own Nature; but that he
must put those affronts upon <hi>Crequy,</hi> or rather upon the King,
who made this business his own.</p>
                  <p>By these disputes (which in another time might have turn'd
very much to the Duke's prejudice) he got nevertheless this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that the King to satisfie him for the future in the interests of
his Command, made a kind of agreement with him (if a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gess
from a Master to his Servant may be so call'd) which was,
That his Majesty would indeed really, and effectually reserve to
himself the nomination of Camp-Master to the Regiment of
Guards;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mounsieur Crequy</hi> made Camp-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to the Regiment of Guards.</note> as also to the other old Regiments: but with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that the Colonel should swear them, that they should
be conceiv'd to have their admission from him, without which
they were not to be receiv'd into the employment: That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
having provided for one Company in the Regiment of
Guards, he was content the Duke should in turn do the same for
the next at his own appointment: That of all the Foot Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the other Regiments, new and old, the Duke when ever
any should be vacant, should have the naming of the Captains
to the King to fill them up; and that no Captain soever, whether
of the Regiment of Guards, or any other Regiment should be
admitted into, or establish'd in his Command till first his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
was Sign'd by the Colonel: But for what concern'd those
Offices, that depended upon the Duke's Command, as Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
Ensigns, Colonel-Ensigns, Serjeants, and Serjeant-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors,
Martials, Provost-Martials, Quarter-Masters, and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
that he should place and displace them by his sole Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
without any order from the King, or his Majesties taking
any notice thereof. According to which Agreement the Duke
proceeded so regularly, and undisturb'd in the Priviledges of his
Command, that there was never after, during this Kings Reign,
the least Dispute betwixt them, saveing once, that the King think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63412:127"/>
it fit to add two Companies more to his Regiment of Guards,
and having appointed their Captains, the Duke interpos'd his
Majesties Royal Promise, humbly beseeching him to do him
right: an Argument so powerful to this equitable Prince, that of
two Captains he had nam'd, he only provided for one, which
was the <hi>Sieur de la Courbe,</hi> who had but the second Company nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
the first being given to the <hi>Sieur de Bourdet</hi> by the Duke's
Recommendation, whose turn it was to name the first vacant
Company: yet did not the business pass without some dispute,
though at last the King was pleas'd rather to give way to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's
just desires, than to fail in the least Article of his Word.</p>
                  <p>I shall here add (since I am upon this discourse of the Office
of Colonel) a thing that time has sufficiently justified to all
<hi>France,</hi> which is, that the Duke was so exceeding cautious in the
dispensation of Commands, whether meerly depending upon his
own Authority, or in his nomination only, that his Majesty
would often say, he never had better Foot Officers, than those of
the Duke's preferring. And in truth the <hi>French</hi> Infantry, whilst
the Duke was permitted to execute his charge, were kept in so good
order, that perhaps no Militia in Europe were better Disciplin'd,
nor better Officer'd than they; a truth to this hour confirm'd by
an infinite number of persons yet living, who have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
under him, and who were witnesses of his conduct. To
which I shall further add, and to his great commendation, a
thing not to be contradicted; which is, that he neither directly,
nor indirectly ever made the least benefit of any Command he
dispos'd of, which I think had they been set to sale would, in the
long course of his life, have amounted to above two Millions of
Gold, after the rate they are sold now adays. And I do very well
remember, that towards his latter end, when he saw the selling
of Offices began to grow in fashion, he did all he could, and that
the condition of the time would permit, to oppose it; represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the King, with very convincing Arguments, what a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
such an abuse would be to his Service; although in the
end seeing he could not prevail with the Council to alter that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
he also gave some of his own Servants, though very
few, leave to make mony of the Offices he had conferr'd upon
them: but I am certain, that for his own particular, he never
converted any the least employment to his own p<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ofit: A thing
perhaps such as thought him solicitous of his own Interest, will
hardly be perswaded to believe, as indeed he was enclin'd to the
saving side, and wary enough when it was fit for him to be so:
but never, upon any occasion where his Honour was concern'd,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63412:128"/>
that ever taking with him the upperhand of all other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The business of <hi>Crequy,</hi> how troublesome, and how hard soever
to digest, was not yet the last of the same nature the Duke was to
wrestle withal in this years revolution, another following immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after; which, as it nearer concern'd him, pierc'd deeper to
the quick: neither had it so happy an issue as the first. The Duke
having in the year 1582. been by King <hi>Henry</hi> the III. establish'd
in the Government of <hi>Metz,</hi> he conferr'd the Lieutenancy of the
City and Country upon <hi>Moncassin</hi> his Kinsman, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Cittadel upon <hi>Sobole:</hi> but in process of time, which
hapned in the year 1585. having withdrawn <hi>Moncassin</hi> from this
employment to continue about his own person: <hi>Sobole,</hi> whom
he had bred a Page, and in whom he had an entire confidence,
was by his bounty rais'd to that degree, that he conferr'd upon
him the command of the City, and Country, together with that of
the Cittadel also; which was effectually one of the bravest enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
in <hi>France, Metz</hi> being at that time the most consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
place of the Kingdom, and the noblest member of the Duke's
Command.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1594. the King undertook the Siege of <hi>Laon,</hi> to
which, as to an occasion wherein he expected to meet with great
difficulties, he invited many of his Servants of the neighbouring
Provinces. Amongst these <hi>Sobole</hi> was one, who by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
the Duke had given him in <hi>Metz,</hi> having got a great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in the Country, might with great facility raise a considerable
party of Horse, as he did, and at the Head of sixscore Light-Horse,
very well appointed, and fourscore Carabins, went to
serve his Majesty at this Siege. The King receiv'd him with
great demonstrations of favour, and not being well satisfied
with the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who being at that time in <hi>Provence,</hi>
where he did not behave himself to his Majesties liking, after he
had, as he conceiv'd, cut him out work enough there, he took
occasion to raise him greater difficulties about <hi>Metz,</hi> by lessening
the Authority he had till that time ever had over <hi>Sobole.</hi> And to
that purpose after he had reduc'd <hi>Laon</hi> to his obedience, and about
to dismiss those Auxiliaries who had come in to serve him in that
Action, his Majesty sent <hi>Sobole</hi> word, <q>That after so great a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
as he had receiv'd from his Services, he was as well
dispos'd to gratifie him as he himself could desire; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
the present condition of his Affairs not permitting him
to do, at so honourable a rate, as he could wish, it was for
him to look out for something he had a mind to, which should
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63412:128"/>
be as readily conferr'd upon him.</q> Those who had order to
make this overture to <hi>Sobole,</hi> were further intrusted to represent
unto him, <q>That being Governour of <hi>Metz</hi> meerly by the
Duke's toleration, he was subject upon the first capricio to be
remov'd; after which from the honourable condition wherein
he had liv'd for many years, he would find himself reduc'd to a
very moderate fortune: That though he could be assur'd the
Duke's humour would continue constant to him, yet ought the
declining posture of his Affairs in <hi>Provence</hi> to give him a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Alarm: That all things in that Country were so averse
to him, it was all the Duke could do to keep his head above
water; and that his Affairs coming to an absolute ruine, as they
evidently declin'd he would be in danger to be left in <hi>Metz,</hi>
without any support, or any colourable claim, either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
or recompense: That the King conceiving a Gentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>man
of his Valour and Merit, worthy a more certain fortune, did
voluntary offer to make him his own Lieutenant, in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Place and Country, under the Duke; whose
Authority being kept inviolate, he could have no just reason to
reproach him; for seeking to establish his own Fortune, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing any prejudice to his.</q> It was no hard matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<hi>Sobole</hi> into a thing he believ'd would settle his Affairs so
much to his advantage; so that he greedily swallow'd the bait,
and receiving a new Commission from the King, retir'd very well
satisfied with his Majesties bounty into his Government: But as
the first step into a fault, makes men subject to stumble into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
after having once fail'd in his Faith, he had now no more
regard to his Duty; and conceiving he had good title for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to Lord it over the Inhabitants of <hi>Metz,</hi> with greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
than he had formerly done; he grew insolent to the last
degree. Complaints whereof were soon brought to the Duke;
where to him they accus'd <hi>Sobole,</hi> for having rais'd mony upon
them by his own private Authority, and to have committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other insolencies against them. The Duke was at this time
disingag'd from the trouble of his Affairs in <hi>Provence,</hi> and
the residence he had since that time made at Court having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
him of <hi>Sobole</hi>'s deportment, he was questionless possess'd
with an indignation proportionable to the offense: but he very
well foresaw, that the King, who had in design rais'd <hi>Sobole</hi>
against him, would doubtless uphold him, and justifie his own
Commission; so that he durst by no means act any thing in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
against him, not go about by open force to displace him:
but on the contrary dissembled as much as in him lay, both the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63412:129"/>
knowledge, and the trouble of his fault; and when continually
importun'd by reiterated complaints from the Inhabitants of
<hi>Metz,</hi> (a people he ever had in great consideration) he only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish'd
him to behave himself with greater moderation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them: but <hi>Sobole</hi> was deaf to all those admonitions, and
so far from slackning his hand, that on the contrary, to render the
Duke's good Offices fruitless to them, he contriv'd with himself
to accuse many of the principal among them to the King, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
(as he said) endeavour'd to betray the Town, and Cittadel
of <hi>Metz</hi> to <hi>Count Mansfield,</hi> Governour of <hi>Luxenbourg,</hi> for the
King of <hi>Spain:</hi> Which he did, to the end that his Majesty being
prepossess'd with so black an accusation, no one, not so much as
the Duke himself might dare to speak in their behalf. The busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was very strictly examin'd, and in the end discover'd to be a
meer calumny, which made all the world conclude it had been
inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ted by <hi>Sobole</hi> in spite to deprive the Inhabitants of their
Lives and Estates: a malice so notorious, that the Duke
could no longer endure a people, whom he lov'd, and had ever
protected, should be so ill us'd by a man he himself had appointed
to govern, but not to destroy them: Which made him openly
undertake their protection against <hi>Sobole</hi>'s violence, against whom
the hatred the people had conceiv'd, having provok'd them into
arms, they besieg'd him in the Cittadel; a thing the Duke was
not sorry for, hoping this would counsel the King to remove
him, and that he being out, the place could be supply'd by none,
from whom he might not promise to himself better things than
from <hi>Sobole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What the Duke had so prudently foreseen,<note place="margin">Anno 1603.</note> fell out exactly, as
he imagin'd it would; for the King alarm'd at the danger of so
important a place (it being very much to be fear'd his ill neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
would take the advantage of the evil intelligence betwixt
the Governour and the people, to seize the Town, resolv'd to
go thither in person; and accordingly with the Queen, and all
the Court set forward in the beginning of the year 1603. A journy
in which the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was too much concern'd to stay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind;
and in the issue whereof <hi>Sobole</hi> was depos'd from his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
with a pardon for all that was pass'd; which his ill
carriage had made the reward of his Service, and all the recompense
he receiv'd for so brave a Command. After his departure his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
resolv'd himself to dispose of his places; a thing wherein
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s interest did most of all consist, who till
that time had ever had the disposition of all Offices inferiour to his
own in that Government; and by that means had been absolute
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63412:129"/>
over the City: but his Authority being suspected to the King, who would have no other than his own acknowledg'd in his
Kingdom, his Majesty gave the Duke to understand, that <hi>Sobole</hi>
having resign'd unto him his Lieutenancy to the Government of
the City, and Cittadel of <hi>Metz,</hi> and the <hi>Messin</hi> Country, which
his Majesty had formerly seated him in, he was now resolv'd to
settle men of Condition, and approv'd Fidelity in his room, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
reserving (which his Majesty would by no means diminish)
for the Duke his Authority in the place; that in order thereunto
he had cast his eye upon the two Brothers <hi>les Sieurs de Montigny,</hi>
and <hi>d' Arquien;</hi> to the first of which he would give his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
to the City, and Country; and to the other the command
of the Cittadel: but that the one and the other should render
him an obedience equal to his own person. The Duke, having
well enough foreseen how things would be, had nothing to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
against his Majesties Royal Pleasure; but without co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
gave way to necessity, and with patience (the only remedy
remain'd) was content to expect some happy opportunity that
might re-establish him in the possession of a place so important to
his fortune, and whereof he saw himself at present absolutely
depriv'd.</p>
                  <p>During his Majesties abode at <hi>Metz,</hi> the Provincial of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Jesuits was by the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> presented to him;
where the proposition preferr'd by the Provincial for the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of his fraternity in <hi>France,</hi> was so promoted by the
Duke's mediation, that it was concluded on to his great satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Neither was this the first good office the Duke had done
them, nor the sole testimony he had given of his affection, and
respect to that Society; he having ever been one of their most
constant, and most powerful Protectors in the time of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
as he was one of their principal benefactors after their
re-establishment. <hi>Metz,</hi> that ever till then had made many, and
almost invincible difficulties of ever admitting them into their
Corporation, receiv'd them upon the Duke's single accompt, as
he also procur'd their admission into <hi>Angoulesme</hi> before he left that
Government: Their Colledge of <hi>Xaints</hi> has no other foundation
than what he bestow'd upon it of four thousand Livers a year in
two fair Benefices, which put all together have rendred him one
of the principal Benefactors of that Society, by the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and testimony of the most ancient, and most eminent men
of the Order.</p>
                  <p>The variety of accidents,<note place="margin">The state of Affairs at Court du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Peace.</note> and business that had befallen the
King in these last years, were yet too few to take him wholly up,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63412:130"/>
he still found leisure enough for his delights; and although he
himself took a particular accompt of all. Affairs, and was ever the
main director in all things; yet his abilities (which nothing was
too big for) rendred him so excellent at dispatch, that he still made
way for his vacation and pleasure. The Peace concluded with all
his Neighbours, and his domestick troubles extinguish'd, either by
the punishment of the offenders, or by the excess of his own cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
gave him now sufficient leisure to look after the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of such abuses as were crept into the state during the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

grown so much in fashion at Court, that there was scarce any talk
of any other thing; and if they had, during this Voyage to
<hi>Metz,</hi> suffer'd a little intermission, they were, at the return of the
Court to <hi>Paris,</hi> more than ever set on foot. It has been believ'd,

                     </gap>ivity of his own nature; yet that for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
play, he had in that as much design at least, as inclination.
I have already told you, that his Majesty having set down the
bringing low the great men of his Kingdom by imperceptible
ways, to render them more obedient, for a Maxime of State, had
put them upon the humour of Building, to drain their purses:
and doubtless his engaging them in play, was in order to the same
design: amongst whom the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who already
felt the smart of the first, and that very well understood his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
meaning in the latter, refus'd not nevertheless to make one
for his Master's satisfaction: but if he did it at first meerly
out of compliance, his ill fortune at last made it become his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and enclin'd him so passionately to it, that he found himself
in the end engag'd in so extraordinary losses, as were no little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
to him. His Majesty would often do him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to play at his house, ever inviting him to all his Matches:
And whether he retir'd to <hi>Zamet,</hi> or to any other place to evade
the tumult of Majesty and Greatness, the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was
always the first invited; so that although he was not in favour,
he was nevertheless in great esteem: of which one of the most
signal testimonies he could receive, was the honour the King did
him in permitting him to enter the <hi>Louvre</hi> in his Coach; a favour
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63412:130"/>
till this time reserv'd only for the Princes of the Blood, exclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to all other persons of the Kingdom, the Duke being the first
that unlock'd this Priviledge for the Dukes, and Peers, though he
enjoy'd it alone during the King's life; his Majesty, though o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

importun'd by others of the same quality, for the same honour,
never consenting to have it drawn into example. 'Tis true, that
after the King's death, the Queen Regent, to accommodate her
self to the time, was content to abate much of the Royal State,
and allow'd the Dukes, and Peers, and Officers of the Crown,
the same Priviledge: but the respect to the Duke's person was
that which first procur'd them that indulgence.</p>

of impoverishing the Lords of his Court, whose Riches grew
suspected to him. The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was one from whom
he drew the most considerable summes; who after having got
all his ready mony, and many of his Jewels, he moreover won
of him a piece of Ambergris, to the value of 20000. Crowns,
the greatest that ever was seen in Europe; and which the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
of <hi>Venice,</hi> to whom it was after sold, preserve to this day in
their Treasure for a great rarity. The Duke had not long been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of it; a Country fellow that had found it upon the Coast of
<hi>Medoc,</hi> having but a little before brought it to him, as a thing due
to the House of <hi>Candale;</hi> of which the Duke was now the head.
This Ancient and illustrious Family, are possessors of many goodly
Mannors in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and principally in the Country of <hi>Medoc,</hi>
with as ample priviledges as belong to any of the greatest Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Kingdom; of which one of the most honourable is
that of the Admiralty, which might also have been one of the
most profitable, had the Duke when the <hi>Spanish</hi> Carricks suffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Shipwrack upon that Coast in the year 1627<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been countenanc'd
in his right; which, however at that time set aside, derives to him
nevertheless from a Title of above 300. years standing, to all the
wracks that should happen any where within the extent of above
fifty Leagues upon the Coast that bounds this Territory. But
how just soever his claim might be, it was impossible for him to
justifie his title against the Power, that then under his Majesties
name exercis'd a more than Sovereign Authority. The Sea of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi>
one of the most tempestuous of the Ocean, famous for Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks,
and for that reason call'd <hi>La Mer Sauvage,</hi> or the wild
Sea, hath usually in stormy weather cast up Ambergris, and
the best in the world, upon that Coast; a truth I can with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
aver, after having been an eye-witness of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
that, and the other which was brought from the Indies in
the Carricks. The people of the Country, by the profit invited
to this search, never fail, after a storm to rake all along the Shoar
for this Commodity, wherein they have often very good fortune;
I having seen in my time a piece, which though much less than
that I have already mention'd, weigh'd above twenty pound, and
was valued at above 20000. Livers, found by a Country fellow
in the year 1625. wherein he did all he could to cheat the Lord of
his due; to whom two thirds of the thing found does of right
belong, and the third to the finder, if he make a faithful discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
but this fellow's fraud being found out, the Duke was by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
favour'd in his claim, and made master of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke on the one hand lost his Mony and Jewels at
play, his liberality at the same time acquir'd a Treasure sufficient
to recompense those losses, and that was the friendship of <hi>Messire
Philip Cospean,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Philip Cospean</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zieux</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>'s means.</note> first Bishop of <hi>Aire,</hi> afterwards of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and
lastly of <hi>Lizieux,</hi> where a few years since he died in as high a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Sanctity and Learning, as any Prelate of his time.
This good Bishop was at this time a young man, newly arriv'd
from <hi>Mons</hi> in <hi>Hainault,</hi> where he was born; who having run
through his course of Study at <hi>Lovain,</hi> under the tuition of <hi>Iustus
Lipsius,</hi> with great applause, had assurance enough to trust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the great Theatre of Europe, and resolv'd upon a
Journey to <hi>Paris:</hi> Thither being come, he first undertook the
Education of <hi>Messieurs de Ramboüillet,</hi> and <hi>du Fargis,</hi> Pupils wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of so excellent a Tutor; when from private Precepts, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to publick Lectures, he became Philosophy Reader, which he
so admirably perform'd, that he soon eclips'd the Reputation of
the most famous Doctors of his time. <hi>Le Plessis Baussonniere,</hi>
who in the profession of Arms retain'd yet a great inclination to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:63412:131"/>
Learning, being invited by <hi>Cospean</hi>'s Reputation to his Lectures,
a particular friendship was soon contracted betwixt them; under
the priviledge of which <hi>Le Plessis</hi> importun'd <hi>Cospean</hi> to leave the
Schools, and to mount the Pulpit, incouraging his modesty with
the applause he might infallibly promise to himself from the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and opinion of all judicious men. With much ado <hi>Cospean</hi>
was at last overcome by his Friends perswasions, so that he
preach'd, and in a short time got so high a repute, that <hi>le Plessis</hi>
made no difficulty to invite the Duke his Master to hear a stranger
preach, that had no name at Court. The Duke went the first
time to hear him upon <hi>le Plessis</hi> account, where being highly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the Eloquence of this new Orator, he afterwards drew
most of the Court to hear him, where <hi>Cospean</hi> out-stripping the
expectation of all his Auditories, arriv'd in a short space to such a
degree of Reputation, that he became the model of queint
Preaching; and doubtless by this stranger Eloquence first moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Pulpit in <hi>France.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> not content on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to countenance the Reputation of so deserving a man, would
further by his bounty advance a Vertue, that he had first brought
into the light; wherefore the Bishoprick of <hi>Aire</hi> having been
some time vacant by the decease of <hi>Francis de Foix,</hi> and <hi>de Candale,</hi>
and this Dignity being at his dispose, he preferr'd the Merit of
his Friend, to the consideration and respect of many men of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
his Relations; and unknown to <hi>Cospean,</hi> dispatch'd his <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi> to the Bishoprick, procur'd Bulls from <hi>Rome</hi> at his own
Charge, and gave him Furniture and Equipage necessary for the
support of his Dignity, which would otherwise have been very
chargeable to him. A bounty this good Prelate would often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to me in the story of his Life, with the greatest acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment;
and never was man more grateful for a Benefit, than
he made it appear he was for this all the days of his life. Neither
if he, upon all occasions, highly magnified the Duke's Liberality,
was the Duke less satisfied with his good Fortune, that had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him so happy an opportunity to oblige so excellent a man;
from whom, I have often heard him declare, he receiv'd more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
in his Affairs, more sweetness, and satisfaction in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and more comfort in his afflictions, than from all the
advantages he had deriv'd from Fortune besides, during the whole
course of his long life.</p>
                  <p>All these things past during the calm the Court at this time liv'd
in, a tranquillity wherein the King, who by the sole reputation of
his name kept all things quiet abroad, and who had very little to
do at home, began seriously to think of improving his Revenue,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63412:132"/>
and of filling his Treasure; his great, and noble courage suggesting
to him generous designs enough of employing it one day to the
glory of his own name, and to the advantage of his Crown and
Kingdom. A time wherein the presence of his great Ministers
being not very necessary at Court, where all things were carried on
by his Majesties own particular conduct, every man had leisure
to look after his own private affairs.</p>
                  <p>It was after the foremention'd transactions that hapned in the
Years 1602. and 1603.<note place="margin">Anno 1604.</note> that the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> willing to share
in the liberty of the time,
departed in the latter end of the last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and thinking himself not clear in his Reputation, unless he return'd
again to <hi>Bordeaux</hi> to renew the match had before by the <hi>Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals</hi>
morosity been broken off, he went again to <hi>Bordeaux</hi> in the
beginning of the year 1604. to make ready for a Carnaval; to
which he had invited a far greater number of Nobility, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
than before, and where the preparation for Masques, Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the Ring, Balls, and Feasting, were made with great
pomp, and vast expense. But the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> notwithstanding the
Orders he had receiv'd from the King, conceiving this business,
what gloss soever might be put upon it, would be interpreted to
his disgrace, and would pass in the opinions of men at honour for
a Bravado, and an affront to him in his Government, could by
no means perswade himself to digest it, which made him very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
with the King, that his Majesty would please to absolve
him from so injurious a condition; a thing the King (who had
him in great esteem) would as willingly have done: But his
Royal Word being already pass'd to the Duke, whom he knew
to be as obstinate as the other, in things wherein his Honour was
concern'd, and not knowing how at once to satisfie two so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
humours, matters were in all apparence going into as ill
terms as at first, when an accident fell out that soon took the Duke
off all thoughts of that Solemnity. The Dutchess of <hi>Bar</hi> the
King's only Sister, hapned to dye at this time which gave the
King occasion to write to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> that he assur'd
himself all such good Subjects and Servants, as he was, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lament with him for the loss of so dear a Relation, than to
think of Mirth and publick Solemnities of Joy, at so unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a time; a command so much the easier for the Duke to obey,
by how much he himself had particular reason to be really afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the death of that excellent Lady. So that by this accident the
<hi>Mareschal d' Ornano</hi> saw himself disingag'd from one of the greatest
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63412:132"/>
extremities he had ever found himself involv'd in, it having been
otherwise necessary for him, either absolutely to disobey the King,
which he could not have done without incurring his disgrace, or
patiently to submit to an affront he himself had declar'd to be the
greatest he could possibly receive; and that ('tis said) he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to have avoided by laying down his Commission: such as
were most perfect in his passionate nature being confident, had it
come to the push, he would certainly have ransom'd himself
from that submission at the price of his Fortune.</p>
                  <p>The Duke continued some time after this in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and from
thence returned into <hi>Angoumois,</hi> where he spent the remainder of
the year, without being call'd thence upon any publick occasion.
All things (as has been said) were quiet, and the King seem'd to be
wholly taken up, with the care of husbanding and filling his
Exchequer; wherein though some believ'd him to be meerly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by a natural inclination to the love of mony; yet his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
which a few years after disclos'd themselves gave the world
an accompt, that there was more of design than avarice in the exact
care he took to moderate the excessive expense had by his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
been introduc'd into the Kingdom. The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>
nevertheless could have wish'd his Majesty had been more open
handed to the Garrisons in his Government, those of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi>
and <hi>Xaintes</hi> being so ill paid that they could hardly subsist; which
putting him into an apprehension, that those places (become
now as it were Frontier Towns, since those of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
had made a kind of separation in the State, of which <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle</hi>
seem'd to be the Metropolitan City) might be lost in his
hands, he continually represented to the King the danger those
Cities were in, but without being regarded at all; which made
him in the beginning of the ensuing year resolve upon a Journey
to Court, to try, if in person, and by word of mouth he could not
prevail more, than by continual importunities in writing he had
hitherto done: where being arriv'd, and presenting himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King, his Majesty as'd him in what condition he had left
his Governments? to whom the Duke reply'd, That they could
not possibly be in a worse; the necessity of the Souldiery in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
being so great that he durst not undertake for the security of
those places committed to his charge. To which the King having
made answer, That they were us'd as others were: The Duke
(who very well knew the difference his Majesty made betwixt his
Catholick Garrisons, and the neighbouring places possess'd by
those of the Reform'd Religion) took the liberty to tell him, that
those who had so inform'd his Majesty had given him a very ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63412:133"/>
of his Affairs, the Garrisons of those of the Religion, who
perhaps were arm'd to the prejudice of his Service, being nothing
in Arrear, whilst the Catholicks who were firm in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
were ready to perish for want of pay. The King nettled at
so tart a reply, and angry that the Duke should give him so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
a reproach in the discovery of a truth, he had a mind, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reasons, should have been conceal'd, suffer'd himself to be so
far transported by his passion, that he could not forbear to tell the
Duke, <q>He was perverse, and importunate: That he sought all
occasions to displease him: That he would have done him
a greater kindness to have kept still at the distance he was at,
than to come into his presence only to offend him; and for the
close of all, that he had long observ'd he did not love him.</q> To
which the Duke without being thunder-struck at the King's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which might perhaps have surpriz'd another man, less confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his Fidelity than he, insisting upon the last words, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
coldly, but after a serious manner, <q>Sir, your Majesty
has not a more faithful Subject than my self in your Kingdom,
and I had rather die, than do any thing contrary to the least
particle of my duty:<note place="margin">A bold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer from the Duke to the King, well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and turn'd to his advantage.</note> But Sir, for what concerns friendship,
your Majesty knows very well, that is a thing not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
but by Friendship.</q> At so bold, and generous an answer,
there was none who was not astonish'd at the Duke's freedom,
and that was not ready to condemn his rashness; though the King
himself, who knew how to put a just value upon great actions,
and how to interpret language of this nature, was of a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
opinion, and gave no reply: but on the contrary, refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
upon what the Duke had said, converted his indignation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
esteem; and interpreting what others thought temerity, for an
effect of honest liberty, proceeding from a good conscience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to make himself belov'd, by the way the Duke had laid
him down, and from that time forward began to use him much
better, than he had ever done. Neither was the Duke wanting
on his part, but perceiving his Majesties good disposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and adding the spur of affection to what he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
perform'd upon the meer accompt of duty, he at last ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
so great a share in his Majesties favour, and good opinion,
that before his death he receiv'd as many testimonies of his Royal
good Will and Confidence,<note place="margin">Anno 1605.</note> as any other person of his condition
whatsoever in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This confidence began soon after to appear,<note place="margin">The Duke's expedition into <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousin.</hi>
                     </note> by the command
the King was pleas'd to give the Duke over the Horse and Foot he
sent into <hi>Limousin;</hi> when tir'd out with the continual disorders,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:63412:133"/>
the excess of his clemency begat every day in his Kingdom, he
was resolv'd to take order once for all, and by a severe and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
punishment to quiet the Rebellion some of <hi>Mounsieur
de Boüillons</hi> Servants openly maintain'd after his departure out of
the Kingdom in <hi>Perigord, Quercy,</hi> and <hi>Limousin.</hi> The <hi>Mareschal
de Boüillon</hi> was seiz'd of many very fair possessions, and had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Friends and Servants in those Provinces; where the Nobility,
Gentry, and Commons being also naturally inclin'd to Arms, it
was no hard matter to perswade them into commotion.</p>
                  <p>The King had been given to understand, that under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
of seeking protection only from the Protestant Princes of
<hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Swisse Cantons;</hi> the <hi>Mareschal</hi> endeavour'd to
interest them in the Quarrel of those of the Religion in <hi>France,</hi>
by possessing them (as it was said) that since the King's Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
their usage was far different from what it had formerly been,
and the liberty of Conscience far more restrain'd, than it us'd to
be. Neither did his Majesty doubt, but that all of his opinion
in his Kingdom, would easily be induc'd to follow the Duke of
<hi>Boüillon</hi>'s discontent, who had acquir'd an absolute reputation
among them. He farther saw that many Catholicks made no
scruple to joyn with him, to the end they might re-enjoy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of War, which would by no means be allow'd them in the
better times of Peace: He knew that great summes of mony
were distributed for the raising of men; which mony was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to come from <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence all the intestine broils
of his Kingdom had ever been countenanc'd, and promoted. Evil
dispositions, that being all joyn'd together, were sufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
great disorders in the State, and to reduce the King in spite
of his heart to the necessity of a Civil War. His Majesty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thinking it very convenient to prevent all these disorders, and
to suffocate them in their Birth, resolv'd to go in person to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousin,</hi>
either by his Presence to appease, or by his Authority to
suppress the begun Commotions: but to dispose them to their
obedience if possible before his arrival, to chastise some Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
without drawing the Odium immediately upon himself, and
to reduce every one to his Duty; he order'd the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
to go before with six Companies only of his Regiment of
Guards, and four Troops of Horse; not doubting but with this
little Body, together with the Duke's Interest (which was very
considerable in those parts, of which some places were under his
own Government) he would be able to give a better accompt of
his Expedition, than another perhaps could do with greater For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And to the end that his Justice might accompany his Arms,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63412:134"/>
he joyn'd to the Duke <hi>Iean Iaques de Mesmes Segnieur de Roissy,</hi>
Master of Requests, with Commission of Oyer and Terminer to
sit upon the Life, and Death of the Offenders. This was he so
famous for his Integrity, and Valour, that was afterwards Doyen
to the Council of State, where, though the esteem every one
had of his Vertue was very great; yet was it no more, than
was due to his merit; although afterwards in the progress of a
long life, he had this honour added to the rest he enjoy'd, to see
his name illustrated by a noble Posterity; not any man scarce of
his condition in the Kingdom having supply'd the State with so
great and able Ministers. The Duke having taken his leave of
the King, advanc'd into <hi>Limousin;</hi> where he would have <hi>Crequy</hi>
Camp-Master to the Regiment of Guards to command in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the Forces he took along with him, and where the most tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent

nothing less than their defense; some of the most advis'd
fearing to have to do with the Duke, or <hi>de Roissy,</hi> appeal'd to his
Majesties mercy, and by the acknowledgement of their offense,

only falling into the hands of Justice. Of which five or six suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd

ways: so that before the King's arrival at <hi>Limoges,</hi> all those
Countries, that before breath'd nothing but Sedition and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
were now so calm and still, that his Majesty had nothing to
do, but by his Clemency to settle Rebels, newly reclaim'd from
their Disobedience, in their Duty, and to reward his faithful
Subjects, by the demonstrations of his Grace and Favour.</p>

years had been nourish'd betwixt the House of <hi>Guise</hi> and him,
continued still, which was ready to discover it self upon every

betwixt them: In all which disputes, the Duke (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and by their Offices in the State, by their vast possessions in the
Kingdom, and above all by the great number of generous
Princes of which it was compos'd, as also by the potency of their

and Servants, as might secure him from the apprehension
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:63412:135"/>
of the greatness of any. He had sometime before this had a brisk

proceeded so far, that the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> by the hands of <hi>la

                     </note> now Duke of <hi>Chevreuse,</hi> and
Brother to the Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi> for this Prince having staid the
Coach of a Woman of Quality at the outer Gate of the <hi>Louvre,</hi>
one night that the King had appointed a great Dancing at Court,
and the Duke coming out, with the Duke of <hi>Montensier</hi> to go
home, the Ladies Coach so stopt the Gate, that the Duke's could
not possibly pass; wherefore he commanded the Coachman to make
way: But the Duke of <hi>Chevreuse,</hi> who was lean'd upon one of the
Boots of the Coach, on the dark side where he could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
commanded the Coach-man not to stir, seeking (as it was
plain enough) out of youthful bravery, an occasion to quarrel:
nor did the Duke fail to give him as good a one, as he could desire;
for not being able longer to endure the insolency of so base a fellow,
he cudgell'd the Coach-man so well, that he forc'd him at last to
give back. The Prince <hi>de Ioinville,</hi> who perhaps forbore out of
respect to the Duke of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> appear'd not at all in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at that time; but in the morning sent the Gentleman of his
Horse, <hi>le Comté</hi> by name, to question the Duke about it: The
Duke was yet in his bed, and asleep when the Gentleman came,
but being wak'd by the Groom of his Chamber, who never refus'd
admittance to any, he sent for him to his bed-side; where being
come, the Gentleman told him that he was sent by the Prince of
<hi>Ioinville</hi> his Master, to know, if when he beat the Coachman
over night, he did it to affront him? To which the Duke return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no answer, but only asking him where his Master was? and
the other having answered that he staid at the foot of <hi>Montmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi>
with a good Horse, and a good Sword to expect him, he,
without more words leap'd out of his Bed, drest himself in the
Gentleman's presence, and having led him into his Armory, took
out thence two Swords of equal length; whereof he gave him the
choice; by which time the Master of his own Horse, being also
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63412:135"/>
come to him they went all three together to the place. Being
there come, the Duke found the Prince <hi>de Ioinville</hi> ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, their Swords were already drawn, and they were just
going to't; when the Prince, who had his face towards <hi>Paris,</hi>

                     </gap>orse coming that way, and suspecting it was
with an intent to prevent them, shew'd them to the Duke, telling
him withal that they must spur to gain the <hi>Bois de Boulogne,</hi> and
without more words turn'd his Horse that way. The Duke, who
by the distance of those he saw, conceiv'd they had yet time
enough to end their dispute before they could come in to interrupt
them, had a great mind, without going further, to have dispatch'd
the business there: but being necessitated to follow the Prince,
who was already upon the gallop towards the Wood, he spurr'd
after, though they could not make such haste, but that they were
interrupted before they could come there, and by their Friends
carried back to the City. Where the King, having notice of their
Quarrel, commanded them both to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and there took
up the bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iness, making them embrace in his presence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to be good friends. That which was most remarkable on the
Duke's side in this occasion was, that the number of those who
declar'd themselves of his Party was so great, that they took up
all the space betwixt the <hi>Roule,</hi> to the <hi>Louvre;</hi> whilst the Duke of
<hi>Ioinville</hi> was only countenanc'd by those of his own Relation,
whose interest in <hi>Paris</hi> was at this time very much declin'd, from
what it had formerly been in the life of the Duke his Father.</p>
                  <p>Although the residence of this great City was very pleasing to

into <hi>Champagne,</hi> and as far as <hi>Sedan,</hi> to reduce the Duke of <hi>Boü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>
to his duty. This Duke keeping himself still at a distance
from the Court, and refractory to several Summons his Majesty
had sent him to make his appearance, and by justifying himself to
obtain his favour, it was plain that his refusing to come, was a
contempt to the Sovereign Authority, and that therefore his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in the vindication of his own honour, was oblig'd to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stize
him. Neither did he longer defer, for that purpose to make his
preparation for a Journey to <hi>Sedan.</hi> In this expedition the Duke
of <hi>Espernon,</hi> whom the King began now much better to relish,
and whose admirable care, and vigilancy, upon all occasions, gave
his Majesty infinite satisfaction, had the command of the Vant-Guard
committed to him, and had matters proceeded to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:63412:136"/>
of a Siege, was design'd for one of the most important
Quarters against the Town: but the Duke of <hi>Boüillon</hi> having at
last shut himself up in the place, and not willing to pull upon
himself the utmost effects of the King's indignation, had recourse
to his mercy; and by his submissions, together with the Queens
intercession (who ordinarily accompanied the King in all his
Motions) obtain'd of his Majesty an indempnity for all things
past, upon the most favourable terms he could himself expect,
or desire. Whereupon he receiv'd the King into the City the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>April</hi> 1606. with a Garrison of 300. men, which by the
condition of the Accommodation were to remain four years in
the Castle; during which time his Majesty would make tryal of
this new Convert's perseverance in his duty: but that long space
was, by his Majesties favour, reduc'd to a few months, the bounty
of this generous Prince ever contracting the term of mens dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces;
his displeasure being short liv'd, and of no continuance;
but his noble nature being ever constant to oblige all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>Though the following year was pass'd over without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
in the Kingdom;<note place="margin">Anno 1607.</note> yet did his Majesties Name, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
give him opportunity, and by his Authority, Power, to
compose one of the most dangerous differences, that could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
have hapned amongst Christian Princes, and that was the
falling out betwixt the Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the V. and the Republick of
<hi>Venice:</hi> a disorder, that had it not in time been taken up, would
infallibly have involv'd all Christendom in the Quarrel, and it is
infini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great a confusion to have made a formidable advance into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
heart of Europe. A danger that his Majesty (than whom none
was clearer sighted) very well forsaw, and (retaining a grateful
memory of the obligations he had receiv'd, both from the Holy
Sea, and that Republick at his advancement to the Crown) as soon
undertook to interpose betwixt those two powerful adversaries.
The business was carried on by the mediation of the Cardinal <hi>de
Ioyeuse,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Perron;</hi> wherein the one, and the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
according to his Majesties wise direction, their endeavours
were at last crown'd with success, and all things concluded to the
satisfaction of both parties, but chiefly to the Honour of <hi>France;</hi>
which now appear'd to be the Arbiter of all the Estates of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.
And indeed in those times all things in a manner were
sway'd by his Majesties will; his desire being almost a rule to all
Princes in all Affairs: Neither was there in the whole world a
Kingdom to be found more glorious, more flourishing, or more
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:63412:136"/>
happy, than that of <hi>France,</hi> during the Reign of this mighty Prince.</p>
                  <p>Yet could not all this reputation abroad secure him from affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
at home; neither could his greatness and bounty exempt
him from the power of Death; who first exercising his cruelty
upon some of his Family, discharg'd in the end his whole rage
and fury upon his own person. The precedent year had ravish'd

                     </note> a Prince for whom his
Majesty had as great a kindness, as for any whatsoever of his
Blood, as he made it appear by the true sorrow he manifested
for his death: but the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was afflicted beyond all
expression. I have already given an accompt of the Alliance betwixt
these two, and of the particular Friendship that Alliance begot,
I shall now further say, they were inseparable in their conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
their Interests went ever hand in hand with one another, and
it will be hard to find a Friendship so pure, and constant betwixt
two private persons, as they ever preserved entire, in the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
and revolutions of the Court. Neither could the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of a Prince of his extraction and vertue be otherwise than
of great importance to the Duke; whose prosperity and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had procur'd him so much envy, and consequently so many
enemies: yet was he constrain'd to submit to the inevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of death, and to bear with patience a loss for which there
was no other remedy.</p>
                  <p>This accident was yet follow'd by another the ensuing year,<note place="margin">Anno 1608.</note> at
which the Duke was almost equally afflicted: <hi>Pere Ange de Ioyeuse,</hi>
Father-in-law to the Duke of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> had been return'd into
the Order of Fathers Capuchins from the year 1599. from which
time he had continued in the austerity of his Canon with so great
zeal and sanctity, that he was become a president of Vertue, and
Holy Living to all the Religious Men of his Order: Yet did
he not (when returning to the observation of his Vow, he threw
off all worldly vanities, and desires) banish from his breast those
true affections which Nature and Reason had planted in his heart:
but on the contrary had ever in his greatest retirement cherish'd
the Duke's friendship, as if he had been his true Brother in Blood,
as he was in Alliance and Affection. Neither was the Duke on
his part less sedulous to improve so vertuous an Interest, ever ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring,
and loving him, even in his penitential Sack-cloath, at
as high a rate, as when he liv'd in the greatest Lustre, in the most
honourable employments; and applying himself with greater
diligence to the Interests of his House, and to the advancement of
his Daughter, than when he himself liv'd upon the great Theatre
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63412:137"/>
of the busie world: so that in different capacities of living, their
friendship continued still one, and the same, till death came to cut
the knot,<note place="margin">The death of <hi>Pere An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge de Ioyeuse</hi> the Duke's Brother-in-law.</note> which along had power to dissolve it. This Holy man
died at <hi>Rivoly</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in his return from <hi>Rome,</hi> in great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Sanctity and Vertue, which has since by time been made
more manifest to all.</p>
                  <p>The following year affords so little considerable to be said of
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> in particular (the Court being at this time
wrap'd in so great a calm and security,<note place="margin">Anno 1609.</note> that there is nothing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be reported of any save the King himself) that it might
well enough be pass'd over in silence: But having hitherto found
out something or other to record in the foregoing years, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
travel, not out of my subject only, but also out of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Kingdom, than to omit the most glorious proof his
Majesty could possibly give of his Authority with all the Princes,
and States of Christendom in the conclusion of the Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the States of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
                  <p>This great affair had been fruitlesly propos'd almost from the
very first bustle of Arms in that Country; neither had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
been wanting even in the heat of the most bloody executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(that the fury of War has perhaps produc'd in any part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope)
for the effecting of so good a work,, Treaties of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
having every year, during those troubles been constantly
by some or other set on foot: but the animosity of Factions, the
difference of Religions, and the variety of Events, that had ever
kept Affairs on both sides as it were in-equal balance, had so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated
the minds of men, that scarce any proposition of Peace
would be endur'd. A work, it seems, reserv'd to be an additional
Ray to the King's Glory,<note place="margin">The Truce betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> concluded by the King's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation.</note> whose reputation only could cut the knot
of all those difficulties. <hi>Spain</hi> had great need of Peace, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
often, without interessing the King in the Affair, sought
in vain, he was in fine constrain'd to apply himself to him
to procure it, and wholly to submit all things to his Arbitration.
A task the King (very well satisfied with so high, and publick an
acknowledgment of his power) as readily undertook, and to
that purpose dispatch'd away President <hi>Ianin,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de
R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>issy,</hi> to manage the Work: by whose prudent conduct, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by their Masters Reputation, they effected that by the weight
of Authority, which perhaps their dexterity (how great soever)
without great labour and expence of much time, could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have brought to pass. So that things were reduc'd to the
point the parties concern'd could themselves desire; from
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63412:137"/>
whence followed an universal Peace amongst all Christian
Princes.</p>
                  <p>It was into this tranquille condition, that the Affairs of Europe
were first to be wrought,<note place="margin">Anno 1610.</note> before the King could begin to form it
into the new mould he had long design'd; for this great Prince,
born to reconcile Monarchy and Justice, being unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the proud Authority, with which the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it over all her Neighbours, and more impatient that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion
of his Empire the <hi>Spaniard</hi> should reap advantages,
which he conceiv'd were more justly due to his Birth, and Valour,
he resolv'd to clip the wings of this soaring greatness, to make
him give back those Territories he usurp'd from his Neighbours, to
restore the Republicks their ancient liberty, and finally to reduce
his power to the limits of his primitive possession. This in short
is all that can be said of the King's designs, and all that such as
conceiv'd they penetrated deepest into his most private thoughts,
could possibly divine; it being most certain that he discover'd the
bottom of his design to none, which had it been communicated
to any, the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> would doubtless in this conjuncture
have participated of the trust:<note place="margin">The King makes great preparation for War.</note> but as this great Prince would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
all things in his own person, so did he here reserve to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the secret of his resolutions; insomuch that though his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was all ready drawn into the Field, that he himself was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to come up to them, and that in all probability there would
be sudden action; yet durst no one venture positively to determine
whither that preparation was directed, or who was to feel the first
edge of his Arms: neither shall I presume to deliver these conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
for truth, nor suffer my curiosity to transgress the bounds
this mighty Prince in his wisdom prescrib'd even to the most
faithful Ministers of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This brave and laudable ambition having long possess'd his
generous heart, he had from the first Idea of his design wisely laid
up for the means to effect it, that it might succeed to his glory:
and to that end, from the time peace was first settled in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
had been gathering, and had now got together a prodigious
Treasure: His Artillery and Ammunitions were all ready, and in
equipage fit to execute his vast designs. <hi>France</hi> was able to furnish
him with an infinite number of old Souldiers; neither, in the
fair weather he had been so solicitous to maintain at home, had
he forgot to take a particular care of breeding so many brave Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains,
and good Souldiers in the Low-Country-Wars, as were
sufficient, in a very short time, to bring such raw men as should
be rais'd, into very good discipline. Besides the Forces of his own
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63412:138"/>
Kingdom, he had made a League with all the neighbouring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Florence,</hi> and almost all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
and most of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> with the Hanse-Towns of
the Empire were engag'd to joyn with him: And the King of
<hi>England</hi> had made great preparation in favour of his designs; so
that in all apparence, what, and how great soever these designs
might be, they were very likely to succeed.</p>
                  <p>Nothing then being wanting, but a pretense to give colour to
his action, the death of the Dukes of <hi>Cléves,</hi> soon supply'd him
with one as good as he could desire; for after his death, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to his Dukedom being pretended to by all his Brothers-in-law,
who were five, the Marquis of <hi>Brandebourg,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>whourg,</hi> the <hi>Count Palatine,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Deux Ponts,</hi> and the
Marquis of <hi>Burgau;</hi> all these Princes agreed to appeal to the
King, and to stand to his Arbitration: but whilst they were plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their titles in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> the Emperour (pretending
all vacant Jurisdictions to be Fiefs of the Empire, and that for
want of Heirs Males, he had right to seize them in trust) had
there establish'd the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> his Cousin, as his Deputy
and Governour, for, and under him: in order to which delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Arch-Duke had already, by the assistance of the <hi>Austrian</hi>
Forces, possess'd himself of the best part of the Dutchy by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Iuliers;</hi> notwithstanding that the King had publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
he desir'd things might remain suspended, till every man's
Title was examin'd, and the true Heir could be known. And this
was in effect, all the reason could be given for this mighty prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
though an Army consisting of forty thousand <hi>French</hi> Foot,
ten thousand <hi>Swisse,</hi> ten thousand Horse, and fifty pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
with their Equipage; together with the Leavies the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Princes were still, on all hands preparing to joyn with him;
giving all the world to understand, that so great Forces were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for some other end, than only for the Accommodation of a
particular Quarrel, all men were in suspense, and in great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of what the event would be.</p>
                  <p>The Army then being in the Field, and the King ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from <hi>Paris,</hi> his Majesty would yet first take so good order to
secure the interior Peace of his Kingdom, that he might not,
when at a great distance, and in the heat of his Enterprizes, be
call'd back by Domestick troubles: A consideration that made
him determine to devolve his Royal Power to the Queen, and to
cause her to be declar'd Regent in his absence; and knowing that
how good soever her intentions were, and how sincere soever her
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63412:138"/>
administration might be; yet that the sovereign Authority he
left her invested withal, would require the Fidelity, Courage, and
Prudence of some great and experienc'd Minister to support it, he
cast his eye upon the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> to confer upon him that
great Trust and Honour. In this resolution therefore, having one
day call'd for the Duke, and causing him to come into his Closet,
where he was then with the Queen alone; the Duke was not a
little surpriz'd at the favourable, and obliging Character, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
was then pleas'd to give of him to the Queen, on so unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
an occasion. He told her, <q>That being upon the point to
go out of the Kingdom, the Government whereof he had, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his absence, committed to her care, he had consider'd how
necessary it would be for her to have a faithful Servant about her
person, upon all occurrences that might happen, and, in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
where the modesty of her Sex would not permit her to act
in her own person, to be assisting to her with his Wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Valour: That having to that end severally weigh'd the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of all the chief Officers of his Crown, he had found none,

there present: That having had a long experience of his
Fidelity, Wisdom, and Valour, he had determin'd to deprive
himself of his Service, though infinitely necessary to him in the
prosecution of his designs, and to send him back to her upon
the first sally of his Arms. That she might repose an entire and
perfect confidence in him, as he himself also did, who knew
him to be a man of approv'd Fidelity, and Honour: That he
was going to execute designs, wherein he was likely to meet
with many difficulties, and perhaps some danger; but that
whatever should happen, he desir'd her to rest secure in the
Duke's vigilancy, and care, for which he would undertake both
to himself and to her.</q> After which, turning to the Duke, he
told him, <q>That he did not require from him any confirmation
by new promises, of those things whereof he had assur'd the
Queen in his behalf: That he had had so many proofs of his
Vertue, in the integrity of his former Actions, it was not now
to be suspected, that he conjur'd him by the esteem, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he had for him, to justifie his expectation, to serve the Queen,
and the Princes his Children, with the same Fidelity he had
serv'd him, and to promise to himself for his reward, all the
acknowledgement he could reasonably expect from a grateful
Prince, and a good Master.</q> The Duke a little out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
at what the King had said in his favour, made answer in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63412:139"/>
few words, <q>That he did humbly acknowledge his obligation to
his Majesty for so high a Character, and for the unexpected Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
he was pleas'd to confer upon him, which in the nature of
it was far above all others, he had till then receiv'd from his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
bounty; and that if he had a thousand lives he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
lay them all at his feet to express his gratitude for so signal
a favour: That he did humbly beseech their Majesties to retain
that favourable opinion of him, and to conclude him the most
unworthy of all their Subjects, and the worst of all men, if
he ever fail'd in the least part of his Duty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this the King told him he could not leave him at present
with the Queen, having occasion for him to command the Vant-Guard
of his Army, till the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> should come up to
him, for whom he had reserv'd that employment. A thing the
Duke knew before, as also that the King intended him the honour
of that important command in the mean time: But the election of
his person in that great employment of sitting at the Helm, did
not a little displease, and increase the envy of many of the greatest
men of the Kingdom, who had long look'd a squint upon the
Duke's Prosperity and Favour; though his Majesty, having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely,
and upon very good grounds proceeded to that choice, was
not for any consideration, or by any arguments whatsoever to be
disswaded from that resolution.</p>
                  <p>I know not how some, who envy the Duke's name, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
may entertain a relation so much to his advantage; though
were I put to prove the truth of what I report, I could bring a
great many persons of Honour, and Quality to attest it; the
Queen Mother, in the first Letter she writ to the King after her es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
from <hi>Blois,</hi> makes particular mention of it; than whom no
one could be better inform'd in this Affair, and has also several
times since declar'd by word of mouth, what she then publish'd
in writing: neither was it a secret at that time, no more than I
hope it will be suspected in this, where so many persons are living
of Reputation enough to give it Authority, should it be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by any, who perhaps are not so well inform'd.</p>
                  <p>The King having, as has been said, taken order to secure all
things that were likely in his absence, to disturb the peace of his
Kingdom, prepar'd himself to be gone: The Queen had been
Crown'd at St. <hi>Dennis</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>May,</hi> and her entry into
<hi>Paris</hi> was design'd to have been, on Sunday the sixteenth, and on
the seventeenth his Majesty intended, without further delay, to set
out towards the Army. Nothing was now to be seen in <hi>Paris,</hi>
but great preparations of joy, and triumph, to honour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining

Prince, the terror of his Enemies, and the love and delight
of his people, going abroad upon the fourteenth of the same

strook through, though the King's Destiny would not suffer him
to receive it all; nor permit, that at the peril of his own life, he
should save that of his Master, as with all his soul he would have
done. The cursed Parricide proceeded yet to a third stab, of which
the two last were mortal, and with the second the King tumbled
dead upon the Duke, who receiv'd him in his Arms, his blood
boiling in great quantities out of his mouth. After this execrable
act, the cursed Assassinate was soon discover'd, against whom those
who attended the King, and amongst them Saint <hi>Michel,</hi> one of
his Gentlemen in ordinary, prompted by a just fury, had already
drawn his Sword to dispatch him; when the Duke, calling to
mind, how much those Gentlemen had been condemn'd who
kill'd <hi>Iaques Clement</hi> upon the Murther of <hi>Henry</hi> the III. by
whose imprudent zeal, a further discovery from the wretches own
mouth of the Authors of that abominable Treason, was preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he cried out to <hi>Saint Michel,</hi> and to the Footmen, who had
drawn their Swords to the same purpose, to hold, and upon pain
of death not to kill him, but only to seize kis person, that he
might be deliver'd into the hands of <hi>Iustice.</hi> A caution that serv'd
not a little to the vindication of an infinite number of worthy
men; on whom, without all doubt, the various Factions that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
broke out in the Kingdom, would according to their several
Animosities, have laid the blame of that detested Fact, to serve
for a pretense to their Insurrection. The Duke having given this
first order, commanded the Coach man to turn back to the <hi>Louvre,</hi>
and having spied in the King's Train, the Marquis <hi>de Monferrant</hi>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:63412:140"/>
his particular Friend and Servant, he intreated him to go before,
and from him to command the Foot Companies that were upon
the Guard before the <hi>Louvre,</hi> to stand immediately to their Arms,
and to secure all the Gates, to prevent any disorder in the King's
Houshold: In the execution of which command, and in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
the sight of so horrid, and so unexpected an accident
might reasonably put him into, <hi>Monferrant</hi> met the Chancellour
<hi>de Sillery,</hi> then going to Council in the <hi>Louvre;</hi> who asking him
the reason of that hurly burly, and of the Souldiers running to
their Arms, <hi>Monferrant</hi> told him the King was dead; at which
the Chancellour amaz'd, and in suspense how to believe it, grasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him by the arm, and saying how's that <hi>Mounsieur de Monfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant!</hi>
do you know what you say? the Coach arriv'd with the
Curtains drawn, out of which the King without any motion was
carried up in a Cloak, and laid upon the Bed in his Wardrobe.</p>

though surpriz'd to the degree may be imagin'd at so tragical an

when considering that the greatest testimony he could give of his
gratitude to his dead Prince, was to serve those he had left to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him, he began to pay the Queen those services, he had but a
few days before in the King's Closet engag'd himself to perform;
though the Orders he there receiv'd were not intended to have
been executed so soon, nor upon so fatal an occasion. The rumout
of the King's death had already spread it self, not only throughout
the <hi>Louvre,</hi> but also over all <hi>Paris;</hi> at which the Queen, being
beyond all imagination afflicted, and dissolving her self into tears,
without any other thought, than how to humour, and satisfie her
own grief; the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> came into her Chamber, and
after some expressions of sorrow, which as a true <hi>Frenchman,</hi> a
good Subject, and an oblig'd Servant he could not forbear for the
loss of so good a Master, he there told her: <q>That he did not
come to her Majesty in hope to stop the current of her tears,
the cause of her sorrow being too great to admit of any present
consolation; but that she would ever have leisure enough to
weep, when perhaps she might not always have opportunity to
provide for the Fortune of her Children, and the Safety of the
Kingdom, which in effect were one, and the same thing: That
her Majesty might better judge than any, what envy the King's
prosperity had drawn upon him, from all the neighbouring
Princes; and how much it was to be fear'd lest his own Servants,
no longer now restrain'd by the presence of this great Prince,
might in hope of novelty be debauch'd from their duty, if some
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63412:140"/>
good, and prudent order, for the settlement of Affairs, were
not suddenly taken: That to keep things in the quiet posture
they then were, her Majesty must speedily, and in the first place,
secure the Domestick Peace of the Kingdom, by continuing
<hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>is</hi> in the serenity, and calm of obedience, it then was: That
the single strength of the Kingdom, if united, and in good intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
within it self, was of it self sufficient to frustrate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of any that should attempt any thing against the Crown
of <hi>France:</hi> That for his own part, who had taken upon him
the boldness to give her Majesty this first advice, he there from
his heart made her an humble tender of his Life, his Fortune,
and his Friends to do her Service; that therefore she was only
to command, what she would please should be done, and that
he would perish, or cause her Royal will to be obey'd.</q> The
Queen awak'd by so prudent a Counsel, and fortified by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of so generous, and so considerable a Subject, told him:
<q>That she wholly reserr'd all things to his Vigilancy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
to be order'd, as he should in his wisdom think most fit;
wherein she recommended to his Fidelity, the care of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
much more than any concern of her own, and that she
should rest very well satisfied with whatever he should do,
knowing as she very well did, his prudence, and affection to be
equally so great, that nothing was to be added to them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke without losing more time, went immediately out
of the <hi>Louvre;</hi> where the first thing he did in order to the Queens
commands, was to bid the Officers of the Regiment of Guards,
to put their men suddenly into Arms. This great body consisting
of four thousand effective men, and those of the best, and the best
Disciplin'd in Europe, did not a little awe the <hi>Parisians,</hi> from
leaping over the bounds of their Duty: a strength that as it was
absolutely at the Duke's command, so did he upon this occasion
know so well, how to dispose it into the most convenient Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Town, that without all doubt, it was by vertue of those
Forces, he secur'd the peace of that Seditious City, and kept the
multitude from tumult and insurrection. <hi>Arquien,</hi> whom (as has
been said) the King had put into the <hi>Cittadel</hi> of <hi>Metz,</hi> in the year
1604. was Lieutenant Colonel to the Regiment of Guards, and
consequently in the absence of <hi>Crequy,</hi> who was Camp-Master
to the said Regiment (and who was already gone up to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
with the greatest part of the Nobility of the Court) was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Authority of the Duke to command it. Him therefore
the Duke speedily sent for to have given him orders, but he was
no where to be found; for from the instant that the King's death
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63412:141"/>
was certain, imagining the Duke would infalliby take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the time, and his own Authority, to remove him from
<hi>Metz,</hi> he had taken post to put himself into the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> hoping
there he should be able to maintain his ground: But the Duke
who in the care of publick affairs, did not altogether neglect his
own, which his Affection and Fidelity to the Crown, rendred
one, and the same with the other, judged by <hi>Arquiens</hi> absence
what his design might be, dispatch'd <hi>Mun de Sarlaboust</hi> Captain
to one of the Companies of the Guards, immediately after him,
if possible to prevent him, or at least to follow him so close, that
he might arrive at <hi>Metz</hi> before <hi>Arquien</hi> could have time to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
any thing to his disadvantage. The Duke had in <hi>Metz,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the ordinary Garrison of eight Companies (of which he had
compos'd a Regiment, call'd the Old Garrison) two Companies
of the Regiment of Guards commanded by <hi>Tilladet,</hi> and <hi>Fromi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gieres,</hi>
since Grand Prior of <hi>Tholouze;</hi> all which were so absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at his devotion, and their Captains so link'd to his Interests,
their Fortunes wholly depending upon his Favour, as they had
been rais'd by his bounty, that not a man of them but was ready
upon all occasions to be absolutely commanded by him. To this
he was confident of the Inhabitants good affection towards him,
who by the moderation of his Government, and by the protection
with which he had sheltred them from <hi>Sobole</hi>'s Insolence, were
wholly acquir'd unto him: which interests, joyn'd together, made
the Duke confident he should not want Forces sufficient to hinder
<hi>Arquien</hi> from being receiv'd into the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> if <hi>Mun</hi> could get
thither before him; or even there to force him, should he happen
to put himself into it, before his Orders could arrive. And indeed
all things succeeded to his desire, as shall in its due place be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd.

he sent five hundred of the Regiment of Guards, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

Duke at this time, or since, resolve almost upon any thing (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of general, or particular concern) without first communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the business to him, and consulting his Advice. There was
at this time none of the Princes of the Blood at Court, for the

<hi>Flanders,</hi> and was at this time at <hi>Milan;</hi> and the <hi>Count de Sois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
was at his house at <hi>Champigny;</hi> so that no body being at Court
considerable enough to make a party, the Duke at his going out
of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> found almost all the Lords, and Gentlemen, who
were then in <hi>Paris</hi> (and whom the suddenness and great concern
of that bloody Accident had assembled together) at the Gate ready
to attend him.</p>
                  <p>Being upon the way with this great Train, he had not gone
far before he met with the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> whom he found also
very well accompanied, though with a Train far inferiour to his
own. These two Dukes, nor their Families, were not as yet so
well united (the paternal hatred having been rather fomented by
the quarrels the Duke had lately had with both the Sons, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his Majesties endeavour to reconcile them) but that
there was greater expectation this meeting should beget some new
disorder, than that men so disunited betwixt themselves should
concur so suddenly, and happily in the publick Service; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that their followers on both sides seem'd only to expect a
signal from their Leaders to fall to blows: when the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> having with great civility saluted the Duke, ask'd him how
that sad misfortune had hapned? to whom the Duke in short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the manner of the King's death, with what had after pass'd
betwixt the Queen and him, and the Order he was by her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Command going to take to prevent any tumult in the City:
Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> asking him, if there were not
something for him to do in the Queens Service also? the Duke
reply'd, <q>That since he ask'd his advice, he conceiv'd he might
do both the Queen and the Kingdom a signal Service, by only
shewing himself in the streets of <hi>Paris:</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63412:142"/>
within their duty, by the presence of a man of his condition,
would be less apt to be seduc'd into commotion; and that by
the calm which would by that means be preserv'd in the City,
they might doubtless more effectually proceed to the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such good orders, as would for the future secure the
peace of the whole Kingdom.</q> A counsel the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> as
readily follow'd, and the good Fortune of <hi>France,</hi> having upon
the instant extiguish'd all particular Animosities, betwixt these
two great Persons, so as to make them, beyond all expectation,
joyn in the common Service of the State. This happy union,
and concurrence was of no little importance to the conservation
of the Peace in that mutinous City. The Duke after continued
his way to the President's House, to whom having communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his designs, he found them to be generally approv'd by him;
insomuch that before they parted it was concluded betwixt them,
that that very day, and as soon as it was possible, the Parliament
should be intreated to Assemble: the management of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
undertaken by the President, the Duke went in the mean time

                  <p>He began with the <hi>Hostel de Ville,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke goes to the <hi>Hostel de Ville:</hi>
                     </note> where having found the
<hi>Prevost des Marchands,</hi> the <hi>Eschevins,</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> met together,
after he had first given them an accompt in brief of the sad Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
had hapned, he proceeded to exhort them, <q>To confirm to
his Majesties Successors the Love and Obedience they had paid
to him during his happy Reign. He told them that by perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in their Duty, they might secure their own Lives, and
Estates, which would otherwise be certainly expos'd to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and licence of Seditious men: That the least disorder of
this nature, that should happen in the City, would put the whole
Kingdom into Confusion: That he therefore intreated them to
cause all their Gates to be shut, to the end that no one might be
permitted, either to go out, or to come in, who were either
thought able, or likely, to breed any disturbance in the publick
peace, to give order to the Capains of the Train'd-Bands to
have their Companies in readiness upon any occasion might
happen, and to walk themselves the round of the City, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by their Presence and Authority to keep every one in his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
He further gave them notice, that he had already caus'd the
Regiment of Guards both <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Swisse,</hi> to stand to their
Arms, on purpose to suppress those who should first make
the least shew of Insurrection; but that he hop'd their wisdoms
would prevent a confusion, which would not so easily be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
if once grown to a head, as it might be suppress'd in the

beginning.</q> A Remonstrance, that, being deliver'd with great
plainness, and vigour, wrought so good an effect, that all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
unanimously engag'd to do their utmost endeavours for
the conservation of the publick Peace; as they accordingly did:
which was none of the weakest links that curb'd the head-strong

meerly intended for the Parliaments security, was nevertheless
misinterpreted by some to be rather design'd to compel them to

would be oblig'd to concur with them, and disappointed, either
from opposing, or deferring to declare the Queen Mother Regent

debated.</p>
                  <p>The Duke being come into the Hall where the Parliament
was set with his Sword in his hand, though not drawn, and in
some disorder both in his Cloaths, and Countenance, began his
Speech with some excuses; <q>For appearing in that honourable
Assembly in so undecent a posture; after which he told them
that his Sword was yet in the Scabbard (his own words) but
that if before he went thence there was not order taken, for the
security of the City, and Kingdom, by declaring the Queen
Regent, he foresaw (to his great grief) he must be compell'd
to draw it against the Enemies of the Crown, and to fill the

some amongst them who would ask respite to deliberate upon
the things propos'd; but that he must tell them beforehand, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was so dangerous as delay: That in many great occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it was wisdom, not to be too precipitous, and to proceed
slowly, and by degrees to a final determination; but that here
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:63412:143"/>
it was quite otherwise, it being necessary in this Crisis of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
to cut off all difficulties, and immediately to resolve upon
the thing propounded: That what might to day be concluded
without danger, could not be done to morrow without Blood
and Slaughter; and indeed what pretense could any man have
to ask respi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the rule of Equity, and nature? To whom was the King's
Fortune more properly to be intrusted, than to her who brought
him into the world, or to whose care the safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
than to her, who for the space of ten years, had with the
late King been a Coadjutrix in raising it to that degree of height,
and reputation, wherein it now stood. He told them that the
Queen was a Princess for whom his Majesty from the hour of
his Marriage had never had any reservation in his most weighty
and most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ecret Affairs: That he had made her his Companion
in all his Expeditions: That he had already deputed the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Kingdom during his absence into her hands; a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
after which he could not believe any one would dare
to contradict the Judgment of a Prince so great in himself, and
so solicitous of the good and welfare of his Kingdom: That
therefore the most effectual means to preserve the Peace and
Tranquillity wherein <hi>France</hi> had been happy many years, was
to concur in the King's Judgment, and to justifie his Election:
That the discontents, which govern'd in the minds of many
men of very eminent condition, were very well known to all:
That those persons (it might easily be believ'd) wanted no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents:
That the impatient humour of the <hi>French,</hi> in hopes
to make their advantage of any disorder in the State, would be
apt to create more Mutineers, if things were not settled in due
season: That there was no time so fruitful in Sedition, nor so
proper for mischief, as when mutinous spirits were in suspense
whom to obey: That if ever this evil disposition was to be
fear'd it was chiefly now, when all the Forces of the Kingdom
were on foot: That they would doubtless soon be practis'd on all
hands; so that if by the prudence of that Assembly such tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
were not prevented, those noble Troops design'd for
the enlargement of the Borders of <hi>France,</hi> and for the glory of
the <hi>French</hi> name, would by an unhappy, and a sad revolution
be seen to employ their Arms to the ruine of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
That they were therefore to take time whilst things remain'd
yet inviolate, and capable of the best impressions, to mould them
into the best form, which depended upon their immediate Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
That he had put the Regiment of Guards, all the King's
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:63412:143"/>
Servants, and his own particular Friends into Arms, that they
might at convenient liberty, and security deliberate of what he
then propos'd that he knew very well what he now advis'd them
to, was without President; but that he hop'd an Act of so great
utility and importance to the publick good, would one day ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Authority of Example, and add to the Dignity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of that Honourable Body; a priviledge, by so much the
more their due, by how much they had never till then possess'd
it: That they did not need to apprehend herein their Authority
should be prostituted to Arbitration, or be disputed by any; but
that, how high and generous soever their results might be, they
should infallibly be executed, and that he, and all his Friends
were ready to lose their lives, or to cause them to be inviolably
obey'd.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke's Oration being ended, the whole Assembly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in a profound silence, and being equally astonish'd at the
Accident had hapned, and surpriz'd at the Proposition was
made, not a man on the sudden, durst either by word, or action
express his thoughts: only President <hi>Harlay</hi> in few words <q>Gave
the Duke thanks for the affection he had manifested to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Kingdom, and to the Honour of that Assembly;
exhorting him to persevere in a passion so worthy of his Vertue,
and so becoming the place and honour he possess'd amongst
them.</q> Whereupon the Duke perceiving their silence still to
continue, and unwilling to give them occasion to complain that
by his presence he had extorted from them a resolution contrary
to their sense and opinion, he retir'd himself: But at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that they might understand there was something of necessity
in the case, he told them aloud, <q>That what he had propounded
was the best course they could take, and that they were therefore
absolutely, and suddenly to resolve upon it.</q> Upon which last
words the <hi>Sieur de la Guesle</hi> the Attorny General taking hold, began
in a short Speech to break the Ice, by representing to the Assembly,
<q>That though what had been propounded by the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
seem'd by the respect wherewith it had been deliver'd to be
a thing wherein they were free to determine; yet that what he
had last said imply'd a kind of necessity: but a necessity by so
much the more, just, and honourable, by how much the Peace
of the Kingdom would not only be secur'd thereby; but also a
great advantage to their Body would certainly accrue: That it
was therefore in his opinion better immediately, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to declare the Regency to be in the Queen, than to stay till
their consent should be wrested from them upon compulsion,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:63412:144"/>
and perhaps in a season, when they should have no thanks for
their labour.</q> Which being said, the whole Assembly forthwith
concluded upon the business, by that Act not only securing the
Peace of the Kingdom, but also introducing a great example to
pitch upon the same, and an equally salutiferous resolution in our
days, when out great Queen <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> was settled in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
by virtue of the same Election.</p>
                  <p>I have often heard the Duke discourse of this Transaction,<note place="margin">The reasons that mov'd the Duke to press the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should be declared Regent.</note>
wherein though he acknowledg'd his proceeding to be by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual,
and something an irregular way; <q>Yet that the Queens
Regency being as yet not authorized by the Suffrages of any of
the Princes of the Blood (whose arrival also should it have been
expected, would probably have put all things into Confusion)
he thought it necessary to have it ratified by the consent of the
people: That to procure their consents, there was no way so
plausible and consonant to Law, as therein to interest all the
Parliaments of <hi>France,</hi> by prevailing with that of <hi>Paris,</hi> whose
whose Act would be a kind of Warranty to the rest: That
should they have staid the coming of the <hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> he
would by his presence infallibly have sway'd all things, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his inclination: That the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> coming after
would have been impatient at his younger Brother's getting
the start of him in an Affair where the priority of Vote in the
Election was in him: by which means the variety of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
not permitting them to concur in an Act, wherein each
of them would be ambitious to precede, a fraction betwixt them
must of necessity ensue: That for that reason he had us'd all
diligence in pressing the Parliament to a speedy resolution in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Queen.</q> In the carrying on of which Affair, it is in
my opinion something hard to determine, whether the Stars of
<hi>France,</hi> or the Duke's Prudence did most prevail: It is not to be
denied but that both the one and the other contributed very much
to the happy performance of this great work: But it is likewise
most certain that the business had never been so fortunately effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
if the Duke had less prudently foreseen what was likely to
ensue, or had proceeded with less diligence and vigour to the
establishment of this Election, to the general benefit of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
wherein if he perform'd a signal Service to the State, he
did no less for the Prince, who would have met with no little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
to his rising greatness, had he at his return, found the
<hi>Count de Soissons</hi> settled, as it were a Co-partner in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by being possess'd of some of the most important Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:63412:144"/>Thus was this business carried on, <hi>France</hi> being, from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
step of her Glory, precipitated into the greatest extream of
her Misfortune; and the King's Triumphs being in a moment
overcast with the Funeral Black of his Obsequies: but the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of the State, overthrown by so great, and so tragick a
Revolution, and the publick happiness in an instant secur'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one drop of Blood; was it not an afternoons work of the
Duke of <hi>Espernon?</hi> and can so great a success without injustice,
be attributed to any thing but to his prudent Conduct? In the
Narrative whereof I have not added one syllable more than the
truth: and doubtless there are many yet alive that can justifie all
I have said. I know very well that the Historians of that time
have not mention'd all the particularities I have, as material to my
purpose, insisted upon, and that those who have been most exact
have recorded but very few in their Relations; which is in part
the reason why I have more willingly enlarg'd my self in this
discourse, that I might impartially render, what is so justly due
to Truth, and Virtue.</p>
                  <p>The sad accident of the King's Death was so suddenly spread
all over <hi>Europe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The return of the <hi>Count de Soissons</hi> to Court.</note> that it seem'd, as if his person, rais'd to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pitch of Honour to which man can arrive, had fall'n in the
sight of all the world. The Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who (as has been
said) resided then at <hi>Milan,</hi> receiv'd the first news of it from the
<hi>Condé de Fuentes,</hi> which was immediately after confirm'd by a
Courrier dispatch'd purposely to him from the Queen Regent, to
invite him back into <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> who was but
two little days journey from <hi>Paris,</hi> was much sooner inform'd,
and at the same instant in all diligence repair'd thither, to see what
this accident might produce; where he arriv'd the sixteenth of
<hi>May,</hi> two days only after the King's Death; but late enough
notwithstanding to find all things dispatch'd to his hand. So that
matters being already concluded, the Queens Authority esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd,
the Parliament, People, Souldiery, and whole City settled
in their Duty, and nothing lest for him to do, but to approve
what was already done (and which he could no ways hope to
overthrow, had he dislik'd it) he was fain whether sincerely, or
otherwise to concur in the Election, and thereupon went to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
himself to the Queen, where he assur'd her Majesty of his
Faith and absolute Obedience.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Count</hi> at his arrival at Court, observing the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>
to be seated in that degree of Favour and Reputation, to
which by his signal, and recent Services to the Queen, he might
justly pretend, he forthwith resolv'd to contract a strict connexion
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:63412:145"/>
with him, as accordingly by making him a tender of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and assistance against all whomsoever, he endeavour'd to
do: neither did he do it but upon very good consideration; for
foreseeing that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> returning to Court (as he soon
after did) would infallibly take upon him the preeminence,
and degree due to his Quality, and Birth, he would by that means
labour so to establish himself before his arrival, that it should not
be in the Princes Power to shake him. To which end he could
pitch upon none so proper to support his Interest, as the Duke of
<hi>Espernon,</hi> who was, at that time, the most considerable person in
the Kingdom. The Queen had appointed him Lodgings in the
<hi>Louvre,</hi> not conceiving her self secure (as she was pleas'd to say)
but under his Vigilancy and Valour; all dispatches were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to him; his Orders and Advice were in all things follow'd
and observ'd, so that would he have stretch'd his Authority to
the utmost, or had he been ambitious of favour, he might doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
with great facility have made himself sole Master of Affairs:
but so far was he from desiring to appear necessary (though effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
so) to the excluding those who had right to the Council,
that on the contrary he entreated the Queen to call, and admit into
it, all such as either by the priviledge of their Birth, or by the repute
of their capacities, might reasonably pretend to that Honour;
coveting no greater advantage, than to have a concurrence with
worthy men for the publick Safety; and seeing he could not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
drawing great envy upon himself, possess alone that preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
in the Administration, to which the King had design'd him,
he was content with the rest to share that part, which could not
equitably be denied to his approv'd Fidelity and Wisdom.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>Count de Soissons</hi> had the foremention'd reasons to
seek the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s friendship, he had yet therein a further
and a more important design, and that was by the Duke's assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to procure a Match betwixt <hi>Madamoiselle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Duke's Niece, and his own Son <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> since <hi>Count de
Soissons:</hi> neither was the Duke so ill read in this Princes intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he did not very well perceive at what part he took his
aim, which made him, though he receiv'd the offer of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with the respect due to a Prince of the Blood, nevertheless ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it with such a gravity, and reservation as should no ways en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him to any partiality in his favour, nor in the least restrain the
liberty of his proceeding in that concern. A coldness that so much
disgusted the <hi>Count de Soissens,</hi> who expected a greater complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and freedom from him, that his affection so violently begun,
was not likely long to last. The first opposition he met with in the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63412:145"/>
Duke to his desires, was in the proposal he made him to give
way that he might cause the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> to be stab'd in the
<hi>Louvre.</hi> He was their common Enemy, and the sole cause of all
the trouble had befall'n this Prince, and of his retirement from
Court, wherein the inury he had receiv'd was such, that although
the King had laid upon him his positive command to be reconcil'd,
he had notwithstanding rather chosen to abandon the Court, than
to do it. The Duke had also receiv'd from the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> (a
great Creature of the late King's) all the ill Offices could possibly
have been done by the most implacable Enemy; which being not
unknown to the <hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> he doubted not to have met an
Animosity in the Duke against him as great as his own, and to
have found him as prompt to his revenge: but he was deceiv'd,
the Duke excusing himself by telling the <hi>Count</hi> he could by no
means permit so great a violence to be offer'd in the King's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace;
beseeching him to consider, that the Guards which he had
the honour to command, being principally design'd to preserve
the respect due to his Majesties Person, and Presence inviolate; and
such as it ought to be, he should commit an irreparable offense to
his Duty, should he consent to favour an act of so dangerous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
An answer at which the <hi>Count,</hi> a man of a furious, and
cholerick temper, was infinitely mov'd; yet his interest not
permitting him to break with the Duke, he for that time with an
extraordinary patience made the best shift he could to dissemble
his discontent.</p>
                  <p>During these transactions at Court, there was something pass'd
also at <hi>Metz,</hi> wherein the Duke was no little concern'd:
you have already heard how <hi>Arquien,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel to the
Regiment of Guards, had immediately upon the King's Death
taken post to retire himself into the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> of which he was
Governour, af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> whom the Duke had sent <hi>Mun,</hi> to spoil his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
so that <hi>Mun,</hi> who was much the younger man, having po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in great diligence, overtook him some six Stages short of
<hi>Metz;</hi> where he found him so bruis'd with riding, that he was
scarce in a condition to perform the rest of his Journey: When
<hi>Arquien</hi> who saw himself likely to be prevented, and in danger to
be deny'd admittance into <hi>Metz,</hi> by the Duke's Servants, plainly
told <hi>Mun,</hi> 
                     <q>That he made no doubt, but that his Journey was
occasion'd by a just suspicion the Duke had conceiv'd of his sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
departure without his Order, and Command; that therein
he must needs confess he had been to blame; but that he had
been prompted to that diligence by a jealousie the Duke might
perhaps have detain'd him by force in <hi>Paris,</hi> with an intent to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63412:146"/>
deprive him of his command in the <hi>Cittadel:</hi> That he therefore
had undertaken that journey simply, and for no other end, than
to keep his possession of that place, which was the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
member of his Fortune, and the only reward of his
Service, but with no design to disserve the Duke: That he was
his Servant; neither did he desire to govern so much as in the
<hi>Cittadel,</hi> but under his Authority, and Command: That for a
testimony of his Candour, and good intention herein, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
<hi>Mun,</hi> if he would slack his diligence, and let them go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
not to enter the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> till first he should by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Duke's own Creatures be permitted so to do, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
moreover, till it should be by them determin'd, that the
Garrison there should be divided betwixt them.</q> A proposition
that <hi>Mun</hi> conceiving to be as fair as the Duke could himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
he condescended to the condition, and accordingly in his
company perform'd the rest of the Journey, arriving both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the City. Where being come, they immediately assembled
the Duke's Friends and Servants, which were <hi>Tilladet,</hi> and <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migieres</hi>
Captains of the two Companies of the Guards, who were
in Garrison at <hi>Metz,</hi> and <hi>Momas</hi> Camp-Master to the old Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison;
amongst whom it was concluded, that <hi>Tilladet</hi> the elder
Captain should with an hundred men only of his Company en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> till the Duke's further pleasure could be known:
a number that to the Duke's Friends seem'd sufficient to make
good their Quarter, should <hi>Arquien</hi> intend any thing but fair; as
<hi>Arquien</hi> thought his would be able to maintain his Authority, and
to over-power the other, should the Duke be obstinately bent to
exclude him absolutely from his Command.</p>
                  <p>Things then being thus concluded, <hi>Arquien,</hi> whilst yet in the

naming any number, as not suspecting any foul play; a negligence
which the Duke's Servants making use of to his advantage, they
caus'd above fifty more, and those the best men they could chuse out
of all the Companies, to be added to the hundred, that by Article
were to be admitted; who being all without any difficulty receiv'd
into the <hi>Cittadel</hi> it soon appear'd <hi>Arquien</hi>'s was not the strongest
Party, and that the advantage he had in number (his Garrison
consisting of two hundred men) being balanc'd by the quality
of the Souldiers, <hi>Tilladet</hi> was rather in a condition to give, than
to receive the Law from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arquien</hi> having thus, by an excess of faithful dealing, perform'd
his promise, went himself last of all into the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> where he
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:63412:146"/>
was no sooner come, but that his Lieutenant at the first word
told him he was no longer Master of the place; to whom <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quien</hi>
having reply'd, that an hundred men could not dispute his
Authority there, the Lieutenant gave him to understand, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
twice so many were already got in, which he had not dar'd
but to receive, not knowing the precise number of those he was
to admit; at which <hi>Arquien,</hi> now sensible of the oversight he had
committed, was so enrag'd that he would presently revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon <hi>Tilladet,</hi> and was ready to fall on, <hi>Tilladet</hi> also on his
part preparing for the Encounter; when the Friends of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
who were in the City, came in at the first noise of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.
At their first coming they found the Gates of the <hi>Cittadel</hi>
shut; but being opened in the end to such as pretended to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
an Accommodation, it was with much ado concluded, that
for <hi>Arquiens</hi> satisfaction, <hi>Tilladet,</hi> to whom he chiefly laid the
blame, as contriver of the Treachery, and Surprize, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the place; but that those Souldiers, already enter'd, should
continue there,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Authority re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd in <hi>Metz.</hi>
                     </note> and that <hi>Fromigieres</hi> should come in to command
them. Thus ended this dispute, and thus was the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s
absolute Authority, though with some trouble, re-establish'd
in <hi>Metz,</hi> which from the time of <hi>Sobole</hi>'s dereliction, until now,
he had altogether lost.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fromigieres</hi> being receiv'd into the <hi>Cittadel</hi> was still more and
more fortified by new Souldiers, which the Duke's friends conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
slipt in from the City; so that <hi>Arquien</hi> seeing himself in a lost
condition, and also stung with the conscience of his own fault, he
return'd in all haste back to <hi>Paris,</hi> at once to beg the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>'s
pardon, and to implore the Queen Regents Justice. Where
being come, and finding the Duke inflexible to his submissions,
and positively resolute to hold what he had, seeing he was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no good accompt from him, he thought fit, as his last refuge
to appeal to the Queen. Neither did he want interest at Court to
support, and countenance his cause, where besides <hi>de Montigny</hi>
his Brother (a man of great merit and esteem, and afterwards
<hi>Mareschal</hi> of <hi>France</hi>) he had many Relations, and Friends, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Duke's Enemies, who could not, without great
heart-burning, see him re-settled in so considerable a command.
Of this number were the Lords of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> and their
Family, who made up a great part of the Court, and who being
all averse to the Duke's greatness, endeavour'd by possessing the
Queen, that the action of <hi>Metz</hi> was an intolerable affront to
her Authority, to make her restore <hi>Arquien</hi> to his Command.
<q>They represented to her that this was an Affair by the late King
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:63412:147"/>
conceiv'd to be of such importance to the State, that his Majesty
had made no difficulty to make a Journey thither in person,
and on purpose to retrive this place out of the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s
hands: That his Fidelity ought at this time to be much
the rather suspected, by how much his Ambition was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,
and less easie to be cur'd: That having, under pretense
of some trivial Services to her Majesty in the beginning of her
Administration, committed a violence of this high nature, he
made it plain that his sole aim was in this new face of Affairs to
establish his own particular greatness: and that, instead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to continue Subjects in their Duty, by the example
of a Subjects Obedience, he had himself committed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
insolence imaginable against the Sovereign Power, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessing
one of the most ancient and faithful Servants of the
Crown, from a place wherein he had serv'd, without the least
blemish, or reproach.</q> It is certain that the Queen, how well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
soever with the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> was notwithstanding
something stagger'd in her resolution at this Remonstrance: but
the Duke having also given his reasons, and represented to her of
what importance it was to have his Majesties Authority in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and <hi>Cittadel</hi> of <hi>Metz,</hi> conjoyn'd in one man, that the emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of two Governours might not produce mutiny, such as would
endanger the introducing of Forein Power into the place; with
how long, and with what Fidelity he had serv'd his Kings in that
Government, the Authority being united in his Person; he found
the Queen so well dispos'd to accept of his justification, that she
was absolutely satisfied: so that from that time forward, nothing
was more thought of in that business, save only how to content
<hi>Arquien,</hi> in finding out for him some other command, that might
hold proportion with that Employment.</p>
                  <p>In the transaction of this Affair, Fortune, as upon other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
would needs interest her self to appear in the Duke's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
<hi>De Vic</hi> Governour of <hi>Calice</hi> was one of the principal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators
in this difference, who on the one side making profession
of great respect to the Duke's Service, and on the other of a strict
friendship with <hi>Arquien,</hi> labour'd with extraordinary passion, and
diligence to satisfie both parties in their pretense, and had brought
matters to so good an issue, that nothing remain'd to their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
satisfaction, save only to find out a Government for <hi>Arquien,</hi>
equal to that whereof he was now divested: but there was none
at this time vacant of equal value, which was the only knot in
the Affair. At last this poor Gentleman prov'd both the Mediator,
and the price of their Accommodation, who had acted so vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:63412:147"/>
in the Treaty, that, with posting to and again in the most
violent heats of Summer, he was surpriz'd with a Pleurisie;
whereof in six days he dy'd. With his Government <hi>Arquien</hi> was
recompens'd, who after that quit claim to the <hi>Cittadel</hi> of <hi>Metz,</hi>
leaving the Duke absolute Master of it, as before; a possession he
afterwards kept, till that a few years before his death he demised
it in favour of Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son.</p>
                  <p>Amidst these many important Affairs, the Duke was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful
of his particular Duties; whereof one, and to which he
conceiv'd himself most particularly oblig'd, was to manifest his
gratitude to <hi>Henry</hi> the III. his Master, and Benefactor. He had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
after his death attended his Body to <hi>Compiegne,</hi> where the
misfortunes of War, and the confusion of Affairs, not permitting
at that time a performance of his Funeral Rites; and the Queen
now resolving to begin the Regency with those of the late King,
he humbly begg'd of her to give him leave to make use of that
opportunity for the interment of <hi>Henry</hi> the III. wherein her
Majesty, doing an Act worthy her Piety, would add little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the expense she was already resolv'd to make. The Queen
readily consented to his request; so that the Duke, accompanied with
a great number of Lords and Gentlemen, went to fetch the Body
from <hi>Compiegne,</hi> from whence he convey'd it to St. <hi>Denis,</hi> where
it was deposited in the ancient Sepulchre of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi>
Neither was this the sole testimony the Duke gave of his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to his old Master, the Records of his Bounty and Favour
being so impress'd in his memory, that they perish'd not, but in
his Grave, where all things are buried in Oblivion. A little before
his death, causing a Marble Pillar, one of the most celebrated
pieces of Architecture of these late times, to be carried, and set up
in the Church of St. <hi>Clou;</hi> wherein he was so curious, as to make
it be wrought in his own House, and almost in his own sight;
his design being to found a Revenue of a thousand Livers yearly
for the Service of the Chappel where it was erected; which was
also adorn'd with Pictures, and pav'd with Marble at his own
charge: but some difficulties arising about the settlement of that
Foundation, which could not be clear'd before his death, the
thing (to his great grief) remain'd imperfect.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremony of these Obsequies,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to Court, where he appears dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd at the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> perform'd in the end of
<hi>Iune,</hi> was immediately follow'd by the return of the Prince of
<hi>Condé</hi> to Court, where he arriv'd in <hi>Iuly,</hi> and where all the men
of condition contended who should give him the greatest testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of joy for his return. Amongst whom, although the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was none of the latest, yet was he not the best
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:63412:148"/>
receiv'd. The Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> who had great need of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Protection, had prevented others in the possession of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and conceiving he should make himself more acceptable
by rendring the affection of other Grandees suspected to him; he
had (amongst others) pointed out the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> for one
of those of whom he had most reason to complain. An ill Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
that having at first preferr'd in general terms, he afterwards
pursu'd by particular circumstance, telling the Prince that the
Duke had doubled the Guards of the <hi>Louvre</hi> at his arrival, and
put all the King's Family into Arms, as they had been to defend
it against a common Enemy. Which impression the Prince was
more apt to receive, by how much he believ'd, that the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already in a great degree of Favour with the Queen, and very
intimate with the <hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> must needs be jealous of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
which he could not consider, but as a great power directly
opposite to all his concerns; which made him at the first inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
receive him, not only with apparent coldness, but also, not
able to dissemble his dissatisfaction, reproach him for having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to possess the Queen with some suspicions to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.
The Duke, surpriz'd at so unexpected an entertainment
and so groundless a reproach (he having alter'd nothing in the
usual Guards that had been kept in the <hi>Louvre</hi> since the King's
Death) and nettled with the sense of so injurious an Office, gave
aloud the <hi>Lye</hi> to all those who had branded him with so false a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.
Yet would not this publick and generous profession of the
truth so satisfie and appease the Prince, that there was not still some
remains of discontent in his mind against the Duke. He did not
think him so affectionate to him, as to the <hi>Count de Soissons;</hi> and
seeing him advanc'd to that height of Reputation with the Queen,
could not expect he should be favourable to him, in the design he
had to assume that place in Court, and to share that Authority in
the management of Affairs, which were due to his Birth and
Greatness. So that here the Court was divided, the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dé</hi>
having his Faction, and the <hi>Count of Soissons</hi> his, amongst
whom the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was the chief, and most considerable
member.</p>
                  <p>Yet did not this diversity of Interests produce any sudden ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,<note place="margin">The state of Affairs at Court, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Queens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</note>
the Princes paying a due respect to the Queen, and being
by her admitted into the debate of Affairs, though the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
were carried on by other hands. The Cabinet Council
at this time consisted of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> the Chancellour
<hi>de Sillery,</hi> President <hi>Ianin,</hi> and <hi>Mounsieur de Villeroy;</hi> wherein the
Duke's Vote had the greatest sway, and his Opinions did usually
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:63412:148"/>
prevail; by whom it being conceiv'd necessary for the honour of
the Nation, and the memory of the late King to pursue the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> which had been the pretense of his Majesties
Arms, he propounded, and got it to be concluded that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
de la Chasire,</hi> with an Army of 10000 Foot, and 1200.
Horse, should be sent to assist the interested Princes in the restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Place. The issue of which expedition was as succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as could be wish'd; the places possess'd by the Arch-Duke
<hi>Leopold</hi> were restor'd into the hands of the Marquis of <hi>Brande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Newbourg;</hi> so that Affairs on that side re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in as good a forwardness as could be desir'd to be shortly
compos'd (as they were) to the satisfaction of the <hi>German</hi>
Princes.</p>
                  <p>As in the occasion we spoke of last things were carried on for
the honour, so was it no less necessary for the safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to give some satisfaction, and assurance to those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Religion in the beginning of this new Reign; it being
very much to be fear'd this Faction (which at this time was very
powerful) pretending a violation of the Edicts formerly publish'd
in their toleration, might run into insurrection, to the ruine of
the publick peace. Wherein the Duke was of opinion to prevent
either the real jealousie, or else the evil intentions of those who
were likely to breed any Commotion, by Declarations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the ancient Edicts granted in their favour. It is very true, that
he had no kindness for their Religion; but he thought it never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
unfit to violate the publick Faith, where what he did then
for reason of State, he has ever since observ'd in his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
administration; so that though an enemy to new opinions,
he was notwithstanding ever very solicitous to maintain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of them within his Governments in peace, and safety;
and it has been observ'd, that although at <hi>Metz</hi> the best Families
of the City were of that perswasion, that they abounded in <hi>Xain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue,</hi>
and <hi>Angoumois,</hi> and that <hi>Guienne</hi> was not free, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be perceiv'd, that he made any distinction betwixt them and
other the Kings Subjects, except where he found them refractory
and disobedient to his Commands.</p>
                  <p>These precautions, so seasonably apply'd in this turn of State,
secur'd the Peace of the Kingdom both within, and without to so
fortunate a degree, that a more happy Government could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
have been wish'd. Which certainly if we consider the great
number of discontents within, before the King's death, the
distastes many persons of great Quality had taken, who breath'd
nothing but revenge, with the Ambition that reigns in all Courts
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63412:149"/>
able to overthrow the surest foundations, is infinitely to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at. To which may be added the envy of neighbouring
Princes, who could not without anxiety, and apprehension suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the height of prosperity to which <hi>France</hi> was already advanc'd;
together with the Artifices of such as usually in the troubles of a
State seek to repair the ruines of their own desperate Fortunes: all
which evil dispositions could not, according to humane imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have found a more favourable juncture, than during a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
to have produc'd their fatal effects; and yet never was
<hi>France</hi> at greater peace within it self, nor more respected of her
Neighbours, than in all the whole time of the Queens admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
Wherein though I dare not, I confess, attribute the
whole reputation of the good Government to the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>
alone (who having call'd the most prudent and experienc'd
Ministers of the latter Reign into his Councils, they ought also to
share in the praise) yet can I not in equity deny him the first place
of Honour, he having (without dispute, the greatest Authority,
and consequently having ever carried the greatest sway in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
of the most important Affairs.</p>
                  <p>This Power and Reputation being the ordinary objects of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
even amongst men of equal condition,<note place="margin">Anno 1611.</note> it is no wonder if the
Princes of the Blood were jealous of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s
greatness;<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Princes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.</note> who (as they said) unknown to them dispos'd the
greatest Affairs of the Kingdom, wherein they particulary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
that he had perswaded the Queen to resolve upon a
match, betwixt the King and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> a thing
which in his Minority was not to be done without the consent of
the Princes of the Blood, by reason of the interest which, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of their proximity, they had in his Majesties Person. But the
Duke was so well read in their Priviledges, that it is not to be
suppos'd he could commit so great an error; and he had divers
times propos'd this Marriage to them, for the most honourable,
and most advantageous match could be found out for the King in
all Europe: although the Princes who began to suffer themselves
to be led away by the perswasions of those who could no longer
contain themselves within those bounds, which the virtue of
Peace prescrib'd to their Ambition, had ever oppos'd that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and would never consent unto it. The Duke nevertheless,
as if he had foreseen the happiness would accrue to the State by
this Alliance, ceas'd not continually to fortifie the Queen Mother
in the resolution she had taken to pursue that Treaty, and to bring
it to a conclusion; which, because it was carried on without their
consents, they pretended it to be without their knowledge: and
this was all the ground of their complaint.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:63412:149"/>In this point the <hi>Count de Soissons</hi> concurr'd with the Prince of
<hi>Condé;</hi> he was already broken off with the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anno 1612.</note> and
that to such a degree, that he appear'd now more implacable in his
hatred, than he had before seem'd violent in his love. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said, that amongst the reasons which induc'd him to seek
the Duke's friendship, the chiefest was the Marriage of <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle
de Montpensier</hi> with the Prince his Son: A Princess,
who had been so far honour'd by the late King, that he had cast
his eye upon her for a Match betwixt her, and the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi>
his second Son, and had spoke to the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>
to that purpose; so that it cannot appear strange in him, if after
being prepossess'd with the hope of so glorious a fortune for his
Niece, and so great an honour to his whole Family he could not
easily condescend to the <hi>Count</hi>'s motion, wherein nevertheless he
excus'd himself with all imaginable Civility and Respect: But
this Prince, of a hot and violent nature, taking for injury the
least contradiction to his will, was so highly transported with
fury at this refusal, that there was no extreme to which he would
not hurry his revenge, publickly threatning to assault the Duke
in the Streets, in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> nay in his own House. Thus do we
see the Duke at once oppress'd with the open hatred of two of
the Princes of the Blood; upon which occasion, although he
very well understood the deference due to their persons, and upon
that accompt declar'd he would ever give them way, and retire
before them; yet did he not conceive it convenient to have the
same respect, and consideration for such as under their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and protection should make any attempts upon him. And
it was in this occurrence, that the Reputation and interest he had
at Court did most evidently appear; so many persons, who by
his bounty he had oblig'd (principally in the dispensation of those
offices depended upon his own of <hi>Colonel</hi>) so many others who
expected their advancement from him, so many Lords of great
Quality, who either by Relation or Friendship were united to
him; and so many others out of the sole regard of his Virtue
flocking about his Person, that he has often been seen in the
streets of <hi>Paris</hi> with seven or eight hundred Gentlemen waiting
upon him: And I have heard many of very good quality, who
in those times declar'd themselves his Friends and Servants, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that when he has gone on foot to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> as he would
sometimes purposely do, his attendance, marching in order, have
taken up all the space betwixt the <hi>Hostel d' Espernon,</hi> and the Court,
which is at least 2000 paces; insomuch that the Van of his Train
has reach'd the Barriers of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> before almost the Rear was
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:63412:150"/>
out of his own Gates. Which (how strange soever it may appear)
is nothing more than truth; as an infinite number of persons
yet living can witness. Neither was the Queen (who had great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the preservation of a man had merited so highly from
her) sorry to see him in so good a posture, conceiving it of no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
moment to her service, to have a person at Court able to make
a Power, that might otherwise have been turn'd against her, and
her Authority: and indeed it was upon him she principally rely'd,
as the chief of all her Servants, and the most considerable person
of her Party.</p>
                  <p>The Queen made this most manifestly appear in a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

true story. The <hi>Baron de la Chastagneraye</hi> after the Service he had
so fortunately done the Queen in recovering her out of the River
<hi>Seine,</hi> at the passage of the Port <hi>de Neully</hi> (relations of which
you will find at large in many of our <hi>French</hi> Histories) had been
gratified for that action with the command of Captain of her
Majesties Guard, and was moreover very graciously receiv'd by
the Queen; advantages that creating him much envy, either her
Majesties Favour, or his own Spirit, or both, engag'd him in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Disputes with several persons of the most eminent condition
at Court; amongst which he had principally one with <hi>Mounsieur
le Grand Escuyer,</hi> since Duke <hi>de Bellegarde;</hi> wherein his passion
one day transporting him so far, as to speak unhandsomly of him
in the Queens presence, and before the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> who was
his Cousin German, the Duke conceiv'd himself oblig'd to say
something in the behalf of so near a Relation, and thereupon
gave <hi>la Chastagneraye</hi> some smart reply, which he, unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
as briskly return'd upon the Duke himself; who with-held
by the reverence of the place, said to him only this, <q>That her
Majesties presence which had encourag'd him to that offensive
language, ty'd his hands, and oblig'd him from taking any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notice of it;</q> resolving within himself to let the Quarrel
alone at that time, and to call him to an accompt at fitter leisure:
but the Queen both to satisfie the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and to do her
self right, <hi>la Chastagneraye</hi> having violated the respect due to her
Person and Presence, committed him immediately to the <hi>Bastile;</hi>
from whence though he was the next day enlarg'd, yet the sense
of his disgrace having wounded him to the quick, the common
bruit went that he would revenge himself upon the Duke's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and that he was countenanc'd in that resolution by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Princes. A thing which above all other men he was
the most fit to undertake, both for his courage which was very
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:63412:150"/>
well known; and also having the command of the Queens Guards,
he had better opportunity than any to execute his design, and to
practice upon the Duke in the very <hi>Louvre</hi> it self, than in any
other place, who never went accompanied in her Majesties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
as he did in all other places. The first intimation of this
design the Duke receiv'd from the Queens own mouth, who, by a
favour never before, or since granted to any, permitted him to
take a number of select Souldiers in his own Livery for the Guard
of his Person, to attend him in all places, so much as into the
<hi>Louvre</hi> it self; which favour was highly improved to him, when
for his greater security, she moreover gave way that he should
chuse some Gentlemen of Quality of his most confident Friends to

the Duke made choice of for this purpose were <hi>Chetin,</hi> Brother to
the <hi>Mareschal de St. Geran, Sauue-Baeuf, Bonneval,</hi> the <hi>Count de
Maillé, Castelbaiart,</hi> and <hi>Marillac,</hi> all men of approved Valour: a
Grace which though it gave great jealousie and distaste to the
Princes and Grandees of the Court, who were the Duke's Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
her Majesty thought it fit notwithstanding, to give him
leave to defend his own life against whomsoever would make any
attempt against it.</p>

himself involv'd,<note place="margin">The Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Dukes three Sons.</note> he forgot not the care of his Childrens Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whom he brought up to the most laborious Exercises, and

in the Latine Tongue, but in the Principles of Philosophy
also, he took care to provide the greatest man, without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
in Europe, for the Exercises of the Body, especially that
of Riding, which was the <hi>Sieur de la Bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>de Montmorencies</hi> entertainment; after whose Death, the
Duke gain'd him to himself by so great Benefits, that he gave him
at one clap ten thousand Crowns in Gold, with an Annuity of
a thousand Crowns issuing out of the <hi>Hostel de Ville</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> the
most certain Revenue at that time in <hi>France:</hi> Neither did he here
limit his Bounties. Under this Gentleman's excellent Discipline,
his two eldest Sons arriv'd to such a perfection in their exercises,
that no young Lords of their condition in the Kingdom went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them.</p>
                  <p>When they had acquir'd as much by precept as seem'd necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he conceiv'd it time they should establish that knowledge by
experience, and by observing the manners and ways of living of
other Countries; to which purpose having put them into an
Equipage suiting their quality, he sent them into <hi>Germany,</hi> to the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:63412:151"/>
end that by the different Governments of the several little Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of which the vast body of that Empire is compos'd, they
might be better enabled to judge of good and evil customs, and
extract a more certain knowledge for their own future conduct in
the Employments to which they were by him design'd. They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in that Country in a very troublesome time, when all ways
were very difficult, and unsafe; but the illustrious name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in greater repute in any part of Europe, than in <hi>France</hi> it
self (present vertues being for the most part less consider'd) did
not only open all ways, and secure all passes to them; but made
them also receiv'd with great respect, and honour'd with many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities,
and favours by all the Princes, and Republicks of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
After having staid some time in <hi>Germany,</hi> and visited at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the Cities, and most eminent places there, they went from
thence into <hi>Italy;</hi> where they made a considerable stay, and where
for the greatest part they made their residence at <hi>Rome,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still their Exercises; from whence they went to visit the most
eminent Cities of that sweetest part of Europe; where having
made an acquaintance with most of the Princes and Lords of
that Nation, they return'd into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilst the two eldest were thus forming their minds and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to such qualities as were either necessary, or at least becoming
their condition; <hi>Lewis</hi> the youngest of the three, design'd for the
Church, was with no less care brought up in the knowledge of
Letters; whom so soon as the Duke his Father conceiv'd to be of a
fit age, he sent him to <hi>La Flesche</hi> to the Colledge of the Father Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,
where the discipline requisite for the profession he was to
take upon him, was in very great repute. He there continued se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years, and came not thence till he had first run through all
the degrees, by which men climb to the highest pitch of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and in effect, when he was call'd thence to come to
Court, he had made so happy a progress, that Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> a
great friend of his Fathers, having been by him intreated to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with his Son, had an exceeding great opinion of him, and
believ'd him likely to make one of the greatest men of that age, if
he proceeded in his profession with a diligence proportionable to
the great parts wherewith he enter'd into it.</p>
                  <p>The three Brothers arriving almost all at the same time at
Court, the Duke their Father began to think of establishing the
greatness of his Family upon the surest foundation; and thereupon
consider'd each of them by himself, for the dividing his Estate
amongst them: wherein though they were all embellish'd with
so many excellent qualities, that it could hardly be discern'd which
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:63412:151"/>
had the greatest merit; yet the Duke having design'd to confer
his own name upon the second, that consideration enclin'd him a
little more to him than the other two. By Article at his Marriage
with <hi>Margaret de Foix,</hi> Countess of <hi>Candale,</hi> his eldest Son was
to carry the name of <hi>Foix,</hi> and to inherit his Mothers Estate,
clear'd, and augmented by the Duke's mony: and his own name
was also so great, what by the vertue of his Ancestors, and what
by his own, that he would not leave him on whom it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd,
inferiour either in Reputation, or Estate to any whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
of his condition, in the Kingdom. He had already by his
Service obtain'd from the Queen Regent the Reversion of all his
Offices; <hi>viz.</hi> of that of Colonel General of the Infantry of
<hi>France;</hi> of first Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, an Office he
had ever kept since his first Favour; of Governour of the City,
and <hi>Cittadel</hi> of <hi>Metz</hi> and of the <hi>Messin</hi> Country; of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
Cities, and Castles of <hi>Xaintes,</hi> and <hi>Angoulesme;</hi> of the
City and Government of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> the Country of <hi>Aulins,</hi> with
the higher and lower <hi>Limousin;</hi> of the City, Castle, and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> and of the City, Country, and Castle of <hi>Loches:</hi>
all which he at this time thus divided amongst his three Sons. To
his eldest, the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Candale,</hi> he assign'd in present (causing him
forthwith to be admitted into it) the Office of first Gentleman of
the Bed-Chamber, with the Governments of <hi>Angoumois, Xain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonge,
Aulins,</hi> and <hi>Limousin</hi> in Remainder; to which he added the
whole Estate of the House of <hi>Candale,</hi> amounting to above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
thousand Livers yearly revenue in goodly Lordships; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the Dutchy of <hi>Espernon,</hi> with the Earldom of <hi>Montfort,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with other Lands arising to above fifty thousand Crowns a
year: to which the Duke having obtain'd an assurance of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal</hi>'s
Staff for this Son, so soon as a more mature age and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
should render him capable of that Employment, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
that a high Spirit, as his was, ought to rest very well satisfied
with so fair a Fortune.</p>
                  <p>To the Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> his second Son, he assign'd his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Colonel, and the Government of <hi>Metz</hi> in reversion, with
the rest of his Estate whether hereditary or purchas'd; which made
up a Revenue equal to the first, together with his share of the
Rents, and personal Estate.</p>
                  <p>For his third Son also he provided to the value of fifty thousand
Crowns a year at least in Church preferments; of which he was
not content only to put him into present possession, but gave him
moreover a years Revenue advance, that he might have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to maintain a port suitable to his condition: to which he
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:63412:152"/>
further added the survivancy of the Government of <hi>Boulogne,</hi>
and <hi>Loches,</hi> with the Office of chief Almoner to the King, which
was a leading step to that of great Almoner of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this distribution of his Fortune, the Duke's paternal care
and liberality, might (a man would have thought) have amply
satisfied the most aspiring Ambitions, and the most avaritious
Natures; neither could the two youngest enough magnifie the
bounty of so good a Father, who by his Industry, and his Blood
had rais'd them to such a height of Riches and Honour: but some
malevolent Spirits, enemies to the peace and happiness of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
by a violence upon his nature, perswaded him he had not
been kindly us'd in this partition; that therein his younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had the best, and most solid Employments assign'd to him;

one was a Command of it self sufficient to oblige all
the Gentlemen of <hi>France,</hi> together with a Frontier much more
considerable, than the best Province of the Kingdom; whereas
what was consign'd to him, was only an Office of little value,
and no great repute at Court, with the expectation of a <hi>Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi>'s
Staff, considerable 'twas true, but a great way off; and that
for his Governments, they lay so in the heart of the Kingdom,
that his Authority would be very little, or nothing at all; by
which means making him at first undervalue the benefits he had
receiv'd, they so debauch'd his gratitude at last, as to make him
publickly complain of his Fathers proceeding, and to despise all
he had, seeing he had not all he desir'd.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, advertis'd of his Sons discontent, labour'd all he
could to reclaim him, and make him see his error, which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
did; neither could any thing be more grateful, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
than he ever carried himself, so oft as he suffer'd himself to
be govern'd by his own natural inclination.</p>
                  <p>Even before the King's death, the Fortune and Greatness of the
Father, with the merit, and Riches of the Sons, had rendred their
Alliances so considerable, that there were few persons of great

illustrious Family, before all the rest, Whereupon a Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them shortly ensu'd, though discontents soon after arising,
grew at last to that height, that in a few years they came to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
separation. Those who had the power to sow division in the
Marriage-Bed, had the same to perswade the <hi>Count de Candale</hi> into
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:63412:152"/>
an open breach with the Duke his Father; the grief whereof
(the most sensible of any he had ever met with in the whole
course of his life) as it was the cause of infinite others, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel
him afterwards, had like to have brought him to his Grave.
Yet did the Duke (as if he had already foreseen what did after fall
out) all an indulgent Father could possibly do, to reconcile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his Son, and his Son to his Duty: wherein though <hi>Le
Plessis</hi> (the usual mediator of all differences in that Family) did
as much as could be expected from an extraordinary prudence,
and a sincere affection, it proved all to no effect; the <hi>Count</hi> either
unable to support the injury he believ'd had been done him in
the partition of the Offices, or not well enduring the presence of
a Father, he was conscious to himself he had not kindly us'd,
being resolv'd by a voluntary Exile, to seek some repose for his
troubled mind. He determin'd therefore to forsake <hi>France,</hi> but
the end of his Travel was not simply for diversion; neither could
he satisfie himself with the meer exercise of some Vertues only
to be practis'd in the obscurity of retirement, and in the privacy
of a Closet; it was by painful, and perillous actions, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
his life to the uncertain event of great Enterprizes, that
he would qualifie and sweeten his discontents. Spurr'd on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by this generous resolution, he took the second time the way
of <hi>Italy,</hi> where arriving at the Court of the great Duke of <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi>
at a time when he was equipping some Gallies for the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
he entreated that Prince to permit him with his friends to
put himself aboard those Vessels. There had not any person of
his condition, for many years, gone out of the Kingdom with so
honourable a Train of Gentlemen, and those in so handsome an
Equipage, as the <hi>Count</hi> did; having above fifty Gentlemen of
good quality in his company, whom either their respect to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or the esteem of his own person, had prevail'd upon to run
the same fortune with him: <hi>Loziere, de Themines, Monberaut, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes,
Magnas,</hi> the two Brothers <hi>de la Tour, Villandry, Cipierre,
Vernegue, Monplaisir, de Vic, la Boissiere,</hi> with many other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of note, were of this number; when the Duke his Father,
how afflicted soever at his resolution, yet unwilling he should be
expos'd to so infinite, and almost inevitable dangers, without some
prudent and faithful person to stand by him in all hazards, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>Le Plessis</hi> likewise, who had been very useful to him in
his former Travels, to attend him in this sally also; not doubting
but he would by his conduct be as serviceable to him in his mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
undertakings, as he had formerly been by his dexterity in
other Affairs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:63412:153"/>The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> having consented that the <hi>Count de Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
with his Companions should embarque in his Gallies, they
cours'd up and down the Coasts of the <hi>Levant,</hi> performing some
exploits by Sea,<note place="margin">The <hi>Count de Candale</hi>'s Voyage into the <hi>Levant.</hi>
                     </note> and making some attempts by Land, and always
with good success: but the particular design of this expedition
being upon the Fortress of <hi>Aglimant,</hi> the most important of all
<hi>Caramania,</hi> they were to steer their course that way, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themselves to assault it. This Fortress, favour'd by a good
Harbour, was man'd with six hundred <hi>Turks,</hi> and moreover fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with Artillery, Ammunition, and all things necessary for
its defense; which, as it lay expos'd to the inroads of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
those who had the Guard of it, were so vigilant to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
that there could be no hope of effecting any thing by
surprize. Neither could the Admiral of the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Gallies (<hi>Signior
Enguerrany</hi> by name) who was to answer for any miscarriage in
the Enterprize, resolve to hazard an attempt, in which he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
saw so many, and almost invincible difficulties: but the
<hi>Count de Candale,</hi> having generously desir'd the greatest danger
might be conferr'd upon him, and his, his noble resolution cut off
all disputes, and the assault was forthwith concluded.</p>
                  <p>If in the proposition of this Enterprize the <hi>Count</hi> had evidenc'd
the bravery of his Spirit, he made it in the execution more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
appear. <hi>Don Pedro Medici</hi> of the Duke's own Family, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
resolv'd to make one in this Voyage, would do the <hi>Count de
Candale</hi> the Honour to fight in his Squadron, which having had
the precedency in landing, had the same deference continued to
them throughout the whole Action; which so succeeded to the
<hi>Count</hi>'s glory, that after a stout resistance he forc'd the place by
Petards, and took it; yet not without the loss of some Christians,
whereof some Gentlemen of Quality in his own Squadron there
lost their lives. <hi>Pedro Medici</hi> was himself desperately wounded,
<hi>Le Plessis</hi> more slightly; as also <hi>Monberaut,</hi> and some others:
but <hi>Villandry, la Boissiere,</hi> and <hi>Vernegue</hi> were laid dead upon the
place A loss however soon recompens'd by that of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
who had above 300. men slain in the Fight, with two hundred
and fifty of them made slaves, as two hundred and forty Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were set free: So that the <hi>Florentine</hi> General having seiz'd of
all the spoil, the <hi>Count de Candale</hi> contented himself with the bare
Honour of the Victory. The Fortress was set on fire, and in a
short space totally consum'd; the chiefest the <hi>

                  <p>This action carried on with so great prudence, and perform'd
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:63412:153"/>
with so admirable Valour, was crown'd with an universal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause:
So that the <hi>Count de Candale</hi> return'd into <hi>France</hi> loaded
with Glory and Praise, and <hi>Le Plessis</hi> having whilst he was
abroad sweetned his temper, and given him a better taste of his
Fathers Affection, at his return home, he also return'd into his
Duty and filial Obedience; which made the Duke with an excess
of joy receive him with open arms into his bosom; a re-union
that continuing some years, the <hi>Count</hi> liv'd at Court in great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and as high Reputation as any Gentleman of his condition
in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>At this time there likewise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that of the Dutchess of <hi>Montpensier</hi> her Mother with the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> acquire him that of that Duke, and all his Family.</p>
                  <p>This great Alliance in the revolutions, that after hapned, was
of no little importance to the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi> The favour of
<hi>Concino Concini Marquis d' Encre</hi> began at this time to shew it

                     </gap>curity, where
it had till now lain hid, and to raise it self to such a prodigious
stature, as drew upon the Marquis the envy of the whole Court.
I do not here pretend to speak of the Birth of this Favour, nor of
the degrees by which it rose to that excessive height, to which it
was so suddenly advanc'd. I shall only say that this Marquis, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself too weak to bear the great weight of Envy with which
he found himself oppress'd, sought the friendship and support
of the Duke of <hi>Espernon;</hi> who he knew was alone sufficient to
protect him against all the rest, and to whom, how ambitious
soever he might be in his own nature, he made no difficulty to
submit. He had in the spring of his favour receiv'd several good
Offices from him, in acknowledgment of which, or to interest the
Duke further in his preservation, he caus'd the Marriage of his
only Daughter with the Marquis <hi>de la Valette</hi> the Duke's second
Son, to be propos'd unto him; offering with her in Dowry the
Office of Constable for the Duke himself, so soon as the King
should come out of his Minority, of which the time was near at
hand; and for the Marquis, Mony and Offices, as much, and as
many as they could expect by the means, and through the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of a Favourite, who, through his Wife, possess'd an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Empire over the Queen Regents will.</p>
                  <p>Would the Duke have taken the advice of many of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
he had not perhaps, as he did, rejected this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oposal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:63412:154"/>
would never suffer himself to be overcome, either by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of his Friends, or the consideration of his own peculiar
interest,<note place="margin">The <hi>Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal d' Encre</hi> seeks the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>'s Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, and is rejected.</note> as to that motion; insomuch that instead of receiving
so advantageous offers with some shew of civility and respect, he
fail'd little of rejecting them with injury, and contempt, as he
did with great disdain: nay he express'd great offense, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness
against those who press'd him to it. An obstinacy that I
have often heard condemn'd by some, who believ'd the Duke had
never fall'n into those disorders, whereinto he saw himself after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
plung'd by the Marquis <hi>d' Encres</hi> excessive favour, had he
made himself Moderator, that is Master of Affairs, as he might
with great ease have done: but as he would pretend to no favour
himself, so could he endure no other Favourites; insomuch that
he would rather make it his business to pull this down, than by
his interest to serve himself in doing his own work.</p>
                  <p>Though by this repulse the Marquis <hi>d' Encre</hi> (upon whom all
things depended at that time) was infinitely cool'd towards the
Duke; yet did he not manifest any disgust at all: The Duke was
so necessary at Court, the Queen could not be without him; he
had propounded, and caus'd the Match with <hi>Spain</hi> to be resolv'd
upon, contrary to the opinion of the Princes of the Blood, and
divers others of great condition, who follow'd their interests;
yet could not the busines be carried on to the Queen satisfaction,
if he did not remain at Court, to fortifie such in their first reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
as otherwise might perhaps be taken off by the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the great power of those, who so stiffly oppos'd it. It was
therefore necessary to make use of him in this occasion for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of what had been first propounded by him: and
in the end the conditions of the two Marriages having been mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accepted of in both Courts, there was great demonstration
of joy in both Kingdoms, <hi>France</hi> particularly pouring out it self
in magnificences to a degree almost of profusion, could too much
gratitude have been express'd for a blessing that has already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
so much happiness, and that is likely to bring much more
to the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Court was busie about the preparation for these so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities,
the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and the <hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
withdrew from Court; whose retirement, together with some
discontent those of the Religion made shew of at the same time,
gave great apprehension, that matters were likely to come to a
speedy rupture: but the wisdom of the Queens Council having
apply'd seasonable remedies to this disorder, if they did not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
take away the effect of what they fear'd, they at least deferr'd
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:63412:154"/>
deferr'd it; so that the publick Peace was for this time secur'd.
The Queen caus'd the Princes to be treated with, who were at
last content to return to Court, and to sign the conditions of the
Marriage; and those of the Religion, having by this little disorder
procur'd some inconsiderable concessions, referr'd to a fitter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
the design they had to interrupt the main work, which
they conceiv'd would be infinitely prejudicial to their Interest, and
Safety.</p>
                  <p>I cannot in this place forbear another digression from my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,<note place="margin">Anno 1613.</note> to speak of the acquisition the Duke made at this time of
one of the principal Servants he ever had in his Family, and one
whose merit made him afterwards very eminent at Court, where
he obtain'd no little Favour and Esteem with the King himself;
and this was the <hi>Sieur de Marsillac,</hi> a Gentleman of as great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and as graceful a presence as any whatsoever of his time.
This man had formerly had a dependence upon <hi>Balagny</hi> (call'd
the Brave of the Court) whom <hi>Balagny</hi> had taken out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Guards, where he trail'd a Pike, to put him upon one
of the boldest, and most honourable Actions a Gentleman of his
condition could possibly undertake,<note place="margin">A Challenge carried by <hi>Marsillac</hi> from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagni</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Eguillon.</hi>
                     </note> and that was to carry a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to the Duke of <hi>Eguillon,</hi> since Duke of <hi>Mayenne.</hi> This bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
hapned in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the great, who did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him for it; and, though it was the first of this nature that
perhaps had ever been known in <hi>France,</hi> gave notwithstanding
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> his Father no satisfaction therein, what
complaints soever he could make. I have heard <hi>Marsillac</hi> himself
tell the story: He adventur'd a poor younger Brother as he was,
to go execute his Commission even in the Duke <hi>d' Eguillon</hi>'s own
Bed-Chamber, whose generosity and freedom he could never
sufficiently commend, he doing him the honour to go out with
him alone to give his friend satisfaction, without other caution,
than his own bare word, though he could by no means prevail
with him, to let him be further concern'd in the Quarrel, being
resolute to end the dispute without a Second; the only thing
whereof he could complain in the Duke's behaviour towards
him; though he gave him at the same time as much reason, to
magnifie the extraordinary, and noble care he took to conceal
the action from the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> his Fathers knowledge. He
was in the house when the Challenge was brought, and has often
been heard to say, that had he known his temerity, he would
have caus'd <hi>Marsillac</hi> to have been tost out of the Windows, to
have taught him what it was to bring a Message of that nature to
a Prince, from a private Gentleman: and doubtless he would
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:63412:155"/>
have been as good as his word, he was so highly incens'd at the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front;
which perhaps serv'd for an example shortly after to the
Baron of <hi>Luz,</hi> in his challenge to the <hi>Chevalier de Guise.</hi> As for
<hi>Marsillac</hi> after the death of <hi>Balagny</hi> (who was kill'd in a Quarrel)
being entertain'd into the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Service, he obtain'd
under him in the command of his Guard, which he bestowed
upon him, so high a reputation, and esteem, that he was at last
desir'd by the King; where his Majesty gave him a Company in
his own Guards, and his deserts were infallibly raising him to a
much higher fortune, if at the same time the King express'd the
greatest esteem and affection for him, he had not at the Siege of
<hi>Privas</hi> receiv'd a Musquet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his hopes, was also the reward of all his Service.</p>
                  <p>We here with a new year enter upon a new disorder,<note place="margin">Anno 1614.</note> of which
the immoderate greatness of <hi>Conchini</hi> was either the effectual, or
at least the pretended cause;<note place="margin">New disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Kingdom.</note> and doubtless his favour and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
were rais'd to that excess, as rendred him intolerable; either
of which are sufficiently odious in whomsoever they happen to
befound; but being united in him, pull'd upon him the hatred,
or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nvy of all sorts of men. The most part of the great ones see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves excluded from all knowledge of Affairs (neither
is it possible to satisfie all who will pretend to that priviledge) cast
their eyes upon the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> to interest him in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents;
and the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Faction not being able without great
jealousie to see the Marriage accomplish'd, was no less ready than
those Grandees to break into open arms: The one and the other
then being in such a disposition, had joyntly by the negotiation
of the Duke of <hi>Boüillon</hi> recourse to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to oppose himself to <hi>Conchini</hi>'s greatness, to demand pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for those evils of which he had been the cause, and a
Reformation in the State; the old and common pretense of all
such as would infest the publick peace. The Prince had ever since
the death of the <hi>Count de Soissons</hi> been in high consideration, not
only by reason of his quality as first, but also as it were sole Prince
of the Blood; to which his admirable endowments rendred him
no less conspicuous, than did the preeminence of his Birth: He
was knowing, dexterous, and intelligent in all sorts of business,
beyond what could be expected from his age: notwithstanding
all which great qualities, something yet being wanting, that some
conceiv'd was requir'd in a person of his eminent condition, they
had not allow'd him that share in the management of Affairs he
either merited, or at least desir'd; an injury that he very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sneting,
and moreover animated by the perswasions not of the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:63412:155"/>
Duke <hi>de Boüillon</hi> only, but also by the Dukes of <hi>Longueville,
Mayenne, Nevers,</hi> and <hi>Luxe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bourg,</hi> who had every one a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
pretext for his defection, made him suddenly depart from
Court, and retire himself to <hi>Mezieres</hi> in <hi>Champagne,</hi> from whence,
should he be smartly laid to, he might conveniently retreat to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.</hi>
To this place he was follow'd by all the other discontented
Lords: as for the Duke of <hi>Vendosme,</hi> who had likewise promis'd
to do the same, not being able to get clear of the Court so soon
as he intended (having been detain'd prisoner in a Chamber of
the <hi>Louvre</hi>) he nevertheless finding means to deceive his Guards,
escap'd soon after to his Government of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> where he did
what he could to fortifie the Faction by the interest he had in that
Province.</p>
                  <p>This great number of discontents put the Court into strange
disorder, the old Ministers of State, who had seen nothing of a
Civil War for many years, apprehending this would certainly
involve the Kingdom in a desperate confusion: but the Duke of
<hi>Espernon</hi> having consider'd that the Princes for the most part had
neither mony, nor credit at home, nor no intelligence abroad,
few places to retire unto, and fewer friends amongst the people,
whom the serenity of the present Government had rendred very
well satisfied with their condition, was of a quite contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

if the King would please to put himself into the head of this little

Rebellion without other ground than the meer instigation of
some mutinous spirits, and no other support at all.<note place="margin">Not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Royal Affairs.</note> It was the same
advice he had formerly given <hi>Henry</hi> the III. in the time of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and in the first commotions of the League; which not
having then been hearkened to, had cost the King and the whole
Kingdom so dear: but the same Counsel had here the same suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
the wisdom of the Ministers of State could not give ear to
an advice, wherein they apprehended so great a danger; so that
for want of having observ'd what the presence of a King does in
a Kingdom, where the respect to the Sovereign Authority has
ever been so inviolate, as that it seems to be a quality inherent to
that people, they lost the most favourable opportunity to have
secur'd the present peace, and to have prevented the mischiefs that
ensu'd, could possibly have been wish'd. An oversight that the
Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> very well observing, as I have heard him say him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63412:156"/>
he of that observation (as we shall see hereafter) made a
great advantage for the King's Service in the Queen Mothers
Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The advice of taking Arms being thus rejected, the Duke of
<hi>Espernon</hi> refus'd to have any hand in the insuing Treaty, wherein
he saw they were to purchase a Peace he neither thought honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
nor likely long to continue. It was nevertheless soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and the Princes having at this time found no disposition
in the people to follow the humour of their priuate discontents;
nor being able of themselves to raise any considerable force, made
no great difficulty of selling a Peace, they would undoubtedly,
have bought at any price, had they once been made to feel the
smart of War. But for this they had great summes of mony, that
furnish'd them for another Rebellion, with some other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as that there should be a Convocation of the Estates General
for regulating such disorders as (they said) were introduc'd into
the Kingdom. And this was that call'd the Peace of <hi>Saint Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hou,</hi>
according to the Articles of which, there follow'd after a
Convocation of the Estates, but not till the Declaration of the
King's Majority had first been ratified in the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi>
that Act having been thought convenient to precede the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
to the end that whatever they should there conclude, might
be more authentick, and admit of no dispute for the time to
come.</p>
                  <p>During this Session of the Estates, and in the sight as it were
of all <hi>France,</hi> which in the persons of their Deputies seem'd to
be then present at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Duke did an action which made a
great bustle, and noise in the beginning; but that in the issue,
through the high consideration and esteem of his Authority and
Vertue, was pass'd over well enough. I have already said, when
speaking of the erection of the Duke's command of Colonel Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
in Title of an Office of the Crown, that the King annex'd
thereto a Sovereign Justice, or Court Martial over all the <hi>French</hi>
Infantry. In any difference betwixt Souldier and Souldier, the
Duke, together with the Officers of that Body to which the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
did belong, was absolute and sovereign Judge of the Offense;
but if the difference hapned to be betwixt a Souldier and a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
there he was to call some Officers of Justice, together with
the Officers of the Regiment to assist him. Rules that, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
amongst the Statutes of the Crown, are at this day part of
the Law, as they make up the most noble part of that brave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
It hapned that at this time, two Souldiers of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Guards fighting a Duel in the <hi>Pré-au-Clercs,</hi> a place within
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:63412:156"/>
the Jurisdiction of the Abby of <hi>Saint Germans,</hi> the one being
slain, the other was taken, and delivered into the hands of the
Prevost of <hi>Saint Germans,</hi> who detain'd him in the Prison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Abby. Whereupon the Duke conceiving this had
been ignorantly done by the Officer, who perhaps might not
know how far in this case his Authority did extend, sent the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost-Martial
of the Regiment to the Bailiff to make him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the right the Duke had to demand his Prisoner, and withal
civilly to entreat him to deliver him up, that he might be brought
to his Trial: But this entreaty was answer'd with a surly and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
denial, which being, in the terms it was deliver'd, carried
back to the Duke, made him infinitely impatient, that the Laws
establish'd in favour of his command, should suffer so great a
contempt: neither could he on the other side submit to pursue all
the due Forms, by which he was by order of Law and Justice to
retrive his man. Thinking it therefore the most expedite way to
make use of his own Authority in the case, he commanded the
Lieutenant of the Company of which the Prisoner was, to take
a Squadron along with him, and by fair means or foul to bring
him away; which was accordingly executed: and upon a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
refusal the Prison of <hi>Saint Germans</hi> broke open, and the
Souldier carried away to be punish'd according to the rigour of
the Law, but by those nevertheless who were his proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Judges.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Bailiff goes to the Parliament to complain of
the contempt had been offer'd to the Court by a violence upon
their inferiour Officers: upon which complaint, and an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Viva voce</hi> preferr'd by the Bailiff himself; the Parliament
issued out a Warrant to apprehend the Lieutenant for executing
his Colonels Order, with a Citation of personal appearance
against the Colonel himself: A proceeding, that as it could not
certainly be approv'd by all, surpriz'd and nettled the Duke to
the last degree. He complain'd of it to the King, representing at
the same time his reasons to justifie the Act, and not being able to
support the contempt he conceiv'd was cast upon his person, by a
body he had ever honour'd, and sometimes oblig'd, he would give
the world an accompt it was no easie matter to serve a Process up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. That from the Parliament had been granted out the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>November,</hi> and on the ninteenth the Duke went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in person, accompanied with five, or six hundred Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
besides whom there also crowded as many more young
Souldiers of the Regiment of Guards into the Palace; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that all the Base-Court, Galleries, and the very Hall it self
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:63412:157"/>
was full of them. The Duke pretended he went to present him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in obedience to the Process had been issued out against him,
though no one could believe he went in such a posture with any
intent of submission: So that the Parliament advertiz'd of his
coming with so great a Train, and not knowing his design, nor
to what his passion might transport him, suddenly adjourn'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
every man his own way before their usual time.</p>
                  <p>As it is hard to govern a confus'd, and unruly multitude, a sort
of young hair-brain'd fellows, who attended the Duke, offer'd
some indignities, and affronts to some of the inferiour Officers of
the Court; and being most of them in Boots, purposely intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
their Spurs in the Ushers, and Proctors Gowns, thinking
thereby the more to oblige the Duke, as they appear'd more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of his offense. An insolence that infinitely aggravated the
business, which without that had been foul enough of it self. A
great complaint whereof was made against the Duke, as respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for all that hapned at the Palace, every one believing that, in
the design he had to brave the Parliament, all things were done by
his order, which had pass'd in his presence.</p>
                  <p>If the Duke had manifested a resentment of the injury he had
receiv'd from the Parliament, the Parliament express'd no less for
what the Duke had done to the contempt of their Dignity; yet
did they make no complaint thereof to the King; but remaining
in a profound silence (the truest sign of a violent affliction) order'd
a cessation of Justice, with a determinate resolution never to meet
again, till first a publick and solemn reparation should be made.</p>
                  <p>This business, proceeding to such a height, put the King and
Queen into a very great confusion; they thought it neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
nor safe in this juncture of Affairs, which seem'd to
threaten some sudden mischief, to disoblige the Duke of <hi>Espernon;</hi>
neither did they think it an easie matter to perswade him to pay
the Parliament any great submissions; who, on the other side,
would in such a case as this accept of no ordinary satisfaction. At
last the King sent the Duke <hi>de Vantadour</hi> to the Palace, to tell the
Parliament from him, That by their Body his person being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
<q>all the injury they pretended to have receiv'd from the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> reflected immediately upon him: That his
Majesty also took it to himself, to whom it did belong, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his own Honour, which he should be sufficiently able to
do without any necessity upon them of espousing his Quarrel:
but that because the business had made some noise, that might
perhaps have given some offense to the publick, he therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
they should receive a publick satisfaction, and such a one as
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:63412:157"/>
should satisfie the world of the great respect he had to Justice.
That in order thereunto it was his pleasure the Prisoner should
be return'd to the same place from whence he had been taken,
and by the same person by whom he had been fetch'd away;
and as for what concern'd the Duke, who protested he had no
intention to offend the Parliament in what he had done, he
should be desir'd in his own person to make the same protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Things being thus order'd, the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> the nine and
twentieth of the same month went to the Palace; when, though
with no extraordinary Train about his person, so many never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
of his Friends had convey'd themselves into the Palace, as
were sufficient to make head against his Enemies, should they,
by taking advantage of the place, or by pretending to do a right
to the Assembly, have attempted any thing against him. Being
come into the great Chamber, and having taken his accustomed
seat, he, speaking with his hat on, in few words Remonstrated:
<q>That having never had other intent, than to pay all due respect
to an Assembly in which he had had the honour for many years
to have some place, he could not but admire they should inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
what was an effect of that due honour and respect, for a
premeditated offense: That he was not altogether so unthrifty
of his own Interest, as to offer an injury to them, which he
could not but know would rebound upon himself: That he
had, for two and thirty years past, been a Member of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Body; during all which time there had not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a man of his condition, more passionate for their Service,
than himself in the Kingdom: That he had set down amongst
the good fortunes of his life, the opportunity he had happily
met withal of expressing his good Affection to the Dignity of
that Assembly, when after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, of
Glorious Memory, he had first advis'd them to make use of
their own Authority in providing for the Regency of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
That he had tendred them his Service upon that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which had not been altogether ineffectual to the putting
them in possession of a priviledge which would doubtless be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of in ages yet to come: That if any indiscreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
had made use of his name, either for the pretense of their
insolencies, or in the prosecution of their own private revenge,
he seriously demanded their Justice, as the person most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the offense: That he very well knew his enemies
would lay hold of that occasion, to make him appear in all the
fault; but that he did humbly beseech them to judge more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:63412:158"/>
of his intentions, and that all things past might be
forgot (concluding his speech with these very words) That he

he had not given that satisfaction he could have wish'd to their
Learned Ears, who having been all his life a Captain of Foot,
had ever made it more his study to do, than to speak well.</q> To
which the first President <hi>Verdun,</hi> after having gather'd the Votes
of the Assembly, return'd this Answer: <q>That since the King
was graciously pleas'd to incline more to Clemency than Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
the Court by his Majesties express Command, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of his many brave Services, as also willing to make
the best interpretation of what had pass'd, accepted of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse;
hoping thereby for the future, to engage both himself and
his Sons to pay those Services to the King and Kingdom to
which they were in gratitude oblig'd; and to that Court the
Honour and respect was due unto them.</q> Of which he never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fail'd; neither at the hour of his death, was there any person
of his condition in the Kingdom, who had more friends than
he in that honourable Assembly, nor that had more reason upon
several occasions to magnifie their Justice.</p>

for the consummation of his Marriage; an Affair that having
ever been oppos'd by the Prince, he very well understood the
meaning of that Summons, and now plainly saw how he was to
trust in the strength of his own Arms. He had ever since the last

dispos'd for an intestine War, in all the best Provinces of the

                  <p>So many discontented persons, and those so considerable in
themselves, put the Court into no little disorder; the Kings Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in order to his Marriage had been resolv'd upon, and the

so publickly known, that the Honour of the King and the Queen
Mother was not a little concern'd in the consummation of a thing,
to which they were so solemnly engag'd: but there was scarce any

hinder that great Affair. For after the retirement of all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd
Princes, there was not any remain'd at Court, except
the Dukes of <hi>Guise</hi> and <hi>Espernon,</hi> who were capable of serving
the King in so dangerous an occasion; and of these the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> though in shew well enough with the Queen, stood never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
so suspected to her, that she durst not trust an Army in his
hands, lest by joyning with the discontented Princes (whereof
the greater part were his Kindred, or nearly ally'd to him) his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Person might be left wholly to their discretion; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
she had not the same jealousie of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> (no

they would, and that he was doing something in order to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
their Journey so far as <hi>Bordeaux;</hi> wherein he neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
pretended to no other Command, than barely to ride in the
head of those Friends, which he should make ready for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
That perhaps a greater Authority might give distaste to
some, who at this time were by no means to be disoblig'd:
That for what concern'd the Princes, a good Army interpos'd
betwixt them, and <hi>Paris,</hi> under the command of some man of
Quality and Experience would be sufficient: and that for any
thing could be apprehended from those of the Religion, whose
greatest strength were in <hi>Poitou, Xaintongue,</hi> and <hi>Rochelle</hi> upon
the way to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> he himself would undertake; his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments

first design, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> told the Duke that she absolutely resign'd the
King's Person, and her own to his care and protection; that she
therefore desir'd him to order all things, as should seem to him
the most convenient, as she absolutely left them to his Valour and
Wisdom: A Commission the Duke had no sooner receiv'd, but
that seeing himself authorized so to do, he caus'd the King's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
the seventeenth of <hi>August</hi> to be proclaim'd, perswading
the Queen to confer the Command of the Army which was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Princes motion upon the <hi>Mareschal de Bois-Dauphin;</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
her Majesty further, and in the first place to provide for the
security of <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Princes Servants, who had great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the City, might raise no commotion there in their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
absence.</p>
                  <p>After therefore that had been taken order for, by the securing
of some eminent and suspected persons, the Court departed from
<hi>Paris,</hi> happily arriving in a few days at <hi>Poictiers:</hi> and had not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
the King's Sister fallen sick of the Small Pox delayed their
Journey, their Majesties had been upon their return before the
Princes could have got their Forces together; but that unhappy
accident, having constrain'd them to stay near two months at <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiers,</hi>
gave their Enemies leisure to put them into great apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
which was also the only harm they received from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:63412:160"/>At the same City of <hi>Poictiers</hi> there hapned another disorder at
this time, wherein had not the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
concern'd in the Affair, rendred himself unusually tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
another obstacle to that Progress had infallibly ensu'd. The
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> from the time of his Marriage with the Dutchess
of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> had pretended to the Wardship of <hi>Madamoiselle</hi>
her Daughter; who was Inheritrix to such a Fortune, as might
reasonably induce any man to covet the management of so brave
an Estate, which nevertheless he could not obtain, without the
consent of the Duke who was great Uncle to the young Princess:
and he, having very good reason to believe the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> did
in this claim, more consider his own interest, than that of the
Dutchess of <hi>Montpensier</hi> his Niece, would never gratifie him in
that particular. But the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> conceiving his Service to
be altogether necessary at this time, took this opportunity to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
the Queen, either to cause the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him in this point, or to give him leave to retire. Whereupon
the Queen spoke of it to the Duke, whom she found very averse
to any such motion; he humbly entreating her Majesty to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
absolutely of all his own concerns, but not to command him
to neglect his Nieces interests: though in the end, the Queen,
who could promise to her self no good issue of that Journey,
without a good intelligence betwixt these two great persons, so
far prevail'd upon the Duke, that he was content to satisfie the
Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi> by which means their friendship upon the point
for ever to be dissolv'd, upon this little occasion, grew greater and
more firm than ever.</p>
                  <p>As it had been no hard matter to foresee how advantageous
the long Sickness of <hi>Madam,</hi> and their Majesties stay at <hi>Poictiers</hi>
would be to the designs of those of the Religion, and others who
were engag'd in the Princes Quarrel: So had the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>
omitted nothing that might any way serve to divert the
dangerous effects of that untoward accident. And herein he had
been especially solicitous to put his Governments of <hi>Xaintonge,</hi>
and <hi>Angoumois</hi> into a posture fit for his Majesties Service, upon
that the security of that Voyage chiefly depending. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
therefore he had sent thither the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> his eldest
Son (already establish'd in the succession of those Governments)
to keep them in Obedience: Nevertheless what he did for so
good an end, succeeded otherwise than he expected, news be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought him, that this Son had entertain'd resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
much contrary to his own, and having suffer'd himself
to be misled by certain ungovern'd passions, was fall'n off
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:63412:160"/>
from his duty to embrace new Counsels, and to follow new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</p>
                  <p>Whether it were the sense of this miscarriage in his Son (which
also occasion'd a new, and a wider breach betwixt them) or the
apprehension of being by this means made incapable of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
his word with the King and Queen, that put his mind into
that disorder whereinto he soon after fell; so it was that he fell
sick of so violent a grief, as every one expected would carry him
to his grave. Things nevertheless succeeded in his Government
according to what he had undertaken; their Majesties after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Madam, having left <hi>Poictiers,</hi> proceeded in great secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to <hi>Angoulesme;</hi> neither there, nor in any other place through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Journey meeting with any impediment at all. But
the Duke wounded to the soul with the violent sorrow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of his
Sons untoward carriage was now no longer able to bear it out;
but having convey'd their Majesties to the utmost bounds of his
Government (that is to say out of all danger, they there entring
upon <hi>Guienne,</hi> where the way was clear to <hi>Bordeaux</hi>) fell sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into so great a weakness, that he was carried back for dead to
<hi>Angoulesme:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> falls despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately sick.</note> He lay above forty hours (a very extraordinary

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, being
stirr'd up by a glass of Water (his ordinary and best Remedy, and
which he ever made use of in all distempers) he began a little to
come to himself, with so great an astonishment nevertheless, that
he continued a great while without any kind of knowledge; his
sighs, which were the issue of his grief, being the only evidence
almost he gave that he was yet alive. Yet could he not, in this
great and total neglect of himself, forget the care of his Masters
Affairs, he being no sooner return'd to a new life, but that he
dispatch'd away the Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who had continued
about him, during his Sickness, to attend the King, and Queen;
that the Friends he had engag'd in this Voyage, having himself as
it were present with them, in the person of so dear a part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
might continue more diligent in their duty.</p>
                  <p>The Duke had the honour, during this Sickness, to be visited
by several persons sent purposely by the King and Queen to see
him, by whom he receiv'd very obliging Letters, under their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
own hands; and when something recover'd, others of the
same stile and kindness. <hi>Mounsieur de Villeroy</hi> also, after their old
animosities, being become his very great friend, writ very often
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:63412:161"/>
to him; wherein he still gave him an accompt of all Affairs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
him to make all the haste he could to Court, where he said
his Presence and Service was never more necessary than at this
time. Two of which Letters I have seen, bearing date the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth,
and four and twentieth,
of <hi>October</hi> 1615. Not that the Duke
was nevertheless upon so good terms at Court, as he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been: neither did those Letters imply any such thing, it being
hardly to be expected he could be in any eminent degree of favour
with the Queen Mother (upon whom, at that time, all things
depended) being out with the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre,</hi> whose Wife
had so strange an ascendent over her Majesties inclinations; but
that his Service could, in this juncture, by no means be spar'd:
neither did he, how evidently soever he saw his favour decline,
fail, out of that consideration, in any part of his Duty, being
resolute rather to perish, than that their Majesties should suffer the
least inconvenience. So soon therefore as he was able to Travel,
he went to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> where he arriv'd the twelfth day of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
and a few days after attended the King to <hi>Castres,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

by this time united, and moreover re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inforc'd with some Forein
Troops, were likely to make their Majesties return to <hi>Paris</hi> very
difficult, and dangerous. An occasion wherein the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>'s
Services were again of very great moment, who, during
his abode at <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> after his recovery, had made many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,
which were all ready at <hi>Ville-Bois;</hi> a recruit that consisting
of 5000. Foot, and 400. Light Horse, and joyn'd to the Forces
their Majesties already had, absolutely secur'd their return through
the Countries of <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Poictou,</hi> possess'd by those of
the Religion, and without any difficulty made good their way to
<hi>Poictiers,</hi> and so to <hi>Tours,</hi> notwithstanding whatever the Princes
could do to oppose them.</p>
                  <p>In this return of the King to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was made
General of the Army, which had hitherto serv'd under the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
de Bois-Dauphin,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had also the
absolute Authority of their Majesties Conduct conferr'd upon
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:63412:161"/>
him; who, for fear of distasting the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> would never
till then pretend to any command: an undertaking wherein he
so acquitted himself, as might give him reasonable expectation of
a grateful return: But who can promise to himself any fruits of
his services, especially at Court, where the best are usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with hatred, or envy? nor had the Duke's a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,
when having perform'd all that could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from a Loyal Subject, and a brave Gentleman, and that
their Majesties by his vigilancy and valour were once settled in
safety, there was nothing more thought of, than how to revenge
the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre,</hi> even at the price of so good, and so faithful
a Servant.</p>
                  <p>The first evidence the Duke met withal of any manifest disgrace,<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s disgrace.</note>
was upon the occasion of a vacancy that hapned in the Company
of <hi>la Courbe,</hi> one of the Captains in the Regiment of Guards: a
Gentleman that having serv'd long, and with great Reputation in
that Command, and hapning to die in this Journey; and his Son
a young and hopeful Cavalier, having before his Fathers death
been admitted Ensign to that Company, the Duke, who had been
a great lover of the Father (whose brave and late Services seem'd
likewise to plead in behalf of the Son) had mov'd their Majesties
in his Favour, that that Command might be conferr'd upon him.
Since the death of the late King, nor of long before, had the
Duke ever appear'd zealous in any request he had not, without
any great difficulty, obtain'd; neither had he less, but more reason
now, than ever to expect the same favour, his recent Services ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been of that importance to the Kings Affairs: all which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
being either not regarded, or forgot; and the design had
before been concluded to disoblige him, prevailing above the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Father, the pretenders Right, and the Duke's Interest
who interceded for him, <hi>la Besne,</hi> Lieutenant to the same Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
was preferr'd before young <hi>la Courbe,</hi> how displeas'd soever
the Duke seem'd to be at that Election. Yet did he not resent this ill
usage so high as to leave the Court, satisfying himself at present
with manifesting his discontents bymany and publick complaints,
though in vain, the Court now no more caring to offend him:
but on the contrary taking this occasion to exclude him from the
Council, where his candid, and unbyass'd opinions did nothing
relish with such as would have all things give way to their own
private interests (and doubtless had he at this time in the least ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
with his enemies, they would immediately have attempted
upon his person) that the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre,</hi> and his Wife might
by so powerful an opposes be no longer travers'd in their designs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:63412:162"/>The Duke's Affairs were in this posture, when their Majesties
having first recover'd <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Chastellerant</hi>
(where the Peace concluded at <hi>Loudun</hi> was sign'd) arriv'd in the
end at <hi>Tours;</hi> neither did the Duke there fail, how ill soever he
saw himself entertain'd, continually to pay all due reverence to the
Queen, when coming one day into her Chamber with a great
many other Lords and Gentlemen, one of the beams that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
the floor suddenly broke; insomuch that all that side of
the Room fell down with a sudden ruine, overwhelming all those
that stood upon it, to their exceeding great peril. Many persons of
very eminent quality were engag'd in the danger of this fall, amongst
whom the <hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> then very young, was one, as also
the Duke <hi>Bassompierre,</hi>

always very well attended, his Servants suddenly leap'd into
the midst of the ruines, to relieve him, where, though himself
was dangerously engag'd, and very much hurt in several places,
especially in one shoulder, he nevertheless call'd out to his Friends
to run and save the <hi>Count,</hi> himself also assisting as much as in
him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ay to disingage him from the rubbish, and to put him out
of danger by the Window of a low Parlour; being much more
solicitous of this Prince's safety than his own: who, being by his
own, and his Servants diligence secur'd, he afterwards disingag'd
himself from the ruines, and wounded, as has been said, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
to his own Lodgings. The Queen Mother, who, by good
fortune had escap'd the danger (that part of the Chamber where
she sate, being supported by the more faithful strength of the other
Beam that remain'd entire) sent very graciously to visit all the
persons of Quality, who had receiv'd any hurt by this accident,
the Duke only (who was design'd for the worst usage) excepted.
It is not to be doubted, but that the Duke must needs highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
so manifest a preterition, by which he evidently perceiv'd
they intended to make him sensible of his disgrace; so that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
should he continue at Court after so clear a testimony of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour,
something of a ruder nature might be put upon him, he
forthwith resolv'd to retire himself, as he did, but with high and
publick complaints of the injustice was done him, and of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
recompense he received for all his Service. He spent two
days before his departure in visiting, and taking leave of his friends,
forbearing nevertheless that Ceremony to all he conceiv'd not to
be such, in what degree of favour soever they might be at Court;
he either having never understood, or having never been willing
to learn those mean Court Maxims that oblige men to dissemble
their resentments, and to give thanks for injuries receiv'd: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:63412:162"/>
on the contrary to all the world, that he went away with
the dissatisfaction an honest man ought to have for the loss of his
time, and service. Notwithstanding at last, taking his leave of
their Majesties, he was by the King and Queen very civilly dismist,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> retires from Court.</note>
though the Queen Mother receiv'd his last complements with the
usual coldness she had already begun to discover upon several oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
                  <p>After this manner the Duke retir'd back to <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> his old,
and ordinary refuge, in all his disgraces, whilst their Majesties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

whither the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> also (imagining he had by the Treaty.

not in the power of event to work any alteration to his disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage)
came presently after; but he soon found that nothing is more
unstable, than a power, how great soever, that depends meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its own strength, the sole name of a King (though a Child,
and the publick administration managed by a man hateful to all)
being sufficient to arrest him in the very arms of all his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> confin'd.</note> and even in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> where he believ'd his person,

                  <p>All the Princes, and Lords, not only those then present at Court,
and who had engag'd with the Prince in the late commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

a proceeding, and believing that after an example like
this, neither respect of persons, nor any security in general was
to be expected, they suddenly retir'd from Court; to whom the
rest almost as suddenly re-united themselves for their common
safety. The <hi>Mareschal,</hi> who thought that by securing the Head of

the rest, was infinitely surpriz'd when he saw them now united in
more formidable numbers than before, and that the Lords of the

wherein nevertheless he had this hope, that so many persons of
equal quality would not long agree together, especially if press'd
home by the Royal Arms: An opinion that made him resolve
to set immediately such Forces on foot, as should be sufficient to
encounter, and suppress them in several places at once. Neither
did he care to reduce any by Treaty, save only the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
conceiving an Accommodation with him would be more easily
effected, than with any of the other, by how much he had ever
observ'd a greater moderation in him, and his Brothers towards
himself, than the rest; to which likewise the complacency the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:63412:163"/>
Duke had ever manifested for the Queen in other occasions, gave
him greater assurance of a flexibility in him to her Majesties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
in this, and that without much difficulty a good intelligence
might be establish'd betwixt them; as there afterwards was, the
<hi>Guises,</hi> having receiv'd caution for their security, being content to
return to Court.</p>

immediately betook himself to Arms, and so vigorously, that
in a very few days, three great Armies were set on foot, whereof
one was sent against the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who was retir'd to
<hi>Soissons;</hi> another against the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> in <hi>Champagne;</hi> and
the third against the Dutchess of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who with a generosity
(something extraordinary in her delicate Sex) was resolute to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Dutchy of <hi>Nivernois,</hi> which was the Inheritance of the
Duke her Husband.</p>
                  <p>In this disorder of Affairs,<note place="margin">Anno 1616.</note> the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> apprehending
that the hatred the <hi>Mareschal</hi> had conceiv'd against him, was no less
than that he manifested against the rest, and that he would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
fall upon him, so soon as he had dispatch'd with them, he
had no mind to be surpriz'd, nor to suffer himself tamely to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd;
considering therefore that alone he should not long be
able to resist the power of the King, whose name his enemy had
usurp'd in all his Affairs, he address'd himself to the Duke of
<hi>Montmorency,</hi> to engage him in his Quarrel; by whose mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he made no doubt to draw over <hi>l' Esdiguieres</hi> also. The Duke
knew those two to be no better satisfied with the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than himself; who, although they were not openly perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
as he was, yet the example of the other persons of the same
condition, making them reasonably to apprehend for themselves,
what they already saw others suffer; he doubted not, but that
without much difficulty they would be perswaded to embrace the
union; neither was he mistaken herein, the Duke of <hi>Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
as also <hi>l' Esdiguieres,</hi> absolutely engaging with him. So that
these three Confederates, having opportunity to concur in the
work, through the mediation, and by the assistance of several
powerful friends the Duke had in <hi>Guienne,</hi> nothing could hinder
them from uniting, in so necessary a defense, and so just a
Quarrel.</p>
                  <p>The Duke,<note place="margin">Anno 1617.</note> notwithstanding he had thus wisely play'd his
game, and that he was certain to receive very great assistance from
his Confederates, did nevertheless very well understand, that as
he was nearest to the approaching danger, so it would be very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for him to put himself soonest into a posture of defense,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:63412:163"/>
that the <hi>Mareschal</hi> might not surprize him. His thoughts therefore
were fully intent upon the resolution of Arms; but he wanted not
only a cause, but even a pretense to colour his preparation; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which only to go about it, was to make himself Criminal in
the highest degree: neither (the Court Minion being absolutely
his enemy) could he reasonably hope, either for a Commission
from thence for the raising of men in the King's name, and at his
expense; or so much as to be permitted to do it at his own charge.
In this strait and anxiety, what course to take, the <hi>Rochellers</hi> gave
him as fair a pretense, as he could possibly desire, to do that under
the vail of Duty, and Obligation, which he could not otherwise
have undertaken,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense for the taking of Arms.</note> without incurring the highest censure. They
had at this time surpriz'd a little Castle, near to their City, and
situate upon the Sea-coast, call'd <hi>Rochefort;</hi> an enterprize con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
by all the world for the most sensless, and unadvis'd, that
could possibly have been undertaken, to begin a War by an action
of so little importance, in a time when themselves, and their
whole party were priviledg'd by so absolute, and inviolate a Peace.
The Duke, who had been at so great a loss before, and that could
not then have wish'd for a more specious pretense, it may easily
be imagin'd was very ready to lay hold of this occasion now;
neither did he fail herein to aggravate the misdemeanour to the
height: but repeating all the Accusations he had formerly preferr'd
against the Ambition, and Infidelity of those of the Reformed
Religion, and particularly against those of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> he of them
drew up a kind of <hi>Manifesto,</hi> which he caus'd to be publish'd in
all parts of the Kingdom. <q>In this Declaration he forgot not to
reckon up the several insurrections those of that Faction had
broke into, to make their advantage of every disorder, had at
any time hapned in the Kingdom, notwithstanding all satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
had been given them by the inviolate observation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Edicts granted in their favour: That they had been observ'd
for many years to call together Assemblies in <hi>Rochelle,</hi> without
either his Majesties Order, or Royal Assent; from which such
unjust and unreasonable Propositions, and demands were usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
sent to the King, as made it appear they did not Treat with
his Majesty in the quality of Subjects, but like Free-States that
were nothing ally'd to his Sovereign Power: That by such a
behaviour it was plain enough, the City was arriv'd to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
degree of Licence, and that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> could never satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their Ambition, till they had introduc'd a popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongst them: That if hitherto his Majesties Council
had (contrary to his Judgment, and Advice) wink'd at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:63412:164"/>
of so dangerous a design; that nevertheless he, to whom
the Government of their City was entrusted, and who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was more concern'd, than any other to keep such in their
obedience, as were committed to his care, was resolv'd to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
their insolence; which he nothing doubted, but by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of his own friends he should be able to do, and to make
them know they had hitherto been only strong in the weakness
of our own Counsels.</q> This had in truth ever been his saying,
and the effects made it appear he had made a right judgment; so
that under this pretense he took Arms; which, as it was colour'd
by a design that immediately pointed at his Majesties Service, so
did he not scruple to make use of the King's mony in the Levies
he made upon this occasion.</p>
                  <p>With these summes, though very small, and some mony of his
own, he rais'd four Regiments of Foot, consisting of above four
thousand five hundred men, and betwixt five and six hundred
Horse; to which were added sixscore Guards on Horseback in his
own Livery: a force, which though not very considerable for
their number, were yet such as he conceiv'd sufficient to keep the
Field against any he had a mind to offend.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rochellers</hi> (who formerly had by many injuries highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
the Duke) no sooner saw him resolv'd, and ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
in a posture of War, even to the Gates of their City, but
they began now to examine their Forces, which they had not so
well consider'd before the danger, and which the more they exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
the weaker they found them to be: This City the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of a powerful Faction, and that had so often disputed the
King's Authority, enrich'd by an extraordinary Traffick, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated
with all the Protestant Princes of Europe, finding it self
in so weak a condition, that it could not in this necessity muster
2000. men, to sally out of their Walls; utterly without Horse, or
the least assistance from any of their Confederates and Friends:
So that converting their usual Rhodomantades, and Menaces
into the most submiss terms of Humble Supplication, addressing
themselves by their Deputies to the King, they humbly, and with
all importunity besought his Majesty to interpose his Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
betwixt the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> and them, that he might not
commence a War against them.</p>
                  <p>Had the <hi>Rochellers</hi> made this confession of their weakness at
another time, it would doubtless have very well pleas'd the
Council; and 'tis likely the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> would have been
countenanc'd in his design, to the end that City might have been
made to know, what they were one day to apprehend from their
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:63412:164"/>
Prince's indignation: but the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre</hi> unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
that his Capital Enemy should be in Arms, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a posture fit to frustrate the design he had long projected of
his ruine, made the Council resolve to dispatch away <hi>Boissize,</hi> one
of the Council of State, to the Duke with a positive command
to lay down his Arms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boissize</hi> at his arrival found the Duke with his Forces, quarter'd
at <hi>Surgeres,</hi> but four Leagues only distant from <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and ready
to march up to the City; neither did he fail with all the Rhetorick
he had to disswade him from that resolution: <q>Representing to
him the danger of what he was about, lest the noise of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
in hand should alarm the whole <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party, whom
the King would by no means should be provok'd; and in
which case, of a particular Quarrel, he would be the cause of
a general War.</q> With which commands from the King, and
Queen, he moreover mix'd menaces of their highest indignation,
should he disobey; with many promises on the contrary of all
satisfaction from the Court, and the <hi>Rochellers</hi> if he would desist;
all which, wanting force to divert him from his purpose, the Duke
gave order in the presence of <hi>Boissize</hi> to sound to Horse, and net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
to the last degree, at the difficulties he saw strew'd in the way
of his designs, march'd directly towards <hi>Rochelle. Boissize</hi> seeing
his endeavours altogether ineffectual, and that the Duke was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
in his first determination, after having highly protested
against his proceeding, went, and put himself into the Town, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Inhabitants thereby to understand, that their Majesties
had no hand in the Duke's Enterprize, that it was absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their order, and that therefore they were at full liberty to
arm themselves for their own defense. But this consent, though
it warranted their Arms, gave them nevertheless no other power,
so that they were to suffer whatever the Duke was pleas'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
upon them: He quarter'd his men in their best Farms,
made his approaches up to the very Gates of their City, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
some who (under the protection of their Counterscape) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to oppose him; till in the end, after having maintain'd
his Army, for almost a month, at their charge, and that his fury
was a little abated by that little revenge he had taken in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
he had put them to, he grew more flexible to a new
Order he receiv'd from Court, and was at last content to let them
alone.</p>
                  <p>It was by <hi>Vignoles,</hi> that the Duke receiv'd this last Command,
a man for many years, well known, and highly esteem'd by him,
which rendred the Duke more flexible to a Treaty with him, than
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:63412:165"/>
the other; from whose mouth having receiv'd his Majesties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
he made answer; <q>That having now made a discovery to
the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Rochellers</hi> weakness, the dis-union
of their Faction, and with how much ease they were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
when ever his Majesty should think fit, he was content
to let them rest in peace: but that, if the King had pleas'd, he
might at this time have punish'd their insolence, as it was in his
power easie to do, he could without much trouble have done his
Majesty a very important Service; but he saw (to his great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction)
his Enemies, who were prevalent with his Majesty,
envy'd him the honour of this Action; but that he must how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
give place to their malice in obedience to his Royal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
though in a thing very prejudicial to his Majesties own
peculiar Interest: That therefore he would retire so soon as the
<hi>Rochellers</hi> should surrender the Castle of <hi>Rochefort</hi> into his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
hands and; that after that act of their Obedience, having no
other particular concern, he had nothing more to desire of his
Majesty for his own private satisfaction, than that his Majesty
would please to assert, and avow what he had only undertaken
for his Service in the past occasion.</q> Which being accordingly in
another dispatch brought him by <hi>Vignoles,</hi> and all those who had
assisted, and serv'd him in this occasion compriz'd, he rose from
before <hi>Rochelle;</hi> dismissing his Army nevertheless in such sort
that most of the Commanders (most of them having relation to
him) might be ready upon the least warning to re-unite in the
same equipage as before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What the Duke had express'd to</hi> Vignoles <hi>of his discontents by
word of mouth, did not nevertheless save him the labour of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Court in such a style, as manifested he still retain'd the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
liberty his great spirit had ever suggested to him, during the
Reigns of his two former Masters. He therefore sent a Letter to
the King, in the beginning whereof having excus'd himself in
that he had not paid so prompt an Obedience to their Majesties
first Orders, deliver'd by</hi> Boissize, <hi>and given reasons for it, that
directly pointed at the Honour of the King himself, which as he
said he conceiv'd to be very much concern'd in the business of</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle,
<hi>he continued in these words:</hi>

                           <p>I have hitherto, Sir, preserv'd
my Hands clean, my Conscience uncorrupt, my Reputation entire, and
my Fidelity without reproach; I have never conspir'd but to do you
Service, neither do I find my self guilty of the least thought disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Duty I owe to your Majesty, and your Crown: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I am not us'd with that Equity, nor rewarded with that Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
that (without presumption) I conceive I have deserv'd, and that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:63412:165"/>
every day I find something attempted upon my Offices, by the diminution,
and cutting off their just, and lawful priviledges (which were ever
preserv'd inviolate to me during the Reign of the late King your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
yet nothing, Sir, can prevail with me above my Duty: neither is
there any so ill usage, nor so sensible unkindness, that can hinder me
from persevering to do well, being resolv'd to the last hour of my life to
conquer whatever just resentments I may have, and to forget all those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
for which I can obtain no satisfaction, but at the publick
expense. A resolution, Sir, in which I am infinitely fortified, by the
firm belief I have, that all the disgraces I receive, and all the foul play
is continually practis'd against me, proceed from no dis-affection your
Majesty has conceiv'd against my person. I know, Sir, that being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
quick sighted, to distinguish betwixt your false Servants and your
true, you have ever honour'd me with your favour: But I have this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to those who are enemies to your Crown, that they have, upon all
occasions discover'd themselves to be particularly so to me; and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
by their artifice, to represent things otherwise to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
than they really are, to restrain the liberty of your own Royal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
from obeying the natural inclination you have to love, and
cherish good men; that as much as in them lies, they may alienate your
Majesties good opinion from such, as by their long and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
have deserv'd the best room in your heart. I hope, Sir, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
that truth will one day prevail in your Royal Breast over those lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Arts, and that your Majesty will then be pleas'd to distinguish your
true and faithful Servants from such, as Authorized by your Name
and presence, oppress your People, invade your own Authority, and
continually disturb your Majesties Peace by their inordinate and unruly
Ambition.</p>

                  <p>I have the rather inserted the express words of this Letter, that
you may see after what manner the Duke took his disgrace, and
how he behav'd himself towards his Enemies, notwithstanding
they carried the whole favour, and sway of the Court: the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rescbal
d'Encre</hi> being manifestly pointed at in this dispatch. We
have since liv'd in a time, when to speak our discontents so plain,
and loud, would perhaps have been out of season: but in that
wherein the Duke writ this Letter, men were at least permitted to
complain; and oftentimes those complaints procur'd a relief, to
such, as like the Duke, had the spirit, and power to accompany
those complaints, with the effects of a vigorous resentment.</p>

now discover'd the weakness of these by the dis-union of all the

to unite for their common defense, one party might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in one Province, before any of the rest could put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

in the sequel prov'd true) made the Council the bolder by their

Council did not conceive it very just, but they look'd upon it as
a thing so highly important to the peace of the Kingdom, that
they durst never till now give them that satisfaction. But the

than death, had he fall'n into the <hi>Mareschal's</hi> power. <hi>Guron,</hi> who
was likewise another of the proscrib'd, with many others, came
to seek the same refuge; all whom the Duke made no difficulty to
receive into his protection.</p>
                  <p>The Duke having (as has been said) settled the Friends he had
in his Governments in such a readiness, as upon any occasion to
make head against his Enemy, took a Journey into <hi>Guienne,</hi> his
native Country, in that great Province to get together what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Friends and Souldiers he could, for the better defense of
his Fortune; in which Voyage he increas'd his Forces to such
a degree, that being all joyn'd together, they were able to make
up a Body of 8000. Foot, and 1200. Horse. The extremity he
knew the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> to be reduc'd unto in <hi>Soissons,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> in the places whereunto he had retyr'd, made him
very well see, that the Torrent would suddenly break in upon
himself: notwithstanding how reasonable soever his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
were, and how necessary soever to put himself with the
soonest into a posture of defense, it might be, he could not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
forbear to prefer the last Duty he ow'd to a good, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hus
Mother, before his own particular preseruation. This Lady
having been dead from the year 1610. in an exceeding old age,
and lamented by the Duke, as if she had been more immaturely
ravish'd from him, he had ever had a great desire to pay her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
the last office of her Obsequies: But the great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Affairs, which had detain'd him at Court having hitherto
frustrated that pious design, he no sooner now found himself in
this little interval of repose,<note place="margin">The Du makes a great Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for his Mother.</note> but that he resolv'd without further
delay to satisfie that Obligation: Assembling therefore together
at his paternal House of <hi>Caumont</hi> above 300. Gentlemen of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his Relations and Friends, he there by a magnificent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense,
manifested his gratitude to a person so near and dear unto
him.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremony of this Funeral was no sooner perform'd, but
that the Duke departed from <hi>Caumont</hi> to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and from
thence was also upon the point to return into <hi>Angoumois,</hi> there to
draw all his Forces together, with a resolution to defend himself
to the last, and rather to die with his Sword in his hand, than to
suffer himself tamely to be oppress'd; when by <hi>le Chalart,</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to the <hi>Mareschal de Roquelaure,</hi> his intimate friend, he receiv'd
intelligence of the death of the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre.</hi>

it was to a man who saw himself deliver'd from so powerful
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:63412:167"/>
and so implacable an Enemy may easily be imagin'd. He had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well foreseen, that with the assistance of all his Confederates
and friends, he could not long be able to resist the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the King; with both which his enemy would have
been arm'd against him: and on the other side, the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being by this execution become, as it were, the revenger of
his particular wrongs, all his past actions would be justified in
the exemplary punishment his Majesty had inflicted upon the
person of <hi>Conchini.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this excess of joy he departed from <hi>Bordeaux</hi> to <hi>Angoulesme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> goes to Court.</note>
and from thence soon after to Court, there to make a new tender
of his Fidelity and Obedience to the King, and to try in this new
face of Affairs, what foundation he could lay to his own future
peace. He was in this Journey attended by his two younger Sons,
(his own misfortune, and miscarriages having banish'd the eldest
from his favour, and presence, ever since his Majesties Voyage to
<hi>Angoulesme</hi>) and at his arrival receiv'd by the King with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of favour and affection, he could possibly expect, or
desire: to which <hi>Luines</hi> the new Favourite (willing to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in his rising greatness by so powerful a friend) highly
sought, and importun'd his friendship, which also by some good
Offices he endeavour'd to acquire. One of the things the Duke
was most earnest with him for, and that <hi>Luines</hi> did most faithfully
promise was a Cardinal's Hat for the Archbishop of <hi>Tholouse</hi> his
youngest Son, at the first promotion: as for himself he was at the
very first restor'd to the full, and absolute Function of all his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
having satisfaction given for all the retrenchments had
been made upon his offices, and commands, or any of their perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits
and rights, and in fine stood in a very good degree of favour.</p>
                  <p>Yet did not this continue long, and whether it were the too
prodigious favour of <hi>Luines,</hi> (grown up on a sudden to a greater
height, than that of the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre</hi> had ever been) that stir'd
up the Duke's old aversion he had ever had for Court Mignions;
or that his own private emulators, by their ill Offices had render'd
his humour suspected to <hi>Luines:</hi> but the Duke soon perceiv'd
him to be quite another man from what he had been at first: At
which causless alteration, being highly nettled, and preferring
(according to his custom) a free, and profess'd enmity, before a
faint, and dissembled friendship, he inveigh'd publickly, and
highly against the new Favourite; by which means, and by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
with other persons of condition, no better satisfied than
himself with <hi>Luine</hi>'s promotion, he drew upon himself alone the
hatred, and jealousie that ought to have been common to them
all.</p>

The first thing the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> did to disoblige him,<note place="margin">Anno 1618.</note> was

openly assisted him in the pursuit of that dignity: To which was
added, that they began afresh to intrench upon his command of
Colonel, some Foot employments having been dispos'd without
the Duke's consent; by which being further exasperated, he highly
complain'd to some of the chief Ministers: amongst whom
<hi>Mounsieur du Vair</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Or Lord Keeper.</note> 
                     <hi>Garde des Sceaux,</hi> one of the greatest Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
having given him no satisfaction, but on the contrary new
matter of discontent, he was not long before he took an occasion
to let him see how sensible he was of the offense.</p>
                  <p>It was upon Easter-day in the year 1618. and in the Church of
St. <hi>Germain de l' Auxerrois,</hi> that the Duke took occasion to quarrel
with him. The Dukes and Peers who were then at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Court offended
at the place the <hi>Garde des Sceaux du Vair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> not only in the Council,
but also in all other both publick and private Assemblies, would
assume above them, had generally address'd themselves to the
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> as to the eldest of their Order, to interest him
in their discontent. It was also suspected that the Chancellor <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,</hi>
(ill digesting that a man so inferiour to him in Dignity,
should usurp upon him in State) was willing enough to promote
a business of this nature against him; and that being upon very
good terms (as he had ever been) with the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> he
had also help'd to blow the fire. However it was, or by whose
suggestion soever it first came into the Dukes head, little perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
would serve turn to make him passionately undertake a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
wherein he conceiv'd his own Honour and Dignity to be so
much concern'd. It was therefore resolv'd betwixt the Duke of
<hi>Moutmorency</hi> (of all others the most incens'd against <hi>du Vair</hi>) the
Dukes <hi>de Monbazon, de Retz, d' Vsez</hi> and some others of the
same quality, that he should be affronted upon the first occasion,
should he again offer to take place above them. Wherein though
it was a business of danger enough, to affront a Minister so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
by the favour of his Prince, and so violent in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> nevertheless made no difficulty to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it; not having (it should seem) consented to the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
with an intent to leave the execution of it to any other,
than himself. Upon Easter day therefore (as has been said) the
King and all the Court being in Ceremony at <hi>Saint Germain de
l' Auxerrois,</hi> and the <hi>Garde des Sceaux</hi> having, according to his
custom, taken his place above all the Dukes and Peers, the Duke
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:63412:168"/>
of <hi>Espernon</hi> violently pull'd him from his seat, and compell'd
him to retire. It may easily be suppos'd an action of this kind
could not pass without some untoward language; neither were
those words thrown away upon a man insensible of offense;
the <hi>Garde des Sceaux</hi> going immediately out of the Church, and
expecting with great impatience the end of the Ceremony, that
he might complain to the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> of the affront he had
receiv'd: Wherein nevertheless he did not reflect upon what had
pass'd, as an injury meerly respecting his own person, <q>But as a
Party, and a Faction form'd, and made in the Court, by the
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who had seduc'd all the Dukes and Peers
under the colour of an imaginary pretense, to interest them in
his own private discontents: That this ambitious spirit so long
inur'd to Government, and Command, thought himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of his lawful possession, if remov'd from the absolute
sway of the most important Affairs: That it was through the
sides of a <hi>Garde des Sceaux,</hi> that the fortune of the Favourite
was levell'd at; and that it was only a tryal, by attempting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his creatures, what opposition they were to expect when
they should immediately fall upon his own person: That it
therefore highly imported him, whilst he had power to do it,
betimes to secure an enemy, that would not spare him, if he
once got him into his hands.</q> An advice that made so much the
deeper impression upon the Duke <hi>de Luines,</hi> by how much he was
before well enough satisfied of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s hatred so
highly manifested, by what he had publickly declar'd against
him. He therefore went immediately with the <hi>Garde des Sceaux</hi> to
the King; where being come, he insisted not much upon the
scuffle betwixt the Duke and <hi>du Vair,</hi> endeavouring on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
all he could to disguise that action from looking like a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Quarrel; but qualified it with the name of the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
and audacious practice that could possibly be introduc'd
into a State, that a Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> in the face, and presence,
and in defiance of his King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should dare to make a combination
with persons of the greatest quality in the Kingdom, to affront
the Royal Authority.</p>
                  <p>The King was so highly incens'd at a Remonstrance preferr'd
to him by two persons in whom he had so entire a confidence,
that immediately, and without reserving to himself so much as
the liberty to consider the interest he himself particularly had in
the Duke of <hi>Espernons</hi> ruine, or to call to memory the long and
faithful Services he had paid to the Crown, he in this case abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

he presently put himself upon his preparation, to make his
best use of that advice. This caution therefore being sent him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the sixth of <hi>May</hi> at night, and the surprizal being design'd
the night following, he had so little time to lose, that he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
dispers'd Tickets to all his most assured Friends, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to be in a readiness by break of day to mount to Horse;
according to which appointment, he found above 300<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ready at

his House of <hi>Fontenay</hi> in <hi>Brie</hi> (where they conceiv'd him lodg'd

                  <p>This retirement of the Duke's being but ten little Leagues
from <hi>Paris</hi> was so far from frustrating the design of his surprize,
that on the contrary it made the bufiness seem more likely to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed:
the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> therefore having consider'd, that in
this solitude he would have far fewer friends about him, than in
<hi>Paris,</hi> the former order was only one day deferr'd, and the <hi>Swisse</hi>
commanded to march away the day following, being the 8. of
<hi>May,</hi> together with some Brigades of Cuirassiers, and Light-Horse
to invest <hi>Fontenay.</hi> But the same persons who had given the
Duke the first intelligence, being no less vigilant ot his preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
now than before, gave him also as seasonable notice of this,
as of the other design; giving him to understand that his danger
was not yet over, and that it concern'd him with all diligence to
convey his person into some place of greater safety: Which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
having made the Duke resolve to get again to Horse, so soon
as all the Family had sup'd, and that every one thought of retiring
to his rest, he (having in the mean time with great secresie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
all things necessary for a tedious journy) commanded his
Trumpets to sound to Horse; his necessity enforcing him so to do
at that unseasonable hour, (though he was certain to undergo all
the inconveniencies of a very dark,<note place="margin">The Duke takes his way towards <hi>Metz.</hi>

                  <p>By break of day the Duke, and all his company, arriv'd at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanne</hi>
in <hi>Brie,</hi> where both himself, and the Horse that were with
him, were so weary, the rain, the dirt, and all other incommodities
of an ill journy having equally toil'd out, and dejected horse and
man, that he had a great desire, and very great need there to stay,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:63412:169"/>
and take some repose; though his Servants, conceiving him to be
yet in danger, were so importunate with him, that they got him
to mount again, making him to continue on horseback all that
day, and the night following; when arriving the next day at
<hi>Montmirel,</hi> he found himself so weary, and spent, with riding, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the indisposition of Age, which now began to grow
upon him, that he was ready to faint; but being laid upon a bed,
and refresh'd by sleep, he soon found himself well enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in his journy, though with nothing so much precipitation as
before.</p>
                  <p>Through so many traverses and difficulties it was, that the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> waded to the foundation of the most glorious
Act of his life, and which, in my opinion, ought to be plac'd on
the highest Pyramis of his Fame; I mean the Queen Mothers

                  </p>
                  <p>And then it was that the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> highly, and openly
declar'd himself an enemy to the Duke, giving his friends plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to understand, he could in no wise repute them to be his, if they
did not totally abandon the Duke's interest; offering them at the
same time his favour and protection, if they would do it, and
thundering out great threats against such as would not embrace
his Quarrel: wherein the constancy of the Duke's friends is
highly to be commended; who notwithstanding the greatness of
the Favourite they had to deal withal, the great promises where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he endeavour'd to allure them, and the implacable hatred he
publickly profess'd against their Friend, and Master, would scarce
any one of them be debauch'd from the fidelity they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd;
whereas some on the contrary were so generous as to carry
him intelligence of <hi>Luines</hi> his proceeding so far as <hi>Metz,</hi> and of
the offers he had made to withdraw them from the Service, and
Friendship they had promis'd, and sworn unto him.</p>
                  <p>The Duke very well judging by what had pass'd at Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his departure thence, and by the continuation of those pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
since, that his enemies intended to give the last blow to his
ruine, began anew to consider of the means to defend himself. He
was very confident they would never offer to attempt any thing
against him by open force in <hi>Metz,</hi> neither would they be easily
induc'd to provoke him to the utmost extreme, the consequence
being of two dangerous importance: but doubted wisely withal,
that no artifice would be spar'd, nor no covert practice unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against him which were by so much the more dangerous, by
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:63412:170"/>
how much a man is oftentimes surpriz'd with the effect, before
he is aware of the cause. There were in the City divers ill affected
and seditious persons, whom he could never disgust, and whom
<hi>Luines</hi> fail'd not to deal withal to put in for a Party in <hi>Metz,</hi>
who being in themselves of too little authority for any thing of
that kind, their malice converted to Spies upon the Duke's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to send continual intelligence to Court, whether false, or
true, and by their Artifice possess'd the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
and fears, about things that were altogether uncertain,
and vain. To make therefore a better discovery of the truth, and
to the end he might penetrate with more certainty into the Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s intentions, <hi>Favier</hi> a Counsellor of State, and a man of
great sagacity in Affairs, was sent away under the shadow of a
Commission, to reside sometime in <hi>Metz,</hi> and to try if by his
dexterity he could better guess at the Duke's designs; though all
those endeavours were equally fruitless to the Favourite, who had
to do with a man not easie to be pry'd into, nor surpriz'd.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Favier</hi>'s return to Court, there hapned so pleasant a
thing at <hi>Metz,</hi> as I hope, though mix'd amongst more serious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
will not much importune my Reader, and that was this:
The Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> continually expressing a great desire to have
constant intelligence of what was done at <hi>Metz,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A pleasant Story.</note> and few being
willing to undertake a thing the Duke's severe humour made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
so full of difficulty, and danger, one fellow, a Courtier, and
who thought by such an undertaking to advance himself highly
into favour, made a voluntary, and brisk tender of himself for
that employment, offering publickly to go to <hi>Metz,</hi> and there to
serve (as he said) <hi>Mounsieur de Luines,</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon:</hi>
Which generous offer of his was as kindly receiv'd, and
as readily accepted; so that with good store of Crowns in his
pocket to defray his journy, he was presently dispatch'd away upon
that design; yet not so soon, but that before his departure from
<hi>Paris,</hi> the Duke had notice of what a <hi>Mounsieur</hi> was coming to
brave him in his own Government. In a few days my Gentleman
arrives at the Gates of <hi>Metz,</hi> where at his first coming he was
made to undergo all the severities usually observ'd in Frontier
Towns; they made him dance attendance a good while at the
Gate, where after having been sufficiently abus'd, hiss'd, and
hooted at, he was by four Souldiers of the Garrison conducted to
his Inn, who (it may be imagin'd) were not commanded to use
him with overmuch respect. But if this first part of his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
surpriz'd him, he was much more, when his Host coming
to him at night, demanded his Name, Surname, Country, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:63412:170"/>
and Age, with many other interrogatories, as if he had been
upon the<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Selette,</hi> that for which we have no word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no such thing; it signifying a low stool, on which Criminals in <hi>France</hi> are plac'd to be examin'd.</note> 
                     <hi>Selette.</hi> From all, or most of these questions, he for
some time defended himself, till being threatned if he would not
answer, to be proceeded against as a Spy, he was at last constrain'd
to do it; when as his answers came from him, he saw them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in a great Book (order'd for that purpose amongst other
ancient rules establish'd for the defense of the place) though he
conceiv'd that under the protection of the Royal Name, which
he had ready to produce, he ought to have been dispens'd from
that Ceremony. He was scarce recover'd from his first astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when he saw four of the Duke's Guards (at that time call'd
<hi>les Simons,</hi> a name very famous at Court) entring his Chamber.
Their first Complements (it may be suppos'd) were none of the
most obliging: neither did they long forbear to tell the new come
Gallant, <q>That they were order'd by the Duke their Master, to
have an eye upon his actions: That the Duke very well knew
upon what pretense he came to <hi>Metz,</hi> but that the true cause
of his coming was to him much better known, which was to
do a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ervice to the King, to observe the weaknesses of the
place, and to give intelligence thereof to his Majesties enemies:
That therefore they were not to leave him, and that they very
well knew how to prevent him from executing his malicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs:
That in the mean time it would concern him to have a
care how he behav'd himself, since no mercy was to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
if the least thing was discover'd in him contrary to his
Majesties Service.</q> At this declaration the poor man was put into
a most terrible fear, he knew the Dukes Authority to be absolute
in <hi>Metz,</hi> and that whatever he should determine, though it should
reach to his life, and under what pretense soever it might be,
would infallibly be executed upon him: Whereupon he ask'd his
Guards if there were no possibility of safety for him? to which
they reply'd, that doubtless yes, provided he attempted nothing
against the Crown. After which they entertain'd him with stories
of how many they had Bastinado'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> and after what
manner the Duke us'd to chastise several fool-hardy fellows, who
had imprudently attempted upon his Honour. If he went out of
one Chamber into another, they were continually at his heels,
and if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e went to sleep, they lay down by him; never ceasing day
nor night to afflict him: insomuch that after having two days
endur'd this usage, such a terror seiz'd him at last, that he fell down
at his Guards feet; weeping, praying, and conjuring them to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the Duke that he was his most humble Servant, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
his fault, begg'd his pardon, and did humbly intreat
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:63412:171"/>
he would give him leave to depart the City. At which, though
his Guards seem'd to comfort and assure him, advising him not
to fear, and protesting that the interest of his Majesties Service
only excepted, they were there to no other end, than to do him
Service: yet were all their consolations vain, so invincible a fear
had possess'd him, and so wholly was he taken up with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to escape from the danger, whereinto he saw he had so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitously
engag'd himself. The Duke, after he had a few days
made himself merry with mortifying his Gull, let him at last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part;
who, as he had been before at <hi>Metz,</hi> became afterwards the
Fable of the Court.</p>
                  <p>Yet did not the Duke spend his time altogether in diversion,
having serious business enough to take up his thoughts with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of more concern, and those were the Affairs of the Queen
Mother. This Princess after the death of the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre;</hi>
having been constrain'd to leave the Court (where <hi>Luines</hi> could
not suffer a person of her Authority, and offended to the degree
she had been, to reside) had the Castle of <hi>Blois</hi> appointed by the
King for her retreat. To which place accordingly the Queen, (in
this change of her Fortune, being allow'd to keep very few of her
Servants about her) departed with a very slender Train. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Luçon</hi> since Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi>) who had been Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of State during the favour of the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre,</hi> was one
of those who follow'd her in her disgrace, as <hi>Chanteloube</hi> also was
another: but the Abbot <hi>Rucellary</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> and very affectionate
to her Service, was, as a person altogether unnecessary about her
Majesty, sent back into one of his Abbies: neither did the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Luçon</hi> remain long without another Order of the same
kind, by which he was first oblig'd to reside in his own Diocess,
and soon after to retire into <hi>Avignon.</hi>

                  <p>The Queen Mother,<note place="margin">The Queen Mother at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to recover her liberty.</note> from the time of her departure from

and Conduct about her: and though they had taken some

effecting her Designs: Neither were they permitted long to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of the means, the entire confidence the Queen was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to repose in them, being suspected at Court, having soon
procur'd the banishment of the two first (as has been said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
of which that of <hi>Luçon</hi> had rendred him utterly uncapable
of all manner of correspondence with her: But <hi>Rucellay</hi> a man
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:63412:171"/>
of great courage, vivacity, and ambition, having for some time
conceal'd himself about <hi>Blois,</hi> and having from time to time in
disguise taken opportunity to consult with the Queen, was (after
having rejected several propositions) at last of opinion, that she
should address her self to the Duke of <hi>Boüillon,</hi> to try, if with the
party of those of the Religion, who were absolutely at his dispose,
he might be induc'd to declare himself of her side, and to attempt
something in her favour.</p>

                     </gap>
as to the qualities of his person, and the circumstances of that
Treaty, which perhaps will not be altogether unpleasant to my
Reader. <hi>Rucellay</hi> then was a Gentleman of <hi>Florence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellay.</hi>
                     </note> descended

with <hi>Za<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>et, Bandiny, Cenamy,</hi> and some other active men of that
Nation (who in those times play'd their game so wisely, as to
keep in with all parties of the Kingdom) had made himself a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in <hi>France.</hi> Amongst other advantages he had there made to
himself, he had got the possession of several Abbeys, arising in
all to a Revenue of above ten thousand Crowns a year; amongst
which that of <hi>Signy</hi> in <hi>Champaigne</hi> not far from <hi>Sedan</hi> was most
considerable. His eldest Son (which was he of whom I am now
speaking) as most eldest Sons of the best Families of <hi>Itlay</hi> (that
education making them capable of the greatest Dignities of the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi>) was bred up to the Church: neither had he been
wanting in his industry to acquire all those qualities that were
most likely to recommend him to the highest Preferment. He
had studied much, and particularly been diligent to learn to speak,
and write accurately in his own Language; wherein he succeeded
so well, that his own fine parts, together with the plentiful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
he was Master of (he having no less in Secular Revenue, than
in Spiritual Entertainment) procur'd him so great a Reputation in
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he there obtain'd the Office of<note n="*" place="margin">

of the Chamber. Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, under whose Papacy he
was there admitted, look'd upon him with a very gracious eye,
and though a young man, intrusted his discretion with many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of State, not seldom making use of his Pen in Affairs of
greatest importance; and often saying, by way of favour, that he
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:63412:172"/>
discover'd something in him of <hi>Signior de la Casa</hi> his great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
All which favours having possess'd the Cardinal-Nephews
with a great jealousie towards <hi>Rucellay</hi> (as himself said) or he
perhaps having fail'd on his part, in a fit complacency to oblige
them, he was by them persecuted to that degree, that he was
forc'd to quit the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to retire into <hi>France.</hi>
A good part of his Estate lay in that Country, the <hi>Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
d' Encre</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> as he was, commanded all there, and
those of his own Nation having ever been well receiv'd in that
Kingdom, it appear'd he could not make choice of a safer, nor
a more honourable retreat. He was thirty years of age, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
when he arriv'd in <hi>France,</hi> where he was at first very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiv'd by the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre,</hi> and soon after in great esteem
with the whole Court, where with twenty thousand Crowns a
year, that he had coming in, he liv'd in so extraordinary a degree
of splendor, as equall'd, if not out-went the greatest Nobility of
the Kingdom: no Table was so neatly serv'd, nor so plentifully
furnish'd, as his; no man more nobly, nor more handsomly
attended than he; to which the presents he continually made of
all the Curiosities wherewith <hi>Italy</hi> so abounds, as by her overflow
to oblige all other Nations, were so many, and so considerable,
as that single way of expense seem'd alone to exceed his Revenue.
Neither did he win less upon the Ladies by his liberalities, and
extraordinary fine fashion, than he did upon the men by his
more considerable qualities; insomuch that he obtain'd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and applause of all. And although the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre</hi>
had not as yet fix'd him in any settled employment in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Affairs, yet was he with him in so eminent a degree of
favour, as was a fair step (in the height the Court Favourite then
stood) to the greatest Offices of the Kingdom. The death of the
<hi>Mareschal</hi> therefore, as it had put a period to all <hi>Rucellay</hi>'s future
hopes, so did it possess him with such a grief, as was not to be
comforted, but by the last effects of an implacable animosity he
had conceiv'd against those who had been the instruments of his
ruine: And this spirit of Revenge it was that prompted him to
be one of those who animated the Queen against the new Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites;
though such Counsels were not necessary to her, who of
her self was sensible enough; the particular injuries she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
having already incens'd her to such a height, that she was
very easily dispos'd to employ him in a Treaty with the Duke <hi>de
Boüillon,</hi> on her behalf. In this Journy <hi>Rucellay</hi> was to undergo
much trouble, and very great danger, he never daring to Travel,
but by night, and in disguise for the most part alone, and always
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:63412:172"/>
without any Equipage; for how circumspect soever he had been in
his intelligencies to the Queen, he could not however send them
in so secret a manner, but that, she being continually, and narrowly
watch'd on all sides by spies set over her by <hi>Luines</hi> to that purpose,
some of his practices had been discover'd: insomuch that I have
heard him say, he had notice given him, that several of his Pictures
were sent to the Magistrates, and other inferiour Officers, that they
might know, and apprehend him in any of their respective Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.
Yet could not all these difficulties fright him from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
this Negotiation, and if he had before given several te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of his wit, and bravery upon other occasions, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
no less in this of the constancy of his Courage, his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Fidelity, which were very eminent, and of great use
in the conduct of this Affair. The main thing he apprehended in
this undertaking was the infirmity of his own tender, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
constitution; who whilst he had liv'd in the calms of peace,
the delights of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the effeminacies of the Courts of <hi>France,</hi>
had ever been so impatient of the Sun, and Evenings Dew, Heat,
and Cold, that the least intemperance of the Air would usually
cause strange alterations in his health; which notwithstanding
he was no sooner in Action, but that he found those little incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
left behind, as if he had had no leisure to be sick.</p>
                  <p>Whether it were that the Favourites only guess'd at the Queen
Mothers discontents, by the offense they had given her, or that
they had some more certain knowledge thereof, than meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
they were however very vigilant to frustrate her Designs:
To which purpose soon after her Majesties arrival at <hi>Blois,</hi> and the
Banishment of the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> they had sent to her <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Roissy,</hi> under colour of a Council for the management of
her Affairs. A man that in truth at another season would have
been acceptable enough: but in this juncture of time, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to her by her enemies, could not but stand highly suspected
to her. Neither had he without great reluctancy taken upon him
an employment of that nature; the principal end of his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
being, as it was, to discover the Queens practices and designs;
though neither his unwillingness could excuse him from going,
nor all his art and observation hinder the Queen from conferring
sometimes in private with those of her Servants in whose fidelity
she repos'd the greatest trust, when he was there. Of which <hi>Luines</hi>
being advertis'd, and willing not only to give himself some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
repose, but also to live in greater security for the time to come,
he resolv'd to take Religion into his assistance, and by a principle
of conscience to engage the Queen in an absolute dependance on
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63412:173"/>
his Majesties good will, and pleasure. To this end therefore he
would exact from her an Oath in the presence of God, and his
Holy Angels (the very words of the Declaration she was to
make) <q>That she neither now had,<note place="margin">The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary precaution of the Duke <hi>de Luines,</hi> to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sure of the Queen Mother, fruitless.</note> nor for the time to come
would entertain other thought, and desire than what should
tend to the prosperity, and advancement of the King's Majestie's
affairs: That she would, so long as she had life, pay all the Duty
and Obedience to his Majesty due, as to her Sovereign Lord,
and absolutely resign her Will into his Royal power: That she
would have no correspondence neither within, nor without the
Kingdom in any thing whatsoever to the prejudice of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
his Crown, and Dignity; but did, and would disown all
persons of what quality, or condition soever, that in her name
should contrive any practice, or conspiracy, contrary to his
Majesties pleasure: That she would moreover discover all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
and Addresses inconsistent with his Service, together
with the persons themselves so addressing, and proposing,
should any be so inconsiderate, as to offer any such thing; and
impeach, and make known whoever should be so evilly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
and that she would never desire to return to Court, till
the King should be pleas'd to order her so to do.</q> Which prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
was accordingly made betwixt the hands of Father <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noux</hi>
a Jesuit Confessor in ordinary to the King, who had been
expresly dispatch'd to the Queen to receive it. Wherein we may
discover the short-sightedness of humane Wisdom; when this
great Minister, thinking by this expedient to settle himself in the
security he so much desir'd, engag'd himself (even by his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution)
in new, and greater difficulties than before. For as on
the one side <hi>Luines</hi> thought, that, through the perswasions of the
King's Confessor, he had captivated the Queen under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of Religion, she on the other side, satisfied to the contrary
by Father <hi>Suffran</hi> her own Chaplain, and of the same Society,
conceiv'd she did not violate her Oath, by attempting all ways to
recover her freedom; insomuch that making use of her enemie's
credulity, she pursu'd her business at greater convenience, than
otherwise she could have done. Neither was this the only benefit
she receiv'd by this declaration; another signal advantage arising
thence, which was a very gracious Letter under the King's own
hand; wherein, to manifest how absolute a confidence he repos'd
in her Word, and Oath, he gave her leave to go whither she
pleas'd within his Kingdom: which Letter serv'd afterwards as a
pretense for her going from <hi>Blois,</hi> as we shall see when we come
to speak of that Affair.</p>

                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:63412:173"/>
Whilst at <hi>Blois</hi> the Court Agents were thus diligent to cheat
themselves, <hi>Rucellay</hi> was arriv'd safe at <hi>Sedan;</hi> where he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the Duke <hi>de Boüillon</hi> with his Commission, and wherein
he fail'd not with his best Rhetorick to induce him to undertake
the Queens deliverance. But the Duke,<note place="margin">

from <hi>Sedan,</hi> where he thought himself so secure, who was already
wearied out with his late troubles, who in the conduct of those
troubles had run so great a hazard of his life, and liberty, and
who likewise foresaw many great, and almost invincible difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the business propos'd, would by no means be perswaded
to engage in that Affair. Contented therefore to serve the Queen
Mother with his advice, instead of that real assistance was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from him, he gave <hi>Rucellay</hi> this answer, <q>That being old,
and infirm, as he was, well satisfied with his present conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and upon so good terms at Court, as to apprehend no ill
usage from thence, it would be a great indiscretion in him to
deprive himself of the peace he now enjoy'd, by engaging in a
new Quarrel, full of trouble and danger: That he was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Queen Mothers most humble Servant, of which
truth the best testimony he could at present give, was to point
out to her Majesty a Neighbour of his, a man of a vigorous
Constitution, though in a declining age, Wise, Valiant, Rich,
Strong in a posterity of men capable of great things, that was
withal possess'd of many very considerable places, both in the
Heart, and upon the Frontiers of the Kingdom; and (which
was more to be consider'd than all) who was so nettled with
the ill usage he had receiv'd at Court, that there was no doubt
to be made, but he would readily embrace any overture, that
would direct him to a just revenge. In the conclusion of which
Character he nam'd to him the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Rucellay</hi> was
not so ill read in Affairs,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Boüillon</hi> advises the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to treat with the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon.</hi>
                     </note> but that he very well knew the person
the Duke of <hi>Boüillon</hi> had propos'd, was of all other the most
likely to do the Queens business: but besides that he had no order
to address himself to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> there had moreover
in the time of his being at Court, some difference hapned betwixt
the Marquis <hi>de Roilhac,</hi> the Duke's Nephew, and himself; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Duke's Authority having protected <hi>Roilhac, Rucellay</hi> had
not receiv'd that satisfaction, he might otherwise reasonably
have expected, for injuries of no ordinary kind. These injuries
therefore, being still fresh in his memory, made him very averse
to any Treaty with the Duke: neither was he ignorant how ill
the Queen had us'd him, at his departure from Court, after the
many, and great Services, that during her Regency she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:63412:174"/>
at his hands, which altogether put him into a very great
confusion. All these considerations nevertheless laid aside, either
out of the desire he had to serve the Queen, or to be reveng'd of
the Favourites, or to re-establish himself at Court, which he
hop'd would put on a new face in the change of the Queens For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
he dispatch'd away to her with all diligence to acquaint her
how the Duke of <hi>Boüillon</hi> had excus'd himself, and of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he had given concerning the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> that he might
thereupon receive her Majesties further Command.</p>
                  <p>This posting to and fro took up so much time, that the Queens
Letters of Credit to the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> could not come to <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellay</hi>'s
hands, till towards the latter end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> nor he send them
to the Duke till the month following; I say send them, <hi>Rucellay</hi>
having no mind to sound the Foard himself, nor to make the first
overtures of that Treaty in his own person, for the foremention'd
reasons. He therefore employ'd herein one <hi>Vincentio Ludovici,</hi> a

formerly been chief Secretary to the <hi>Mareschal d' Encre,</hi> after a long,
and very severe imprisonment he had suffred since the death of his
Master, had retir'd himself to <hi>Signy,</hi> and put himself into <hi>Rucellay</hi>'s
protection. Where living in expectation of some considerable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
<hi>Rucellay</hi> propos'd this negotiation to him, who as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undertook it; and having receiv'd full instructions, together
with the Queens Letters of <hi>Credence,</hi> came to <hi>Metz,</hi> where at the
<hi>Moors-Head</hi> he took up his Inn, and from thence sent to <hi>le Plessis</hi>
(whom all the world knew to be the man in greatest trust about
the Duke) to entreat him that he would take the pains to come see
one of his old acquaintance, without further discovering himself.</p>
                  <p>I have heard <hi>le Plessis</hi> say, that by this Complement he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guess'd what the business might be, that brought this man, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was, to Town; yet would he not appear upon this first
Summons: but having a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> in his dependence, that
he had bred from a Boy, in whom he durst confide, and of whose
dexterity, and discretion, he had often made tryal upon several oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
he commanded him to go to the <hi>Moors-Head,</hi> to see
who it was desir'd to speak with him, and to observe if it were a
face he had formerly seen, or one that was altogether a stranger to
him. This man's name was <hi>Cadillac,</hi> which I insert here, because
we shall shortly find him a principal Agent in this Affair.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cadillac</hi> accordingly comes to the Inn, where his eye had soon
found out his man; he observ'd him, spoke to him, and by his
accent soon discover'd him to be a stranger, of which he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carried back a report to his Master; giving him withal a descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:63412:174"/>
of his person. <hi>Le Plessis</hi> confirm'd by this accompt in his
former opinion, would by no means confer with him till he had
first acquainted the Duke: but having receiv'd his Order, takes
his way towards the Inn. Thither being come in the confusion,
and hurry that usually happens in those houses of publick enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
he soon found out the man he sought for, runs to him,
and embraces him, as if they had been the greatest friends in
the world, though they had never seen one another before, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of him aloud of their friends in <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> where this stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
had never been; who, nevertheless very well understanding
<hi>le Plessis</hi> meaning, deliver'd him the services of several persons they
neither of them both knew: after which <hi>le Plessis</hi> drawing him
aside, and entring into more particular conference with him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from his mouth the first overtures of his Treaty, which he
also undertook to carry back to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>No sooner therefore was he parted from <hi>Vincentio,</hi> but that he
went to find out the Duke at the <hi>Haute Pierre</hi> (the place where the
Governours of <hi>Metz</hi> ordinarily reside) where he gave him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of the strangers business; together with the humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
he made to be admitted to a further Conference with his
own person. Whereupon the Duke call'd for his two Sons, the
Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and the Archbishop of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> since Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>de la Valette</hi> (it appearing very reasonable they should partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of the Counsel, who were to have so great a share in the

that the Duke should the next day give audience to this Envoy in
the Abby of St. <hi>Vincent</hi> in <hi>Metz,</hi> belonging to the Archbishop of
<hi>Tholouze.</hi> According to which determination the stranger was
early the next morning conducted thither, by the foresaid <hi>Cadillac;</hi>

                  <p>This Letter being read, and the Duke having ask'd the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
what he had more to say, <q>He represented to him the many
and signal Services he had formerly perform'd for the Queen,
first in promoting her Interest when she was declar'd Regent,
and afterwards throughout the whole course of her Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration:
telling him withal how infinitely her Majesty was
afflicted: That she had not acknowledg'd those Services at so
just a rate, as the quality of them did truly deserve: That ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
she having shew'd her self ready to gratifie him in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things of some importance to him, she doubted not, but
that a generous heart, as his was, would be apter to record
those testimonies of her Favour and Affection to him, than
some little discontents, that could not so justly be imputed to
her, as to the necessity of the time, and the occurrences that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
them: That he very well knew the late King her Lord,
and Husband had a few days before his death (as if he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
the persecution was preparing against her) recommended
her Interests to his care and protection, wherein he had already
in part so worthily perform'd the Trust that great Prince had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in his Vertue, that she had reason to believe he would
continue to oblige her for ever: That she was now reduc'd to
such a condition by the violence of her Enemies; as after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
depriv'd of her liberty, to think her self in great peril of
her life: That the King her Son, though his constraint was less
apparent, was not himself however exempt from the tyranny
they exercis'd upon her person: That it was in his power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
them both from the slavery they were in; wherein, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
she doubted not, but that the King would one day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a Service of this nature to such a degree, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of it would justly deserve; she in the mean time would
notwithstanding take all the obligation upon her self, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
to make him see the effects of such a gratitude, as he
might reasonably expect from a Princess, who conceiv'd her
self oblig'd to his generosity for her liberty,<note place="margin">And hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to the Proposition.</note> and her life.</q> The
Duke having made answer to this discourse in such terms of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and respect, as befitted a Subject to a Princess of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:63412:175"/>
the Mother of his King, and one from whom, amongst
some little unkindnesses he had receiv'd many benefits, and signal
favours, proceeded without more ceremony to the negotiation;
in the progress whereof, <hi>Vincentio</hi> in the Queens name promis'd
so many men, and places, and such summes of mony, proposing
withal so great and so advantageous conditions for the Duke, as
made him conceive the proposition worth the thinking of, and to
promise him in a few days a positive answer.</p>
                  <p>He was no sooner therefore parted from <hi>Vincentio,</hi> but that he
sent for his Sons to deliberate with them about this Affair, in
whom he met with young spirits, full of heat, and courage, that
presently advis'd him confidently to embrace that motion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they said there was no question to be made, but that the issue
would be glorious for him, advantageous to the State, and easie to
be effected in it self, through the concurrence he would certainly
find in most of the great men of the Kingdom, who were appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
dissatisfied with the present Government, which was also
no extraordinary thing in the best, and most happy Reigns. The
Duke on the contrary by a long experience become more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
could not suffer himself so easily to be overcome; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
he was about to expose his Life and Fortune, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Friends,<note place="margin">B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t without engaging himself at this time.</note> and Family for a Princess who had not at other
times been over mindful of his former Services, he had some
reason to fear he should receive no better an acknowledgement of
this, than he had done of the rest. Besides he knew very well
that he should no sooner appear in Arms in order to the design in
hand, but that the Kings whole Power, and his Person would
immediately be upon him; and seeing no visible Forces sufficient
to resist that Torrent, he could not clear his mind from those ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
wherewith it was involv'd. He represented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to his Sons, that all those Confederates they seem'd to rely
upon, should they joyn in the Quarrel, would most of them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
at the very sound of the Royal Name: That the most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
of them would be reconcil'd to their Duty by the least
satisfactions should be given them, and that then he alone should
do the work of all the other great men of the Kingdom, at the
price of his own particular ruine. So that after having again and
again consider'd of this proposal, he could not perswade himself
to condescend to the importunities of his Sons, and <hi>le Plessis,</hi> who
was present at this deliberation, all they could say being able to
prevail no further upon him at that time, than that <hi>Vincentio</hi>
might in his name assure the Queen, he had a passionate desire to
serve her, provided it would please her Majesty to enable him so
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:63412:176"/>
to do, by letting him know what persons of quality she had won
over to her party, with what summes of mony she could make
for carrying on the War, until when he humbly desir'd he might
reserve to himself the liberty of his promise, with an assurance
of his Secrecy and Fidelity in the mean time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vincentio,</hi> after having staid eight days at <hi>Metz,</hi> went back with
this answer to <hi>Rucellay,</hi> who with great impatience expected his
return; and who having receiv'd this accompt of the business,
thought they had done enough at this first push, in prevailing
with the Duke to hearken only to the proposal: neither did he
doubt, but that the difficulties he had represented, though very
rational in themselves, would in the end be overcome by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of those things, whereof the Duke, before he would give
a determinate answer, desir'd to be assur'd. He therefore in all
haste signified to the Queen the Duke's disposition to serve her,
assuring her withal of the Duke <hi>de Boüillon</hi>'s Concurrence with
the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> provided the last would undertake the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Whereupon her Majesty, secure of her Interest with the
Dukes of <hi>Guise,</hi> and <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and many other persons of
great quality; and nothing fearing also, but she should be able
to raise a great mass of mony, what by borrowing, what upon
her Jewels, and what by the Revenue of those Provinces would
be engag'd with her, sent the same <hi>Vincentio</hi> a month after to the
Duke, to give him full assurance of all things he desir'd. Upon
which second dispatch, the Duke conceiving he might confide in
the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eens word, engag'd himself (though not without some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy)
to declare openly in her Quarrel, dismissing his little
Ambassadour with a much better accompt, than before, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
him a Cypher for his future Correspondence with the
Queen; after which, and a particular answer to the Letter her
Majesty had honour'd him with by <hi>Vincentio</hi> the first time, he
launch'd so far into the Affair, that it was afterwards impossible
for him to retire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rucellay</hi> having pump'd the whole secret of this Negotiation
out of <hi>Vincentio,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rucellay</hi> takes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Treaty in hand.</note> and having no mind he should carry away the
Reputation of an Affair of that importance, and so successfully
begun, resolv'd for the time to come to undertake the Treaty
himself, and laying aside his former aversions, with all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
(which he likewise conceiv'd were not of so high a nature,
as ought to stand in competition with the Affair in hand) would
treat with the Duke in his own person. In order whereunto he
advanc'd as far as <hi>Pont a Moulins,</hi> a little Village about a League
distance from <hi>Metz;</hi> either unwilling, or not daring to venture
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:63412:176"/>
himself in the City, till he first knew how the Duke was dispos'd
to receive him. From this place therefore he immediately sent
away for <hi>Cadillac</hi> (the same <hi>le Plessis</hi> had sent the first time to <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centio</hi>)
not doubting but he would be the first should be sent to
discover who he was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Cadillac</hi> thus sent for by he knew not whom,
would not go out to him without first receiving his Masters Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
nor his Master give it him, till he himself had first receiv'd an
Order from the Duke: Neither could the Duke suddenly consent
to this intelligence, who, although he did not know the stranger
to be <hi>Rucellay,</hi> yet suspecting him to be some new Negotiator,
and unwilling to have so many intrusted with a business, upon
the secrefie whereof depended his Life and Fortune, he waver'd
long before he would give way to an enterview betwixt <hi>le Plessis,</hi>
and this new Agent. He was at last notwithstanding content he
should go: but if he had at first made some difficulty of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Conference, before he knew <hi>Rucellay</hi> to be the man he
was to confer withal, he was so out of all patience when he knew
the secret was committed to an <hi>Italian,</hi> his enemy, and disoblig'd
by him, that he was many times upon the point to have recall'd
his word, and absolutely to give over the design. <hi>Le Plessis</hi> was
then forc'd to return back to <hi>Rucellay</hi> with a very unsatisfactory
answer; who, without being much out of countenance at this
repulse (the Duke refusing to admit him into the Treaty) or the
seeing the civility he had advanc'd so far towards a reconciliation
rejected, told <hi>le Plessis</hi> coldly, <q>That since the Duke had a mind
to do the business without him, he might, if he pleas'd, in good
time proceed; but that in the mean time he was to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that it was to him the Queen had intrusted the secret of
that Affair, and not to the other, who had hitherto appear'd in
it, who was but his substitute, and by him sent to make the first
overtures to the Duke, presuming his own person might not be
so acceptable to him; but that he had seen the Duke of <hi>Boü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon,</hi>
and treated with him: That <hi>Vincentio</hi> had given him an
accompt of all he had done at <hi>Metz,</hi> and had deliver'd a Cypher
to him: That he knew very well that he <hi>le Plessis</hi> in the Cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Cypher was call'd <hi>Floze,</hi> the Duke by another name,
and his Sons by others. After which explanation he desir'd
him to consider whether a man so well inform'd in, and able ot
give so good an accompt of the business, was fit to be laid aside:
That he could not but wonder the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> should
continue to use him so ill, who had never given him any
offense; but on the contrary had been highly offended by him,
and his; that having so many and just inducements to revenge
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:63412:177"/>
those injuries, he had now sufficient means to do it, were not
his honour far dearer, than his ill usage was sensible to him:
but that he would tread all those considerations under foot, to
preserve his Fidelity to the Queen his Mistriss, provided he
should not be urg'd on to the last extremes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Declaration, though something high from an Enemy,
and very rough from a man that pretended he came to Treat, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
nevertheless so much sting with it, and threatned so much to
the ruine of the design in hand, that the Duke saw it necessary ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to admit him into the Council, or to dispatch him out of the
way: the latter of which being too cruel for him to consent unto,
and on the other side it appearing of better advantage to treat with
a man of the Quality <hi>Rucellay</hi> was, than with <hi>Vincentio,</hi> who
could do nothing, but as he receiv'd Orders from him; the Duke
resolv'd upon the first: So that <hi>Rucellay</hi> being upon these terms
admitted into the negotiation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rucellay</hi> with much difficulty admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Treaty.</note> he came by night to <hi>Metz,</hi> and in
disguise (as he always went) was conducted to the <hi>Haute Pierre,</hi>
where he had a Chamber made ready for him in the Duke's own
Lodgings; out of which he never stirr'd for a whole month to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Being there receiv'd, he had <hi>Cadillac</hi> appointed to attend
him, as also one of the Duke's own <hi>Valet's de Chambre,</hi> whom
he knew was to be trusted, order'd to bring him all necessaries
from the Kitchin, and other Offices, without any bodies being
able to guess who this person might be, that was so carefully, and
diligently attended. The Duke went almost every day to see him, his
Sons very often, and <hi>le Plessis</hi> ofter than them all; by which regular
visits in the Duke, and by the great care was taken to seek out the
best water (for <hi>Rucellay</hi> drank nothing else, and was very delicate
in that) it was suspected some Woman of Pleasure was kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
in the house: A suspicion that perhaps contributed something
to his better concealment, and to the restraint of a further curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity

much afflicts me, that I must entreat you to write to me by this bearer,

therefore so far, as to send me word what the matter is, as also of the

It appears by this Letter, that Affairs were now in a very good
forwardness, some mony having been sent by the Queen to <hi>Metz,</hi>
which,<note place="margin">Mony sent to <hi>Metz</hi> by the Queen.</note> as it was the most important place of her Party, and
wherein the Duke had resolv'd to leave the Marquis <hi>de la Valette</hi>
his Son, he would not he should be left without some mony in
his greatest necessity to assist him. He very well foresaw that after
the Queens escape he should be the first assaulted, and expos'd (as
he afterwards was) to the fury of the Royal Arms, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the preservation of <hi>Metz</hi> depended, in part, the life of the
whole Action: but of how great moment soever this place might
be to the design in hand, the summes nevertheless were very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
that were there left for its defense, arising to no more in
all, than an hundred thousand Crowns, carried thither by Wagon
from <hi>Saverne;</hi> of which summe <hi>Vincentio</hi> receiv'd an hundred
thousand Livers for the use of the Duke of <hi>Boüillon,</hi> who was
to take Arms in favour of the Queen, a part of the remainder
only being left at <hi>Metz,</hi> for the raising of men necessary for the
defense of the Town, and to buy Ammunition.</p>

so carefully for the rest, that nothing would be wanting of
all those things whereof they had given him before so ample as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance:
In which belief he set himself wholly upon his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to be gone; of which also having given notice to the
Queen, her Majesty, whose condition was much worse than his,
to quicken his haste, sent him another Letter in the same Canting

now is, he will come to take order about those we have in these parts,

                  <p>This Letter, which, betwixt persons so well read in one anothers
designs, might with great ease be explain'd, was by the Duke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
put into deliberation; first, that a day might be resolv'd
upon for his departure, and next that something might be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
about the order was to be observ'd in going to receive the
Queen. To this Consultation the Dukes two Sons, <hi>Rucellay,</hi> and
<hi>le Plessis,</hi> were only admitted, where (as it usually falls out) the
nearer they approach'd to the execution of their design,<note place="margin">Some difficulties arise about the execution of the design.</note> the harder
it seem'd to be effected. From the time the Duke had first engag'd
his word to the Queen, he had been very instant at Court, to
obtain liberty to go into his Governments of <hi>Xaintonge</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goumois,</hi>
very well foreseeing, that without such a formal leave,
he should meet difficulties enough in the very Journey it self, had
he had no design to favour the Queens escape; but the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
he had been to procure that Licence, the more obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
he had found them to be in the denial. They look'd upon
him, as it were mew'd up in <hi>Metz,</hi> and were resolv'd to
keep him in a manner a prisoner to his own Government, in that
remote part of the Kingdom. So that the Duke in despair of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
that priviledge, and seeing that under the colour of some
very inconsiderable excuses, the King had a mind to make his
presence at <hi>Metz</hi> appear altogether necessary to his Service, he sent
his Majesty a very full Remonstrance of the urgency of his Affairs
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:63412:179"/>
in those parts, with a repeated supplication, that he would please
to permit him to go: Not that he expected a better success in this
than in his former applications, he had lost that hope: but by this
new Address to lull the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> asleep, who ought in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe, that this reiterated importunity pre-suppos'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
in the Duke to prevail in his request; and that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
he would not depart from <hi>Metz,</hi> till that were first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
This Letter was writ by the <hi>Sieur de Balzac,</hi> and is, in my
opinion one of the best pieces has flow'd from his admirable
Pen; which notwithstanding I have not inserted here, forasmuch
as the Reader may find it printed amongst the rest of his excellent
Works.</p>

for his departure, the Duke endeavour'd to conceal his Design;
wherein his policy was of infinite use, and this that follows of no
less. He had a mind to send away before his Stable of manag'd
Horses, consisting of thirty, what Gennets, and Barbs, the finest,
and best in <hi>France,</hi> and equipage he had ever been very curious to
maintain, as he continued to the last hour of his life. These hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that had been very unfit to travel such Journeys, as he must
of necessity take, had they staid to go along with him, and that
could not in the mean time be convey'd out of <hi>Metz,</hi> without
much notice taken, to hinder that observation, and to del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de such
as were too clear-sighted, and too prying into all his actions, the
Duke caus'd, for fifteen days together, bridled, sadled, and in all
their equipage as they had been to go a long Journey, to be led out
at several Gates of the City: wherein though it was given out by
the Grooms, as done only to air them, left they should become
useless by standing continually still; yet for a few of the first days
they were seen to go out in that manner, no body believ'd other
than that they were the Dukes forerunners, who intended himself
soon after to follow. An opinion that made the people crowd in
multitudes to gaze upon the sight, every one certainly concluding
at first, what was effectually the Duke's real design: but in the end,
seeing them, after a walk of four or five hours, continually brought
back at night, and that which at first surpriz'd them by its novelty,
being grown familiar by the continuation of it, even the most pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netratingly
inquisitive began to grow weary of their suspicion,
letting them at last pass to and again without any regard at all.
And then it was that the Duke commanded the <hi>Sieur de Campels</hi>
the Gentleman of his Horse, who, till that time had been as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
as the rest, at his next ordinary sally, to ride clear away,
and to go to a House near <hi>Sanserra,</hi> and upon the Banks of the

perform'd without the least notice taken, or any noise

                  <p>This part being thus perform'd, <hi>le Leige,</hi> Major to <hi>Rembure</hi>'s
Regiment, a Gentleman very expert in the Geographical Cart,
and an excellent Quarter-Master for the lodging of an Army, came
back to <hi>Metz,</hi> whom the Duke had sent a few days before to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
all the ways, by which he was to pass into <hi>Angoumo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whose extraordinary diligence, the way was already chalk'd out, and
divided into Journeys, the Fords all sounded, and the whole thing
exactly drawn into a Map. After all which precautions, the Duke
still living at <hi>Metz,</hi> as if he never had design to part from thence,
and having concluded with his Sons, <hi>Rucellay,</hi> and <hi>le Plessis</hi> the day
of his setting out to be the 22. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the ensuing year, all
things were thenceforward prepar'd with the greatest secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ie, and
diligence imaginable, to be ready against the time to come. The
Queen Mother had, as you have heard, signified in her last dispatch,
that she was in hope she might convey her person to any place the
Duke should think fit to name, thinking that the Letter she had
receiv'd from the King (after the Protestation she had made to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Arnoux</hi>) would priviledge her so to do, she having full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
given her therein to go whither she pleas'd into any part of the
Kingdom: but because that it was probable the design of that
Letter was rather to comfort her in her solitude, and to swee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her captivity, than intended to give her absolute liberty to dispose
of her person; it was moreover thought impossible so to order
the time, that she could at a certain and punctual hour transfer her
self to a place where she might be free to dispose of her self at her
own choice: Especially considering that all those who were about
her, the major part at least, were Servants made, and corrupted
by the Court Minion. Which sole difficulty appearing invincible,
it was at last resolv'd, that, to avoid all suspicion, her Majesty
should not stir from <hi>Blois,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anno 1619.</note> but that the Duke, or some other trusty

before the Duke his Father, to go into <hi>Angoumois.</hi> The pretense
of this Journey was to try to raise mony upon their Territories in
those parts for their better support, they having not (as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
wherewithal to defray their necessary expense, the Duke's

to confirm the Servants the Duke had in his Governments there
in their Duty, and to secure the strong Holds he had in <hi>Xaintonge</hi>
and <hi>Angoumois,</hi> by a seasonable prevention of any practice from
Court. There was also at the same time a dispatch sent to the
Queen Mother, to acquaint her with their resolutions, that she
might make her self ready against the day prefix'd; the charge
whereof <hi>Rucellay</hi> having taken upon himself, he intrusted it to a
young fellow whose name was <hi>Lorme,</hi> one whom he had bred up
of a Page, and by whom he had in truth been very faithfully
serv'd at Court, in some affairs of no ordinary nature; though in
this, and in the most critical time for the ruine of the Enterprize
in hand, he play'd fowl, and stumbled into the foulest Treachery
in the world. He had often been employ'd to and fro upon this
occasion, wherein he had ever acquitted himself with great since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and discretion: but now, though he had not penetrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the depth of the design, yet guessing by the secresie had been
enjoyn'd him, that it must necessarily be of very great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
what recompenses soever he had been promis'd by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
he chose rather by his infidelity to obtain them, than by a
vertuous action to deserve them. Instead therefore of going to
<hi>Blois,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Confolant</hi> in <hi>Angoumois</hi> (where he was
order'd to expect the Duke, after he should be dismiss'd by the
Queen, from whom he was to bring an accompt of the precise
day of her escape) he went directly to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he address'd
himself to some of the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> his Servants, to be by them
presented to their Master; to whom he said, provided he might be
secur'd of a good reward, he would discover something of
more than common concern.<note place="margin">The whole design in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ruin'd, through the infidelity of one of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>Luines,</hi> looking upon him as an Impostor, either made no
mention of him to the Duke at all, or, if they did, represented him
for such a fellow, as they themselves took him to be, making him
wait at the Gates for three whole days together, without giving
him either admittance, or answer. In the interval of which three
days <hi>le Buisson,</hi> a Counsellor in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> heard
by chance that <hi>Lorme, Rucellay</hi>'s man was in Town; which he
had from one of his own people, who, being of <hi>Lorme</hi>'s acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
had met him accidentally in the street. At which intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<hi>le Buisson</hi> (a man passionately devoted to the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
privy to her designs, and an affectionate Servant of the Duke
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:63412:180"/>
of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s, by reason of a Brother of his, a Lieutenant in
the Regiment of Guards, who was one of the Duke's dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
being infinitely surpriz'd; forasmuch as <hi>Lorme</hi> had at
other times ever been directed immediately to him, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to comprehend the cause of this alteration, began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to suspect there was some knavery in the wind. He therefore
presently took order to have my companion narrowly watch'd,
and was by his spies as faithfully inform'd of his being continually
seen waiting at the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> his Gate; by which discovery
judging aright at what he was about, and foreseeing what mischief
the sight of those Letters, he knew he had about him, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
he undertook a dangerous, but a very necessary act, and
that indeed prov'd the safety of the whole design. By a suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
hand, one that took upon him to be a Servant to the Duke
<hi>de Luines,</hi> he caus'd five hundred crowns to be paid down to <hi>Lorme</hi>
by virtue of which he retriv'd the Packet out of his hands, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
so of <hi>Lorme</hi> himself, that he was never seen or heard of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
by which means this great design in the greatest danger ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to be discover'd, and lost, was again restor'd to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
condition.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, who as yet was totally ignorant of <hi>Lorme</hi>'s treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who knew nothing of it of above a month after, put
himself in the mean time upon his Journey; the order whereof

                     </note> I shall here present you. Wherein we shall observe so
admirable a conduct, that we cannot forbear (notwithstanding
the Duke's modesty) who ever gave Fortune too great a share in
all his performances) to attribute the whole success of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
immediately to his own prudence. No body knew of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
till the night before his departure, when all the Gates of
the City being shut, which at <hi>Metz</hi> (as at all other Frontier
Towns) was commonly betimes, he commanded every one to
make ready for their departure the next morning. He had some
time before this caus'd eight thousand Pistols (his whole stock at
that time) to be sowed up in Girdles of Leather (which were all
found in his Truncks at his death in the same condition they were
at his departure from <hi>Metz</hi>) such as a man might, without much
trouble, wear about him, which he distributed to fifteen Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of his Family (whom he knew to be the most faithful, and
that were the best mounted) to take care of, with orders to follow
him wherever he went, should any cross accident befal him in
the way. His Jewels also, which were lock'd up in a little iron
Chest, and carried in a Male, was committed to a <hi>Valet de
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:63412:181"/>
Chambre</hi> of approv'd fidelity, who had likewise order not to stir
from his person. He had fifty Gentlemen only in his company,
every one arm'd with a Case of Pistols, and a Carabine, forty
Guards, with each one a Musket, and a case of Pistols, fifteen
Sumpter Mules, the ordinary Officers of his Houshold, with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
common Servants. With this Troop amounting in all not to
above an hundred good Horse (and that would have been too
little had he gone upon the accompt of a private quarrel only) the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> adventur'd upon a Journey, contrary to the
King's express Order, from one extremity of the Kingdom to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and thence to return back again into the very heart of the
same Kingdom, there to assist the Queen Mother; resolv'd (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the King's will) to make her escape from a place, to
which she had been, by his Majesty in the nature of a Prison, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd;
and without certainly knowing by whom he was to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in his design, undertook to change the face of a mighty
State, so quiet, and so united within it self, as that it seem'd impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
either at home or abroad to be threatned with the least dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or trouble: Wherein, if the attempt was bold, we shall find
the execution no less worthy to be admir'd. He must alone make
an end of what he had alone begun, his good Fortune, it seems,
to his Glory, ordering it so, that not one great man of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(either envying, or astonish'd at so daring a design) would
be drawn to embark in an action the honour and success whereof
could derive to none but the Duke of <hi>Espernon:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Memoires de Monsieur de Rohan.</note> So that they were
content to let him bustle it out alone, whilst themselves sate idle
spectators of this haughty and noble Enterprize; though it was
certainly reported, and believ'd, that many of them had engag'd
themselves to the Queen to serve her upon this occassion.</p>
                  <p>The Duke having thus order'd his little Train, and not being
able to separate himself from the Marquis <hi>de la Valette</hi> his most
beloved Son, without taking his leave, he call'd him aside, where
embracing him with the tenderness of an affectionate Father, he
told him; <q>That the greatest testimony he could possibly give him
of his Affection and Esteem, was (as he now did) to commit
to his Vigilancy, and Valour the Custody of <hi>Metz,</hi> it being the
principal member of his Fortune; and to the conservation of
which he ought to be the more awake, as it concern'd himself
much more than it did him, who having but a short time to
live, could expect but a few years possession: That he might as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
himself, he should with the soonest be beleaguer'd with all
the Forces the King could make; and that no better was to be
expected from the Inhabitants, how well affected soever they
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:63412:181"/>
might pretend to be; to oppose both which, much prudence
and constancy would be requir'd: That upon the success of
the Action, wherein they were now engag'd, depended not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their Fortunes, but their Reputations also; which if it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
well, they should be loaded with Honour; but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
be look'd upon as Criminals, and Traytors: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were to put on a Resolution rather to dye, than to fall
into that disgrace; but that it was much better to live, and to
overcome, as his heart assur'd him they should honourably,
and fortunately do.</q> By which few words the Marquis, being
confirm'd in the generous resolution he before had taken, humbly
besought the Duke his Father to be confident he would never do
any thing unworthy his own Birth, or his expectation; when his
tears having stop'd all further expression, he by that tenderness gave
a much better testimony of his courage than otherwise, and at a
greater liberty of speech, his own modesty would perhaps have
permitted him to do.</p>
                  <p>The Duke was no sooner parted from his Son,<note place="margin">The Duke goes out of <hi>Metz.</hi>
                     </note> but that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
went to Horse to begin his Journey, it being Monday the
two and twentieth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> as had been before appointed.
The Gates of the City had not been opened since the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and then only that by which the Duke was to sally; which
was also shut again so soon as he (who would himself be the last
man) was gone out: Neither of three days after his departure
was any one opened at all, the Duke having moreover (lest any
Tickets might be thrown over the Walls, or any persons let down,
who might carry intelligence of his motion to Court) left order
with <hi>Paul,</hi> Lieutenant to a Company of Carabines, belonging to
the Garrison of <hi>Metz,</hi> night and day to scour the Road to <hi>Paris,</hi>
and to intercept, and stop all that should travel that way; a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution
of so good use, that the last news the Court receiv'd of the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s departure, came from <hi>Metz,</hi> so well had all
the Avenues been guarded on that side.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, being now out of the City, pursu'd his way with great
diligence, taking as long Journeys as the heaviness of his Sumpter-Mules
would permit, which, though they ty'd him to one stage a
day, yet was that stage always nine or ten Leagues at least; and his
good Fortune was such, that at this season, commonly the most
turbulent of all the year, the weather was so exceedingly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and fair, that there fell not one drop of rain all the way; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he not only could foard all the Rivers, but mounting
every morning so soon as the Sun was up, both he and all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
rid without their Cloaks all the day long, as it had been the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:63412:182"/>
warmest time in Summer. The fourth day after his departure
from <hi>Metz,</hi> he pass'd by the Trenches of <hi>Dijon,</hi> where the Duke of
<hi>Bellegarde</hi> his Cousin being Governour both of the Castle, and
Province, and having the <hi>Sieur de Mun</hi> his Lieutenant in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
the Duke sent for him, who being it seems at that time out
of the way, <hi>Fouqueroles</hi> Ensign to the Duke's Life-Guard came out
in his stead to receive the Duke's commands. Of whom the Duke
having enquir'd of the Duke his Master, he entreated him, so soon
as he should write, to present his Service to him, and to acquaint
him with his motion, but that nevertheless that complement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
no such haste, that he was oblig'd to do it otherwise, than
by the ordinary way of the Messenger (the Packet Office being at
that time not erected in <hi>France</hi>) as he desir'd he would not do;
adding withal, that having been starv'd out of <hi>Metz,</hi> he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to go into <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Angoumois</hi> to live there upon
his own Estate: Wherein, though <hi>Fouqueroles</hi> promis'd to obey
his Orders, yet he was not so good as his word, he dispatching
away an express Currier the next morning to the Duke <hi>de Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,</hi>
to acquaint him with the Duke's motion; by which means
it was that the King had the first intelligence of his departure from
<hi>Metz,</hi> though it was not before he had been eight days upon the
Road, and that it was now too late to stop him.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be imagin'd how strangely this news alarm'd the
whole Court,<note place="margin">The news of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s motion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Court.</note> the King openly saying, that he ever thought if
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> could not obtain the leave he desir'd, he
would infallibly take it: but the Duke <hi>de Luines,</hi> conceiving that
(in all probability) the Duke would never have done such a thing
without some design, thought fit to try if he could not effect that
by fair means, he saw was not to be done by foul; and to that
end dispatch'd away <hi>le Maine</hi> (otherwise call'd (<hi>Chabans</hi>) to the
Duke, with a Letter from the King to Authorize his Voyage, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with all assurance of satisfaction in his Affairs, as also a
particular complement, that he would accept of his Service, and
that all things pass'd might be no more remembred betwixt them.
Which Envoy we shall in due time find upon his way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dijon</hi> being pass'd, the Duke continu'd his Journey without
intermission, baiting, or staying near the great Towns, till he had
pass'd the River <hi>Loire</hi> at <hi>Port de Vichi;</hi> from whence he sent a
new dispatch to the King, to give him notice of his Voyage into
<hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Angoumois;</hi> where he had (as he said) no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
than to live under his Majesties obedience. With this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
<hi>Baussonniere</hi> Nephew to <hi>le Plessis,</hi> (a Gentleman of as good
Parts, and as much Valour, as any other of his time) was sent
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:63412:182"/>
away to <hi>Paris,</hi> where at his arrival he was very well receiv'd; but
hapning to be still at Court, soliciting an answer to his dispatch,
when the news was brought of the Queen Mothers escape, he
ran a very great hazard of his life, his head being often brought
into debate, that in his person they might punish the high Offense
done to the King by the Duke his Master.</p>
                  <p>Two days Journey short of this <hi>Port de Vichi,</hi> the Duke's
Quarter-Masters (who always carried <hi>Rucellay</hi> along with them
in disguise, and who, the better to conceal him, us'd him with
no other respect,<note place="margin">An Encounter by the way.</note> than as a Comrade) discover'd two Parties of
Horse standing in a Field, a little distance from them, which at
the first sight they apprehended to be two Troops, where of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been made to the Duke, one of Light-Horse belonging
to the Queen, and another of Carabines commanded by <hi>Arnout;</hi>
which he had been inform'd were dispos'd in Garrison near this
part of the River (out of an opinion had for some time been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd

consent or no) would infallibly undertake this Journey into <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to obstruct his passage. And indeed those Troops had
wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed some time thereabouts; but whether it were that they
had accidentally only been Quarter'd there, or that they had been
tyr'd out with expecting, or that the coming of the Duke's great
Horses towards <hi>Sanserra,</hi> (for they were now march'd that way)
had made them alter their design: but so it was that the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
not the least impediment from them. His people notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
something surpriz'd at the sight of these two Troops, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
upon the spur to give the Duke notice of what they had
seen; at which intelligence, as at a thing that requir'd some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
he made a little halt, when immediately with a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and confident countenance, he said to those who were with
him. We are now come too far my Masters, to return back again,
we must either thorow, or dye. Which being said whilst he was
drawing up to charge, he sent to discover who they were; when
having word back, that they were two Gentlemen, who, being at
Suits, had rais'd men on both sides to take possession of a House
in dispute betwixt them, he continu'd on his way, this being the
only Alarm he receiv'd throughout the whole Journey.</p>
                  <p>But almost in the same place,<note place="margin">Another Encounter with the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> miss'd b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had the fortune to have come a little sooner, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tted betwixt
them. A jealousie that the known friendship betwixt the Duke
and him would have rendred so plausible to all, that the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> not seeing a possibility of jnstifying himself against so
violent a presumption, could hardly have avoided engaging on
the Queens Party, seeing he must inevitably stand highly suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to the other; though the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> concluding him
absolutely engag'd in the same design, did not much care to send
after him, for fear of giving the Court too great a discovery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Affairs were yet ripe: So that by this means, and from the
very business it self, wherein he was thought to be so deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
as perhaps he was, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> took occasion to
make his own Game at Court, and to reconcile himself to the
King, and the Favourites, he sending thither, seal'd up, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them from the Queen, the Packets wherein she made her
application to him, to engage him in her designs.</p>
                  <p>The twentieth day after the Duke's departure from <hi>Metz,</hi> he
arriv'd at <hi>Confolant</hi> in <hi>Angoumois;</hi> where his Son, the Archbishop
of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> together with the <hi>Sieur d' Ambleville,</hi> the King's
Lieutenant in the Province, and the Duke's most faithful friend,
and about three hundred Gentlemen more, came to wait upon
him. And here it was that the Duke was infinitely astonish'd and
surpriz'd; he had all the way expected to find <hi>Lorme</hi> there, with
the Queens instructions about the manner of her escape: but his
treachery (as yet unknown to the Duke) having turn'd him quite
another way, gave the Duke reason to believe, either that the
Queen Mother had alter'd her resolution,<note place="margin">The Duke and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a great confusion.</note> or that otherwise she
had been betray'd, and that the whole design had been discover'd:
The one or the other of which had been equally ruinous to him,
who must either way be certainly expos'd single, and naked to
his enemies discretion. And as one mischief never comes alone,
it fell out, that in the heighr of this confusion, he was assaulted by
another of no less moment, and that consequently added very
much to the perplexity he was in before. The man of the house
where <hi>Rucellay,</hi> and <hi>le Plessis</hi> lay, was one of the<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> Cuiras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers.</note> 
                     <hi>Gend'arme</hi> of
the King's own Troop, whose name was <hi>Betison.</hi> This man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
with <hi>Cadillac le Plessis</hi>'s Servant about the Affairs of the
time (the common talk of that kind of people) innocently told
him, amongst other things, that there was a bruit in the Country,
as if the Duke were come to carry away the Queen Mother from
<hi>Blois.</hi> It could never be found out from whence this rumour
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:63412:183"/>
should arise, for it was so great a secret in the Duke's own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
that the very persons who were continually employ'd in it,
had not the least inckling thereof. Insomuch that <hi>Cadillac,</hi> who was
himself as ignorant as the rest, told his Master this story for a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
thing: but <hi>le Plessis,</hi> who took it after another manner,
and that on the contrary was astonish'd to the last degree, that an
affair which had been carried on with the greatest secresie imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
should become the discourse of the people, went immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to acquaint <hi>Rucellay</hi> with what he had heard; who being no
less surpriz'd, than he, they went both together to the Duke, who
was yet the most amaz'd of the three, and who by this was still
more confirm'd in his former belief, that he was abandoned, and
betray'd, wherein also the appearances were so great, that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was not indeed much to be contradicted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Le Plessis,</hi> who had waded very deep into this Affair, could by
no means perswade himself that the Queen had any ways alter'd
her resolution, yet did he not know what to say to her silence; He
saw his Master's Enterprize was no more a secret, and that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
he could not, without eminent danger make a longer
stay at <hi>Confolant,</hi> his residence in that little place giving too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
evidence of some secret design. The consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
made him resolve generously to expose himself to search out
the truth of the business, and to clear those doubts the Duke was
in at the hazard of his own life.<note place="margin">

and affectionate to the Duke his Master and Benefactor, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
at the first proposal very much surpriz'd with the

the sudden prevail upon himself to embark in an Affair, wherein

knew, if she continu'd in her first resolution, must needs be in
great anxiety, and suspense. He had moreover great reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the news of the Duke's Voyage was by this time arriv'd
at Court, and that then all possible diligence would be us'd (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they might be) to prevent his designs. In which perplexity,
not daring to depart from <hi>Loches,</hi> without having first made
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:63412:184"/>
                     <hi>Iliere</hi> firm to their purpose; or at least till the Archbishop of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louze</hi>
(who was to follow presently after him) should come to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the place, that being design'd for the Queens first retreat, he
found a necessity upon him of committing the secret of this great
and important Affair to <hi>Cadillac</hi>'s fidelity and discretion: Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him therefore to him, entreating, and conjuring him to be
faithful, with great promises of reward, he deliver'd him Letters
for the Queen, with two or three words to the <hi>Count de Brenne,</hi>
that he might by his favour be admitted to her Majesties presence.
The <hi>Count</hi> had hitherto, 'tis true, been entrusted with no syllable
of the design; but <hi>le Plessis</hi> knew him to be very faithful to the
Queen his Mistriss, and that they had usually apply'd themselves
to him to obtain Access, for several private Messengers that had
been sent to her Majesty about this Affair. <hi>Cadillac</hi> acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
very well in his dispatch, he came to <hi>Blois,</hi> presented his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the <hi>Count de Brenne,</hi> and was by him that very night presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Queen, who entertain'd him some time alone in her
Cabinet; and who after having heard the humble request he
made in his Masters behalf, that her Majesty would please to send
some trusty person to <hi>Montis</hi> (a post stage distant only from
<hi>Blois</hi>) with whom he might the next day confidently confer. She
made answer that she had no soul about her whom she durst trust;
but that he should immediately back to <hi>le Plessis,</hi> to tell him from
her, that without staying at <hi>Montis,</hi> he should come on as far as
the Suburbs of <hi>Blois,</hi> where at the little <hi>Moor</hi> he should hear
further from her. <hi>Cadillac</hi> accordingly return'd, riding all night
back again towards his Master, to acquaint him with the Queens
desire, whom at his arrival at <hi>Montis,</hi> he found got thither before
him: <hi>La lliere</hi> (who had never faultred in his duty, and whom
the fear of his Master's safety, rather than any consideration of
his own, had made a little shie at first) being upon better delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
now resolute to run the Duke's fortune, having it should
seem set <hi>le Plessis</hi> at liberty to pursue his Journey: wherein never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
he light upon an Encounter by the way, that had again al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
overthrown the whole design; and that had certainly done
it, had he not by his dexterity, and the vivacity of his judgment,
manag'd it in such sort, as to make it in the end contribute much
to the good success of the Affair in hand.</p>
                  <p>You have already heard that upon the first intelligence the
Court receiv'd of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s departure from <hi>Metz,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and important Encounter upon the way.</note>
                     <hi>Luines</hi> had dispatch'd away <hi>le Maine</hi> to him with an approbation
of his Journey from the King; and it now fell out that this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
in pursuance of that dispatch, hapned to meet <hi>le Plessis</hi>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:63412:184"/>
upon the Road betwixt <hi>Ambois,</hi> and <hi>Blois;</hi> an Encounter that
did not a little surprize <hi>le Plessis,</hi> who knew him to be a subtle
man, and no very good friend to the Duke, by whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
he had not been so well us'd, as he deserv'd to be. Neither
was there any possibility of passing by him unknown, they had
been too long acquainted at Court for that; and it was much to
be fear'd, lest the meeting of <hi>le Plessis</hi> upon this Road might make
<hi>le Maine</hi> penetrate into the truth of his design, and consequently
endeavour to obstruct it. In this apprehension, I have heard <hi>le Ples<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
say, That he was once in mind to have kill'd him; though
considering that an act of that nature was likely to draw after it
consequences that might utterly overthrow the Affair he had in
hand, he quickly alter'd that resolution; conceiving it therefore
better not to avoid his Encounter, he went chearfully up to him,
where after he had some time entertain'd him with great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of intimacy, and friendship, he so order'd the matter,
that he (without discovering the true intent of his own) got out
of <hi>le Maine</hi> the business of his Journey, which was, that he was
sent by the King, and the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
to let him know that his Majesty was very well satisfied with
his expedition, and that <hi>Luines</hi> desir'd to be his Servant. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whereunto, having further enquir'd of <hi>le Plessis</hi> where he
might find the Duke, he made answer, that certainly at <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesme,</hi>
where he arriv'd two days before he came from thence. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner did <hi>le Plessis</hi> disingage himself from this danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
encounter, diverting <hi>le Maine</hi> from the way to <hi>Loches,</hi> whither
before he was going, to go enquire upon the Post Road some
more certain news of the Duke: Whereas had he held on his
way, and met him at <hi>Loches,</hi> as infallibly he had, the Queens Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
had yet been in very great danger, <hi>le Maine</hi> returning in all
diligence to Court, having had leisure enough to give <hi>Luines</hi> time,
either to prevent the Queen Mothers escape, or at least to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

where he was no sooner arriv'd, but that the <hi>Count de
Brenne</hi>'s Steward came to seek him, to guide him to the Castle,
and to lodge him in the Anti-Chambre of the <hi>Count</hi> his Master.
Night therefore being come, he was accordingly by him condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
thither, when, so soon as every body was retir'd, and the
Queen left at liberty, and alone, she sent for him into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:63412:185"/>
to consult with him what remain'd to be done; where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had in few words given her an accompt of the long, and
dangerous Voyage his Master had undertaken, out of the sole,
and passionate desire he had to serve her, and that she had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that obligation in the handsomest manner she could
by words express, <hi>le Plessis</hi> proceeded to represent to her Majesty
the many dangers that attended this delay, remonstrating to her:
<q>That it was now a great while since the Duke's departure from
<hi>Metz:</hi> That he had already waited four or five days in a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
in expectation of her Majesties Commands in order to her
escape: That the true design of the Duke's Journey (though
he believ'd it had no other ground than meer suspicion) was
already become the common discourse of the people: That he
had met <hi>le Maine</hi> going towards the Duke, upon the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
had already been carried to Court of his departure from
<hi>Metz;</hi> and that therefore it was very requis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>te her Majesty should
make immediate use of the present occasion, which perhaps
might in two days be irrecoverably lost.</q> To which the Queen
made answer: <q>That she was of his opinion, and that therefore
they were then instantly to resolve upon the order, and the
the means of her escape.</q> Whereunto <hi>le Plessis</hi> having reply'd,
<q>That that depended chiefly upon some man of Trust:</q> The
Queen made answer again: <q>That she had not one about her
(<hi>Chanteloube</hi> the only man of all her domesticks, to whom she
had entrusted the secret of that Affair, being dispatch'd away
to the Princes, and Lords, which she either conceiv'd already
were, or soon would be engag'd in her Quarrel) in whom she
durst confide.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon, <hi>le Plessis</hi> conceiving there might be something of
the humour of her Sex, or Nation, in so general a distrust, of his
own accord propos'd to her the <hi>Count de Brenne;</hi> who, he said, had
sufficiently manifested his fidelity in those Services he had already
perform'd. A proposition the Queen did not seem absolutely to
reject, saying (which are her own very words), That 'twas true
she believ'd the <hi>Count</hi> to be a man of honour, but that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
she thought him very young for the conduct of so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
an Affair. Which scruple being satisfied by <hi>le Plessis,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to make him capable enough; and seeing it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to trust some one of the Queens domesticks, he thought a
man of his condition, her Majesties Gentleman of the Horse,
and Brother to the Marquis <hi>de Mony,</hi> a most passionate Servant
of hers, was the most proper of all others to be made use of in
this occasion. And accordingly, though it was then very far in
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:63412:185"/>
far in the night, went immediately to talk with him about it;
to whom (after he had felt his pulse a while, and found him very
ready to undertake any thing for her Majesties Service <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> he at last
declar'd the resolution had been taken, to deliver the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of her captivity: a design, that he told him was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
by a person of very great quality, concealing however the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s name) who had drawn great Forces together
in his Government, to favour her Majesties retreat; and in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that therefore he was the very next day to take order for Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to get the Coaches ready, and to lay in fresh Horses, with
all the secresie he in his own discretion should think fit, to the end
that the night following without further delay her Majesty might
be restor'd to her former Freedom. Not forgetting withal to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to his consideration, what he might expect from the
gratitude of a Mistriss, restor'd again to the whole sway of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
her due Authority, and Greatness; besides the honour he

to the Archbishop of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> to acquaint him with the Queens
readiness, the night following to make her escape. The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
who was to part from <hi>Confolans</hi> immediately after <hi>le Plessis,</hi>
had order to advance no further than <hi>Loches</hi> (that place being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for the Queens first reception) only to clear the Road in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thereunto: but <hi>le Plessis</hi> by <hi>Cadillac</hi> intreated him to advance
as far as <hi>Montrichart,</hi> which was half way betwixt <hi>Blois</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi>
assuring him that the Queen would infallibly come thither
the night following, which hapned to be the 22. of <hi>Feb.</hi> an exact
month to a day after the Duke's departure from <hi>Metz. Cadillac</hi>
therefore posted with extraordinary diligence back again to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
to meet the Archbishop there; where being come, he found
not only the Son, but the Father also, entring together the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
of the City. The reason of which was, that though it had
been at first resolv'd, the Son should go before with twenty or
thirty Gentlemen only, to make the less noise, and give the less
suspicion; yet could not the Duke his Father, when it came to'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

consent to let him go so slenderly attended, where he apprehended
the peril to be so manifest, and great. He knew not, in the anxiety
and doubt wherewith he was involv'd, what to think of the
Queens silence, of whom he had hitherto heard no news at all,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:63412:186"/>
to which the rumour that was already spread abroad of his real
design, having more encreas'd his apprehension, nature would not
permit him to expose his Son to so great an adventure, chusing
much rather to run the whole hazard together with him, than
that he alone should tempt the danger, whilst himself lay idle and

stiffly against her Majesties resolution, as being very unwilling to
consent she should commit her safety to persons altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.
The debate whereof was very hot in the Queens Closet,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:63412:187"/>
whilst in the mean time her Cabinets were packing up with her
choicest Jewels, where though they could not very well approve
of the thing, yet had they not however neglected to fix the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and <hi>Cadillac</hi> who had set out of <hi>Loches</hi> by eight of the
clock that evening, was got betwixt twelve and one, upon the
Bridge of <hi>Blois,</hi> to give the last blow to the design. He was
here staid by the <hi>Count de Brenne</hi>'s Gentleman of his Horse, and
one of the Queens Footmen, who had been to convey the Coach
out of Town, and who had orders to suffer one Currier only to
pass; which, though this were the man intended in that direction,
yet would they not permit him to pass upon his own word, but
would themselves go along with him to the Castle, though he
had taken so exact observation before of the way from without
the City, to the Ladders that he serv'd for a guide to those, who
pretended to conduct him. In the heat therefore of this diligence,
he was not long e're he recover'd the first Ladder, by which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
mounted the Terrass, he went to the second, which from
the Terrass lead up to the Queens Closet Window, by which she
was to come out. Being got up to the Window, which he found
shut, he there heard the noise the Queens Servants made in their
Debate; who were not yet to be perswaded out of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
they had conceiv'd of her Majesties person, and safety.
Which first fears had been infinitely augmented, by the recovery
of the Packet entrusted to <hi>Lorme,</hi> and retriv'd by <hi>le Büisson,</hi> which
the Queen had but that very night, and almost at the same instant
receiv'd: by which, though they were satisfied the treachery had
fail'd of its effect, that knowledge was nevertheless so far from
making them secure, that on the contrary it awak'd their jealousie,
and by rendring them more apprehensive of others which they
doubted might succeed, made them more circumspect than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
Wherein though the Queen appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

did she not think it as yet convenient to discover the person who
was to assist her in this escape. Whilst they were in this suspense,
<hi>Cadillac</hi> knock'd at the Window, who brought news that would
satisfie all their doubts. The Window was presently open'd to
<hi>Floze</hi> his man (that being the phrase) who was no sooner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Cabinet, but that transported with joy, to see things so
well prepar'd, he threw himself at her Majesties feet, telling her,
that now all things were in as good a posture, as her Majesty
could her self desire; that <hi>Monsieur d' Espernon</hi> was at <hi>Loches,
Monsieur de Tholouze</hi> at <hi>Montrichart,</hi> and with them three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Gentlemen ready to serve, and attend her Majesty, whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
she should be pleas'd to go. This was the first time the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63412:187"/>
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had been mention'd in all this Affair, whose
name was no sooner heard by the Queens domesticks, but that it
clear'd them of their former apprehensions, no one after that
once offering to oppose their Mistrisses resolution. They making
no doubt, but that a man whose wisdom and power were so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
known, had taken order for all things necessary for the
Queens, and his own particular safety. Here then was a sudden
change of faces, not a person in the Cabinet, who discover'd not
alacrity and satisfaction in their looks; especially the Queen, who
without losing more time, her self gathering up her Gown, that
she might at better convenience get out of the Window,<note place="margin">The Queen goes out of the window of her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Count de Brenne</hi> her hand, who went out before her, her Majesty
following next, <hi>le Plessis</hi> the third, and after him all the rest. The
Queen had found so much difficulty, and trouble in this first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,
that she had no mind to make use of the Ladder, to go
down from the Platform into the street of the Suburb, chusing
rather (the earth being mouldred down in many places, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the Terrass was not yet fac'd with stone) to sit upon a Cloak,
which being leisurely drawn down, convey'd her to the bottom
with very great ease. The rest, either by the same way, or by the
Ladder suddenly follow'd, when the Queen being immediately
taken by the arms by the <hi>Count de Brenne,</hi> and <hi>le Plessis.</hi> as they
were leading her along the Suburbs, they chanc'd to meet some of
her own Officers; who seeing a woman led betwixt two with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Torch, concluded her to be a Wench; which she hearing,
said laughing to <hi>le Plessis, They take me for a good one.</hi> Yet did not
these encounters hinder them from suddenly recovering the
Bridge, where they were to take Coach; but being come where
they expected to find it, there was no Coach to be seen, nor any
body left to tell them which way 'twas gone. So that here they
were in a new disorder. The Queen knew not what to think of
her people, nor <hi>le Plessis</hi> what to imagine of the thing: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to suspect one another, and (as it happens in all dangerous
occasions) every one was so intent upon their own particular
concern, that no one had reserv'd so much judgment as to advise
what was best to be done. In this general jealousie, and conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
comes one of the Queens Footmen, to guide them to the
Coach; which they had convey'd into a little blind lane out of the
way, that it might not be taken notice of by such as should have
occasion to go over the Bridge. This fear then being then blown
over, all past jealousies and apprehensions now vanish'd, and were
forgot. The Queen put her self into the Coach, with the <hi>Count de
Brenne, le Plessis,</hi> and <hi>Katherine,</hi> the rest had all Horses ready to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:63412:188"/>
mount; the Queens Cabinets also were all thrown into the
Coach, one excepted, which by oversight was left upon the place;
but being miss'd, before they had gone two hundred paces, was
sent back for, and found; and it was worth the labour, having
in it Jewels, to the value of above an hundred thousand Crowns.
And this was the last alarm. They went out of the Suburbs, the
Torches were lighted, and the Queen held on her Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Montrichart,</hi> without any further adventure worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating.</p>
                  <p>It hath already been said, that the Archbishop of <hi>Tholouze</hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chart,</hi>
to secure that little Town; of which party <hi>Rucellay</hi> was
one. They had over night possess'd themselves of the Gates, to
be Masters of the Bridge, which affords passage over the River,
that almost environs the Town; neither were they ordered to
stir from thence: but <hi>le <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any accident, or receive any fright by the way, dispatch'd again
<hi>Cadillac</hi> in all diligence to the Archbishop, to give him notice of
her Majesties coming; and withal to desire him to send out twelve,
or fifteen Gentlemen to meet her for her further assurance:
which was presently done, and <hi>Rucellay</hi> would needs command
the Troop, whilst the Archbishop staid behind to guard the <hi>Pass;</hi>
which, should it have been obstructed, would infallibly have
overthrown the whole design.</p>
                  <p>Not long after <hi>Rucellay</hi>'s departure,<note place="margin">The Queen Mother is receiv'd by the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>

where she was complemented by the Archbishop, and
whence (staying no longer there, than fresh Horses could be put
into the Harness) she continued her Journey towards <hi>Loches,</hi>
better attended than hitherto she had been. About a League on
this side the City, she was met by the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> with a
hundred and fifty Horse (what Gentlemen, and what of his own
Guards) he having dismiss'd most of the Gentry, as not necessary
upon this occasion. At this meeting the Queen deliver'd the most
passionate expressions of Obligation, together with the largest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of a grateful return, a Princess of her condition could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
make to a Servant who had so highly merited from her;
which the Duke having receiv'd with all becoming respect, he
was by the Queen commanded to come into the Coach; where
being seated, she began to tell him of <hi>Lorme</hi>'s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

till this instant he knew nothing; proceeding to acquaint him
with greater liberty, than by Letter before she durst do, with her
designs; naming to him the persons she conceiv'd she had won
over to her party, and giving him hopes of several things which
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:63412:188"/>
notwithstanding succeeded not according to her expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Queens escape had been carried with that secresie, that not
a soul in the Castle had perceiv'd it; so that it was far in the
morning, when the domesticks appointed for the Service of her
Majesties person (seeing themselves not call'd to their ordinary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
and not knowing what to think of so profound a
sleep) resolv'd to venture into the Queens Chamber: Where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enter'd, and not seeing the Queen, they look'd for <hi>Katherine,</hi>
who likewise was no where to be found. Every one therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amaz'd at so strange a Solitude, they sought, and call'd, but all
in vain: neither could they imagine which way they could be
gone; the Ladders, by which the Queen had gone down, having
been thrown into the River, the better to conceal the manner of
her escape. At last having been some time in suspense, they had
some news of the Queens motion, which begot a new astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongst them, though proceeding from several motives.
The most faithful and affectionate were glad she had recover'd her
liberty; whereas those who had been corrupted by the Favourite
(which were very many) fearing on the one side they should stand
suspected at Court, to have been assisting to the Queen in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,

which way to turn, nor what to do. Whilst they were in this
confusion, her Majesty writ to the <hi>Marquise de Guercheville</hi> her

her arrival at <hi>Loches;</hi>

began to meditate of the means to defend her self from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite's

would, into any part of the Kingdom: Which Letter she also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

she entreated his assistance in the prosecution of her design. By
which means the Duke was clear'd of the imputation the Court
laid to his charge, that he had taken away the Queen by force, and
against her will; which had been a crime as well towards the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the Son. The two Letters were these.

<q>That of all others he could never have suspected an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
of that nature, believing there had not been that man in
the world, who, in a profound and inviolate peace, had had the
impudence (which were the express terms of the Letter) not
only to execute, but even to meditate a resolution to attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the liberty of the Mother of his King. From whence his
Majesty proceeding to menaces of the most severe, and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
punishment, he in the end justified those about his person
from the ill usage whereof she complain'd; as having been done
by his own order, and that with as much favour and respect as
any Son of a much inferiour Birth, could pay to a Mother:
declaring withal, that he was resolv'd to take Arms, thereby to
put her in full possession of that liberty, her enemies had taken

at this time retir'd from Court, and almost all dissatisfied with
the present Government; yet whether it were (as I have said) that
seeing the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had already so engross'd the entire

Queen 'tis true granted out several Commissions, and disburst
some money, not considerable, for Leavies; all which, though it
signified little to the work, yet had she betwixt five and six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

rais'd in the Duke's Governments by his own interest. He had
from the beginning of the Queens Regency made provision of
Arms for ten thousand Foot, and six hundred Horse, which
were now taken out, and of so great use, that could the Friends
he had in <hi>Guienne</hi> have assisted him according to their affections,
he had upon his own accompt rais'd a very considerable Army:
But the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who was Governour of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
having in this occasion been prepossess'd by the Favourite,
(by whom the command of the Army that was to go against the
Queen, was conferr'd upon him) it was not likely he should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
those Troops to go out of his Government, which were to
be employ'd against him; yet did not the Duke fail however of a
very considerable succour from thence; so great an affection, and
esteem they had for him in that Countrey: the Marquis <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrant,</hi>

zealous, and affectionate to the Queens Service could do, being to
come in in their own persons, which signified no great matter. Of
which number were the Marquis <hi>de Môny, Breauté, Bourbonne,
Bethancourt,</hi> and some others. The Marquis <hi>de Themines</hi> came in
also of another side, though the <hi>Mareschal</hi> his Father was on the

of which he was Captain; so that in effect the whole weight of

against the Duke than her. The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> was in the

had receiv'd order to make Leavies, to impede those the

soon employ'd them in an Enterprize of greater noise, than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

sate down before it; whereof the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> having intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,

it was indeed a good one, and the coming of it very well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen;
yet its greatness being made more formidable by report, it
is not imagin'd to what a degree the Queen, and those about her
were terrified with its approach. The Duke had taken along with
him for this expedition of <hi>Limousin</hi> but very few Forces; but
the life and soul of the Queens party consisting in his person, and
experience, her Majesty dispatch'd away to him Post after Post,
with so much importunity, that he was in the end constrain'd to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:63412:191"/>
quit all his designs in <hi>Limousin,</hi> to return back to <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesme.</hi>

                  <p>Before the Duke's return, the Archbishop of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> his Son,
who had staid behind to command those Forces, had been left
with the Queen, having intelligence of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>'s

upon that little Town, the situation whereof rendred it
very considerable, there being a stone Bridge over the River <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente:</hi>
though otherwise very weak in it self, and without any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
at all. All which notwithstanding the Archbishop, with
two thousand men, went, and put himself into it with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
either to preserve it, or dye. So that the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
advancing to view it, was entertain'd with so brisk a charge,
that he had no hope of doing any good upon men so well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for their defense. Not therefore to waste time to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
he went on, and took up his quarters at <hi>Chasteu-Neuf</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three Leagues of <hi>Angoulesme;</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

him; so disposing them into places of most advantage, that the
Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> could make no further progress into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
He made indeed some light Skirmishes, but such as won no
great reputation to the one side, or the other, whilst the Peace was

                  </p>
                  <p>It was doubtless by no ordinary conduct, that the Duke of
<hi>Espernon,</hi> with so few Forces as he had about him kept so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
an Army as the King's in play, and to manage the several
sorts of people he had with him, with that dexterity as to keep
them from Mutiny, and Disorder: Such as have been engag'd in
parties where the Royal Name has been oppos'd against them, and
who have commanded men, who have had no less to apprehend
from the Sword of Justice, than from those of the Enemy, will
easily conceive, the Duke had never greater use of his Prudence,
and Valour, than upon this occasion; it being certain, that had
his Authority susser'd by the least accident of that kind, he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly

promise her all the satisfaction she could her self desire; wherein
I have often heard the Duke highly commend not only the

but the <hi>Count de Bethune</hi>'s generosity also, who being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a man of great worth, and honour, could never countenance
so unhandsome an advice. But what one of the King's Ministers,
commanded, and authoriz'd by him, and importun'd by the
Duke's enemies, was asham'd to insist upon, was nevertheless
with great eagerness pursu'd by a person he had very highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd.
It is of <hi>Rucellay</hi> I speak, who ambitious, and puft up with
a vain opinion of himself, and the Services he had perform'd for
the Queen, was impatient, that any one should rival him in the
Queens favour, or take the freedom to oppose his Counsels: And
it will be imagin'd by such as have consider'd the former passages
of the Duke's life, he was not of an humour to be justled, either
in the one, or the other by a man upon all accompts so inferiour
to him. This disparity therefore both in their persons, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which at first begot a coldness only in the Duke (who
was very unwilling (having lov'd, and esteem'd <hi>Rucellay</hi> at a very
particular rate) to withdraw his friendship totally from him) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:63412:192"/>
at last (as it commonly falls out in such cases) to a final
and absolute rupture betwixt them. It was at this time, and upon
this occasion, that I withdrew my self from <hi>Rucellay. Le Plessis,</hi>
thereunto mov'd by the old affection he had born my Father, had
taken me from my studies, to place me with this man, in hopes
that one time or another I might by his favour be introduc'd
into the Queens Family;<note place="margin">A breach betwixt the Duke and <hi>Rucellay.</hi>
                     </note> but finding that after this breach I was
become suspected to him, and that he look'd upon me, as one of
the Duke's creatures, for having only been born in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and recommended to him by one of his domesticks, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>le Plessis</hi> with my discontent, and the desire I had to
withdraw my self from his Service; who approving my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and speaking of me to the Duke, he was thereupon pleas'd
to receive me into his dependence, from whom I never after par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
till his death; nothing but that inevitable necessity having the
power to separate me from him, which was not however till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
three and twenty years, without intermission, I had the honour
to live in his Service. I shall therefore henceforward be able to
speak more regularly, than hitherto I have done, of the Duke, and
his Affairs, as having been an eye-witness of the rest; though I can
almost with the same certainty aver the truth of what I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
deliver'd, the testimony of so many famous Authors, and
what I receiv'd from persons of great repute, now living, who
have been assisting to me in this undertaking, having no less au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with me, than what I have seen with my own eyes, and
collected out of my own obseruation.</p>
                  <p>The Duke was inform'd by the Queen Mother her self of the
importunity wherewith <hi>Rucellay</hi> had press'd her to seize upon the
Castle of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> demonstrating to her at the same time with
how great facility it might be effected. Her Majesty went some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to walk in the Park belonging to the Castle, where being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
as she ever was, without the least scruple, or distrust, she
might, he said, without the least opposition, thrust out the Baron
<hi>d' Anton,</hi> the Duke's Nephew, and under his Authority Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the place; which being done, she would, he told her, be
Mistriss of the Duke's Fortune; whereas one might now (with
much more reason, than at <hi>Blois</hi>) declare her a Prisoner, being as
she was at the discretion of her Vassal: Endeavouring moreover
to render the Duke odious to her, by making his free humour,
and some complaints (the non-performance of some things, had
been promis'd by the Queen, had perhaps extorted from him) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
like affronts, and indignities to her Person, and Honour.
But the Queen (as has been said) nobly rejecting so unhandsome a
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:63412:193"/>
proposition, her self gave the first intimation of it to the Duke;
who incens'd, as he had just cause, at a practice so foul, and an
advice so pernicious to his Affairs, from that time forwards for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
any more, either to speak to, or to treat with <hi>Rucellay;</hi> though
he could by no means consent his Servants, and particularly
<hi>Marsillac</hi> the Captain of his Guard, should revenge the injury by
any outrage upon <hi>Rucellay</hi>'s person, which he absolutely, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
forbad, as to my knowledge it was high time.</p>

dissatisfied with some undecent liberties he had taken in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
to which the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was also highly animated
against him, desiring nothing more, than his removal, or at least
some notable disgrace; and to all this the Treaty of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was then upon the point to be concluded; so that the Bishop
of <hi>Luçon</hi> coming at so opportune a season, could not fail of
thanks on all sides, both from the King, and Queen, how little
soever he contributed to the work, and in the mean time of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infallibly well receiv'd at the Queen Mothers Court. Which in
my opinion was a pretty criticisme in his good fortune, and from
whence he, in the revolution of time, deriv'd all those other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,

into the King's. Yet was it not without highly complaining
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:63412:193"/>
of the ill usage he had receiv'd; nor perhaps without repenting
his carriage towards the Duke, who had been his very good friend,
so long as he behav'd himself civilly to him. A resolution that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
known to the Queen (however her self at that time in great
distress for mony) she sent to present him with thirty thousand
Crowns, as an acknowledgement of the pains he had taken in
her behalf; though he seeming to be more offended at that than
all the rest, that the Queen should think any one could set a price
upon his Services, scornfully refus'd it, and went to put himself
into the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> his protection; where he was by that
Favourite at first receiv'd with great civility and respect, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
into a very eminent degree of favour, and trust, both as
to private, and publick Affairs. The Marquis <hi>de Môny, Rucellay</hi>'s

him to his enemies revenge, than that of the Bishop his Brother
did him) fell wholly at last upon <hi>Richelieu.</hi> The Marquis <hi>de The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi>
a very intimate friend of <hi>Rucellay</hi>'s (though as ill satisfied
as the rest) could not however leave the Queens Court, as being
ty'd there by the obligation of his Command: A consideration
that forcing him to continue there, he would nevertheless let his
absent friend see, how much he interested himself in his disgrace,
by quarrelling with those he conceiv'd had most contributed to
it: Wherein his malice must of necessity be directed against the
Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> and those of his party. Neither did the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
favours they all receiv'd from the Queen, a little add to the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,

granted, but to them, or at their request, who alone absolutely
dispos'd of all Affairs. <hi>Themines</hi> therefore, having resolv'd to take
upon himself the revenge of all the rest, took occasion to require
an explanation from <hi>Richelieu</hi> of some things, of very little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which in the heat of the Debate (as it commonly falls
out) grew at last to an absolute quarrel betwixt them: Wherein
having several times been prevented from fighting, sometimes by

the friends of the one party, and sometimes of the other, one day
the Marquis <hi>de Themines</hi> mounted upon a little pad Nag met <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu</hi>
in the open street; whereupon alighting from his Horse,
they talk'd together, but not long before their Swords were out;
when the Marquis stooping to get under <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s Sword, which
was longer than his, receiv'd a thrust, which running all along
his back, rip'd up the skin only; whilst at the same time he

of a Brother, so affectionate to him, had he liv'd to see him in

should be demolish'd.</p>
                  <p>During the time of this Treaty, the Council had generally
been held in the Duke's Lodgings, where the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi>
was ever very diligent: he came continually to the Duke's Table,
waiting very often in the Parlour, and in his Bed-Chamber, his
vacancies, and leisure, an as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iduity, and respect that promis'd for
the future, an inviolate love and friendship; the Duke also on
his part was infinitely obliging to him, espousing all his Interests,
and declaring himself upon all occasions, highly partial, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
to him: notwithstanding all which, we shall in time
see so strange an alteration in them both, and so antartick to those
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:63412:194"/>
good dispositions betwixt them, as will sufficiently inform us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how
little dependence there is upon the humours of men, when an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate
passion, a little interest, or (which is more light than
either) a meer jealousie, has power in a moment to overthrow the
greatest and most inviolate friendship.</p>
                  <p>Whilst this Treaty was in agitation, there hapned yet another
untoward accident, though no great matter was made of it, and
that was this. A little before the conclusion of the Treaty,<note place="margin">A conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy against the Queen Mother at <hi>Angoulesme</hi> discover'd.</note> a
Powder-maker of <hi>Limousin</hi> came, and made an offer of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to such, as he very well knew were enemies both to the
Queen, and the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> undertaking to insinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Castle of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> and to fire the Powder in the
Magazine; the quantity whereof was so great, as must infallibly
have blown up the whole Town, with the Castle, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them both to ashes: Which fellow, though taken in the
manner, and upon the point to execute his cursed determination,
had nevertheless no greater punishment for his crime, than bare
imprisonment, and that of a few days only, the Queen, it should
seem, desiring no other satisfaction, than that of having escap'd
the danger, nor permitting he should so much as be put to the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>viz.</hi> The Wrack.</note> Question, that she might not be oblig'd to an animosity against
those who had either suggested to him the thought, or encourag'd
him in the execution of so damnable a design: So that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
receiv'd no interruption by this practice, <hi>Bethune</hi> by his dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and prudence, bringing it in the end to a happy conclusion.
All things therefore being resolv'd upon, the King (desiring that
those assurances, had been given to the Queen his Mother by his
Agent, should be further confirm'd to her by some person of
eminent condition and Authority, sent to her on his behalf) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
away the Cardinal <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> whom he knew to
be a man of great conduct, and exceedingly acceptable to her.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, beginning from this time forward to live after the
rate of a man reconcil'd to his Prince, would do all the Honour
he could to his Ministers; and therefore treated the Cardinal, and
<hi>Bethune</hi> with a magnificence that tasted nothing of the incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of the late War: The Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> also desirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the Queens favour,<note place="margin">The Queen Mother comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed from Court. And the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> and to satisfie her that he intended for
the future really to become her Servant, sent to her <hi>Brantes</hi> his
younger Brother, and since Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> to assure her
thereof; by whom he also sent very civil, and obliging Letters to
the Duke of <hi>Espernon:</hi> to which the Marriage that was celebrated
at this time betwixt the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> since Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
and Madam <hi>Christina</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> having given this Prince, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:63412:195"/>
with Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his Brother, accasion also to come pay
their respects to the Queen; her Court seem'd, in that little place,
little inferiour to the Kings at <hi>Paris.</hi> The change of her fortune invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
moreover every day new Servants over to her, every one now
appearing as zealous to obtain her favour, as they had before been
shie, and cold in embracing her interest, and engaging in her
quarrel. Upon which occasion the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much incommodated with the expense of this War (maintain'd
almost throughout at his cost, and by his interest) endeavour'd
nevertheless all he could to turn the best side outward, pouring
out himself in so many magnificences,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon's</hi> magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</note> as perhaps he never had,
in his most flourishing condition, so fair an opportunity of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greatness of his mind, and fortune. After having lodg'd
the Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the Palace belonging to the Bishop of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goulesme,</hi>
furnish'd throughout with his own rich Hangings, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boss'd
with Silver and Gold, he entertain'd them with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of hunting a Stag, presenting them with two very beautiful
Coursers, he had supply'd them with for that Chace. After which
he treated them three several times with so much splendour, and
magnificence, that it could hardly have been greater at <hi>Paris.</hi> The
Tables which were forty times cover'd, were at every covering
serv'd with five several Courses; neither was the profusion less
at the entertainment of the Cardinal <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
wherein if the excess made the Duke's liberality highly
esteem'd, it gave no less reputation to that little Countrey, which
could of it self furnish all sorts of provision in so great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                  <p>It was not by the Cardinal <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> alone that the
Queen Mother was complemented from the King, and assur'd
of his good inclinations, and affection to her; <hi>Luines</hi> who had a
desire so soon as was possible to allure her from <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesme,</hi>
sending moreover thither <hi>le Pere Berulle,</hi> at that time Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Congregation of the Oratory, and since Cardinal, to
settle her mind in a full confidence, and security. This Father, a
man of great Vertue, and no less Capacity, was very acceptable
to the Queen, and in no less esteem with the Duke; to whom he
had another quality of it self sufficient to commend him, which
was his near relation to President <hi>Seguier,</hi> the Duke's most inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
friend. After this person had dispos'd the Queen, so soon as
she could, to come to the King, he afterwards treated at great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and freedom with the Duke in the behalf of the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
from whom he deliver'd him other Letters full of affectionate
expressions; promising him withal in his name all sorts of good
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:63412:195"/>
Offices, and Service; to which the Duke having answer'd with
the same civility, the Queen was in all apparence likely to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
secure, and the Duke very well us'd for the time to come, whose
discontents, as they had been the occasion of the War, their satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
ought in all probability to have settled the Peace of the
Kingdom; though notwithstanding this fair outside of Affairs
we shall see things fall out quite contrary in the ensuing year.</p>
                  <p>But to go on with the Subject in hand,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> sends a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch to the King by the Archbishop of <hi>Tholouze.</hi>
                     </note> the Duke, seeing all
things now perfectly reconcil'd, conceiv'd it very fit for him to
write to the King, to excuse what was pass'd; which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
did, and indeed in terms of very great submission, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
though nevertheless far from any meanness, or so much as
any acknowledgment of the least offense: <q>Wherein he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to his Majesty, that having obey'd the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whom he had ever known passionately solicitous of the
Kingdoms prosperity, he never so much as imagin'd, that the
reverence he should pay to a person so nearly related to him
could be reputed for a Crime: That although in the very act of
taking Arms (to which he found himself oblig'd by an inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
necessity) he might possibly have given his Majesty some
distaste, he nevertheless conceiv'd he had by his behaviour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
so amply justified his good intention, that no impression
ought to remain in his Royal Breast, but what should be to his
advantage: That he could confidently say, that without so much
as ever reflecting upon his own grievances, and disgrace, he had
govern'd his passion from resolutions that might evidently
enough have succeeded; wherein he had sufficiently manifested
the Reverence he bore to his Majesties Name, and Arms, though
in the hands of his own particular enemies: That he call'd all
good <hi>Frenchmen</hi> to the test, whether ever his own interest, or
animosity had transported him to any action contrary to his
duty; and whether he had not ever preserv'd his fidelity unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and pure, during all the disorders of this Kingdom: That
he had now remaining but a short time to live, and that he
should himself conclude he had already liv'd too long, could
he find himself guilty of the least thought contrary to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Service, and his own Duty: That his Conscience being
clear in that particular, he demanded no other recompense for
his Services pass'd, than only a little repose in his old age; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
an occasion wherein he might honourably dye for his
Majesties Service:</q> which was the conclusion of his Letter.
Dated at <hi>Angoulesme</hi> the 7th. of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1619. The Archbishop of
<hi>Tholouze</hi> his Son was dismiss'd away with this dispatch, who had
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:63412:196"/>
also another Letter for the Duke <hi>de Luines,</hi> in answer to those
the Duke had receiv'd before.</p>
                  <p>The Queen in the mean time was preparing for her departure,
but her equipage being not to be made ready so soon as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
at Court, where she was with great impatience expected, the
Duke <hi>de Monbazon,</hi> Father-in-law to <hi>Luines,</hi> had yet time to come
kiss her Majesties hands, which was nevertheless, by giving her
new and greater assurances of all the good usage she could desire,
to press her with the soonest to part from <hi>Angoulesme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Queen Mother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from <hi>Angoulesme</hi> to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King.</note> and to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
her self from the Duke. In the beginning of <hi>August</hi> therefore,
according to the Favourites desire, she departed from <hi>Angoulesme;</hi>
in which Voyage the Duke only attended her to the borders of
his own Government, not caring to engage himself nearer to a
Court, to which he was so lately reconcil'd; where the Queen at
his taking leave, after many gracious expressions of the infinite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
she had to him,<note place="margin">The Queens parting with the Duke, her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, and Present.</note> presented him with a Ring of very great
value; together with a request that he would continually wear it
for her sake, as he did almost to his death: This Ring was a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
cut into a heart, and is at this day reputed one of the finest
and cleanest for its size in <hi>France;</hi> and this was all the Recompense
he receiv'd for his Service he had done the Queen, and for above
two hundred thousand Crowns he was out of purse upon that
accompt, which nevertheless was more than he expected in the
condition she then was; having propos'd to himself in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
no other acknowledgment, and reward, than the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to serve her effectually, and well upon this occasion.</p>
                  <p>The Queen after her departure from <hi>Angoumois,</hi> arriv'd in a few
days at <hi>Cousieres</hi> in <hi>Touraine,</hi> a house belonging to the Duke of
<hi>Monbazon;</hi> where <hi>Luines</hi> (accompanied (like a Favourite) with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
persons of very great quality) came first to wait upon her, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing
her with the greatest civility, and respect imaginable,
as he was also very graciously receiv'd. And here the Queen, who
had no mind to be kept any longer at a distance from the King her
Son, endeavour'd with <hi>Luines</hi> (and that with all the insinuation,
and artifice her haughty and imperious nature would permit) to
remove those difficulties, which, as they had been the causes of
their former separation, were most likely to oppose their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
now. The next day after her arrival,<note place="margin">The King and Queen Mother come to an enterview.</note> the King with all his
Royal houshold came also to <hi>Cousieres,</hi> where at their first enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
there was nothing but mutual manifestations of great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and tenderness on both sides: from whence their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
went the same day to <hi>Tours,</hi> where for some days they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
together; but in the end, after all this dissembled kindness,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:63412:196"/>
the King returning towards <hi>Paris,</hi> left the Queen more dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to see her self oblig'd to go to <hi>Angers,</hi> after so many assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that had been given her she should no more depart from
Court,<note place="margin">From whence she departs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied.</note> than she had been before pleas'd with these demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Honour and Respect, wherewith they had endeavour'd
to deceive her credulity, and to flatter her sincere intention.</p>
                  <p>From thenceforward therefore she so far resented <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ines</hi> his ill
usage,<note place="margin">The Queen Mother dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to a new War.</note> as to meditate a revenge, and how by a second War to
procure, what by this first Peace, she saw, she could not obtain;
neither was the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> (become now absolute with
her) sorry to see her so dispos'd: He consider'd, that whilst his
Mistriss remain'd thus excluded from Court, her power being so
small, his could not consequently be very great; a consideration
that made this aspiring spirit, who already had propos'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
no less than the Government of the Kingdom, suffer, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
with greater impatience, than the Queen her self, those ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles
that he saw were oppos'd to the level of his haughty Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
and vast designs.</p>
                  <p>Animated therefore with these reflections, he began to labour a
good intelligence betwixt such, as he knew were dissatisfied with
the present Government, to re-unite them in the Queens Interest,
as discontented as they: Neither was it any hard matter to win
many over to her side, the happy issue the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had
single, and alone, procur'd to this Princesses Affairs, having got him
so great a reputation, that the major part of the great ones of the
Kingdom made no great difficulty of engaging in a cause, they had
seen so easily, and by so little means to succeed. Of this number
was the <hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> and the Countess his Mother, the Dukes
of <hi>Longueville,</hi> and <hi>Vandosme,</hi> the Grand Prior of <hi>France,</hi> the
Dukes of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and <hi>Retz,</hi> with many other Princes, and
Lords of very eminent condition. Had the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> not
been concern'd in the first business, he could never have been
drawn into this; so many confederates of almost equal quality,
giving him to apprehend more from their ill intelligence betwixt
one another, than he could reasonably hope from their union:
but the Queen, who repos'd her chiefest confidence in him, who
had already made trial of his Service, and found it so successful to
her, did so ply him with reiterated favours, and entreaties, that
he could not handsomly avoid engaging in her behalf. Neither
had he so long stood off, that he had fewer particular grievances
than the rest; but having engag'd his Faith to the Duke <hi>de Luines,</hi>
it would have been almost impossible to have perswaded him to
break his word, had not <hi>Luines</hi> himself given the first example:
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:63412:197"/>
and on that side it was, that the Queen assaulted the Duke, by
representing to him the non-performances of those things
had been promis'd, and that as it had been principally through
his assistance she had obtain'd all that had been granted to her,
she expected he should see the Articles of the Treaty fulfill'd; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to perswade him, that his own honour was no less
interested therein, than her satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>And that he might the better taste her reasons, she fail'd not to
prepossess him with all sorts of civilities, and favour, honouring
him with some presents, whereof one was a very fine Watch, set
all over with Diamonds, and very curiously wrought; which
she accompanied with a Letter as kind, as could possibly be writ
upon such an occasion, wherein, amongst other obliging expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
she told him: <q>
                        <hi>That the Diamonds, wherewith it was embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
were not more firm than her affection, and that he might as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
himself the Services she had receiv'd from his generosity, should
ofter come into her memory, than the hand of that Watch should point
out hours every day:</hi>
                     </q> To which words (which were, it seems,
the way of writing at that time, and none of my invention) I
have neither added, nor diminish'd: But by this complement, and
several other testimonies of affection, and esteem, the Queen ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
awak'd the passion the Duke had to give her always all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,<note place="margin">The Queen Mother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engages the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> in her quarrel.</note>
she gave him consecutively a full accompt of her deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
of all the persons of quality she had made to her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and of the powerful means she intended to make use of to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instate
her self in that degree of honour, which was due to her
Person, and Dignity: Whereupon the Duke considering this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
action, as dependent upon the first, solemnly engag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and made an absolute promise, once more to serve her.</p>
                  <p>If the Queen was thus diligent to form,<note place="margin">Anno 1620.</note> and redintegrate her
party, <hi>Luines,</hi> on the other side, was no less industrious now, than
he had been before,<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de Luin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> to break and disunite it. He very well knew
the Queen to be discontent, which she had her self so publickly
profess'd; that could be no secret: He was moreover inform'd,
that most of the great persons in the Kingdom had engag'd with
her; and though he doubted not, but that the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
from whom she had for the time pass'd receiv'd so many good
Offices, continued still his ancient fidelity to her; yet would he
notwithstanding feel his pulse by <hi>la Croix de Bleré,</hi> whom he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
away to him to that purpose. This Gentleman therefore
comes to the Duke to <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> in the time of the Carnaval;
where he found him taken up with entertainments, that nothing
relish'd of the meditation of an approaching War, making merry
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:63412:197"/>
with the Company of the Town, which at this Festival was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
with several Families of the neighbouring Gentry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>La Croix,</hi> who would by all means make use of his dexterity, to
sound the Duke's intention, met with a person in him, that was
not easie to be pry'd into; so that the Duke, after having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
with him, in general terms, of the Queen Mothers Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
and Affairs; and having return'd a civil answer to <hi>Luines</hi> his
Complement, dismiss'd his Ambassadour, perfectly instructed of
what he conceal'd from none, and of what he did not care <hi>Luines</hi>
himself should know.</p>
                  <p>The first Essay having given the Favourite no great satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who already saw, that Affairs began to grow hot, with the
season; that the <hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> with the Countess his Mother,
had left the Court, that the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had done the
same, and that the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> and the Brothers of
<hi>Vandosme</hi> were already in their Government in actual Arms: He
would therefore be no longer in suspense, what he was to expect
from the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who of all others he had the greatest
mind to withdraw from the Queen Mothers Interest; well enough
foreseeing, that if the youth and inexperience of most of the
other Lords were not govern'd by his prudence, they would be
easie enough to deal withal.<note place="margin">And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> He therefore dispatch'd away <hi>Toiras</hi>
(since <hi>Mareschal</hi> of <hi>France</hi>) to treat with him obout this Affair.
The Duke was then at his house of <hi>Plassac</hi> in <hi>Xaintonge</hi> (since
famous for his disgraces) making private Leavies, by the assistance
of his Friends; to whom he had given instructions to make sure
of their own people, without nevertheless telling them what they
were to be employ'd about, till his further order. <hi>Toiras</hi> had here
in Commission to tell him: <q>That the Duke <hi>de Luines,</hi> absolutely
relying upon his friendship since their late reconciliation, could
not give credit to some reports he had heard to the contrary; that
since that time he had not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ail'd the least in any of the good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
the Duke had requir'd at his hands; that all his Commands,
Pensions, and Assignments of Offices, had been in part already
paid, and should suddenly be fully discharg'd: That for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he should be maintain'd in all their functions, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
more advantageously, than hitherto he had ever been:
That if yet all this fair dealing was too little to satisfie him, let
him but say what he would have, and that <hi>Monsieur de Luines</hi>
would endeavour to procure it for him: That in the mean time
he only conjur'd him to separate himself from the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Interest, with whom he had now no reasonable pretense to
engage: That he had already serv'd her so well, and so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:63412:198"/>
acquitted himself of all he had undertaken in her behalf,
as thereby to acquire the esteem, and commendation of even
his greatest enemies: That therefore he ought not to expose a
reputation, wherein he had no rival, to the hazard of being
overthrown, and blemish'd by some sinister disgrace: That all
things had been perform'd, had been promis'd the Queen in
the Treaty of <hi>Angoulesme;</hi> but that nothing could satisfie some
ambitious spirits about her, who doubtless possess'd her, she
was not well us'd, if not permitted to rule in Chief.</q> The Duke
having given <hi>Toiras</hi> audience for two days together, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
himself, and having entertain'd him by intervals with
shewing him some Garden Instruments, an employment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he said he intended to pass away the remainder of his life, he at
last drew him aside, where he told him: <q>That he was too brave
a Gentleman to be otherwise dealt withal, than with a free, and
open heart: That in truth he had some reason in his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
(whatever might be said to the contrary) to complain of
not having receiv'd, both as to his own, and his friends concerns,

attended a Civil War, which he had ever had in great

to command his assistance in her removal from <hi>Blois,</hi> and
having further honour'd him by making use of his person, and
those of his friends for the recovery of her Dignity, the violation
of those things had been granted to her, must necessarily reflect
as much upon him, if not more, than upon her Majesty her
self: That notwithstanding he demanded nothing in his own
behalf, let them only contrive how to satisfie the Queen, and
that being done, he promis'd <hi>Mounsieur de Luines</hi> to be his

who were engag'd in the Queens party were already in Arms, he
follow'd their example, and brought his Troops also into the

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:63412:198"/>
debate in the Queens Council, how they should dispose of her
Majesties person. The Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who had a very good
Army in <hi>Guienne,</hi> mov'd with great fervency, that she might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
her self into his Government, where he had gather'd together
above eighteen hundred effective men: but the Duke of
<hi>Espernon</hi> understanding his design was to be Master of the
Queens person, the better at her expense, and the Lords of her
Party to make his own conditions, would by no means allow of
that proposition; neither had there been no jealousie in the case,
could he have approv'd that counsel; he consider'd that the Queen
Mothers absence, and departure from <hi>Angers</hi> in so critical a jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
would be interpreted a flight, which would very much
discredit her Affairs, and by which occasion, besides the loss of
reputation (wherein commonly consists the event of War) she
would infallibly lose all the Provinces betwixt the Rivers of <hi>Loire,</hi>
and <hi>Garonne,</hi> which were now wholly at her devotion, and might
be disputed a great while. For which reasons he concluded it
much better, and more advantageous to the Queens Service, to
unite those Forces he had, with those of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
and to march them away to <hi>Angers</hi> to joyn with the Queen, who
being re-inforc'd with five and twenty thousand men at least,
that they were able to make up betwixt them, would be in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to reduce the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> to reason; which ought to be
the true intent of their Arms, and not the particular Interests of
particular men; who, as they had only taken them up in her name,
were to use them only for her Service.</p>
                  <p>Doubtless had this latter advice been receiv'd, the King's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
would have found enough to do: But the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi>
who had no mind to have persons of the Duke's condition, and
capacity, so near the Queen, for fear of falling from the place he
had in her confidence, and esteem, could by no means consent
either that she should depart from <hi>Angers,</hi> or that the Duke of
<hi>Espernon</hi> should go thither to her. The knowledge he had of the
Duke's free and unbyass'd humour, made him apprehend, he
should be by him sometimes contradicted in his opinions, and by
that means be no more absolute Master of the Queens Counsels:
so that dextrously spinning out the time, without coming to any
positive resolution, the Duke grew weary of these delays, and
unwilling to let his Forces unprofitably moulder away in <hi>Xain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonge,</hi>
and <hi>Angoumois</hi> (Countreys that yet smarted with the last
years War) he departed thence to quarter them more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously

himself reason to complain of the ill usage he had receiv'd under
her administration; during whose Regency, <hi>Conchini</hi> had clap'd
him up in prison; from whence <hi>Luines,</hi> presently after the King's
coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> got him releas'd: An obligation, which, as it
was great in it self, was soon after repaid with as grateful a return.
The Prince had found by his own experience, what an influence
the Royal name has upon all parts of the Kingdom, very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
how easie it had been for his Majesty to have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd

out of which observation he advis'd the King, suddenly
to mount to Horse, and to go in person to <hi>Caen,</hi> which was the
nearest of the revolted Cities; wherein what the Prince had so
judiciously foreseen, as happily succeeded, <hi>Caen</hi> surrendring almost
without any resistance, <hi>Prudent,</hi> who commanded there for the

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63412:199"/>

oppos'd the uniting of her Forces, and diverted such as were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

same. Upon the breaking out of this second War, as in the first,
he had been there invested with a very considerable Army; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had they fail'd, as before, to stir up the Inhabitants (whose
inclinations commonly change with the fortune of those that
command them) to mutiny against him. Of which practice the
Marquis having intelligence on all hands, that the people had a
design upon his person, and that despising his weakness, (who
to spare their purses, and to win their affections, had forbore to
quarter any Souldiers upon them) they talk'd loud of opening
their Gates, and letting the King's Army into the City; he was
constrain'd by the truth, and importance of this advice, to deal
with some Captains of the old Regiments of that very Army
that came against him: In the old body of which Army there
were very few Officers who were not the Duke his Fathers Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and who stood not oblig'd to him for their Fortune, and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63412:200"/>
Commands; whereof some fifteen or twenty deserted the Royal
Arms, to go serve him in this extremity of danger; some sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him in Squadrons by their Serjeants, and others bringing
over their whole Companies: so that by an act of honourable
gratitude (the example whereof is not nevertheless to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
approv'd) they brought him over in one night above fifteen
hundred men of the best Souldiers in the Army. With this relief
(seeing the Town upon the point of a total Revolt) he attempted,
by disarming the Inhabitants, to secure his own Fortune, which
he accordingly perform'd, and that without any notable violence;
for having dispos'd his men into the most advantageous Posts of
the City, he made Proclamation that at the beat of Drum, upon
a penalty impos'd, every one should bring their Arms into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

with some five and twenty or thirty Gentlemen, mounted on
horseback to be ready in such places, where he had information,
some bustle was like to be; a precaution that was not altogether
necessary, the people being so daunted at his resolution, as with a
stupid silence, and sheepish tameness, with a submission greater
now, than their insolence had been before, quietly giving up
their Arms; by which means they remain'd incapable of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

retain'd a will to do it.</p>

him at his mercy, should take some notable revenge of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
he had done him, could not so soon resolve to lay down his
Arms. He could much rather have been content to have possess'd
the Duke with the same apprehensions, and to have engag'd him
with him in some violent extreme, thereby to procure their own
conditions: to which purpose he also sent to sound his inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to represent to him their common danger, if they did
not provide for the security of their lives, and fortunes, before they
parted with their Swords out of their hands: but the Duke sent
him word again,<note place="margin">Who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to stir.</note> 
                     <q>That his resolution was already taken, and

was satisfied: That he hop'd his Majesties Clemency would easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extend it self to all his Subjects, who should not obstinately
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63412:200"/>
persist in their disobedience: That therefore he could give
<hi>Monsieur de Mayenne</hi> no other advice, than that he had taken
himself; which, though it should not succeed well with him, he
had rather be ill us'd whilst he could justifie himself innocent,
than after having committed a fault that would render him cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
beyond all excuse.</q> By which answer the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi>
seeing he had set up his rest in this determination, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself too weak alone to wrestle with the King's Name and
Power, he was in the end fain to submit, and to return to his
Duty: wherein nevertheless his Majesty, who knew after what
manner both the one, and the other proceeded, as highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> as he blam'd the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One would have said that this great disorder in the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Affairs, wherein so many persons, and those of so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
condition were engag'd, only hapned to set a greater value,
and lustre upon the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s conduct. In the first War,
alone, and unassisted by any, he so manag'd the few Forces he
had, as without giving ground to his adversaries, he ever kept
himself in a posture to resist them, and so as in the end to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
reasonable Conditions, not only for the Queen, but also
for himself, and his friends, without ever submitting to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
discretion; whereas in this there was no reservation for any,
insomuch that of all the great men who were engag'd in this last
business, there was not one who lay not open, and expos'd to the
utmost severity of the King's justice, had he been pleas'd to have
proceeded against them. 'Tis true notwithstanding that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in his Clemency pardon'd every one; but it was meerly an
effect of his own goodness, without any obligation upon him,
either by writing, or the least promise at all.</p>
                  <p>The King assur'd of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s obedience, and
finding by his late signal advantages, how much his own presence
had contributed to the success of his own Affairs, taking his
measures from thence, what he might promise to himself by the

(who was very well at Court, and exceedingly solicitous
of the Duke his Kinsmans Interest) came to see the Duke at <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi>
to assure him he might be very kindly receiv'd by the King.
The Duke had never so much as desir'd any such security, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
he had been in the King's bounty, and his own deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
nevertheless confirm'd in the hope of so gracious a rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
from so good a hand, they departed together from the
Duke's Lodgings,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> presents himself to the King, and asks his pardon.</note> to go directly to the King's: Where the Duke
was no sooner seen to enter, but all the Court flock'd to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty;
so that I have heard the Duke say, that seeing the crowd
there was to observe his reception, and to hear what he would say
for his excuse, he strain'd his voice much louder than he us'd to
do, to satisfie the curiosity of the standers by; telling the King
in few words: <q>That he never thought it a disservice to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to serve the Queen his Mother; but that since he had been so
unhappy, as to have incurr'd his Majesties displeasure, he most
humbly begg'd his Pardon; protesting that the Grace he should
be pleas'd to grant him upon this occasion, should be the last of
this nature he would ever ask of him, so long as he had life,
there being no pretense, nor consideration whatsoever, that
should ever have the power to separate him from any interest,
wherein he should see his Majesties name, and person engag'd.</q>
A promise that he from that time forward inviolably observ'd, as
we shall hereafter see. The Duke was kneel'd down when he first
began to speak, but the King raising him at the first word, and
embracing him at the end of this short speech; his Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd:
That he was confident he would be as good as his word,<note place="margin">And is very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him with great demonstrations of favour, and esteem:

him that he might go visit the Duke <hi>de Luines;</hi> betwixt whom
at their meeting there pass'd great civilities on both sides, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
assurances of reciprocal affection. And that very day the Duke
executed his command of Colonel in the King's Lodgings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
orders from the King's own mouth to carry them to the
Regiment of Guards. The next day his Majesty commanded
him to go prepare his entry into St. <hi>Iean d' Angely,</hi> a City in his
Government, but held by those of the Religion, and into which
he had never till now been receiv'd; so that he saw himself at the
same time, not only restor'd to his old Commands, but also by a
particular favour from his Majesty, authoriz'd in places, where, as

The Duke was surpriz'd at so extraordinary, and so unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
favours but much more when he understood it was in part,
through <hi>Rucellay's</hi> good Offices, that he receiv'd them; who
though they had not parted very kindly (as you may have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd)
could not nevertheless forbear upon all occasions to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the Duke's generosity and vertue, and to manifest the desire

                     </gap> great confidence in
him, and was the rather enclin'd to credit all the good things he
said of the Duke, by how much his testimony (upon the terms
they then stood) was no ways to be suspected. The Duke antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
by so many good Offices, was as careful to let <hi>Rucellay</hi> know
how exceeding kindly he took them at his hands; so that from a
violent feud, their hot spirits being re-united in a very particular
friendship, the Duke receiv'd very great assistance from <hi>Rucellay,</hi> in
an Affair wherein he was very highly concern'd. And that was the
re-establishment of those Captains, who had forfeited their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands

he order'd all things so admirably well, and with such magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
that his Majesty could hardly have been better entertain'd
in any part of the Kingdom. The noble Furniture, wherewith
this house did abound, was now all brought out: The Kings
Apartment hung round with Hangings emboss'd all over with
Gold, as also ten Chambers more were furnish'd with the same,
to which the Beds of Cloth of Gold and Embroidery were rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suited; neither was the delicacy, rarity, or plenty of provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
inferiour to this outward Pomp. All the Favourites Ministers,
and others of the greatest quality at Court, were commodiously
lodg'd in this stately House, and the Provisionary Officers there
found what was not elsewhere to be seen in the Kingdom; which
was a vast series of Offices under ground, so large, and so well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with lights, that they were astonish'd at so prodigious an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Accommodations; which are indeed, if not the chiefest
ornament, at least the greatest convenience of a Building.</p>
                  <p>After his Majesty had ftaid two days at <hi>Cadillac,</hi>

that the Council of this little Countrey would think fit to submit
to his Royal pleasure, without obliging him to perform that
Voyage; to quicken which resolution his Majesty had pass'd the
River of <hi>Garonne,</hi> which, though when on the other side he was
advanc'd no more than a League only beyond <hi>Cadillac,</hi> he thought

where his presence produc'd the same effect it had done in other
places; he overran all this little Province, seizing as he pass'd of

<hi>Olleron,</hi> principal Cities of that Countrey; he subverted all their
ancient customs, restor'd the Bishop, and other Ecclesiasticks to
their Estates, and Dignities; took away the administration of
the Affairs of the Country from those of the Reform'd Religion,
and re-establish'd his own Authority: but he left the Government
of the Province in the hands of the Marquis <hi>de la Force</hi> since <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal</hi>
of <hi>France;</hi> who, impatient to see his Authority cut so
short by these alterations, could hardly forbear till the King was
got back to <hi>Paris,</hi> from reducing things again to the same posture
they were in before. He was very confident that his Majesty,
who had already try'd the ill ways of <hi>Bearne,</hi> would never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
by his Ministers to undertake a second Journey into that
Countrey, for the resettlement of his Affairs. He knew that the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot</hi>
Faction were ready to find his Majesty enough to do nearer
home, and did not believe, that without his immediate presence
they could compel him to any thing he had not a mind to in his
own Government, where his Authority was establish'd not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a long habitude he had there contracted; but much more
by a passionate concurrence of the whole Body, and of all the
Orders of the Province, who agreed with him in the same Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
He therefore labour'd all Winter to drive out the Garrisons

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> pass'd away the same Winter in <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>

Addition; wherein he was nothing deceiv'd, it being impossible
he could any way oblige him more. The Duke look'd upon this,
as the supreme height, and accomplishment of all the prosperities
he had left to desire; he had already by his Merit, and Services,
united a considerable number of the greatest Honours, and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
Commands of the Kingdom in his own person, which he
had moreover procur'd in survivance for his Posterity: so that
nothing remain'd to render him fully satisfied with his Fortune,

upon the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> as a disinterested person, and capable
of the greatest undertaking, he propos'd him to the King for this
employment; who well approving of his choice, the charge of
this expedition (wherein his Majesty seem'd more than ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern'd) was forthwith committed to his care.</p>
                  <p>Neither,<note place="margin">The Duke receives his Commission.</note> if his Majesty conferr'd herein a signal honour upon
the Duke, can it be deny'd, but that he made as fortunate a choice
for himself, and for the advantage of his Affairs. The Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
his Order at <hi>Cadillac</hi> by <hi>la Saludie,</hi> which was only in paper,
without any assignation either of men, or money, wherewithal
to begin the work, but a great clutter of Commissions, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
only; so that the whole weight of the King's design lean'd
absolutely upon his Interest and Wisdom; which it was happy
were so considerable, things had not else succeeded as they did:
but the Duke had so great a desire to confirm the King in the good
opinion he had already entertain'd of his Loyal Intentions, that
there was nothing he would not attempt, to let his Majesty see,
he was neither unworthy of this present Favour, nor unmindful
of his former Grace, and Goodness.</p>
                  <p>Having therefore wisely consider'd, that diligence must strike

is, that most of these were of <hi>Guienne,</hi> where the Duke had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do, and liv'd only in the quality of a private person; and
that though the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> (who could not without an eye

serve under any other than himself) did (it may be imagin'd) all
he could to disswade people from going in; the conflux was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
so great, that it seem'd the Province had sent all the brave
Gentlemen it could make to attend the Duke in this expedition.</p>
                  <p>And these were indeed almost all the Forces he had; neither
had he so many Foot, as Gentlemen in his Army: 'Tis true that
Camp-Master <hi>Vignoles,</hi> who commanded some Troops in <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
had orders to bring them over to him; and that himself (as
has been said) had Commissions in his hands, for the raising new
Leavies; but his diligence supply'd the place of a good Army,
by which he also effected more, than he could have done with
greater preparations: all the other Forces he made use of, being
only ten Companies of the Regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> that he found
Quarter'd about <hi>Ortez:</hi> so that it is no less to be wonder'd at he
should undertake so hard a task, with so small means to effect it,

sent the Baron of <hi>Arros,</hi> 
                     <q>To entreat him not to be too precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
in the execution of the King's Commands, and to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to him, that he was ready to do whatever his Majesty
should please to appoint: That he had already sent a dispatch
to the King to that effect, and that he hop'd the Court would
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:63412:204"/>
be so satisfied with his submissions, as to spare him the trouble
of a tedious Journey, his friends a great deal of inconvenience,
and the people the disturbance, and oppression a War must of
necessity bring upon them; adding withal the ancient friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and alliance betwixt them: To which the Duke (who
was already advanc'd far on his way) return'd answer: That
having undertaken that Voyage upon no other accompt than
his Majesties command, he should be very ready to return upon
the first orders he should receive: That except what concern'd
the interest of his Majesties Service, he was <hi>Monsieur de la Force</hi>'s
Friend, and Servant: That he had not sought that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against him, and that he should be exceeding glad to hear
his Majesty was satisfied with his submissions: But that till then
he should not delay a minute the execution of the Orders he had
receiv'd; no consideration either of his own, his friends, or
any other person under the Sun, being of force to divert him in
the least from his Duty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This first Embassy having therefore taken no effect, it was soon
seconded by another, of which one <hi>Charles</hi> the principal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>Bearne</hi> was the Bearer. <q>This person, in the quality of a
Deputy from the Countrey, was sent to represent to him the
sterility of the Countrey, the poverty of the Inhabitants, and
difficulty of the ways, and the resolution of the people to make
a smart resistance, should they (who were at present in as good
a disposition as could be desir'd) be urg'd to the last extremes:
but the Duke having flatly told him, that the end of his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was to cause the King to be obey'd, and to chastise all
those that should rebel against him:</q> He was sent back very
much astonish'd at so brisk a reply.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis <hi>de la Force</hi> that perhaps expected no better a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
from his deputations (having been well enough acquainted
with the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> to know he was not a man easie to
be impos'd upon) would therefore make what preparation he
could to oppose him: but he found so general a fear, and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
among the people, that he evidently saw it was to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
his own ruine, should he expect the Duke's coming into his
Government.<note place="margin">The sudden terror of the <hi>Bearnois.</hi>
                     </note> The <hi>Bearnois</hi> had no sooner heard the Duke's
name, but that they gave themselves for lost; their haughty, and
declar'd insolence, with which they had a few days before over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
the King's Order, and trodden his Authority under foot,
and their high Vaunts, that they would defend their Religion, and
their Countreys liberty to the last man, were converted into a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
terror; so that on a sudden whole Cities were left desolate,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:63412:204"/>
men of the best quality among them, with their Wives, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
seeking their safety in their flight, out of a just appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of all the punishments an offended Prince might reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
inflict upon a mutinous, and disobedient people.</p>
                  <p>In this general consternation of the <hi>Bearnois</hi> the Duke drew
near to <hi>Ortez,</hi> the first City in Rebellion he met upon his way;
the Castle whereof was of it self very strong, and had of late
been moreover fortified, and furnish'd with all necessaries of
War,<note place="margin">As also of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery.</note> which also shut up the pass of the whole Countrey, and
was of so advantageous a situation, as was very easie to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
but those within, what countenance soever they had before
put on of a resolute defense, no sooner heard the Duke had sent
for Cannon from <hi>Navarrens</hi> to force them, but they presently
surrendred without staying till they could be brought up.</p>
                  <p>This success was of no little importance to the Duke, who, had
he met with much opposition in this first enterprize, having but
ten Foot Companies wherewith to form a Siege, no Officers to
serve his Artillery, little Ammunition, no Victual, Money, or
any other means to subsist four days in a place; had been in great
danger of being stop'd from making any further progress into the
Countrey. All which difficulties though he had beforehand very
well consider'd, and foreseen, he would notwithstanding try the
experiment, knowing very well, that in matters of War, all
was not always to be expected from an enemy, he either could, or
should do. And from this success he took his measures of what
he might promise to himself in reducing the other Garrisons; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doubting from that time forwards, but he should bring all
his other enterprizes to an honourable and successful issue.</p>
                  <p>As the business of <hi>Ortez</hi> had given the Duke very good hopes
of his expedition, so it totally overthrew those of the Marquis
<hi>de la Force,</hi> who no sooner had intelligence of the surrender of
this place, but that he made haste to be gone, that he might not
be hemm'd in with the Duke's Forces; whilst the Duke on the
other side, to make his advantage of the astonishment the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
his flight must of necessity leave the whole Country in, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
with all diligence from <hi>Ortez</hi> to <hi>Olleron,</hi> where some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
had lately been made, which were also at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
deserted, without the least shew of opposition. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
fellow, a Souldier, and a Provençal, had been the main
director in this work, where he suffred himself to be surpriz'd;
so that the Duke, who was oblig'd to make some example, was
not sorry this wretch should expiate for all the rest, as according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he did, being condemn'd by a Council of War, and hang'd at
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:63412:205"/>
his own Barricado, where the poor fellow at his death lamented
the ill fortune he had to be born a <hi>Provençal;</hi> declaring he was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd
to the Duke's antiquated hatred to those of his Countrey,
and that his Bitth was his greatest Crime, though it was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
altogether untrue.</p>
                  <p>After this there being neither judgment to be pass'd, nor exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
to be done,<note place="margin">The Duke quiets <hi>Bearne</hi> in a very short time.</note> the Duke went to <hi>Nay,</hi> to <hi>Salies,</hi> to <hi>Sauveterre,</hi>
and lastly to <hi>Pau;</hi> where the fear of his severity, that had before
frighted every one from his habitation, being converted into an
absolute confidence in his Clemency, and Goodness, every one
return'd to his own home. The Cities, which at his coming had
been almost totally deserted, were on a sudden re inhabited; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that from that time forward all the Duke had to do, was
only to receive the tenders, and protestations of their obedience,
and to set down some Rules for their Civil Regiment; which
was order'd with so much Justice, and Wisdom, or so fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at least, the equality of all things was so entirely preserv'd, and
he took such care to reconcile the Interests of Religion (wherein
the incompatibility had been so great before, and had with so much
heat fomented their divisions) that both parties were satisfied with
the equal shares he divided betwixt them in the publick admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;
since which time there has been no revolt, nor commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in that Province, it having ever since continued in peace and
obedience, under the Justice of the Duke's Discipline, which is
there inviolately observ'd to this day.</p>
                  <p>And all this was perform'd in less than three weeks time, his
Journey thither, his stay there, and his return thence, being in
all not two months expedition; neither did it cost the King twelve
thousand Livers,<note place="margin">And at very little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense.</note> I having seen the Accompt of the Army, which
did not in all arise to that little summe. 'Tis true withal that the
Duke reckon'd nothing upon his own account, contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with causing some Officers to be paid, that at his instance had
serv'd upon this occasion. So that, by the influence of his own
name only, he so settled this Province in his Majesties obedience,
that it is at this time, however the most remote, perhaps the most
quiet, and obedient Member of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>If the Duke was careful to keep his own hands clean, in what

                  <p>His Majesty thought the Duke to be most busie in the Affairs

his Majesty was already grappled with those of the Religion,
and had laid Siege to St. <hi>Iean d' Angely,</hi> take any rest, till he had
travell'd from the remotest part of the Kingdom, to expose his
life for his Service, in those occasions wherein he saw his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Person, and Honour so far engag'd: The Leaguer had been
near a month set down, when the Duke arriv'd, and the King's
Forces were so much cool'd in their first ardour, that in all appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the enterprize was not over-suddenly to be effected; when
the Duke's arrival very much chang'd the face of Affairs: Nor
do I add this to attribute any thing to him, that is not justly
his due; he has so much honour besides, I do not need to forge
so small an addition to his Fame: neither on the other side, the
thing being perfectly true, ought he to be depriv'd of any particle
of his right.</p>
                  <p>The Duke having at his arrival receiv'd from the King the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
due to his conduct in this expedition of <hi>Bearne,</hi> and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
from his own mouth of his Majesties high satisfaction,
whereof he had before receiv'd very favourable testimonies in the
several dispatches had been sent him: He humbly entreated his
Majesty, that he might for the future have the honour to serve in
his own Army, and attending upon his own Person; and that
he would further be pleas'd, wherein his Majesty should vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to employ his Service, that he might have the priviledge to
receive his Commands immediately from his own mouth: a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that he easily obtain'd. Now the reason why the Duke made
this request, was, because a little before the Kings departure from
<hi>Paris,</hi>

                     </note> the Duke <hi>de Luines</hi> (as Favourite, not being satisfied with
his Fortune, unless he rais'd it above all the other great men of
the Kingdom) had made suit to be honour'd with the Dignity of
Constable of <hi>France:</hi> to arrive at which degree (which he
might well foresee would create him much envy) having had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to make use of the Duke <hi>de l' Esdiguieres,</hi> he would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
his Gratitude for the good Offices he had receiv'd at his hands
upon that occasion, by dividing with him the Employments of
this brave Command; wherein reserving to himself the honour
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:63412:206"/>
and emoluments of the place: The Duke <hi>de l' Esdiguieres,</hi> under
the Title of <hi>Mareschal General de Camp,</hi> executed all the Functions,
and trouble of it. The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> therefore, finding at his
coming to this Siege so many Commanders in Chief, represented
to his Majesty: <q>That since he had first had the honour to be in
Armies, he had never been commanded by any but the Kings his
Masters, nor had ever receiv'd Orders, but from them: That
therefore iin the age he now was, he should be very froward,
and refractory, to lose that advantage, and to be subjected to
the <hi>Mareschal de l' Esdiguieres,</hi> whose worth, though he had in
high honour and esteem, he believ'd nevertheless, that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal</hi>
himself would not pretend to be above him: That he
was both an older General, an older Officer of the Crown, and
of much longer standing, than the other, in all the Dignities to
which they had both been advanc'd; and that therefore he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
himself his Majesty would not deprive him of a preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
due to his age, whereunto the Kings his Predecessors had
rais'd him, and wherein they had so long maintain'd him, which
was the only thing he had to desire of his Majesty, that he
might live satisfied in his Service.</q> Neither did the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tick
franckly to gratifie him in his request, which was also allowed to
be so reasonable by all, that even those whose interest it had been
to dispute it, chearfully acquiesc'd in his design.</p>
                  <p>After this the Duke going to view the Leaguer, he especially
staid at that Post, where the Marquis <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son (who
had one of the approaches committed to his Conduct) comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Chief, and where not being able to contain himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the discretion of a Superficial Survey, the present danger cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
up his wonted Valour, and the frost of old Age, not being of
force to freeze his natural heat, he had no sooner spy'd in the
Trenches one of the eldest Captains of the Regiment of Guards,
but that calling him to him, he made him mount with him upon
the Parapet, at open view of the Enemy, to consider the strength,
and situation of the place with the order of the Siege. Those
who were with him, were not a little troubled to see him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any necessity expose himself to so manifest a peril; neither did
they fail (though they from the Town sufficiently shew'd him
that, by the numerous Musquet-shot they made at him) to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to him several times the danger he was in: but he, taking no
notice of them that press'd him in vain to retire, continued still
his discourse with the Captain, shewing him here and there what
he observ'd to be well, or ill dispos'd in the order of the Leaguer,
with as much indifferency, as he had been in the securest place in
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:63412:206"/>
the world: a piece of bravery, 'tis said, the old Souldier could
have been well content to have been excus'd from; it being, as
he conceiv'd, very much out of season: when the Duke having
told him in the end, that it was fit they should let the young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
see, their white Beards were not to be frighted away with noise,
he came down at last, to the astonishment of all in the Trenches,
who saw the action, that he could carry it with that unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and strange security, in so desperate a place.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, having thus taken a view of the Town,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> applye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

instructions for their further proceeding in their Works; which
the Marquis his Son executed with so extraordinary diligence, that
they had soon made their approaches to the very graff of the City,
and had nothing left to do, but to open their Trench. We were in
those times very raw in Sieges, and the way of opening a Trench
was so new, that very few knew which way to go about that
kind of Service; wherein the Duke highly manifested his courage
and experience, and to such a degree, that all the rest, who had
hitherto had the ordering of the Siege, seem'd only Spectators of
his conduct, all the other works either totally ceasing, or being
but negligently carried on, and his only going forward; as indeed
it was on that part that the Town was taken.</p>
                  <p>Having therefore set a time for the opening the Trench, which
was St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Eve, the Duke went that morning very early to the
Trenches; and having the night before prepar'd all things ready
for his design, and amongst other things given order to the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Artillery, to play their Cannon by break of day to
beat down the defenses of the City, he was by the noise of this
Battery call'd up from his Quarters. The Enemy on the other
side, having intelligence of what was intended against them, had
prepar'd to make a resolute resistance; so that though the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
which, from two Batteries rais'd upon the very edge of the
Graffe, had in two hours time by near upon five hundred shot
made great ruines in the Walls, yet had they not prevail'd so far,
but there were still two Flanckers remaining, which cut the Duke
off a great many very worthy men, as well of his own Domestick
Servants,<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Musquet-shot before <hi>St. Iean d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was at the opening this Trench wounded by a Musquet-shot
which broke his ankle bone all in pieces: <hi>Carbonnié</hi> Captain of
the Guard to the late Duke <hi>de Biron,</hi> a man of great Valour, and
a particular Servant of the Duke's by a Musquet-shot in the head
was there slain: <hi>Brignemont</hi> the Gentleman of the Duke's Horse,
and Brother to the <hi>Count de Maillé,</hi> receiv'd another in his thigh,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:63412:207"/>
of which he died a few hours after; as also many others were
either slain out-right, or dangerously wounded: which hapned
by an inconvenience for which there was no remedy, which was,
that the Graffe of the City being exceeding deep, the Trench could
not be carried on so low, but that they were necessitated to leap
from a great height into it; by which means most of those, who
had thrown themselves into that danger, receiv'd this disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
before the Ditch could be fill'd up with Bavins: but how
great soever the danger was, the Duke never stirr'd from the
mouth of the Trench, but stood open, and expos'd, and in his
Doublet only, till he had seen the Quarter made, which by <hi>l' En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheres,</hi>
and <hi>le Roc</hi> two Aides <hi>de Camp,</hi> was at last brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
the last of which was slain in the attempt, the other
came more happily off, though it was only soon after in a very
handsome action, to meet the same misfortune. The day after,
the Duke having renewed his Batteries, and by them made the
two Flanckers useless, which rendred that Post very unsafe; the
besieg'd fell into so great a fear, that seeing our men already lodg'd
at the foot of their Walls, and that the Miners were about to

                     </note> they sued to be admitted to Capitulation, attributing by
common consent the whole honour of the Siege to the Duke of
<hi>Espernon,</hi> as indeed by his conduct it was evidently two months
advanc'd.</p>
                  <p>For the rest, as the Duke had most contributed to the reducing
this place, or because it was a member of his Government, or
that his Authority was more absolute with the Souldier than any
of the rest, or out of deference to his Command as Colonel, or
out of the respect his age, and merit had acquir'd him above all
others: upon some, or all these considerations it was so order'd,
that he himself was the first man that enter'd into the Town. And
happy it was for that poor City he did so; for some <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Swisse</hi> Foot, having got over the ruines of the Breach (whilst those
within were intent about letting such as were appointed to enter
into the Gates) were already upon the spoil, and principally busie

him whereof I was a witness, and without which the King had
had the dishonour to have seen his faith violated before his own
eyes: but the Duke by this action made it plain, that if he knew
how to conquer, he knew as well how to provide for the safety of
those he had overcome.</p>

mutinous people feel the smart, their contumacy, and disobedience
had so highly deserv'd. The ill example of this City had so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the other parts of the Kingdom, and had begot so many
disturbances to the publick peace, as had necessitated his Majesty
in his own person to run up and down to so many several places
to suppress them, that in the beginning he could never be at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to sit down before <hi>Rochelle,</hi> the living source of all those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs;
as he did some years after, and that with a success poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
will hereafter look upon, as a prodigy of Fortune, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
But for an undertaking of that difficulty, and importance,
it was necessary his Majesty should make choice of some Subject
of great Valour, and approv'd Fidelity, and such a one as could no
way be suspected to have intelligence, either with the <hi>Rochellers</hi>
themselves, or any others of their party: qualities that appear'd
so eminent in the person of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> as that they
seem'd to be in him united to no other end, than to point him
out for this Employment. To which may be added, that as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Governour of the Country of <hi>Aulnis,</hi> where <hi>Rochelle</hi> stood,
as also of the bordering Provinces of <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Angoumois;</hi>
he could for a need upon the single accompt of his own Interest,
and Authority, draw so great Forces from those places to his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
that his Majesty should not in the least be necessitated to
slacken the vigour and progress of his other Victories, for any
accident that could happen on that side.</p>
                  <p>Upon these considerations his Majesty resolv'd to confer upon
him the Command of the Army before <hi>Rochelle,</hi>

to invest him with that Employment: a person that we have
since seen rais'd to the supreme Dignity of Chancellor of <hi>France;</hi>
an Office that he does at this day discharge with so unblemish'd a
repute, as is nothing inferiour to the greatest men of those who
have preceded him in that charge; though at this time he had
been but lately admitted into the Council in the quality of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Requests. He had not long continued with the Duke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he gave as favourable a Character of his worth, and merit,
as could possibly belong to a man of his condition, judging him
thence forward worthy, and capable of all the great preferments a
man of his Robe, and Profession, could reasonably expect, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto.</p>
                  <p>So soon as the Troops appointed for this Service could be
drawn together, the Duke appointed the Rendezvous to be about
<hi>Surgeres,</hi> a house belonging to the Baron <hi>de Montendre,</hi> which he
took up for his own Quarter, and, without giving the Enemy fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respite, brought them two days after before the City, to try if
the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who had had time enough to prepare themselves,
would be so brave, as to receive him in the Field; though they
contented themselves with bestowing upon him some
Volleys of their great shot only (which did no body any
hurt at all) without once offering to stir out of their Walls.
At his return from this little piece of bravery, the Duke came to
take up his Quarters in two great Burroughs, a quarter of a League
distant from one another,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> takes up his Quarters before <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle.</hi>
                     </note> whereof that he made choice of for
his own Post was called <hi>la Iarrie,</hi> and the other <hi>Croix-Chapeau,</hi>
where he dispos'd the rest of his Army (as eldest Camp-Master)
under the command of <hi>d' Auriac.</hi> The distance of the Quarters
from the City was a League, or thereabouts, far enough to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Enemy a great way, should he attempt to disturb him,
and not so far neither as to leave him too much liberty of the
Field.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:63412:208"/>
Having thus settled his Quarters, he began to plant Garrisons
upon all the Avenues of the City, as well to keep the Enemy in,
as also to cut off from them all Commerce with the adjacent
Countrey: In such places as he found either Castles, or Churches
he lodg'd them there, making shift elsewhere with Mills, and
private houses. Which Garrisons in some places consisted of an
hundred, in others of fifty men: but scarce any above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
To these he gave particular instructions to take especial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of all things within the observation of their own Quarter;
to stop all such as would either offer to go into, or come out of
the City; and to hinder the Enemy from gathering in their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vests
of Corn and Wine. The Foot being thus order'd, he caus'd
the third part of the Cavalry to mount every day to Horse to
scour the Field, even to the very Gates of <hi>Rochelle:</hi> So that should
any thing by chance pass by the Foot, it was almost impossible to
escape the Horse: by which means those few Forces being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
provided for, and so advantageously quarter'd, did in a few
months so incommodate the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> that they found themselves
absolutely depriv'd of all manner of Relief by Land; insomuch
that had any Shipping at the same time been employ'd to block
up the Channel, they could not, without all doubt, long have
wrestled with those necessities they must have apparently fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
but this was a Victory too glorious to be reserv'd for any
other than the King himself.</p>
                  <p>Of all these little Garrisons (which (though they had drawn no
lines of Communication) made shift nevertheless to make up the
Circumvallation of the City) there was never any one forc'd by
the Enemy: 'tis very true that they had attempted upon some of
them, both by day, and by night: but the Duke having ever
been seasonably alarm'd, alwayes came in time enough to relieve
his own men, and to make the Enemy with loss to retire: Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that were at last so frequent, and considerable, as that it is most
certain they lost in several engagements, betwixt twelve, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred men: Whereof some of those Skirmishes had been
so brisk, as that therein sometimes two, sometimes three hundred
men were left dead upon the place; besides a great number of
Citizens, and Officers of note taken Prisoners, whose Ransomes
were very considerable.</p>
                  <p>The Duke every week duly twice, sometimes thrice mounted
on horseback in his own person to visit his Quarters; which
could not be done, without coming very near the Town: and
this commendation is due to the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> that they never saw the
Duke's Horse approach their City, without sallying out to
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:63412:209"/>
Skirmish: but it is also as true, that they never return'd with the
least advantage.</p>
                  <p>They were sometimes so bold, as to attempt upon the Duke's
own Quarters; but they were no more fortunate in assaulting,
than when they were themselves assaulted. I shall not undertake
a Narrative of all the several actions that pass'd in the beginning
of this Siege,<note place="margin">Several actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.</note> though very remarkable in themselues; forasmuch

his Son (who alwayes made one upon all occasions) ran very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
very great hazard of their lives. The first whereof had the

and the truncheon he carried in his hand broke all to

the Gentlemen of the best quality of their party) they at la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to make no more Sallies, contenting themselves for the future,
with defending the circuit of their own Walls, and preserving
their City from the practices and intelligence the Duke main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
with some of the Inhabitants; which was gone so far, that
those he had dealt withal, were upon the point to deliver him up
one of the Gates of the City; when upon several conjectures,
the Magistrates having found out the truth at last, they expos'd
the parties (whom they call'd Traytors) to the violence of
the people, by whom they were all torn to pieces.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Rocbellers</hi> had taken a resolution no more to hazard
their Forces in the Field, some active spirits in the City impatient
of lying idle, and immur'd, laid several designs to go further off
to make trial of their Valour: amongst whom <hi>la Noüe</hi> was one
of the first, and most eager, though not the most fortunate in the
execution of his design. This Gentleman upon the intelligence he
had receiv'd, that the <hi>Count de la Rochefoucaust</hi> was parted from his
Government of <hi>Poictou,</hi> on purpose to come visit the Duke at
<hi>la Iarrie,</hi> had laid himself in ambush in the Forest of <hi>Benon</hi> to
surprize him; but the Duke advertiz'd of his March by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
people (who (to preserve their Houses from firing, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from punishment) never fail'd diligently to inform of
whatever they could discover of the Enemies designs) sending
out his Company of <hi>Gens-d' Armes,</hi> took <hi>la Noüe</hi> in his own Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscado;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:63412:209"/>
where, after he had made all the resistance could be
expected from a very gallant man, he was at last constrain'd to
give way to his ill fortune, and to yield. He was therefore brought
prisoner to the Duke, who for sometime entertain'd him in his
Camp with all imaginable civility; giving him leave moreover
upon his parole to go see his Mother in <hi>Poicto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>:</hi> of which the
King being inform'd, his Majesty gave the Duke to understand
he was infinitely dissatisfied with that favourable proceeding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a man, by whom he had been so often, and so highly
offended; commanding withal that he should forthwith send
him to the Prison belonging to the Parliament of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> that
he might there be brought to his Trial. <hi>La Noüe</hi> in the mean
time had surrendred his person to the Duke to disingage his word;
whom the Duke (who could now no longer allow him the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of his Camp) sent away by two of his Guard to the Castle
of <hi>Angoulesme. La Noüe</hi> in this condition, and advertis'd of the
express and reiterated Orders the King had sent to the Duke, to
use him no longer as a prisoner of War, but as a Criminal, and a
Rebel, began to apprehend he should at last be deliver'd up into
the hands of Justice indeed: and consequently thence forward
began to think of making his escape; as in the end, either through
the negligence, or connivance of his Keepers he did; by that
means delivering the Duke from the perplexity he was in, either
of offending the King by insisting too long against his Majesties
pleasure for this Gentlemans preservation, or of giving his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and assistance to the ruine of a man of his condition, which
he could very hardly have ever perswaded himself to do.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke lay before this place,<note place="margin">The first propositions that were made to the Duke for the block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Harbour of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sent to view the disposition of the place, and to consider of the
means by which the Port was to be rendred useless: In order
whereunto having long consider'd the nature of the Channel, he
propounded at last a Machine, which was an <hi>Estacade,</hi> or kind of
floating Fort; though the Duke could never relish that proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
always disputing it must be some solid body that could
block up the mouth of this Harbour, and demonstrating withal
which way it was to be done: The very same in truth they were
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:63412:210"/>
at last fain to resolve upon, after having made a vain and fruitless
trial of all the rest. I have yet by me a Copy of what he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
writ to the Duke of <hi>Angoulesme</hi> upon this very subject,
when that Duke commanded before the place: So that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
say, the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> what by his own proper For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(as in his first expedition before <hi>Rochelle)</hi> what by his conduct
of the King's (as upon this occasion) and what by his advice (as
we shall hereafter see) did no little contribute to the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
of this place.</p>
                  <p>The Duke did yet another thing before he quitted his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
which was not a little conducing to this great success. The
Isle of <hi>Maran</hi> was of so great importance to the execution of this
Enterprize, that it has ever been thought, whilst the <hi>Rochellers</hi>
should have it at their dispose, a thing almost impossible to take
that City,<note place="margin">The surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal of the Isle of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon.</hi>
                     </note> by reason of the communication this Island gave them
with <hi>Poictou,</hi> from whence they might at great ease, and without
any impediment at all, supply themselves at any time, with all
sorts of Relief. The <hi>Baron de Chandolan,</hi> a man of great quality,
and merit, who at this time shew'd himself very affectionate to the
King's Service, was Governour of this Isle, but he was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the <hi>Rochellers</hi> Religion: so that the fidelity of a man,
who having Religion for his pretense might, whenever he pleas'd,
and without any blemish to his reputation, separate himself
from his Majesties interest, was not in reason altogether to be
rely'd upon; and the Duke also fear'd lest he might be perswaded
into a thing he might do with great security, and almost without
reproach. He therefore took up a resolution to possess himself of
this Isle, to prevent any inconvenience for the time to come; and
having receiv'd his Majesties command to do it by the best means
he could contrive, he rose from his Quarters one of the coldest
nights in Winter; a time when all the Ditches of the Island were
frozen up, and which the Duke therefore chose, as it rendred his
access more easie for the execution of his design. He therefore
commanded some Foot Companies to steal over silently, and by
single Files, who that very night possess'd themselves of all the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues;
and in the morning, having caus'd the Ice to be broken,
that he might himself pass over with his Horse, he made himself
Master of the Island without the least opposition: an action that
nevertheless he undertook with great reluctancy, so great an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and esteem he had for the Governour: but his Duty ever
carried it with him above all considerations. The <hi>Chevalier de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi>
was therefore establish'd in this Isle, and very opportunely;
for had not the Duke taken this course, and that the <hi>Rochellers</hi>
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:63412:210"/>
who had a design to seize it, had once got footing there, great
force, and vast expense must have been employ'd to remove them:
but the Duke by this foresight sav'd the King that charge, and
labour.</p>
                  <p>Certainly never was War carried on at greater convenience for
the Souldier, than in this Countrey, which by its situation, and
vicinity to the Provinces of <hi>Poictou, Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Angoumois,</hi>
lay so exceeding conveniently for the bringing in of all sorts of
Provision, and other necessaries, that they were scarce to be had in
greater abundance, or at cheaper rates in the best Cities of the
Kingdom, than they were in the Camp continually to be sold;
as also the people came in with their commodities with as great
confidence, and security, as to the publick and ordinary Markets:
and they might do so, the least violence to any Higler, Sutler, or
other Provisionary Person, being a crime so capital, as never es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd
unpunish'd. By which we may judge how much the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of our civil dissentions has impair'd the flourishing
condition the Kingdom was then in, and how much the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of War by being grown older, is alter'd from what it us'd to
be in those better times.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke thus bravely acquitted himself of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
before <hi>Rochelle,</hi> his Majesty had also with extraordinary
vigour prosecuted his designs in <hi>Guienne;</hi> where he had compell'd
most of the places possess'd by those of the Religion in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
to submit to his Authority and Power. Of which he had
reduc'd <hi>Bergerac, Saint Foy, Puimirol, Tournon, Monflanquin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King's exploits in <hi>Guienne.</hi>
                     </note> with
several others; besieg'd, and taken <hi>Clerac,</hi> and at last laid Siege
to <hi>Montauban,</hi> though herein he had not been so successful, as in
his other enterprizes: so that the year ending with this variety of
Events, his Majesty was constrain'd to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> to let the
stormy quarter blow over, that he might in a more favourable
season recommence the interrupted progress of his Arms.</p>
                  <p>In his Majesties return to <hi>Paris,</hi> a little paltry place situated
upon the banks of the River <hi>Garonne,</hi> call'd <hi>Monhurt,</hi> had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to stand out against the Royal Army; an insolence which
though it receiv'd its due reward, prov'd notwithstanding fatal to
the Duke <hi>de Luines,</hi>

days: by whose decease both the place he possess'd in the King's
favour, as also the Office of Constable of <hi>France</hi> became void:
The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had likewise a few days before left a vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the principal Government of the Kingdom, which was that
of <hi>Guienne,</hi> by a Musquet-shot he receiv'd in his head before
<hi>Montauban;</hi> by the fall of which two great Ministers the King
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:63412:211"/>
(as we shall hereafter see) had means to recompense the Services
of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and the <hi>Mareschal de l' Esdiguieres,</hi> two
of the eldest, and best deserving Servants of his Crown.</p>
                  <p>The Winter was no sooner a little abated of its fury, but that
those of the Religion, more elevated with the raising of the
Siege of <hi>Montaubon,</hi> than they had been dejected with the loss of
so many other places, as the King had taken from them, took the
field to give his Majesty a new, and greater provocation than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Of these <hi>Soubize</hi> was the first that fell in his Majesties way,
who having fortified himself in the Isle of <hi>Reé,</hi> and some other
Islands of <hi>Poictou,</hi> thought the difficulty of their access would
protect him from the Royal Power: but he soon found that all
places are firm Land to Kings; when his Majesty overcoming all
difficulties, that oppos'd his way, pass'd over the Marshes, and
his own Fortifications within them, to fall upon him; where he
gave him so notable a defeat, that he could not of a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
recover that blow, nor put himself again into any tolerable
posture of War.</p>
                  <p>So soon as the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had intelligence of the King's
motion towards those Provinces,<note place="margin">Anno 1622.</note> where he had the honour to
command,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> goes to the King at <hi>Poictiers.</hi>
                     </note> he design'd a Journey to his Majesty, to give him an
accompt of those discoveries he had made whilst he lay before
<hi>Rochelle,</hi> that were of greatest importance to his design: a desire
he had no sooner acquainted his Majesty withal, but that he gave
him leave to come to him to <hi>Poictiers;</hi> where he accordingly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in the beginning of the year 1622. He could not possibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
a more favourable reception, than his Majesty was here pleas'd
to give him, who openly declar'd himself infinitely satisfied with
his Service: neither indeed could it by any one have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
with greater fidelity, or to better effect: so that the King
being resolutely bent to punish the <hi>Rochellers</hi> disobedience, had a
great desire, that the Duke should still pursue the Siege, as he
had begun: But the <hi>Count de Soissons</hi> a young Prince of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and expectation, having been prompted by his friends to
ask some employment, he was not handsomly to be denied any
thing almost he could demand, every thing he would pretend to
seeming justly due to his Birth, and merit. Amongst all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Kingdom, that the Duke had before <hi>Rochelle</hi> was,
without all dispute, the most honourable; and the Duke had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
given him a few days after his return to his Camp, of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
suit the <hi>Count de Soissons</hi> made to have the Command
of the Army under his charge conferr'd upon him; an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that perhaps the informer presum'd would have been very
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:63412:211"/>
unwelcome to him: but if the Duke knew how to stand upon
his punctilio, and to hold his own amongst his equals, he also
better understood than any man of the Kingdom, what deference
was due to the Princes of the Blood. He was therefore no sooner
advertis'd of the <hi>Count</hi>'s desire, but that he was himself the first
man to second it; representing to his Majesty in his dispatches
how much it stood him upon to favour the inclinations of this
young Prince, that he might the sooner be made capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
those Services his Majesty was one day to expect from his
Valour and Conduct. He also renew'd the same instances by word
of mouth, when his Majesty came a few days after out of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctou</hi>
into <hi>Xaintonge;</hi> though when all was done he himself would
never be prevail'd upon to serve any more in this Army under
this new General. <hi>Monsieur d' Herbaut</hi> Secretary of State, his old
and particular friend, was commanded by the King to speak to
him about it, who represented to him: <q>That his Majesties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
herein, was not in the least to diminish his Authority
in the Army, nor to cut him off in the least from the exercise
of his Command: That if they took from him the vanity of
a Title only, they added much more to his effectual power:
That the Army being augmented by one half (as it was to be)
there was no honourable exploit he might not be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
by such an addition of Forces, since with so few, as he
had hitherto commanded, he had, to so glorious a pitch, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
his Majesties designs: That his Majesty intended all
things should be order'd by his wisdom, and that this Prince's
youth might be govern'd by his experience; to the end that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o excellent a Discipline, he might betimes be train'd up to
the profession of Armes.</q> The <hi>Count</hi> also either of his own accord,
or by the King's order sent him the same complement at the same
time; but the Duke persisting never to have dependence upon
other than Kings (from whom he said, and from no other, all
things by men of his condition, were to be expected) he humbly
besought his Majesty to excuse him from this employment, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
<hi>Monsieur d' Herbaut</hi> to tell the King from him: <q>That
he did not think himself Souldier enough to instruct this
young Prince so well, as he ought to be; but that he likewise
thought himself too old to begin to learn of any whomsoever.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Duke had sent the King this answer by <hi>Monsieur d'
Herbaut,</hi> and that he knew it had been well receiv'd, he went
himself the same day to his Majesty, where he told him: <q>That
he could never enough commend the good resolution his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
had taken in the <hi>Count</hi>'s favour: That he did with all his
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:63412:212"/>
heart resign into his Majesties hands those Forces he had done
him the honour to entrust him withal, without diminution of
number, and some encrease of Reputation: That of all the
other Services he had heretofore perform'd for his Majesty, and
the Kings his Predecessors, in the long course of his life, he had
ever expected his reward from their bounty, without importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them with his demands: but that he should not do so
here, being resolv'd to take upon him the boldness to make one
request; which as it would neither incommodate his Majesties
Affairs, nor impair his treasure, he hop'd would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd,
and that was only, that his Majesty would give him leave
to serve about his own person in the simple condition of a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer:
That his Governments of <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Angoumois,</hi>
being secure, whilst an Army should lie before <hi>Rochelle,</hi> his
presence would be altogether unnecessary there; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he humbly begg'd he might partake of those dangers, to
which his Majesty was about to expose his own person; and
that though he was now grown old, he found he had never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
strength, and vigour enough remaining to dye in some
glorious day, with a Pike in his hand, at his Majesties stirrop.</q>
Which being said, his Majesty embracing him in his arms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
this answer: <q>That he did very freely grant him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense,
and that if he had many Servants on whom to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
the like, and who knew so well how to make use of it, he
should think himself a much greater Prince than he was: That
notwithstanding he did not receive him in the quality of a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer,
as he desir'd, but that he might assure himself he would
ever afford him such a place in his Armies, as that therewith he
himself should be very well content. And accordingly his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
having a desing upon <hi>Royan,</hi> he dismiss'd the Duke with part
of his Forces to begin the Siege.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this sort the Duke quitted his employment at the Siege of

near <hi>Royan,</hi> mounted on Horseback to view the place.
This <hi>Royan</hi> was a little City built upon a very high Rock by the
Sea-side, inaccessible on that side towards the Water; the height
whereof breaking off the impetuosity of the Winds, at the foot
of the precipice afforded a very secure Harbour to so many Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
as it could contain. This Harbour was defended by an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Castle rais'd upon the eminence of the Rock, and in the midst
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:63412:212"/>
of it a little way was levell'd, that lead to the Harbour by one of
the Gates of the City. On that side towards the Land the situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was more even; but there also so well fortified, that in the
opinion of all who view'd it either before, or after the Siege, it
was one of the most tenable places, for its circuit in <hi>France.</hi> To
which it had moreover this advantage, that it was almost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger to be defended; forasmuch as after their out-works
should be taken (which could not be till after a long Siege) the
convenience of the Sea, and the vicinity of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> rendred their
retreat at any time so easie, and so secure, that it was to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the last extreme. The <hi>Baron de Saint Surin,</hi> a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> and
a Gentleman of great quality, and valour, though very young,
had in the beginning of these commotions surpriz'd this place
from <hi>la Chesnaye,</hi> one of the King's Domesticks of the same Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
but infinitely zealous for his Majesties Service: neither
was he ignorant of the advantages of the place; he knew what
reputation he might gain amongst those of his own party, and
what recompense from the King himself, after a long and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
resistance: but <hi>la Mote Saint Surin</hi> his Brother, the <hi>Count de
Marennes</hi> his Brother-in-law, and <hi>Navailles</hi> his Cousin, having
been taken prisoners at the Isle of <hi>Rheé,</hi> and the King threatning
to deal with them after another manner than with ordinary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
of War, gave <hi>Saint Surin</hi> to understand, that upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
depended the safety of his Allies. The Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon,</hi>
who had instructions from the King to manage this Affair
with <hi>Saint Surin,</hi> had to the King's menaces added so many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
propositions for the Governour in his own particular,
as had altogether brought the business to that pass, that <hi>Saint Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
who had a great respect for the Duke, of whom he was also
very much esteem'd, and entirely belov'd, touch'd with a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
towards his friends, and moreover very ill satisfied with
the ill usage men of his condition receiv'd from those of their own
party (who were eternally expos'd to the capricious humour of
the most abject rabble of <hi>Rochelle</hi>) had made him an absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to surrender the place. The day was set, the hour concluded,
and all things prepar'd for the execution, the King's Forces were
advanc'd towards the Town to receive it, and the Duke's Guards
appointed to guard the Gates of the City; when <hi>Saint Surin,</hi>
more confident of his Garrison, than he ought to have been,
made no difficulty to go out of the place to settle some Articles with
the Duke he had not thought on before. ' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lieutenant, whom he had made firm to his own resolution, in the
Castle; a Fort that rendred him absolutely Master of the City,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:63412:213"/>
having a back Gate by which the King's Forces might at any time
be introduc'd, notwithstanding any endeavour of the City to
hinder his design: but <hi>Favas, Saint Ravy, Moulines,</hi> and some
other Gentlemen of Command, upon the rumour was spread at
<hi>Rochelle</hi> of this Treaty, ran thither in all diligence; where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Governour gone out, and his Lieutenant call'd <hi>l' Arnau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diere,</hi>
being so senseless as to come open the draw Bridge of the
Castle to talk with them in too great security, <hi>Saint Ravy,</hi> assisted
by one <hi>Poyanne,</hi> gave him a Pistol-shot in the head, by which he
was laid dead upon the place; which being done, they forthwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cry'd to Armes, when the City immediately revolting from <hi>Saint
Surin,</hi> his own Garrison follow'd the same example; whereupon
on a sudden such a noise was heard within, as sounded nothing of
the expected surrender.</p>
                  <p>The Duke in his approach to <hi>Royan</hi> had taken up his Quarters
in a house call'd <hi>Saint Pierre de Royan,</hi> which was within Cannon
shot of the City and before which was a little Green, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
the City, had drawn thither a great number of persons
to behold, as from a Scaffold, the surrender of this place. The
Duke himself was there, where <hi>Monsieur d' Autry</hi> had been long
discoursing with him, and they were still walking together; when
this cloud of people having invited those within to level all the
Iron, and Brass Pieces they had at that eminence, there was heard
on a sudden, one shot overtaking another, a Volley of eighteen
pieces of Ordnance, which all plaid into this little place. And
certainly after an example like this all Cannon-shot are to be
despis'd, when had they shot with a design to do no harm, they
could hardly have been so exact in their aim, as to miss so great a
crowd of people, yet was not any one touch'd; so that except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fear, that made some of the over-timorous lay themselves
flat upon the ground, it prov'd matter of laughter to all the rest.
The Duke was still talking, whilst the Cannon play'd from the
City, with the same indifferency, as if there had been no noise
at all; neither did he once break off his discourse, though the
Bullets flew very thick about his ears: but the tumult being over,
conceiving these to be no Volleys of Triumph, and that it was
necessary, before the Enemy could have time to look about them,
to take all possible advantage of this confusion; he caus'd his men
to betake themselves to their Arms, himself immediately going
down into the Suburbs; which though very well Barricado'd,
was nevertheless by reason of their disorder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o weakly guarded,
that he carried it at the first assault, with little or no resistance:
a thing that in many days, and without the loss of a great many
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:63412:213"/>
good men, had he slipt this opportunity, he could not have done.
<hi>Saint Surin</hi> surpriz'd at so unexpected an alteration, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able almost to believe his own eyes, went down to demand
the cause of this confusion; where all the answer he could get,
was to bid him begone, his Souldiers yet retaining so much respect
for his person, as not to shoot at him, though they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him; and then it was that he saw the error his youth,
and want of experience, had made him to commit. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
return'd back to the Duke to justifie himself, who more

receiv'd, and comforted him with great civility, and
friendship; entertaining him in his own Quarters, and giving
him opportunity by the Services he perform'd during this Siege,
to wipe off the imputation of his ill conduct, and to give the
world high proofs of his bravery, and valour. His good qualities
after the War was over, and no more to do at home, carried him
to seek his destiny in <hi>Holland,</hi> and by that means depriving <hi>France</hi>
of one of the most accomplish'd Gentlemen to all purposes, and
in all qualifications commendable in a man of his condition, of
his time. As to this business, the Duke having undertaken his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
against the ill offices of many who were emulous of his
desert, not only prevail'd with the King to accept his excuses, but
as a recompense for the Passion he had observ'd in him to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Service, moreover procur'd the enlargement of his friends;
ordering it so, that his Piety was not rendred fruitless by his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
and that what would have been punish'd in the person
of another, was rewarded in him.</p>
                  <p>The Suburbs of <hi>Royan</hi> being thus taken, they were now to
proceed regularly in their approaches for the taking of the Town,
wherein though the Duke had made choice of that part, where it
was with greatest difficulty to be assaulted; yet did he ply his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
so well, that a Mine was brought up under the Bastion he
had undertaken. The King's Army in the mean time advanc'd to
favour the Siege, when his Majesty coming after to view the
Trenches, resolv'd at last upon an assault. The order therefore
being given, and all things prepar'd for the design, the Marquis
<hi>de la Valette</hi> put himself in the head of his men, seconded by the
Guards of the Duke his Father, where he engag'd himself so far
in the danger, that he was buried up to the middle in a Counter-Mine
sprung by the besieg'd, and where he had run a great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of his life, had not <hi>Montigny</hi> the Gentleman of his Horse, a
tall, and very strong man, help'd to disingage him. The Guards
that follow'd avoided the danger of the Mine, but they found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:63412:214"/>
so smart an opposition at a work the besieg'd had cast
up within the Bastion, that of five and forty, whereof that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
consisted, two only escap'd without wounds. Fourteen
were there slain outright, all the rest being hurt more or less; but
the three Officers, <hi>Marsillac, la Roche,</hi> and <hi>Larcan,</hi> Brother to the
Baron of <hi>Esclignac,</hi> who lead them on to the assault, were all so
desperately wounded, that there was small hope of their recovery.
The <hi>Baron de Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was slain upon the Bastion by a great shot, as also several
Gentlemen of the Duke's houshold; but the rest, resolute to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all difficulties, lodg'd themselves at last in the Bastion. The
<hi>Mareschal de Vitry</hi> who was present at this assault,<note place="margin">

this, as in all other occasions signaliz'd himself with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
valour, gave them the glory of this performance, principally
the <hi>Chevalier de la Valette,</hi> who did wonders in his own person,
from the beginning to the end of the action. Thus by the Duke's
admirable conduct, and the valour of his followers this Siege
was brought to an end in fewer weeks, than months would have
been allow'd him, had he carried it on with less prudence, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
In this, as it oft falls out upon other occasions of this
nature, so strange Wounds<note place="margin">Strange Wounds.</note> were observ'd, as, their cures defeating
all the rules of Art, pass'd for miraculous. One of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Duke's Guards call'd <hi>Faure</hi> receiv'd a Cannon-shot in
his Belly, which pass'd quite through, leaving an orifice bigger
than a Hat Crown; so that the Chirurgeons could not imagine,
though it were possible the Bowels should remain unoffended
that nature could have supply'd so wide a breach, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
she did; and to that perfection, that the party found
himself, as well as before. Another of the same condition call'd
<hi>Rameé,</hi> and of the same place (they being both Natives of St.
<hi>Iean de Angely</hi>) receiv'd a Musquet-shot, which entring at his
mouth, came out of the nape of his neck, who was also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cur'd: which two extravagant wounds being reported to
the King, his Majesty took them both into his own particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence,
saying those were men that could not die, though they
afterwards both ended their dayes in his Service.</p>
                  <p>This place being reduc'd to the King's obedience,<note place="margin">The march of the Kings Army into <hi>Guienne,</hi> and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress there.</note> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd

that he was at liberty to advance with all his Forces into <hi>Guienne.</hi>
The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had been sent thither before with the Vant-guard
of the Army; where at his Majesties arrival he found
<hi>Monravet</hi> taken by the Duke <hi>d' Elboeuf,</hi> and <hi>Themeins,</hi> after a long
and obstinate resistance, surrendred to the same Duke. Saint <hi>Foy</hi>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:63412:214"/>
also, <hi>Clerac, le Mont de Marsan,</hi> with several other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
places, were reduc'd to his obedience, by the Marquis
<hi>de la Force, de Lusignan,</hi> and <hi>de Castelnau de Chalosse,</hi> who
had taken them in; so that his Majesty finding little to do in
<hi>Guienne,</hi> pass'd speedily thence into <hi>Languedoc. Negrepolisse,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
paltry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Siege; but it was soon taken by assault; and St. <hi>Antonin</hi> having
after a Siege surrendred to mercy, their temerity having put the
King upon making some examples, the neighbouring places
thought it convenient to fly to his Majesties Clemency, to evade
the trial of his victorious Arms.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the King was taken up with these little exploits, the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had taken opportunity to look into his own
Domestick Affairs, the better to fit himself to follow, and serve
his Majesty in his main expedition; which he had so dispatch'd,
as to come before the King to <hi>Tholouze;</hi> who arriving there a few

the seven and twentieth of <hi>August</hi> the whole Court arriv'd at
<hi>la Verune,</hi> a little Town in <hi>Languedoc:</hi> where the Duke receiv'd
the honour of a Patent for Governour, and his Majesties Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and for the particular Governments of
<hi>Chasteau, Trompette,</hi> as also of the City, and Cittadel of <hi>Bergerac,</hi>
with the City and Castle of <hi>Nerac,</hi> in lieu of his Governments
of <hi>Angoumois, Xaintonge, Aulins,</hi> and <hi>Limousin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the time of their being together at <hi>Tholouze,</hi> the Prince
of <hi>Condé</hi> having converted the animosities he had conceiv'd
against the Duke, during the Regency of the Queen Mother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a particular esteem; he was the first man that thought of this
Command in the Duke's favour: and though he had himself
been Governour of that Province, yet thinking it no prejudice to
his Birth and Dignity, to be succeeded by a man of his Merit, he
first propos'd him to the King. His Majesty understood as
well as any the importance of this Command, and having
a little before experimented in the person of the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> what a Governour of <hi>Guienne</hi> could do, when debauch'd
from his Duty, had been at great debate with himself, upon
whom to confer the honour of this great Employment.
At the first mention notwithstanding of the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
he very favourably gave his consent, and the constant
testimonies he had always receiv'd of the Duke's fidelity seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be security for him for the time to come, he gave the
Prince order to speak to him about it, and to let him know
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:63412:215"/>
he had thoughts of conferring upon him the honour of that
command.</p>
                  <p>But all we who were of the Duke's Family, can witness there
was not the same facility in the Duke to receive this favour, there
had been in his Majesty to confer it: Not that he wanted ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or that his spirit did not prompt him with great confidence
in himself to aspire to the highest employments: but this ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
also was not blind, and if on the one side he consider'd how
great an honour it would be to succeed the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the
great of happy memory, who had maintain'd himself in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
till he came to the Crown with other first Princes
of the Blood, and to have his Authority rais'd to that height in
his own native Countrey: he wisely weigh'd on the other side,
that amongst so many advantages he should meet with much
trouble, and many difficulties to balance the lustre of that Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with many occurrences that he foresaw would be very cross
and untoward. His present condition 'twas true was not so
shining, but it was also more calm; and his Authority was so
establish'd in his own Governments, that there was none who
was not acquainted with his Justice, and who from the Infancy
of his Administration, had not paid so inviolate a respect to his
person, that the reverence those Countreys had for him, seem'd
to be a natural quality in the people committed to his charge.
The Gentry and Populacy were equally obedient to him, and he
liv'd amongst them as free from trouble, as envy: whereas in
<hi>Guienne,</hi> where his Government would be shut up betwixt two
Parliaments, he conceiv'd that in the administration of his charge
it would be almost impossible to avoid many disputes, with the
members of the one or the other Body. Whilst he had only had
to do with them in the quality of a friend, he had found them
exceedingly obliging, and all the Gentry of the Province had
ever paid him a very great respect: but he very much doubted
whether in such a degree of Authority he could preserve the
friendship, and affection of so many persons of quality as would
be subjected to him. These reasons made him long deliberate
upon this Affair, and he was often tempted to refuse it: but he
was so importun'd by his friends, and particularly by the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> who came to wait upon the King in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> that he
at last resolv'd to embrace his Majesties gracious offer: though I
heard him say then, and he has often confirm'd it since, that he
would never have been perswaded to do it, had he not been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
divested of the Cittadel of <hi>Xaintes;</hi> assuring us, that could
he have kept that in the condition he had once put it, he would
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:63412:215"/>
not have exchang'd those Governments he was already seiz'd of,
for any the best in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having therefore long deliberated before he could resolve,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> receives his Patent for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Guienne.</hi>
                     </note> he
at last went to receive from the King's own hand his Patent for
Governour of <hi>Guienne,</hi> dated from the Camp of <hi>la Verune</hi> the 27.
of <hi>August</hi> 1622. the news whereof was no sooner spread abroad,
but that all <hi>Guienne</hi> was as much over-joyed at their good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
to be govern'd by a Lord of their own Countrey, and one
that had already laid so many obligations upon it (there being
few Families of the Gentry, that had not been enrich'd by his
bounty) as the Provinces that saw themselves depriv'd of him,
were afflicted, and disconsolate at his loss. A privation the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
they afterwards endur'd made them very sensible of a long
time after; though they have at last found a remedy in the person
of the Marquis <hi>de Montauzier,</hi> the present Governour there;
who by his generous, and prudent administration, after having
procur'd them all the ease and comfort, the condition of the time
will permit has either so confirm'd them in, or so reduc'd them
to their obedience to the King, as has secur'd them from many
inconveniences, into which, by the ill example of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they would otherwise have been seduc'd.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>de l' Esdiguieres</hi> was at the same time promoted to
the Office of Constable of <hi>France:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betwixt the Dukes of <hi>Espernon</hi> and <hi>l' Esdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres,</hi> with some refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</note> and since Fortune seems to
have made choice of these two Lords (the most eminent of their
time) to manifest what she can do, when dispos'd to favour men
of extraordinary merit, it will not perhaps be altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to consider the several ways by which she rais'd them to that
infinite pitch of Honour. They were indeed very different both
in the one and the others promotion: In the advancement of
the Duke <hi>de l' Esdiguieres,</hi> she was observ'd to proceed with order,
leading him through all the degrees of his profession, and from
the quality of a private Souldier, raising him step by step, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of time to the Dignity of Constable of <hi>France.</hi> He had
never been preferr'd from a less command to a greater, without
having first been concluded worthy of it; wherein Envy (which
has seldom been known to be reconcil'd to Vertue) never appear'd
his adversary; insomuch that he ever possess'd all the advantages
of the one, without once proving the malignity of the other, and
by a favour particular to him alone, was so constantly fortunate,
that his happiness was never travers'd with the least disturbance.
He never undertook any thing, how dangerous soever, where
Fortune did not still smooth his way, and level all difficulties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, to favour his success, even beyond his own expectation:
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:63412:216"/>
and no less solicitous of his person, than partial to his Affairs,
was ever so ready to defend him from the least mischance, that
whatever he acquir'd of Greatness, Wealth, or Honour, scarce cost
him so much as one drop of blood. It is in truth very much to rise
by so honourable, and so easie a gradation, to such a place of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
but yet methinks it must appear more strange, as it is more
rarely found, to see a young man at twenty years old rais'd to the
highest pitch, to which Fortune, and Favour, when combin'd,
could possibly advance him: That a man envy'd of every one,
justled by all parties, abandon'd by his own Benefactor, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
by a mighty King his Successor, should keep himself still
upright, against all those violent assaults. We have seen him woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in several Engagements, blown up by Mines, and swallow'd
in Precipices; notwithstanding all which he overcame all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
by a vigorous resistance, triumphing at last over Envy it
self: so that if the one obtain'd from the world a favourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
by his Conduct, the other forc'd it by his Vigour; constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all <hi>France</hi> to confess, that those Offices, and Honours which
at first had prevented his desert, fell at last very much short of his
Vertue. Insomuch that if we find the one worthy of Esteem, the
other is no less worthy of Admiration; if the one was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by ordinary means, the other rose to all his Advancements by
extraordinary ways; if the one leisurely, and by degrees arriv'd
at greatness, there was a kind of impetuosity in the promotion of
the other; and yet his foot never slipt back: and if the one sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
his Fortune erected upon sure Foundations, the other
(which is very strange) even without any foundation at all, has
rais'd his to that prodigious height, as to carry it almost out of
sight.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke resolves to attend the King's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in his expeditions.</note> though he had merited well enough
from the Crown, to expect an acknowledgement like this where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

rather as a new obligation for new, and greater Services, than as
a recompense for what he had already done; and conceiving that
those he should perform in his Majesties own view, would best
manifest his Gratitude; he deferr'd till a fitter season, the taking
possession of his new Government, that he might not loss such
opportunities, as the War was likely to offer him whilst he should
continue about the person of the King. He therefore attended his

as he had taken leave of the King, that he might prevent any ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
of his motion: but he soon found it was far easier for him
to reduce his attendance, than to obscure his reputation, which
had already so far got the start of his preparation, and had so
fill'd the neighbouring Kingdoms with the reverence of his
name,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> takes a Journy into <hi>Catalognia.</hi>
                     </note> that he was no sooner enter'd into the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
Dominions, but he was receiv'd in all places with infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and extraordinary honours. He was in this Voyage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by the Marquis <hi>de Varennes</hi> (made Governour of <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guemortes</hi>
at his return) the <hi>Vicount de Fontrailles,</hi> the <hi>Count de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illé,</hi>
the <hi>Sieur de la Iliere</hi> Governour of <hi>Loches,</hi> six Gentlemen of
his houshold, as many of his Guards, and a necessary number of
Officers; yet could he not, with all his care to contract his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
order it so, that he had not above fifty persons in his Train:
so troublesome a thing is Greatness. He lay the first night at <hi>la
Palme,</hi> a private house belonging to one of the Gentlemen who
went along with him, and the next day pass'd close by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
of <hi>Laucate,</hi> and <hi>de Salses,</hi> two little Fortresses which at that
time divided the Kingdoms of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> by the distance
of which from our Frontiers as they now stand, it may be seen
how far our Conquests have extended the limits of our own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Two days after he came to <hi>Perpignan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it was that the Duke first perceiv'd how fruitless all his
caution to conceal his person had been,<note place="margin">The Duke's reception in all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties through which he pass'd.</note> he finding at his arrival
there the Garrison already drawn out to receive him; and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
so soon as he was alighted coming to his Lodging to kiss
hands, and to offer him admittance into the Cittadel; though the
Duke making no other advantage of his Complement, than in
such a case he ought to do, after having return'd his thanks in
the most civil terms so obliging an invitation requir'd, would
still remain in the Town. He parted thence the next morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
day, it being necessary to avoid the excessive heats of the
Countrey, and the season, to end his Journey by six of the clock
in the morning, and to repose himself the rest of the day. And
here he was likewise constrain'd, either for fear of wanting fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
for Horse, or with less difficulty to pass the Mountains and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:63412:217"/>
Rocks, to leave his Horses, and to mount upon Mules. The Gates
were set open for him at the appointed hour, and two Troops of
the Garrison Horse were found ready to convoy him two Leagues
from the City: he was moreover saluted by all the Artillery at
his departure. A complement so loud, as the adjacent Countrey
being thereby given to understand, that so unusual an honour was
not paid to a person of ordinary condition, he found at <hi>Stelrie,</hi>
at <hi>Girone,</hi> at <hi>la Roque,</hi> and the other places through which he pass'd,
that the <hi>Spanish</hi> pride hindred not their gravity from paying all
due honour, and respect to Vertue.</p>
                  <p>He came at last to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> where the Duke <hi>de Alcala</hi> Vice-Roy
of <hi>Catalognia,</hi> so soon as he heard of his arrival, came in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to visit him, excusing himself in that he had not had timely
notice of his coming, that he might have come out to meet him,
and to receive him without the City, as he said, he had order
from the King his Master to do. Being return'd home, it was not
long before he sent the Duke his Coach of Ceremony, drawn by
six great and very beautiful Gennets, for him to go abroad, and
take the Aire. A sight at which the Duke (who had ever been, and
who continued to his death a great lover of the Horses of <hi>Spain</hi>)
was almost impatient, that so noble Creatures should be subdu'd
to so mean a use: nevertheless (so great is the contagion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
especially where the glory of emulation seems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd)
that he was afterwards himself the first who show'd such
another set of Horses in <hi>France;</hi> he being a few years after, very
often observ'd in the Cours at <hi>Paris</hi> in a very rich Coach, drawn
by six dapple-Gray <hi>Spanish</hi> Horses; to which I could add that it
was in the company of Ladies too, and that at the age of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and ten, he was content to be seen playing the young man,
upon the greatest Theatre of Europe. He staid two whole days at
<hi>Barcelona,</hi> during which time he view'd at leisure the greatness,
and beauty of the City. The Viceroy invited him to his Palace,
where he had assembled the best company of men to wait upon
him, and the finest women in the Town to entertain him, which
was a very extraordinary favour. This civility was moreover at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a Ball, a Comedy, and a noble Banquet: and from
hence the Viceroy carried him to the Cours, which extends it self
in very great length upon the Sea-shore, and where we could not
but wonder at the delicacy of that people, the Ghing of all the
Gallies in the Harbour being drawn out every night to water this
Cours, which is above two thousand paces long. We at first
thought it an extraordinary thing, done only in favour of the
Duke: but we were soon dispossess'd of that error, when we
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:63412:217"/>
understood that the Inhabitants, to defend themselves from the
dust, and to qualifie the excessive ardours of the Sun, had impos'd
this new task as an addition to the other intolerable labours of their
miserable slaves.</p>

he continued three days entire at his Devotion, not without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
the excellent Oeconomy observ'd in this Abby, where
there are ordinarily above two thousand five hundred persons
provided for every day; for which all the provisions so much as
wood, and water must be fetch'd a great way off upon Mules,
the Rock being so dry, and unfruitful, as neither to afford the
one, nor the other of these, much less the other necessa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies of life.
The Duke presented the Abby with many very rich, and noble
Ornaments, adding to his Presents an Almes of five hundred
Crowns of Gold, for three thousand Masses, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
into <hi>France.</hi> The Religious Governours of this Abby ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
take any mony for their Hospitality, which they in Charity
bestow upon all Pilgrims indifferently of what condition soever
for three days together: but they also never refuse how much
soever any one is dispos'd to give for Masses.</p>
                  <p>During the Duke's abode in this place, those of his followers
who were nimblest of Foot, had the curiosity to climb the top of
the Mountain to see the Hermitages, which, being thirteen in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
are situated upon the most inaccessible precipices of the
Rock, and inhabited by so many devout persons, who subsist
upon almost no other nourishment than Herbs, and Fruit.
Though we met with great difficulty, and danger in this attempt,
and had very much ado to satisfie our desires; we saw neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
that one of the most unwieldy, and unready footed Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
that is to say, a Mule went twice a week the same way,
alone, and without being guided, to carry these good people their
allowance, and could with great security set his four feet in very
narrow paths, where we had much ado to dispose of our two;
so great a priviledge has Custom: but what we thought the most
strange of all, was, to see Birds of all sorts, and of those kinds
which with us are the most wild, and untractable, so familiar
with these Holy men, as to peck meat out of their mouths, and
suffer themselves to be handled, living in as great security with
them, as amongst us those of more docile natures, which we have
reclaim'd, and made tame with the greatest diligence, and art.</p>

which if it had not been, the defects of the place
would notwithstanding have been sufficiently recompens'd in the
Valour of the Governour, that had been very considerable in an
open Village. It was the <hi>Sieur de Calonges</hi> of whom I speak, a
Gentleman equally to be esteem'd for his wit, and bravery; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
that made him look'd upon so long, as he liv'd, for an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
person in his own Province, whither he at last retir'd
himself, as full of honour, as empty of ambition, to end his
days, after having perform'd many signal Services for his Prince,
by dying to expiate the glorious fault he committed against his
Majesty in his gallant behaviour at this Siege. The Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>
having long been acquainted with this Gentlemans vertues,
who had formerly out of his own affection ty'd himself to his
Service, and even in his disgraces paid him a respect at Court
above all other great men of the Kingdom, gave such a Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of him to the King, as prov'd too true in the revolution of
this Siege.</p>
                  <p>The Constable <hi>de l' Esdiguieres,</hi> by the prerogative of his place,
having the principal command of the Army, would (with good
Title) go to view the place, and the Duke, who disputed nothing
with him, but who also receiv'd no more orders from him now
he was Constable, than when he was only <hi>Mareschal General de
Camp,</hi> was also commanded by the King to do the same. The
Constable went out first, accompanied with a strong party of
Horse, as the Duke also was with some Gentlemen: but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
not to take his Guards along, who prov'd very serviceable to
him, and also to the Constable in this occasion.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had not advanc'd far in order to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
before he was fir'd upon by some Musqueteers of the City
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:63412:218"/>
planted in the hedges, in which Volley the <hi>Count de Maillé</hi> who
was talking with him, receiv'd a Musquet-shot in the face, which
put him in great danger of his life: some others were also hurt,
and the mischief would have been greater, had not the Duke
commanded <hi>la Roche</hi> the Lieutenant of his Guard with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
to alight, and beat the Enemy from their Post; which
he having without much difficulty perform'd, and the Duke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that <hi>Monsieur de l' Esdiguieres</hi> would meet with the same
entertainment, he dispatch'd away <hi>la Roche</hi> to do the same Service
for him, if occasion should require. Neither could he have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in a better time, for the Constable having taken no Foot
with him (as the Duke had very well observ'd) the Horse that
attended him, at the rattle of the Musqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t-shot, began to face
about, the craggy, and difficult passes not permitting them to
come up to charge the Enemy, who in great security fir'd very
thick upon them; insomuch that the Constable, abandon'd by his
men, would perhaps have been himself oblig'd shamefully to
retire, had not the Duke's Guards come opportunely in to clear
his way. But meeting, after this little brush with no further op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
he soon after joyn'd himself with the Duke near <hi>Pont
Iuvenel,</hi> where they both alighted, and where after the Duke
had a little rallied him about his disorder, they continued a great
while in consultation to consider a Plot of the place presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and went afterwards together to the King's Quarter to
make their report.</p>
                  <p>Immediately upon their return, the King call'd a Council of
War, to resolve upon the manner of carrying on the Siege, where
the Duke did not only propose, but did moreover with many
powerful Arguments maintain, that they were especially to possess
themselves of the Hill <hi>Saint Denis;</hi> an eminence near the City,
from whence the inside of all their Fortifications were so easily
discover'd,<note place="margin">A prudent counsel of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> which, not being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, cost the lives of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very brave men.</note> that it was impossible (that post being well secur'd,
and furnish'd with good Artillery) for the Enemy, either to go
from the Town, to the defense of their out-works, or to remain
secure within. But this prudent advice, that being follow'd had

friends to support him: So that those who were enemies to the
Duke (which were ever a very sufficient number) prompted <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>
to dispute his opinion in the Council, not considering the
King's Service, and Interest, when they came in competition with
the injury, and affront they intended against the Duke; which
<hi>Chabans</hi> so effectually perform'd, as to cause a determination quite
contrary to what the Duke had advis'd, to be resolv'd upon. A
thing I observ'd the Duke at his return from the Council very
much nettled at, and heard him give <hi>Chabans</hi> some very bitter lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
about it: but the oversight was already committed, and
the more unhappily, by how much it was never to be repair'd:
of so great importance it is to husband the opportunities of War,
where a moment's neglect draws after it an irreparable loss.</p>
                  <p>Immediately upon the breaking up of the Council, they fell
to work on all hands to advance the Siege. The Trenches were
opened, when those within soon perceiving of how great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
the foremention'd eminence was to their common conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
they there cast up a little Work, and left some Souldiers to
Guard it. Which Guard was no sooner planted there, but that our
Commanders eyes being opened, they saw the error they had
committed in not possessing themselves of that Post whilst it
might have been done without any opposition. They therefore
now resolv'd to fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce it, and succeeded in the attempt; for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulting
it by night, and the besieg'd not daring to sally out of the
Town in the dark to relieve their men, they suffer'd it to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the Guards giving our Souldiers leave to make themselves
masters of their Works, almost without any resistance: But (as
it often falls out) the facility of this little Victory having made
our people as negligent to its conservation, as if it never ought
more to be disputed with them, they took no care at all to perfect
the Works, that to their hands had already been begun: Neither
was this the sole over-sight was committed in this Affair; for
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> (as true in his predictions, as unhappy in
prevailing with these good counsels his long experience suggested
to him) had advis'd that a sufficient Guard of Horse should be
planted near to the Fort, to beat back any that should dare to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of the Town, to drive our men from their post. He knew
very well that the enemy had few, or no Horse, and that therefore
they durst not without infinite danger hazard their Foot to come
to us, the space between being large enough to give our Cavalry
room to come to charge, and to cut them in pieces before they
could come to the Fort that we kept; and <hi>Calonge</hi> has since con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
to me, that had his counsel been follow'd, he should never
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:63412:219"/>
have dar'd to sally out, it being not to be done without manifest
ruine, and that consequently within ten dayes he must have been
necessitated to a surrender:<note place="margin">Another prudent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s rejected.</note> but this second advice was rejected as
well as the first, through the opposition of some who car'd not

the Duke's conduct, or traverse his designs.</p>
                  <p>All these over-sights of ours being taken notice of by <hi>Calonges,</hi>
he would no longer defer to re-possess himself of what had been
taken from him; especially considering, that he could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

he sallied out at high noon, at the head of five hundred
Foot, seven and twenty Cuirassiers, fourteen Carabins, and two
Trumpets: with which small party he fell so vigorously upon
the Fort, that it was abandoned to him with little or no resistance.

most of them without Boots, or other Arms than their Swords,
to signalize their Valour in the sight of their Prince, who was
himself spectator of the Action. Of these the Duke of <hi>Fronsac,</hi>

the Duke in that Countrey, as well friends as enemies; but time
(which is the sovereign cure of all untoward passions) had recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd
them all by this time to one sense. All Animosities were now
converted into a general esteem of his Vertue; insomuch that I
have not observ'd him to have a greater reputation in any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of the Kingdom, nor to be any where receiv'd with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
respect and applause. All mischiefs whether publick or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
occasion'd by the former War, were buried in oblivion,
and the people, after having seen the King, enquir'd aloud for the
Duke of <hi>Espernon;</hi> which his Majesty taking notice of, fail'd not
so often as he met a crowd upon the way, to shew them the
Duke they were so inquisitive after, and when asking them some
pleasant questions, about their past disorders, even their former
miseries were at this time turn'd into delight.</p>

seeing almost none of the old Court, save the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>
(for whom he had ever had a very great esteem, though he had
been notably disappointed by him in all his designs upon <hi>France,</hi>
as has been said before) was particularly, and infinitely civil to
him. He came very frequently to his Lodgings, ever carrying
himself with great familiarity, and very obliging fashion, living in
the King of <hi>France</hi> his Court with as much liberty and freedom, as
he had been all the while in his own. His aspect, which was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,

good reason, before all the rest he had hitherto receiv'd from his
Majesties bounty. The King had a little before (as you have
heard) honour'd him with the Government of <hi>Guienne,</hi> had by
his Grace and bounty establish'd, and confirm'd him in all the
Offices, and Dignities, he had been invested withal, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of his Service: but now for the Crown of all his Favours,
the King would yet honour him with his Alliance, and make him
Father-in-law to <hi>Gabrielle</hi> a legitimated Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> one
of his own natural Sisters, being Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Great,
by the Marquise <hi>de Verneüil,</hi> and half Sister to Monsieur <hi>de Metz.</hi>
This young Princess exceeding fair, and as finely bred as any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of her condition in the Kingdom, had been the ambition of
most of the great men of the Court: but the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>
was preferr'd before all. The Queens had brought her along with
them to <hi>Lyons,</hi> and her inclination, as well as her duty, having
ty'd her particularly to the Queen, the excellency of her Wit, and
Nature, the most acceptable, the sweetest, and most accomplish'd
of her time, having acquir'd her a very good share in this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess

highest place in her Majesties favour.</p>
                  <p>So many advantageous conditions, and so many admirable
qualities having rendred this Lady one of the most considerable
matches in <hi>France,</hi> his Majesty would yet make her overweight,
by giving her himself two hundred thousand Crowns in Dowry;
assigning her the County of <hi>Senlis</hi> (a Member of his Crown
Lands) to enter upon for payment of part of the summe; to
which the Marquise <hi>de Verneüil</hi> her Mother added a hundred
thousand more. The Ceremony of this Marriage was perform'd
in the Marquis <hi>de Saint-C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Government of <hi>Lionnois;</hi> but the Magnificences at the
Duke's own Lodgings, where the Feast was honour'd with the
presence of the King, both the Queens, and all the great persons
of the Court. From such an illustrious Marriage what could be
expected less than what we now see? a Son, and a Daughter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors

of the life of the Duke of <hi>Espernon;</hi> and if in
the preceding two you have met with great
Actions, you will meet no fewer here, though
perhaps not altogether so shining as the first.
He had much to do, and no little to suffer; his
Government of a vast extent, and fruitful in Novelty, would
never suffer him to be long at rest; and the hatred of the great
Minister Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> gave him now occasion as amply to
manifest his constancy, as he had before in more favourable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
manifested his other Vertues; as you shall see in the
pursuit of his History.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the accomplishment of the Marriage of his Son the
Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> their Majesties took their way towasds <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi>
when the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> having left the new married

couple, together with his Son the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> to attend
the Court, took his leave of the King, to retire into his own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

                     </note> to take order for the transportation of his
Furniture, Arms, and Equipage, in the Castle of <hi>Angoulesme;</hi>
which he had there in so great quantity, as requir'd no little
time, nor no few hands to remove them: though he found it a
greater trouble to part with the Friends and Servants he had in that
Countrey; it being hardly possible to see in any particular Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
upon the saddest occasion, so many real tears, as were shed by
the people in general at this separation.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Angoulesme</hi> he went to <hi>Coignac,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Xain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
which was yet one of the principal Cities of his Government,
and where he had too dear a concern not to give her a visit before
his departure. And this was <hi>Marguarite de Foix,</hi> Abbess of

                  <p>The Duke, before he departed from this place, would first return
an answer to a Letter he had receiv'd a few days before from <hi>Marc
Antonie de Gourgues,</hi> first President of the Parliament of <hi>Bordeaux.</hi>

                     </note> in the time of his being
the King's Lieutenant General in <hi>Guienne,</hi> which had enrich'd
him so, as that he had provided very plentifully for his posterity;
of which this <hi>Marc Antonie</hi> being his eldest Son, he had by the
help of the wealth his Father left him, advanc'd himself to some
publick employments, and being a man of notable wit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
his parts, together with his fortune, recommended
him so as to be receiv'd into the Family of <hi>Seguieres,</hi> a Daughter
of which he married, Sister to the Chancellor of <hi>France</hi> now
being, who in those days went by the name of <hi>Autry;</hi> and in the
end through the interest of his Wives Relations was preferr'd to
the Dignity of first President in his Countrey. This <hi>Gourgues</hi> in
the time of his being at Court had made great professions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
honour and service to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who also ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of respect to his Allies, or to himself, had given him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
testimonies of no ordinary affection: So that this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
having pass'd beforehand betwixt them, the Duke expected
that at his coming into his Government, he should meet with a
sincere friend at the head of the most illustrious Body of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
whose mediation in occurrences, that might happen, would
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:63412:223"/>
be able to qualifie many little discontents, that the jealousie of
Authority usually begets in great Commands: but at the sight of
this first Letter he was of a contrary opinion,<note place="margin">Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets that betwixt the Duke and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> from which those
divisions sprung betwixt him and the Parliament, that hardly
ended, but with the Duke's death; though they were begun even
before he was receiv'd into his Administration.</p>
                  <p>The Letter of which I am speaking, after having treated of
some Affairs of little importance, that respected the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of the Province, gave the Duke at last plainly to understand:
<q>That a difficulty having been started in the Parliament about
the manner of his reception, they had determin'd to moderate
the excessive honours had formerly been paid to the Sons of
<hi>France,</hi> or the first Princes of the Blood, who had been Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Province, in going to receive them in their
Scarlet Robes; a punctilio that though it was true, it had been
wav'd in deference to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> it had nevertheless
been done meerly out of respect to the high favour wherein
he was, when advanc'd to the Government of <hi>Guienne:</hi> but
that at this time they were resolv'd to be more reserv'd.</q> I never
in my life saw the Duke more surpriz'd, than at this news, who,
jealous of his Honour and Dignity to the highest degree, would
rather never have enter'd <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> than to suffer the least dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of what had been granted to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne.</hi> He
therefore return'd an answer to this Letter, dated the 27. of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi>
1623. wherein after having briefly answer'd what concern'd
the general Affairs, he insisted with great vehemency upon the
denial of those honours had been paid to his Predecessor; telling
him amongst other things: <q>That if they had never appear'd in
their Scarlet Robes, but in honour of the Sons of <hi>France,</hi> or
the Princes of the Blood, he so well understood the respect due
to them, as they were in a capacity of succeeding to the Crown,
as not to desire a new example in his favour; but that he had
not the same consideration for others.</q> The whole Letter being
writ with his own hand, he commanded me to take a Copy of it,
from whence I have taken the very words I present you here.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, not yet satisfied with delivering his sense of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
in writing, would moreover dispatch away <hi>Constantin</hi> the
Comptroller of his House to <hi>Bordeaux</hi> to communicate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to several Members of that Parliament, who were his
particular friends; wherein he succeeded according to his own
desire, and his reception was concluded in the same form his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
had been receiv'd, some of the Company totally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning
all the first President had writ concerning this business:
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:63412:224"/>
by which the Duke having just reason to believe him the Author
of this scruple, he conceiv'd he had a mind to oblige the Society
at the price of his Friends Honour: so that being offended to the
last degree, that he should so much as bring a thing into dispute,
thas was his apparent due; he from thenceforward entertain'd
very sinister impressions of his friendship: neither was it long
before he made him sensible of it.</p>
                  <p>Whilst these things were in agitation,<note place="margin">The Duke arrives in <hi>Guienne.</hi>
                     </note> the Duke was still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
towards <hi>Cadillac,</hi> where he intended at leisure, from the
Parliaments proceedings to take his measures, what he was to do
about his entry into <hi>Bordeaux.</hi> He was here visited by all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Province, by several of the Parliament men in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and by an infinite conflux of Gentry, who came to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him at his entry, which was concluded to be upon the last
of <hi>February</hi> 1623. Whilst he here waited in expectation of the
appointed day, he dispos'd of the Governments of those places
committed to his charge; whereof that of <hi>Chasteau-Trompette</hi> was
given to <hi>Plessis, Nerac</hi> to the <hi>Count de Maillé</hi> but <hi>Bergerac,</hi> which
was a command of the greatest profit, and the most important
place, was put into the hands of the <hi>Chevalier de la Valette,</hi> the
Duke's natural Son, who by his bravery had infinitely gain'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his love and opinion. The King had besides these places, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
assign'd him two Regiments in constant pay, <hi>viz.</hi> That of
the said <hi>Chevalier de la Valette,</hi> and that of <hi>Castelbayart,</hi> together
with his Company of <hi>Gens-d' Armes;</hi> so that his Authority sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by these Forces, was much more considerable, than any
of his Predecessors had ever been.</p>

either by Letter, or Visit, a man, who although he had ever till
this time had the Duke's person, and friendship in very high
esteem; yet having been constituted the King's Lieutenant in
that Province, sometime before the Duke was promoted to the
Government, he could not without infinite impatience see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
absolutely depriv'd of all the functions of his Command.
He knew very well the Duke would be so active on his part, that
very little would be left for him to do; whereas he pretended this
Lieutenancy had been conferr'd upon him with a promise, that
if a Governour should happen to be set over him, it should be no
other than a Prince of the Blood, who should never continue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place, and that consequently, by his absence, would leave
him the absolute command of the Province: and in truth the
<hi>Mareschals, de Matignon,</hi> and <hi>d' Ornano,</hi> had formerly enjoy'd it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that manner: so that the seeing himself by this usage defeated
of that expectation, was, as he himself declar'd, the subject of
his discontent.</p>
                  <p>The Duke was very much surpriz'd at this proceeding; he
had, as there was just cause, ever had the <hi>Mareschal</hi> in very high
esteem, and could have been glad he would by gentle means have
been reconcil'd to his duty, that he might not have been oblig'd
to make use of those remedies the authority of his Command put
into his hands: which that he might not do, he consented that
some who were friends to them both should treat with him about
a better understanding betwixt them; he being unwilling, what
provocation soever he had, to have recourse to violence: wherein
perhaps he was more temperate, than ever in his life before: but in
the end, seeing his patience serv'd only to make the <hi>Mareschal</hi> more
obstinate in his unkindness, laying aside all those considerations
that had hitherto withheld him, he would no longer defer to
make him sensible of the difference betwixt a Governour and a
Lieutenant of <hi>Guienne.</hi> He therefore began imperiously to cancel
and overthrow all his Orders. A <hi>Consul</hi> of <hi>Agen,</hi> who had been
created so at his recommendation, was displac'd by the Duke's
command, for no other reason, but because he had been preferr'd
at his request; such of the Gentry, or the People, as were known
to be affectionate to the <hi>Mareschal</hi> were certain to obtain little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with the Governour: if any order was presented him sign'd
by the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> he would presently issue out another to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sede
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:63412:225"/>
the first; whatever carried the name of <hi>Themines,</hi> was inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
and whatever he own'd as his act must signifie nothing at all.
And moreover to let him see he had the same Authority over him
in his own particular Countrey, he had in other places; the Duke
prepar'd himself to go to <hi>Cahors,</hi> whither the <hi>Mareschal</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd,
and accordingly went. The <hi>Mareschal</hi>'s House stood near
this City, he was moreover invested with the<note n="*" place="margin">Or chief Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                     <hi>Seneschalsy</hi> of the
Countrey, his chiefest Relations, Friends, and Acquiantance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
there: notwithstanding all which, at the Duke's arrival
the <hi>Mareschal</hi> quitted him the place, and retir'd to his own house;
where seeing himself as it were shut up, without Reputation,
without Authority, and almost without Friends, he began, though
something with the latest, to see the error he had committed. He
then plainly saw himself so overmatch'd, that he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
but to his ruine; nor longer stand out to other purpose,
than thereby to make the advantages of his Superior more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
appear; and then it was that he rendred himself more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
to his friends perswasions, who had before been fruitlesly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
with him, to reconcile himself to his Duty, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Duke's Authority, and to seek his friendship. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sent to the Duke to make an Apology for what had pass'd,
and to let him know, that if he had hitherto fail'd of paying the
respect due to his Quality, and Command, it had not proceeded
from any dislike he had of his person, which he had in as high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and esteem, as any man living; and that he should have
look'd upon it as a very great honour to obey him, had not the
sweetness of some years Authority wherein he had commanded in
Chief, and the assurances had been given him he should do so
still, blinded his Judgment from seeing his duty: That he did
therefore beseech him, he might be permitted to come tender his
excuses for what had pass'd, and to assure him of his obedience for
the time to come. The Duke was very well pleas'd to find to this
Lord, a man full of years, and honour, in so good a dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
neither had he begun to justle him, till after having expected
the return of his good humour with the extremest patience; so
that he sent him word he should be infinitely glad to see him,<note place="margin">An Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation betwixt the Duke and the <hi>Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines.</hi>
                     </note> and
that he might be confident for the future of as civil usage, as he
had hitherto found rough, and perverse dealing in the exercise of
his Command.</p>
                  <p>A day for their interview being agreed upon by their friends,
the Duke would by no means suffer it to be in the Capital City of
his Government, being unwilling to expose the Age, and Person
of the <hi>Mareschal</hi> to so publick a satisfaction; but appointed it to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:63412:225"/>
be at <hi>Saint-Foy,</hi> whither he himself accordingly came, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with many persons of Quality of the Province; thither the
<hi>Mareschal</hi> also came to wait upon him, when coming into the
Duke's Lodgings, he receiv'd him without stirring out of his
Chamber, for which he made his being surpriz'd at Play his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.
It had been concluded that the <hi>Mareschal</hi> at their meeting
should say (as he did) <q>

it to you, and therein satisfie the King's Command, and my own Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                     </q>
To which the Duke return'd for answer in as few words,
which had also been set down in writing: <q>
                        <hi>Sir, you oblige me
with your Friendship; you and I are both of us in a capacity of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
his Majesties Service in this Province; I shall gladly concur
with you in any thing that may be conducing to it, and embrace any
occasion wherein I may let you see, that I have ever had an esteem for
your Valour, and Merit, and that I am your Servant.</hi>
                     </q> This first
visit continued but very little longer, when the <hi>Mareschal</hi> taking
his leave, the Duke brought him only to the top of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tairs,
without going any further, by which he would let him see, that
he both understood his place, and knew how to keep it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mareschal,</hi> having after this first complement, continued
two days at <hi>Saint-Foy</hi> in perfect intelligence with the Duke, at
last frankly told him: <q>
                        <hi>That he had us'd him according to his desert;
that he had made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>im know his duty; and that he took it for a greater
honour to be subservient to him, than to any other person of</hi> France.</q> And
in truth he afterwards continued, both whilst he staid in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and when he was made Governour of <hi>Brittany</hi> (which
hapned a few years after) to render him so much honour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and to give him so many testimonies of friendship, that I
do not think the Duke had a truer friend in the Kingdom: Yet
did not all this pass in the order it is here set down, there having
been some years of interval, betwixt their coldness, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation:
But I chose rather to record these passages all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than to disperse them into several pages of my History;
conceiving such a division would more have intangled the thred of
my discourse, than would have been recompens'd by the order, in
a more exact observation of the succession of time.</p>
                  <p>This Quarrel with the <hi>Mareschal de Themines</hi> was not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,<note place="margin">The Duke co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when the Duke (who had never enough to do) resolv'd to
come to an open rupture with the first President <hi>de Gourgues,</hi>
without dissembling any longer his resentment of the ill Offices
he had receiv'd at his hands. I have already given an accompt of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:63412:226"/>
the Injury, which was the Presidents proposing a diminution of
Honours at the Duke's reception; a thing that, bearing with it
a shew of contempt, pass'd in the Duke's opinion for an irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
offense. Neither could he forbear at his first visit, to give
him some hints of his displeasure, nor from manifesting a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedness
towards him: and (as heated spirits never want occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of new offense) his passion making the lightest pretenses, to
pass for reason, and just causes, there soon after fell out new acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
which animated the Duke against the first President to the
last degree. This man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> subtle and dextrous as the best, very well
foreseeing, that without the concurrence of his Brethren, he should
never be able to withstand the power of the Duke he had so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in the Quarrel, to the end that under the protection of the whole
Body, he might the better defend his own particular interest.
Neither did he herein fail to use some artifice, which he manag'd
so, that in putting finister interpretations upon the Duke's best
intentions, he possess'd the whole Company with a jealousie,
that the Duke labour'd to encroach upon the Authority of their
Estate: A part wherein all Societies of men are so sensible, and
tender, as that from the least shadows, the highest divisions are
very frequently observ'd to arise. And here, though the Duke la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
to clear their suspicion, by laying the truth before them;
yet the first impressions were so deep, and the President knew so
well how to manage their mis-apprehension, that it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to dis-unite him from his Colleagues.</p>
                  <p>The Duke exasperated, as he had just cause, at the mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>Gourgues</hi> somented betwixt the Parliament and him,
would not give him altogether the advantage of an Aggressor;
but speedily sought out all occasions to vex him, and to assault
him both in his Reputation and Fortune. He was therefore by his
order disputed with about some priviledges, he pretended to,
and usurp'd (as was said) to the prejudice of the City of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne,</hi>
near unto which he had a dwelling house: but he gave
him a more sensible blow, by prohibiting the Post-Master of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
in his absence any more to carry the Couriers, that came
through the City, to the first Presidents house, though for some
time it had been their custom so to do; pretending that it was
without any right at all, and that consequently he might by his
Authority overthrow that custom, as a new thing, and that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
absolutely upon his Command. It is most certain, that had
matters rested here, the President would have receiv'd a notable
affront; his most intimate friends having generally blam'd him,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:63412:226"/>
for applying himself much more to Politick, than to Judicial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and for that by doing more, than he was concern'd to do in
the one, he left himself no leisure to perform what he was oblig'd
to do in the other.</p>
                  <p>The first President being a crafty man, as has been said, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously
taking hold of this occasion, as suddenly remonstrated to
the Company: <q>That if in this Affair, as in the other of <hi>Libourne,</hi>
there had been nothing, but what pointed at his own private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
he should not have been concern'd in the least; but that
it aim'd directly at the honour, and dignity of the whole Body,
of which he was much more tender, than of any concern of
his own. That the dispatch of the Posts did no more respect
him in particular, than the other Officers of Parliament, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therein only the priviledge of priority, without having
any power limited to his person: That in his absence, he who
was next in order in the Company, had the same right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the Couriers, to enquire of their new<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o dismiss
them: That therefore since the Injury was common to them
all, and that the Duke made it manifest enough, he endeavour'd
to destroy the Authority of Parliament, it was necessary they
should unanimously concur with him in the support of their
own Dignity and Power: That if they did not vigorously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this first attempt upon them, they would see themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
depriv'd of all their Priviledges; and that the Sovereign
Authority, they were invested withal, would in the end be less
considerable, than that of their subalternate Judges: That
though in this Affair he was meerly animated by the common
interest, he nevertheless freely offer'd himself alone, to stand
the shock of the Duke's utmost Indignation; wherein though
he should perish, and be crush'd under the weight of his Power,
he should nevertheless be proud of so glorious a Fate, as to be
sacrific'd for the honour of that Assembly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not to be imagin'd how strange an impression this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
made upon the minds of this Fraternity, the whole body
almost being thereby betray'd into the Animosity of their head,
some few only of the eldest, and most affectionate to the Duke,
endeavour'd to qualifie the heat of this dispute, but in vain; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impossible for them to stop the violence of the Torrent: so
that the Duke, who thought he had only one enemy to deal
withal, found above an hundred rais'd up in mutiny against him.
Nay their impatience was such, that they would not defer a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the passing of an Act, at that very sitting, in opposition to
the command he had given concerning the Couriers: it is indeed
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:63412:227"/>
true, that there was after some propositions of Accommodation
tendred: but after this Thunder-clap from the Parliament, the
Duke was deaf to all overtures of agreement, his invincible spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that had ever been inflexible in all the undertakings of his life,
suggesting to him, that it would be an eternal blemish to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
should he in the least moderate his first resentment, for all
the great number of enemies that were declar'd against him.</p>
                  <p>The beginnings of this Feud were so light, and trivial in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that I should not have been so particular in the relation of
them, had they not brought on those greater disputes, that since
hapned betwixt the Duke, and this Parliament: and this is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
a Record, that I could heartily wish all that is further to
be said of this Affair, might be totally raz'd out of the Duke's
life, that the memory thereof might for ever be extinct. Neither
the Parliament, nor he got any advantage by it: the publick was
the greatest loser, as it will ever fall out in such dissentions.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s mind was not so wholly taken up with
these divisions,<note place="margin">The Duke settles his Domestick Affairs.</note> but that he had a care of the settlement of his
own Domestick Affairs, which the Queen Mothers escape from
<hi>Blois,</hi> the War that succeeded, the several expeditions he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
undertook for the King's Service, and his chargeable
Journeys whilst he attended the Court, had brought into very
great disorder. He was at this time above seven hundred thousand
Livers in debt, that he had taken up at <hi>Paris</hi> upon a Rent-Charge;
which one of his Domesticks, that had been brought up in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
undertook to acquit him of, shew'd him which way it was
to be done, and perform'd what he had undetaken: and this
was the foremention'd <hi>Constantin,</hi> Comptroller of his House;
who as he could by no better way express his Gratitude to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor,
than by doing him so important a piece of Service, he,
without any visible diminution of the Duke's ordinary way of
living, manag'd the business so, that his Master in a few years had
the satisfaction of seeing himself disingag'd from that prodigious
Debt Which, as I have said, was effected without any other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
than the retrenchment of some superfluous expenses on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(which his distance from the Court (where he was resolv'd no
more to reside) rendred altogether unnecessary. So great a blessing
is an intelligent, and faithful Servant.</p>
                  <p>But to establish the order which for the future was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in reference to this work, the Duke was upon the matter
oblig'd to make a Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> to examine the Accompts of
his Agents there; he therefore sent to the King to entreat his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
whilst the peace of the Kingdom, and the good condition
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:63412:227"/>
he had settled his Government in, rendred his presence less ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
there, to give him leave so to do. His request was easily
granted, and he accordingly departed from <hi>Bordeaux</hi> in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>December</hi> following. Some have suppos'd he did not so much
desire this Journey, for any thing that concern'd his Domestick
Affairs, as to see if any benefit was to be made of the Queen
Mothers good inclinations towards him, and to try the grateful
return she made him to expect for the signal Services he had done
her in the time of her disgrace. She was of late years become all
in all at Court, and many of her Servants, that had not so well
merited from her, as the Duke had done, had receiv'd very great
rewards: but he could not perceive the same dispositions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, nor discover the gratitude she had promis'd him,
when she was in the worst condition to express it: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as if with her Fortune she had chang'd her Nature, and as
if by being become happy, and powerful, she had been no more
the same Princess the Duke had so well serv'd, when she was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
persecution, and had no power at all: she no more remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
him, she was oblig'd to have recompens'd, by all sorts of
benefit and favour.</p>
                  <p>The Duke came to <hi>Paris</hi> so well attended, that of many years

that even so great a fault as his negligence should ruine the Affairs

                  <p>All his Accompts, and the other Affairs that most requir'd his
presence at <hi>Paris,</hi> were in less than four months dispatch'd; so
that towards the latter end of <hi>April</hi> he began to think of his return
into <hi>Guienne.</hi> The Court was then at <hi>Compiegne,</hi> whither the
Duke went to receive the King's Commands, supposing this
should be the last leave he was to take; and not expecting that his
Age, which was now very far advanc'd (he being at this time
near upon threescore, and ten years old) would permit him to make
another Journey eight years after, as he did in a marvellous health,
and vigour.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke staid at <hi>Compiegne,</hi> the King who would have
been very glad to have the mis-understanding betwixt him and
the Parliament compos'd, caus'd <hi>d' Herbaut,</hi> Secretary of State, to
treat with him about it: wherein the Duke express'd himself ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
willing to an Accommodation, and so far as to consent to the
Act about the Couriers, which was, in his own presence, by the
Council determin'd in the Parliaments favour: He was moreover
satisfied with the Order the King sent to suspend the Election of
the Maire of <hi>Libourne</hi> (which was another main thing in dispute)
till his return into the Province: But the first President was not
so well dispos'd to peace; he conceiv'd this Accommodation
would infinitely lessen the Authority he had got amongst his
Brethren during these controversies; and therefore without any

the Election of the Maire, whom the Duke found esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
at his arrival; from whence arose a new, and higher quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
than before: So that if in truth the Duke was herein to be
condemn'd for having in the beginning prosecuted things with
too much heat, the President cannot, in my opinion, be excus'd,
for thus urging them to the last extremes, without ever yielding to
such a reconciliation, as might, being timely apply'd, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the ensuing mischiefs.</p>
                  <p>The Duke having thus settled those of his Domestick Affairs,<note place="margin">The Duke goes from <hi>Paris.</hi>

Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> was since his departure created prime Minister
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:63412:228"/>
of State. I was present when the Duke receiv'd this news, at
which he was the more surpriz'd, forasmuch as he had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
nothing of that design in the time of his being at Court;
though he had been very frequent with the Queen Mother, who
had also constrain'd her self to dissemble a little forc'd shew of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity,
and confidence in him; by which he evidently saw he
was not upon so good terms with her, as they had a mind to
make him believe he was: he notwithstanding said no more at
present but this: That the Cardinal was indeed a man of great dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity;
but that he would very much change the face of Affairs,
should he long continue at the Helme. Upon the instant he, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his custom, sent him a Complement upon his new
promotion, which doubtless was not very acceptable to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
there being scarce any space left at the top of the Letter,
and nothing more than, <hi>Your very humble Servant,</hi> subscrib'd at
the bottom; a style that he continued a great while, and perhaps
too long for the interest of his Affairs, though it was indeed no
other than what he ever us'd to all other Cardinals.</p>
                  <p>After having dispatch'd this Complement, he continued his
Journey towards <hi>Guienne;</hi> where he arriv'd in the beginning of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> and where the first thing he did after his arrival was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the pretended Maire of <hi>Libourne</hi> to prison, he having been
advanc'd to that Magistracy in contempt of the King's Order.
The first President had herein his hearts desire;<note place="margin">New diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon,</hi> and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux.</hi>
                     </note> neither did he
fail to make use of this occasion, to interest the whole Body in
the affront, which he said was the greatest violence imaginable
upon their Authority; a high Complaint whereof was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
sent away to the Council. The King though very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
with the first President, would not nevertheless absolutely
countenance the Duke in the Justice he had executed in his own
behalf; but writ to him to set the Prisoner at liberty, though that
Letter could not prevail, the Duke pretending to believe that this
Command had been procur'd either at the importunity of some of
the interested party, or negligently granted, as many times a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under the Privy Seal was not hard to obtain. But the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
become now (as has been said) all powerful in Affairs, having
undertaken to establish his Majesties absolute Authority (which
was in effect the establishment of his own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

proceeding, it was then believ'd, as it was very likely, that the
Cardinal would exercise this severity towards the Duke, that his
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:63412:229"/>
will might no more be disputed; not doubting but that after an
example like this all the other great men of the Kingdom would
acquiesce in his Commands. This Arrest was directed to the
Chief Justice <hi>d' Autry,</hi> to cause it to be put into speedy execution,
without so much as forbearing to hear any Reasons the Duke
could represent to justifie the demur he had given to his Majesties
first Order.</p>
                  <p>His Sons who were at Court, and <hi>le Plessis</hi> (whom he had sent
thither not long before upon several accompts) us'd their utmost
endeavour, that the sending away of this Arrest, so highly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to the Duke's Honour, might be some time deferr'd; they
were vehemently importunate with the Queen Mother, and the
Cardinal to that purpose; but all to no effect, the Queen in so
light, though nevertheless so sensible an Affair, totally abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Duke's Interest, who had so passionately embrac'd hers in
so important occasions, and the Cardinal being obstinate in his
resolution, all the favour they could obtain in this business, was
from <hi>d' Autry</hi> himself, who was perswaded not to produce the
Order: but it was upon condition the Duke should enlarge the
Prisoner, as he immediately did, and that too the Court would
have him understand to be a special Grace. After this manner then
they began to reward the Duke's, and his Sons Services, they gave
them things of no moment, for the highest obligations, and most
current pay: they were continually us'd at this rate, and it is not
to be believ'd what prejudice these inconsiderable things were to
the Duke's more important Affairs, nor what encouragement it
gave little people frequently to offend him. It had therefore been
to have been wish'd, either that he could have supported these
affronts in his Administration, with a better temper, or totally
have retir'd himself out of their way: but his great spirit that had
never encountred any difficulty it had not overcome, was impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to be resisted by men, who as they were single incapable of
contesting with him, being embodied, would neither relent, nor
obey.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal, stung no doubt, with the Conscience of having
in so trivial a thing, disoblig'd a man, who had formerly been
serviceable to him in so many important occasions, would make
himself Mediator betwixt the Duke and the Parliament, and
consequently dispatch'd away <hi>Guron</hi> to <hi>Bordeaux</hi> for that end;
with Instructions that joyntly with <hi>d' Autry,</hi> he should labour an
Accommodation betwixt them. By <hi>Guron</hi> the Cardinal writ to
the Duke, that his Journey was absolutely upon his accompt, and
in his favour, offering withal his Service in this, and in all other
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:63412:229"/>
occasions: but these Complements were accompanied with no
marks of honour and respect, the Cardinal (doubtless nettled, at
the little Ceremony the Duke had observ'd with him in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulatory
Letter at his promotion to the Ministry) leaving by his
example, but a very little space above the first line, and concluding
his Letter with only <hi>Your affectionate Servant.</hi> Before <hi>Guron</hi>'s arrival
the difference had been already compos'd by the mediation of
<hi>d' Autry:</hi> but the Duke touch'd to the quick at the ill usage he
had receiv'd from Court, was not to be appeas'd with so light a
satisfaction; and I have ever thought that the injury he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
upon this occasion, was perhaps the first, if not the only
motive, that totally alienated his heart from the Cardinal's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
which (as you may have observ'd) he once had in as high
consideration as his own.</p>
                  <p>The Peace that had been concluded before <hi>Montpellier,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anno 1625.</note> in the
year 1622. had hitherto continued the Affairs of the Kingdom in
some repose, and though those of the Reform'd Religion express'd
great dispositions to a new Commotion, there was as yet no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
breach; so that men rather liv'd in expectation of fresh
Alarms, than in any disorder of open War: When <hi>Soubize,</hi> by an
attempt he made upon the King's Shipping at <hi>Blavet,</hi> began first
to break the Ice.<note place="margin">A new War.</note> All the rest of the Party broke into Arms at the
same time, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who had long been known
to be the head of that Faction, infecting all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which were affectionate to his cause, with his discontents,
stirr'd them into Insurrection, without ever moving from <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,</hi>
and without meeting the least contradiction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A promptitude
in his Partizans so much the more to be wondred at, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a sort of people, whose obedience was only voluntary,
and from which every one conceiv'd himself to be dispens'd by all,
both Divine, and Humane Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Montauban</hi> was one of the Cities not only of <hi>Guienne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Revolt of <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</hi>
                     </note> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of the whole Kingdom, that engag'd the deepest in this Revolt,
the Inhabitants whereof by having had a Siege rais'd from before
their Walls, and by having baffled a Royal Army, even when
animated by the presence of the King himself, being elevated to
such a degree of Vanity, as to think themselves invincible, and
their City a place not to be taken. A presumption that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
very necessary should be corrected, and the people by
some exemplary Punishment made sensible of their Crimes. It
should seem that the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was by his Destiny call'd
into <hi>Guienne</hi> only for this end; he had formerly subdu'd the pride
of <hi>Rochelle:</hi> neither did the King doubt but that he would be as
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:63412:230"/>
successful at <hi>Montauban,</hi> and that his Vertue (which had ever been
fatal to the Capital Cities of those of the Religion) assisted by his
powerful Arms, would also cause his Authority to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
and obey'd here, as it had done in other places.</p>
                  <p>He sent order therefore to the Duke to take Arms, and to
wast the Countrey all about <hi>Montauban;</hi> in order whereunto
(though the King in his own judgment thought it an Enterprize
of great difficulty) he notwithstanding allow'd him no more
than 3000. men, in three new rais'd Regiments, to wit, that of
St. <hi>Croix, d' Ornano, Foncaude,</hi> and <hi>Maillé,</hi> wherewithal to effect it.
He receiv'd a Command withal to make some Leavies; his
own Company of <hi>Gens-d' Armes,</hi> and four more of Light Horse
were also drawn into the Field for this Expedition. With these
Forces he departed from his House <hi>Cadillac,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke's Forces.</note> to advance to <hi>Mois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac,</hi>
a little Town about four Leagues distant from <hi>Montauban,</hi> the
appointed Rendezvous for the Volunteer-Troops, and Gentry;
of the latter whereof, the number was so great, that there was an
appearance of above six hundred Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>It was said that there had hardly been seen so great a conflux
of Gentry, under any Governour, as frequently attended this, he
having never any occasion to mount to Horse, for his Majesties
Service, that there was not more complaints of unkindness ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that they had not been summon'd to their Duty, than excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
made because they did not come.</p>
                  <p>It will perhaps seem strange, that the Duke's humor enclin'd
rather to austerity than sweetness should acquire him so many
lovers, and friends; for certainly he was serv'd out of affection,
it being impossible that fear could ever have drawn after him so
many free, and voluntary persons. Such as have before me refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
upon this observation, have conceiv'd that this universal love
was deriv'd from his Justice, of all others the most popular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
(as in truth the Duke was a man of most unblemish'd equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
or that it might proceed from the infinite number of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Offices, and Benefits he had, dispers'd throughout the
whole Province of <hi>Guienne;</hi> wherein there were very few Families
of any note, that stood not highly oblig'd, either immediately to
him, or to his Interest for some signal favour. To which they
have moreover added the generous disposition he had to do all
good offices for his Friends, who although he was not apt to be
familiar, was nevertheless very civil, constant in his friendships,
and always the same; insomuch that one good word from his
mouth, or one gracious undissembled look, prevail'd more upon
those who receiv'd those petty favours, than the larger promises,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:63412:230"/>
and more winning behaviour of some others, who in two days
would no more know the very man, to whom they had so lately
before vow'd the Friendship of their whole lives.</p>
                  <p>The Duke came to <hi>Moissac</hi> in <hi>Iune,</hi> and removed thence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Montauban</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Iuly,</hi> with a Commission
equally extending as well into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> as <hi>Guienne,</hi> by reason
that City, which is situated upon the Confines of both
those Provinces, has a great part of its Territory lying in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc.</hi>
He took up his Quarters at <hi>Montleigh,</hi> and <hi>Castelsarrazin,</hi>
from whence, as occasion serv'd,<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey about <hi>Montauban</hi> laid waste.</note> advancing with his Forces still
nearer the City, he executed the King's Command whereever he
went with so much vigour, and severity, that the footsteps of this
expedition were to be seen a long time after.</p>
                  <p>Yet was not this perform'd without great resistance, those of
<hi>Montauban</hi> had had early intelligence of the preparations against
them; neither had they neglected any thing that might conduce
to the defense of their fruits, or to the support of the Reputation
they had acquir'd in the preceding War. Besides the great number
of warlike Inhabitants, they had within their City, they were
moreover reinforc'd with a strong Garrison without, commanded
by <hi>Montbrun,</hi> a Gentleman of great Quality in <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> and a
man of very great Valour, sent thither for that purpose by the
Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> to which they had also call'd in several of their
Neighbours to their assistance; so that the Duke never approach'd
their Walls (which notwithstanding he did almost every day)
but that there follow'd very smart Engagements, with great loss of
men on the Enemies side: In some whereof there were left
sometimes 200. sometimes more dead upon the place; wherein
certainly the numerous Gentry, that attended the Duke in this
expedition, were of infinite great use; for the place being envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd
almost on all sides with Plains of very large extent,<note place="margin">Those of the Religion make a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</note> and the
Enemy having many more, and much better Foot, than the
Duke, had not those brave Troops of Horse continually repell'd
them, it had been to be fear'd, that Victory would not always
have been so partial to the Royal side.</p>
                  <p>The Duke perhaps never expos'd his person more, than in
these frequent Engagements; the precincts of the City were so
great, that they requir'd above a months time totally to destroy
their fruits, of all which time few days pass'd, as has been said,
without an Encounter, and in all those Encounters the Duke
was ever in person, at the head of his Troops, encouraging his
men, not so much by his voice, as by his example.</p>
                  <p>How great soever the faults of those of <hi>Montauban</hi> might be,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:63412:231"/>
it was not nevertheless without great reluctancy, that the Duke
executed his Majesties Order upon the fruits of the Countrey with
so great severity, and certainly he must have had a very obdurate
heart, that would not have been touch'd with compassion at the
sight of so many lamentable objects, as were every where to be
seen. I remember that from <hi>Pickqueros</hi> (a place famous for having
been the King's Quarter during the Siege of <hi>Montauban,</hi> and
from whence the whole Plain betwixt the Rivers <hi>Tarn,</hi> and <hi>Vaï<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
lay open to the view) so soon as the obscurity of the night gave
colour to the Fire that had been kindled by day; one might see a
thousand Fires at once: the Corn, Fruit-Trees, Vines, and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were the Aliments that nourish'd this Flame: a sadder sight I
never saw; neither can I imagine that the horrors of War can
be represented in a more dreadful form. Yet was not this severity
altogether unprofitable, even to those upon whom it was infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
I having heard several of them since confess, that nothing
so much dispos'd them to the acceptation of Peace, as this austere
usage; and they were indeed the first that embrac'd it, and who
serv'd for a leading example to the other rebellious Cities of their
Party to do the same.</p>

which is almost all the Duke's, environs a great part of the
Metropolis of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> extending it self to the very Gates of the
City; many of the richest Inhabitants whereof having possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
there, and <hi>Soubize</hi> having a design to draw from the City a
large Contribution, he threatned the Citizens to destroy their
Houses and Fruits in the Countrey (of which he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without contradiction the absolute Master) if they did not
speedily ransome them with a very considerable Summe. As he
himself press'd the City on the one side, he had of another caus'd
<hi>Verger Malagnet</hi> a Gentleman of his party, to come ashore at a
little point of Land, in the River of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> that divides the
Rivers of <hi>Garonne,</hi> and <hi>Dordongne,</hi> call'd <hi>Bec-Dambez,</hi> hoping
by that means to cut off the Commerce of those two Rivers from
the City, and by streightning it both by Land, and by Water,
the sooner to perswade the Inhabitants to give him his demand.</p>
                  <p>This design (which was not ill projected, if it had been as well
executed) alarm'd both the Parliament, and the people to such a
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:63412:231"/>
degree, that a greater confusion was hardly any where to be seen:
they knew not which way to turn them for their defense; and
though they had but too many Forces within themselves to defend
their City from the threatned mischief, yet had they no mind to
examine their own strength, that they might not be oblig'd to
put them to the Test<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this extremity the first President (though
upon no very good terms with the Duke, notwithstanding the
late Accommodation) made no difficulty to have recourse to him,
to implore his Assistance, for this time laying aside all Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Aversions: but it was only to assume them again, when
the Duke had deliver'd him from this fear, as will hereafter
appear.</p>
                  <p>At the first intelligence the Duke receiv'd of <hi>Soubize</hi> his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Medoc,</hi> though he could not himself leave the work he had
begun, without infinite prejudice to the King's Service; yet
would he not omit his care to the preservation of the principal
City in his Government. He therefore in all haste dispatch'd away
<hi>le Plessis</hi> to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> to advise with the Parliament what course
was to be taken, for the relief of the City, and Countrey, against
<hi>Soubize</hi> his attempts; giving him order withal to draw out part of
the Garrison of <hi>Bergerac,</hi> and to raise new Forces within his own
Territories, to serve himself withal upon this occasion; writing
moreover to his Friends and Servants in the Countrey to joyn
with him, and to <hi>Toiras</hi> who lay in the Isle of <hi>Ré;</hi> entreating
him to advance with all the men he could conveniently draw out
of the Regiment of <hi>Champagne,</hi> of which he had the Command.
Instructions that were so well observ'd by <hi>le Plessis,</hi> and he so
well seconded by the Parliament and <hi>Iuratts</hi> (who were very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to concur in an Affair that so much concern'd their common
safety) that all things were in a short time put into a very good
Posture: By which means the Duke, without suffering himself to
be diverted from the employment he had before <hi>Montauban,</hi> not
only frustrated the Enemies design, but also extracted thence the
opportunity of obtaining the honour of a second Victory. <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bize</hi>
being shamefully repuls'd, his Forces routed, the few that es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd
the Victors hands, and with much ado, recover'd their
Ships, leaving their Dead, Arms, Artillery, and Baggage, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
testimonies of a total Defeat.</p>
                  <p>The War was carried on in all places, so much to the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party, that the principal Heads, and best
Cities of their party apprehending a continuation of those evils
they had already suffer'd, thought fit to sue to the King for Peace.
Which was accordingly granted them; but upon conditions far
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:63412:232"/>
different from those they were us'd to insist upon in former times;
<hi>Rochelle</hi> if self not being in this Treaty able to obtain, that they
might be freed from the slavery of <hi>Fort-Loüis:</hi> but on the contrary,<note place="margin">The Peace concluded.</note>
for an augmentation of their grief constrain'd by the Articles to
admit of a Chief Justice set over them by the King, oblig'd to slight
all their new Fortifications, to receive his Majesty with all due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and respect, so oft as he should please to honor them with his
Presence, and to keep no more Ships of War in their Haven. The
<hi>Rochellers</hi> would never have submitted to these hard Conditions,
had not the other Cities of their party, and above all the rest
<hi>Montauban</hi> positively declar'd they would no more expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to those Miseries they had suffer'd in the burning up of their
Countrey: so that if we will consider the Duke's conduct
throughout the whole business, we shall find it more than a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
conducing to the general Peace the King granted upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

                  <p>But this Peace,<note place="margin">Anno 1626.</note> to the acceleration of which the Duke had so

having receiv'd a Copy of the same Declaration, without ever
acquainting the Duke, who was come no further than <hi>Cadillac,</hi>
caus'd the Peace to be openly proclaim'd, and that with so much
precipitation, that he would not forbear so long as till he could hear
from <hi>Montauban,</hi> to know whether they had there accepted the
Peace or no. This impatience the Duke could not but interpret
purposely put on to affront him; 'tis true, that, had no unkindness
pass'd betwixt him and the President before, the business was of
it self so light, that it might well enough have pass'd without any
great notice taken: but the preceding Differences giving him to
understand, that it must needs be done out of design, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complain'd of it to those Friends he had in the Parliament, but
moreover writ about it to Court, and gave the President plainly
to understand, that he would no more suffer such Contempts.</p>
                  <p>This proceeding of the first President's was by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
at Court; it was there look'd upon as an occasion of noise
and bustle, maliciously and unseasonably sought, and for which
he receiv'd a little rebuke: but this spirit not much delighted
with rest, having met with another that was never tir'd out
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:63412:232"/>
either in War, or Business; it was almost necessary that successive
differences should continually arise betwixt them. This at the last
proceeded so far,<note place="margin">Which grows to a very great height.</note> that the publick Peace was therein no little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd:
the Parliament pass'd many Acts, and the Duke as many
Ordinances to contradict those Acts. From Acts, and Ordinances
they proceeded to Invectives, and from words to some untoward
effects. Some of the Presidents Servants were ill us'd, and himself
threatned; whereupon the Palace was shut up, and a cessation
of Justice decreed. The Duke's Friends and Servants fear'd to
fall into the Parliaments hands, and those who were affectionate
to the Parliament, were not well us'd by the Governour; many
Decrees by reason of the dissention betwixt the two parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
unexecuted, for not being justified by Power, which gives
life to Justice. Such as were the most moderate, and best dispos'd
of the Company, could not without great grief behold these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions;
but those were not the prevailing part: so that things
being every day more and more exasperated, it was infinitely to
be fear'd they would in the end shoot up to the last extreme,
though they were already grown to a sufficient height.</p>

had unravell'd many great intricacies, and overcome the greatest

that the greatest aversions to it were not in the Duke, as he satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Court at his return; to which both parties at last were
forc'd to appeal, and to submit unto a severe, and definitive Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
after they had rejected all rational, and moderate
ways.</p>
                  <p>This Quarrel was on both sides carried on with extraordinary
heat, the first President himself was deputed by the Parliament
to maintain their cause before the Council; to whom President
<hi>du Bernett,</hi> a man of great esteem, and approved wisdom (and
then thought very worthy, one day to possess the first place in
that Company, as he afterwards did) was also joyn'd. The Duke
also on his part dispatch'd away first <hi>le Plessis,</hi> and after him

                     <hi>Magnac</hi> his Kinsman; a Gentleman of great Courage, of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

and with great reverence pour'd out themselves in eloquent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
a Regulation ensu'd, at which both parties were equally
displeas'd. And then it was that all the world plainly saw, and
chiefly those who were immediately concern'd, that they were not
sorry at Court at the continuation of these dissentions; and that
the design being already laid to diminish all the Authorities of the
Kingdom, to unite them in one single person, they were glad to
see them insensibly put their own hands to their own destruction.</p>
                  <p>These little disorders were not yet fully compos'd,<note place="margin">A disorder at Court.</note> when an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
of much greater importance began to disclose it self at
Court, which occasion'd the death of <hi>Chalais,</hi> and the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
of the Duke, and the Grand Prior of <hi>Vandosme.</hi> They
would also have involv'd the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who at this time
retir'd to <hi>Metz,</hi> in this Affair; and to that end tempted him by
<hi>la Louviere,</hi> the Confident of <hi>Chalais,</hi> to receive the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi>
into that City: but they had to do with a man so well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in his Duty to his Prince, that all <hi>la Louviere</hi> could obtain
of the Duke was only a civil repulse in these terms: <q>That the
place was none of his: That he was only a substitute to the
Duke his Father: That he was therefore to apply himself to
him, and that for his part he should do whatever his Father
would please to command him.</q> He could not have serv'd the
King more faithfully, than by retaining this respect to the Duke
his Father, whose principles he knew to be perfectly Loyal, and
himself inseparably ty'd to his Majesties Service; yet was not the
Court satisfied with this proceeding: but the Duke, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
been tamper'd withal from the same part, through the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
of the Abbot <hi>d' Aubazine,</hi> by the candour of his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so clearly justified their common intentions, that both the
one and the other had all the satisfaction they could themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
Yet was this satisfaction in words only, and the Duke was
notwithstanding very ill us'd in several occasions; of which ill
usage he could not forbear highly to complain: neither in his
complaints were the Queen Mother, as powerful as she was, nor
the Cardinal himself excepted: The hard measure he receiv'd
under their Administration being so much the more sensible to
him, by how much he had infinite reasons (as may be gather'd out
of the former passages) to expect they should have been altogether
partial to his Interests: but though his great and advantageous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
had been so lately perform'd, the memory of them was
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:63412:233"/>
notwithstanding totally worn out, and the Cardinal was already
exasperated, though by occasions of so little moment, as scarce
ought to have been taken notice of: Neither doubtless would
they have been, had he been in another condition: but as great
Authorities are usually very tender, in the great height of State,
and Power he then stood, they carried, in his opinion the quality
of most high injuries, which thenceforward dispos'd his heart to
those strange Animosities, which we shall see in time break out.</p>

Bourbon,</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Montpensier.</hi> This match had been thought
worthy of him by <hi>Henry</hi> the Great his Father, and the Duke of
<hi>Espernon,</hi> who had the honour to be great Uncle to this Princess,
prepossess'd with the hopes of so great a Fortune for his Niece,
and so great an honour both to himself, and his whole Family,
had made no difficulty to expose himself to the hatred of the late
<hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> in refusing him (as you may have observ'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
this Lady in Marriage for <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son. And truly what
rubs soever had hapned in the way of this Match, the Duke not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
never lost the hope, nor the ambition to see it one
day brought to effect. It is not therefore to be doubted, but that
the accomplishment of a thing by him so ardently coveted, must
be highly pleasing to him. The first news he heard of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of these Nuptials was by a Gentleman dispatch'd

wherein the high Dignity, to which she was arriv'd, nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
her from paying the Duke the respect that decency, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximity
exacted from her; she writ to him therefore with her own
hand, and the express words of the Letter were these.

There was a strange and sudden alteration in <hi>Madames</hi> style, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her Marriage it had us'd to be <hi>Monsieur my Uncle,</hi> and her
Letters always ended with <hi>Your most humble, and most affectionate
Servant:</hi> but one sole night had so rais'd her above her former
condition (though very illustrious before) that there was now very
little difference betwixt her style, and that us'd by the Queen, and
Queen Mother; neither was the Duke, it may be suppos'd, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
to be so us'd, and the advancement of so near a Relation,
being in part his own; that which seem'd a little to lessen him in
this new way of writing, he conceiv'd to be amply recompens'd
in the honour of this Alliance. The Dutchess of <hi>Guise</hi> also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
this Letter of <hi>Madame</hi> her Daughter with another
from her self; wherein she made an excuse for not having written
to the Duke before the Marriage, as it had been her Duty to do:
<q>Telling him they had met with so many difficulties in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that she could never believe it would take effect, till she saw
it absolutely done, which uncertainty had occasion'd that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</q>
The King presently after did him the same honour, as also
the two Queens, the <hi>Monsieur</hi> himself, with the rest of his new, and
illustrious Allies: but before he receiv'd the honour of these last
Complements, the Duke had sent the <hi>Count de Maillé</hi> to Court to
prevent them, and with all humble respect to let them know,
how infinitely satisfied he was, to see his Family, by his Majesties
Royal Bounty, rais'd to such an eminent degree of honour, as it
was by this Marriage.</p>
                  <p>The Peace of the Kingdom,<note place="margin">Anno 1627.</note> the success of the Marriage of
<hi>Madame,</hi> and the news of the Dutchess <hi>de la Vallette</hi>'s being great
with child, hapning almost at the same time, had altogether so
overcharg'd the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> with an excess of joy, that it
must of necessity overflow: He would therefore communicate
part of his own satisfaction to the publick; and as all his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would ever break out after an extraordinary manner, so this
of so excessive a joy, gave him a new occasion of shewing the
world the largeness of his heart.<note place="margin">The Duke appo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

least Ornament of that great Solemnity. As the expense of this
Festival was exceeding great, the Assembly continuing for above
fifteen days together; so Fortune would seem to contribute some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to this profusion: but she did only seem to do it, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having presented the Duke with Millions, and brought them
almost to his own door, she rather chose to bury them in the Sea,
than to make good what she had so fairly promis'd. It is of the
wrack of the Carricks that I am about to speak, which hapned
at this time; and having had a Relation of so remarkable an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident

                  <p>After the Conquest the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had made of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the same Custom the <hi>Portugals</hi> had formerly
paid to their natural Princes, for the Liberty of their <hi>East India</hi>
Trade, devolv'd of course to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> but with this
condition nevertheless, that the <hi>Portugals</hi> should not be oblig'd
to unlade their Merchandize in any other part of the Catholick
King's Dominions, than that of <hi>Lisbon</hi> only, for a Mark of the
antient Right those of their Nation had ever had to that Traffick
with the <hi>Indies.</hi> This priviledge was the loss of those two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks;
they had set sail from <hi>Goa</hi> the fourth of <hi>March,</hi> 1626 la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Merchandize of very great price, as Diamonds, and
other Stones; Amber-gris, Besoar, Spices, Drugs, Silks, and
other rarities both of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> to
the value of above two Millions and a half of Gold at least in
either bottom. They had been mann'd out with above four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty, what Mariners, and Souldiers, besides several Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and other persons of condition, that either by the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Travail, or thirst of Gain, had been tempted into those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
parts of the world. All these together made up above six
hundred persons, and one might indeed more properly have call'd
these prodigious Hulks (which were each of them of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Tun) floating Cities, rather than Ships built for Navigation;
they having in them all sorts of Artizans, establish'd Markets,
Victuallers, and almost all sorts, and conditions of men, with
the same policy, and civil Regiment, that is usually observ'd in
the greatest, and most populous Cities. These two great Vessels
that seem'd to be Sovereigns of the Sea, and that despising any
thing of a Storm, fear'd nothing but Quick sands, Fire, and
Rocks, after a prosperous Voyage, were surpriz'd in the Road of
<hi>Lisbon</hi> with foul weather, and driven back to <hi>Coruna</hi> a very good
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:63412:235"/>
Port, upon the Coast of <hi>Galicia</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> Where the storm conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
very long, the Captains of the Carricks were by those of
the Town importun'd to unlade their Goods in that Harbour, and
no more to expose so great Riches acquir'd with so much peril,
and pains, to the dangers of the Sea: but they were deaf to that
motion, and on the contrary highly insisting upon their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> at last gave way to their obstinacy; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
only the Admiral of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Navy, <hi>Don Manuel de
Menezes,</hi> with six of the best Gallions of his Squadron to put to
Sea, and to Convoy them safe to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> though this precaution
only serv'd to augment his loss. The Gallions came up to the
Carricks, to which the Admiral gave express order, not to stir
thence till a calmer season. But what good Counsel can prevent
Mischance? the Carricks contrary to all order and advice, upon
the first little Truce of the Tempest (which, as it often falls out
at Sea, only retir'd to return with greater fury) weigh'd Anchor,
and put out to Sea: but they had no sooner committed their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
to the mercy of the winds, but that they found themselves
engag'd in the greatest stress of weather, that perhaps has at any
time been seen; and after a Tempest of two and twenty days,
without any intermission, they came at last to suffer Shipwrack,
one at <hi>Cap-Breton,</hi> near to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> and the other two days after
upon the Coast of <hi>Medoc;</hi> in which exigent of Fortune the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
were so faithful to them, as to bear them company in ruine:
so that three attending either Carrick, the loss was equal in both
places.</p>
                  <p>The Duke receiv'd the first news of this accident from the
Common Bruit, and that not till three days after it had hapned;
and indeed the rains that had fall'n, during this tempestuous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
had so overflow'd the ways, that although this Coast be
no more than ten or twelve Leagues distant from <hi>Bordeaux</hi> only,
it had been impossible sooner to have pass'd: but it is likewise
true, that the Inhabitants of the Countrey, a barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
people (as generally Sea-borderers are) and inur'd to the
spoil of Wracks, were not over hasty to acquaint the Duke's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
with this, that they might not be disturbed whilst busie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
after Booty. At last, and whilst preparing for the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
solemnity, he heard of this misfortune, and that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who deliver'd themselves for men of Quality,
preserv'd out of a greater number that perish'd, were upon their
way coming to implore his assistance; and accordingly the next
day this miserable company, consisting of two hundred, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
were seen to enter the City, in the lamentable plight may
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:63412:235"/>
be imagin'd of men, that had been expos'd to the fury of a Wrack.
The Duke took care to lodge them in the City, furnish'd them
with Victuals, took order for Cloaths for them, and reliev'd them
with money; when being by some of them inform'd of the great
Riches that was in the Carrick he mounted to Horse to hinder the
Pillage, and Disorder, which had already continued five or six
days together without intermission; it was nevertheless impossible
for him to get to the shoare, the ways were so impassible; so that
he was constrain'd to return back, to begin his Triumph.</p>
                  <p>The Solemnity was begun, with a Skirmish of sixscore Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassieres,
divided into two Troops, and arm'd Cap-a-pie; the
next day they ran the Ring in the same Equipage they fought:
after which they ran disarm'd with Vizors, and afterwards ran at
Tilt, for five or six days together, doing all the Exercises that are
to be perform'd on Horseback.</p>
                  <p>The Horse Exercises being gone through, they must now come
to a representation of Foot Service, that the angry trade of War
might be set forth in all its Forms. In a spacious place therefore,
at one of the Extremities of the City, the Duke caus'd two regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Forts to be built, and fortified according to all the Maxims of
Art. These Forts were mann'd with arm'd Souldiers to defend
them, they were batter'd with Cannon, assaulted, and in the end
taken, so much to the delight of the beholders, as made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
there can be no so dreadful Original, from whence pleasant
Copies are not to be taken.</p>
                  <p>The Combat of the Forts was follow'd by a noble Masque, and
a Ball, and those by a Combat at Barriers, which concluded the
Solemnity; the last Act of which was set out with infinite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense,
and very great Art. There were in it seven Entries, and all
those usher'd in with great Machines, contriv'd by the principles
of the several parties, who were all persons of eminent Quality.
I shall not however undertake a description of all the remarkable
passages therein, there having been then a collection taken of them
that made up a Volume of it self, and I having no need to swell
this with unnecessary relations.</p>
                  <p>It was no little addition to the Duke's particular joy,<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de Cand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the general satisfaction of the whole Assembly, to find it honour'd
with the presence of the Duke <hi>de Candale,</hi> the Duke's eldest Son.
It had now been ten years complete, that their common misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had caus'd a separation betwixt them; wherein though the
Father had high causes of Discontent, yet had the gallant behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the Son been such, and had so far prevail'd upon his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection, that at this time without all doubt he had an equal
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:63412:236"/>
share with his Brothers in the Duke's Favour. Neither indeed
could the Heroick Son have better spent these years of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
who seeing he could not honourably live in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
whilst out-law'd in his Fathers Favour, went to exercise his
profession of Arms in <hi>Holland,</hi> at that time the most conspicuous
Theatre of War in all Europe: He had not there long continued,
before by his brave deportment he so far won the opinion of
<hi>Count Maurice</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (acknowledg'd by all the world
to be one of the greatest Captains of his time) that he doubtless
possess'd the highest place in his confidence, and esteem. A short
Truce being concluded in that Countrey, he went from thence
to <hi>Venice,</hi> where he commanded some of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Militia in
the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and in process of time, having gain'd the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
opinion of that Serene Republick, he was at last honour'd
with one of their principal Commands, and made General of all
their Land-Forces; an Employment wherein he serv'd upon so
many brave occasions, as would deserve a particular History;
when at last more ardently desir'd, than well us'd by <hi>France</hi> his
native Countrey, he came to end his days in his own Princes
Service, and in the Command of one of his chiefest Armies.
The Duke his Father, when sometimes speaking of him, would
say, that he could hardly wish his Son had never done amiss,
since he had done so glorious a Penance for his faults, and by so
many Heroick Actions expiated the afflictions he had brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</p>
                  <p>The arrival of this long absent Son, was not yet the utmost
bound of the Duke's satisfaction; he receiv'd another at the same
time, that touch'd his heart with a more sensible joy, than any
thing that has been mention'd before: and doubtless it would
have been greater now, than it was then, had God been pleas'd
to have prolong'd his life till these days, that he might have seen
the fruits of the just expectation he had conceiv'd at the Birth of as
hopeful an Heir, as he could possibly have wish'd. I have already
told you, that the news of his Daughter-in-law the Dutchess <hi>de la
Valette</hi>'s being great with child, was one of the occasions that
caus'd this Publick rejoycing, and that Assembly was scarce broke
up, when he receiv'd by a Courier, dispatch'd away for that purpose
certain news of her being brought to bed of a Son:<note place="margin">The Birth of the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had more zealously begg'd of Almighty God, than any other
thing in this world; and that he had the most reason to desire,
that he might see his succession continued in a hopeful Heir: But
as this was the richest Present, this young Princess could possibly
make him, so it was (God knows) the last; she ten days only
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:63412:236"/>
surviving the Birth, who being deliver'd upon the fourteenth of
<hi>April,</hi> and dying the four and twentieth after, left her noble Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
a Widower, and all <hi>France</hi> her mourners.</p>
                  <p>The Duke receiv'd this sad news as he was upon his return
from <hi>Medoc,</hi> to which place the Wrack of the Carrick had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
him to make a second Journey, and where, now that the
season gave him leave to come nearer to the Sea, we saw a most
incredible thing; which was the Relicks of this mighty Vessel,
several pieces whereof were to be seen, for above a quarter of a
League together, along the shoar, and in so great number, that
whoever had seen those floating Spoils, would rather have judg'd
them the ruines of some demolish'd City, than the remains of
one single Ship. The Duke with much ado recover'd twelve
great brass Pieces, that were buried in the Sands, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
all that could be sav'd, of an hundred and eight, or ten, that
were aboard, either the Carrick, or the Gallions that Convoy'd
her. Upon his return from this short Journey, the Duke receiv'd

their mutual Affliction, wherein, as a more just occasion of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
could not possibly arrive, so could it not possibly be express'd
with more, or with more unfained tears.</p>
                  <p>Upon this sad occasion both the Father, and the Son receiv'd

                  <p>In this variety of good, and evil events but (as it usually falls

evil than good, the Duke saw himself necessitated to engage in a

Dispute with the Cardinal, and upon this occasion. The rumour
that had been spread abroad of the infinite Riches the shipwrack'd

of the Navies (with which he had also confounded that of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral)
gave him to all the wracks that should happen upon the
Coasts of <hi>France.</hi> Wherein doubting nevertheless that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Officers he had establish'd at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> as in all other parts
and Havens of the Kingdom, would not be sufficient to justifie
his Claim against the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who was upon the place,
and whom he knew to be a man, that would not easily be baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
out of his Right; he caus'd a Commission to be directed to
one <hi>Fortia</hi> a young Master of Requests,<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> that under the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Royal Name he might with greater facility obtain his
own desires. This business was at first debated with great civility
and moderation, and the Duke was very willing to satisfie the
Commissioner of his Right, and Title,<note place="margin">The Duke's Title.</note> by shewing him Evidences
of above three hundred years standing, by which his Ancestors
had ever been maintain'd in their Title to all the Wracks that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon the Coast of <hi>Medoc,</hi> exclusively not only to the Officers
of the Admiralty, but even to the King himself: by whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
it had been formerly demis'd in free gift to the Lords of
<hi>Candale</hi> for ever. After which he moreover deliver'd him Copies
of those Evidences, clearing to him by several Authentick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and Records, his antient, and lawful Right; which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
him to prefer to the Council, together with his Reasons, and
the equity of his cause. But this was not the thing was desir'd at
Court, and <hi>Fortia</hi> was blam'd for having taken cognisance of
the Duke's Title, and for having receiv'd Copies of his Deeds,
as if he had a mind to bring a business to the issue of a Suit, and
Tryal, wherein they intended that Authority should stand for
Law. <hi>Fortia</hi> therefore having receiv'd this check, would for the
future endeavour by violence to repair, what he had by modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and respect to Equity overthrown; and to that end began
to talk to the Duke in other terms, than he had us'd at first;
wherin meeting with a Spirit that was not to be frighted with the
menaces of the Court, the heat of their disputes grew at last to
an open Quarrel betwixt them. Whereupon the Commissary, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unwilling, or not daring to have any more to do with the
Duke, desir'd to be recall'd, as he was; and it is not to be doubted
at his return to the Cardinal fail'd not to lay all the evil success of
his own ill carriage at the Duke's door, by whose ill offices the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
discontents were not likely to be any thing qualified, much
less appeas'd.</p>

The Duke had in the mean time dispatch'd away <hi>le Plessis</hi> to
the King, to beseech his Majesty that he would please to send to
the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> to do him right in his lawful claim; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him moreover instructions to go to the Cardinal, and in his

Council as he should himself think fit;<note place="margin">The Duke offers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would willingly stand to their award: but the Duke's case was
too clear for the Cardinal to submit his to reference. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
seen his Title, which was such as he knew nothing but the
Sovereign Authority could supersede, and that made him deaf to
any thing of Arbitration. He chose therefore rather to continue
his pretense under the protection of the Royal Name, and to that
purpose procur'd <hi>Monsieur Servient,</hi> another Master of Requests,
to be put into Commission to prosecute his Title in <hi>Fortia</hi>'s stead;
a man that by his dexterity and handsome carriage prevail'd so
far upon the Duke's inclination, and esteem, that he obtain'd that
from him, and in a very few days, which the other had been
constrain'd to give over, as a hopeless thing, and impossible to be
effected.</p>

the rich lading of this prodigious Carrick, the rest being either
buried in the Sea, or pilfred away by the Countrey people, though
all put together was but a very small part of this mighty loss. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient</hi>
therefore by a gentle, and insensible violence, having (as has
been said) won upon the Duke's inflexible temper, obtain'd all
the satisfaction he could desire, and in exactly observing his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
acquir'd the Duke withal for his friend, performing
therein what is only reserved for men of extraordinary Conduct,
which was to reconcile so opposite Interests, and yet to disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige

<pb n="448" facs="tcp:63412:238"/>
House of Lords, of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to give an account
of the Treasure, that (as they pretended) had been imbezzeld du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Reign of the late King: upon which occasion, the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
natural to that Nation in such Inquisitions, making him just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to apprehend the issue of an Enquiry; wherein perhaps it had
been impossible for any man living to have satisfied their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or their Malice; he chose rather to withdraw himself
from the inconvenience of such a Trial, and to put himself into a
posture of standing upon his own Guard, than to run the hazard
of a Sentence that he could not expect should be favourable to
him, from men that were envious of his Favour and Fortune:
and this has been said to have been one motive to this Invasion.
Another, and which was no less prevalent with the Duke (as
some have deliver'd, who pretended to be very privy to his
thoughts) was the jealousie he had of the Cardinal's greatness, of
whom he had been so ill satisfied in a late Embassy into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,<note place="margin">Our <hi>English</hi> Authors, that as they must needs be better inform'd of the motives of this War, are likely better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, give a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> Bakers <hi>Chronicle.</hi>

in all probability was likely to be favour'd with an Insurrection of
those of the Reform'd Religion at home (who were not depress'd
to that degree, but that they were yet very considerable) put the
whole Court into a very great Alarm: wherein the Cardinal, who

                  <p>
                     <hi>Le Plessis</hi> hapned in this juncture of time to be at Court, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as has been said) he had been before dispatch'd by the Duke
his Master to solicit his Interest about the Wrack of the Carrick.
This Gentleman was so generally esteem'd by all both for his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and his Experience in matters of War, and principally by
the Cardinal (who had been a witness of his behaviour through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Queen Mother's Affairs, and had in those times contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a strict League of Friendship with him) that he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply'd himself to him in this urgent necessity; neither did he
herein forget any promises that might induce him, or omit any
endearments that might oblige him to render the Duke his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
favourable to his designs, and himself to accept of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
upon this important occasion:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Le Plessis</hi> the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Domestick Servant, has the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Regiment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that no more mention should be made of the Carrick, or of any
other cross Affair he had been perplex'd withal, and had now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
at Court. Upon this assurance <hi>Le Plessis</hi> departed from
Court, provided with ten Commissions for the raising of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his own name, and with all the civil Language, and fair
Promises could be desir'd for the Duke his Master, whose assistance
was exceedingly considerable, by reason of the short cut by Sea,
betwixt <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and <hi>Rochelle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Le Plessis</hi> arriv'd in <hi>Guienne</hi> in the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> where
he first gave the Duke an accompt of his own Affairs, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
acquainted him with the Commission he had receiv'd for
himself; who was so assisting to him in the raising of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it was one of the first that was ready for this Service.
The Duke no sooner saw <hi>Le Plessis</hi> Companies compleat, but
that he fell to making ready the Succours were requir'd of him for
the Fort of the Isle of <hi>Ré,</hi> already besieg'd by the <hi>English</hi> Forces,
though I must confess it was (contrary to his custom in other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions)
exceeding slowly: not that he did not heartily desire to
see <hi>Rochelle</hi> reduc'd to the King's Obedience, but he could have
been glad that the Cardinal, whom he had no reason to love,
might have had no share in the honour of this great Enterprize;
as if he had then foreseen that the addition of Reputation, and
Greatness, he must infallibly derive from that success, would one
day prove fatal to him. Yet in this distraction of thoughts he fail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
not nevertheless to prefer his Duty before all other respects, that
regarded either his own Passion, or Interest; and in effect the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:63412:239"/>
great Succours that were drawn together upon <hi>Olome</hi> Sands, and
by which the Isle was preserv'd, consisted principally of those
Forces he sent away from <hi>Bordeaux.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet was not this the only thing wherein the Duke was highly
serviceable upon this important occasion,<note place="margin">Anno 1628.</note> his instructions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
as much at least to the taking of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> as any other
means whatsoever: for it was he, without all contradiction that
gave the first advice for the bringing up a Cawsey to block up the
Harbour, and who rejected all the propositions of <hi>Pompeo Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,</hi>
as frivolous, and of no use; and indeed the success of those
floating Forts, and Bridges contriv'd by this <hi>Italian</hi> Engineer,
proving such, as the Duke had prophesied it would be, they were
fain when all was done to follow his advice. A Copy of which
advice I here present you, as it was written by his own hand to the
Duke of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> before the Cardinal came before <hi>Rochelle;</hi>
the Duke rather choosing (it should seem) to communicate his
opinion to this Prince, than to any other of the Commanders of
the King's Army, as he had his person in much greater esteem.

assur'd, and consequently that of reducing <hi>Rochelle</hi> to the last

somewhat a tedious way, but in a year or two at most the

did not joyn with them, or that refus'd to be involv'd in
the ruine of that Rebellious City. It was impossible the root of
this Faction could be so violently shaken, and the incorporate
branches remain insensible of the motion: so that the extremest
members thereof, foreseeing a certain, and general ruine in the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:63412:240"/>
fall of <hi>Rochelle</hi> (which was, as it were, the body where the soul of
their Interest did inhabit) they no sooner saw it threatned by these
mighty preparations: but that the common safety made them
concur in the common defense, and break into open Arms in all
parts of the Kingdom. In <hi>Languedoc,</hi> the <hi>Sevennes,</hi> and <hi>Guienne</hi>
they were excited by the instigation of the Duke of <hi>Rohan: Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban</hi>
follow'd the example of the rest,<note place="margin">And of <hi>Montauban.</hi>
                     </note> and what Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
soever the Inhabitants of that City had made to the Duke of
<hi>Espernon,</hi> that they would continue firm in their duty, their desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
notwithstanding over-rul'd all those temperate resolutions, and
the hour was now come, that the King's Victories must (in spight
of their own endeavours to oppose it) establish them in a happier
degree of Peace, and Safety, than till this time they had ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd,
even in the greatest prosperity of their Affairs.</p>
                  <p>It was no fault of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s, that they did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this benefit better cheap, and by better ways, and that they
were not at once both happy, and innocent: he often by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
put them in mind of their duty, and of the promises they
had so faithfully made him, to continue firm therein, and, for a
final testimony of the zeal he had to their preservation, sent to
them one of the most powerful instruments he could possibly
make choice of for so good a work. And this was <hi>Morin,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor

                     <hi>Chambre de l' Edict</hi> of <hi>Guienne,</hi> a man of
admirable
Wit, and great Eloquence, to perswade them to their own good,
had they been capable to understand it; and one the Duke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the more proper for this imployment, as being one of
their own perswasion, who had born Arms amongst them with
great Reputation and Valour, and who having upon very good
considerations reconcil'd himself to this Duty, was the more fit to
perswade them to do a thing, wherein he had himself been a
leading example.</p>
                  <p>So soon as these, and the rest of their Party had declar'd, the
King seeing the War kindled in almost all the Provinces of his
Kingdom, sent away the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> in the
quality of Lieutenant General of his Armies, not only in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi>
and <hi>Guienne,</hi> but likewise in some other adjoyning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
to whom he also deliver'd two Commissions of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Generals under him, for the Dukes of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and
<hi>Espernon.</hi> The latter of these had no sooner intelligence of the
Prince's arrival at <hi>Tholouze,</hi> but that he immediately posted thither
to pay him the respect due to a Prince of the Blood, and from his
own mouth to receive his Majesties Commands. He was there
receiv'd by the Prince with all the tenderness, and manifestation
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:63412:240"/>
of entire confidence he could possibly expect, or desire: but how
kindly soever he took this entertainment, he could not neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
force his complacency so far as to accept of the Commission
the Prince had to give him of Lieutenant General under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
He at first defended himself from it by several very civil,
and respective excuses; telling him, amongst other things: <q>That
being his most humble Servant (and he was effectually so) no
condition whatever could more subject him to his Commands,
than the respect he had for his Quality and Person had already
done, and that for any thing else, the power he had as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Guienne,</hi> giving him of it self sufficient Authority to
cause him to be obey'd in whatever he should please to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
within that Province, he did not stand in need of any
further Commission for that end.</q> But at last (the Prince unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to understand his excuses, and still pressing him to receive it)
the Duke with his usual liberty franckly told him: <q>That from
his youth till that time he had ever been honour'd with such
Commands immediately under the King's his Masters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having ever accepted that quality under any other than
themselves; and that he did therefore beseech him he would
please to permit him in this last Act of his Life, to retain a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he had for so many years, and under so many glorious
Masters enjoy'd.</q> After so candid a Declaration, the Prince
would no more importune him; neither did he discover the least
offense, or unkindness, at the Duke's refusal; which he had the
more reason to be satisfied withal, as he very well knew he had
formerly rejected the same Employment under the <hi>Count de
Soissons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke had no sooner taken leave of the Prince, but that
he return'd back in all diligence towards <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> to take order
for the raising of such Forces, as he was to set on foot. He had
at present no more, than the same Regiments of Foot, and the
same Troops of Horse, that had serv'd before in the like occasion,
and those the Marquis <hi>de Monferrat</hi> (whom he had lately made
Lieutenant of his own Company of <hi>Gens d'-Armes</hi>) had order to
draw into the field: but these small Forces were scarce ready when
the Duke receiv'd intelligence that a little Town call'd <hi>Caussade,</hi>
near to <hi>Montauban,</hi> had had the confidence to declare for the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot</hi>
Party. Upon this news the just apprehension he had, lest
the other Cities of his Government, that were inclin'd this way,
should follow this ill example; and lest in the end, instead of
<hi>Montauban</hi> alone, he should find thirty good Cities oppos'd against
him, made him hasten that way to chastize these first Rebels: but
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:63412:241"/>
he was hardly there arriv'd, when he understood both by several
Letters from the Prince, and by other pressing intelligence from
the Court it self, that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had gather'd together
a considerable body of an Army in <hi>Sevennes,</hi> where he was still
rallying so many other Forces of his Party, that of them he
doubted not to make up such an Army,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> opposes himself to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who was moving with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the relief of <hi>Rochelle.</hi>
                     </note> as would be able by some
notable attempt to divert the King from the Enterprize of <hi>Rochelle.</hi>
It was therefore necessary for him to strive with all his endeavour
to obstruct his passage, wherein consisted the main concern of
the whole Affair, and accordingly he went about it, though not
without great reluctancy, that he should approach so near to
<hi>Caussade,</hi> and not stay to besiege it: but on the other side he
durst not do it, lest whilst he should be taken up with an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
of so little importance, the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> might take that
opportunity to execute his design. I heard many of his Servants
murmur, that he was not more eager of this Siege, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
knew very well, that the Prince had writ something unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
of him to the Court about it: but he was nothing moved
at all that noise, and having good reason for what he did, nothing
had power to alter his determination.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was thus vigilant about <hi>Montauban</hi> to obstruct the
Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s passage, the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who had made a
very considerable progress in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> by the taking of <hi>Pamieres,
Realmont,</hi> and several other places, resolv'd to pursue his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
into <hi>Guienne.</hi> There was a little corner in the lower <hi>Roüergue,</hi>
and bordering upon the <hi>Sevennes,</hi> that had never yet felt the power
of the Royal Arms; it was therefore agreed upon betwixt the Prince
and the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> that the Army should advance that
way, their design herein being, either to disunite this little Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
from the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Interests, or at least by this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
to divert him from the design he had of moving towards
<hi>Rochelle;</hi> it being very unlikely he should think of that, whilst
the Cities of his party should be so dangerously engag'd in the
most advantageous Post he had upon any occasion to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> who was very punctual in all his designs,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> lays Siege to <hi>St. Afrique.</hi>
                     </note>

himself in sight of <hi>Vâbres,</hi> an Episcopal Sea, and almost
the only Catholick City of all that Countrey; to whom the Duke
also the next day joyn'd himself with his Forces. Their design
was suddenly to clap down before <hi>Saint Afrique,</hi> a Town very
considerable in those parts, and exceedingly well fortified: but
the success of this Enterprize did by no means answer their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:63412:241"/>
they being after a very brisk assault, vigorously sustain'd
by those within, constrain'd to raise the Siege; after which the
Prince's Forces being very much decreas'd in the preceding Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,<note place="margin">With ill success.</note>
and infinitely dejected with this repulse, as the Duke's also
were, it was necessary to dispose them into several Garrisons to
refresh them.</p>
                  <p>It seem'd as if this baffle at <hi>Saint Afrique</hi> had hapned for no
other end, but to justifie the Duke about the business of <hi>Caussade,</hi>
wherein the miscarriage of the one caus'd his wisdom to be highly
magnified for not having attempted the other; whereas before
both the Court, and the whole Kingdom talk'd a little odly of
his proceeding; so ready is ill natur'd mankind to censure the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
Spirits upon the least shadow of occasion, though after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
perform'd in the sight of all the world innumerable actions
that ought the least of them to defend the Author's name from
Calumny, upon any accident of Fortune. The King lay at this
time before <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and <hi>le Plessis,</hi> who had serv'd in the Isle of
<hi>Ré</hi> at the defeat of the <hi>English</hi> with marvellous reputation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to serve with his Regiment at this Siege; where being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the great Scene of Affairs, and hearing what was said of the
Duke his Master, he fail'd not to let him know what censure the
world pass'd upon him concerning the business of <hi>Caussade,</hi> and
how he had been represented to the King: insomuch that the
Duke finding it necessary to give his Majesty an accompt of what
had pass'd upon this occasion, he dispatch'd away <hi>Monsieur Fabert,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke sent <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Fabert</hi> to Court.</note>
who was then in his entertainment, to Court, to that effect. This
<hi>Monsieur Fabert</hi> was a Gentleman of whose education the Duke
had had so particular a care, that he had ever been either under his
own eye, or with the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son; and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in him, in a very green youth, great courage, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and an extraordinary assiduity, and application to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of his profession; and thence conceiving the hopes of those
rare fruits we now see, had ever honour'd him (which was not
ordinary with him to young people) with great demonstrations
of particular favour and esteem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fabert</hi> being arriv'd at Court, presently acquainted the King
with the occasion of his coming, presenting with all his Letters
of Credence to the Cardinal, wherein he acquitted himself so
well, that his Majesty remain'd highly satisfied with the Duke's
Conduct; and as touching the Cardinal, <hi>le Plessis,</hi> who had an
old establish'd familiarity with him, writ to the Duke in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<pb n="456" facs="tcp:63412:242"/>
discourses of your proceeding at <hi>Caussade;</hi> wherein, though
some were prompted by their malice, yet even the most mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and who spoke neither out of Envy, nor Disaffection, could
not absolutely acquit your Reputation: but since his coming,
all men unanimously applaud your Wisdom; insomuch that
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> himself, who before in obscure language
would sometimes give me private touches of reproach (to
which I could return no other answer, than to entreat he would
suspend his Judgment, till you writ to Court) has confess'd to
me since, that had you engag'd in that Siege, <hi>Monsieur de Rohan</hi> had
doubtless pass'd by, as he had promis'd the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> and that
you had been so long in possession of well doing, that it was
henceforward impossible for you to do amiss.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the raising of the Siege of <hi>Saint Afrique,</hi> they were now
to think of a second devastation of <hi>Montauban,</hi> and to make the
innocent Countrey suffer for the Crimes of that rebellious City:
to effect which, the Duke had only two Regiments remaining of
three that he had rais'd; the third which was that of <hi>Saint Croix
d' Ornano,</hi> having by the Prince been taken into the Body of his
own Army: yet did he not for all this refuse to undertake this
difficult Enterprize, which nevertheless I do verily believe he
could never have been able to execute, without the assistance of
a great number of gallant Gentlemen Volunteers, to whose Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
(as has been already said) he stood oblig'd for most of the
Services he perform'd for the King in that Province.</p>
                  <p>The business was therefore perform'd with very good success,
not that the Enemy did not make a stout Opposition, and did not
daily engage the Duke's small Forces: but it was ever to their
own loss. Whilst matters went thus prosperously on, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
toil wherewith the Duke had been exercis'd during this
whole Campagne, had so overcome his spirits, that the fell dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
sick at <hi>Castelsarrazin;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> falls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Physician was with him to retire from the ill air of that Countrey,
corrupted no doubt by the excessive heats, and the length of the
War, which had there continued for almost five years together
without intermission, he was notwithstanding obstinate to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in his Camp, and would by no perswasions be drawn to
forsake his Army. Neither, though his indisposition confin'd him
to his bed, could it hinder his indefatigable mind from still work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon his business: he would have his people to bring him an
hourly accompt of all that pass'd, and his Genius inspiring his
followers with the same good Fortune had ever attended him in
all his designs, he (even in the most violent height of his distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:63412:242"/>
gave himself Orders, the execution whereof made him ever
victorious. But after having long strugled with his Disease, he
must at last give way to its violence; and his strength by the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his mind visibly impairing, made his Physician begin to
apprehend a more dangerous issue of his distemper, than was at
first suspected. They were therefore constrain'd whether he would
or no to force him from his Camp, and to carry him aboard a
Boat, in which he was convey'd upon the River <hi>Garonne,</hi> and
the next day brought to his own House <hi>Cadillac;</hi> where he was
scarcely arriv'd,<note place="margin">The Duke recovers.</note> but that the change of air produc'd a manifest
alteration in his health, which in a few days was succeeded by a
perfect recovery.</p>
                  <p>The waste having been made about <hi>Montauban,</hi> it was still ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to leave some Forces thereabouts, to hinder the excursions
of those of the City; which Forces, though very few, were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
so conveniently dispos'd, that the Enemy could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make any advantage of their own numbers. The Marquis
<hi>de Monferrant</hi> (who together with the Lieutenancy of the Duke's
<hi>Gens d'-Armes,</hi> had at his recommendation moreover obtain'd the
Office of <hi>Mareschal de Camp</hi>) was left to command them; an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
wherein he so well discharg'd himself, as besides the
honour he deserv'd for having with so few men bridled the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of so populous a City, he further acquir'd that of having
kept those men in so admirable a Discipline, that there was never
the least complaint made of any disorder, or the least insolence
committed by any of his party.</p>
                  <p>Whilst in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Guienne</hi> the King's Forces were taken
up with these petty Enterprizes, his Majesty in his own person
continued to streighten <hi>Rochelle</hi> both by Sea and Land; carrying
on the Siege with so much vigour, and conduct, that after having
made the besieg'd suffer extremities, far beyond what we read of
with horror in the most sensless obstinacies of other desperate Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
he at last reduc'd them to a necessity of submitting to his
Royal Mercy. In which Surrender,<note place="margin">Rochelle sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to the King.</note> though the wilful blindness
wherewith the <hi>Rochellers</hi> had been so long possess'd, had kept
them from looking into their own miserable condition, till they
had consum'd not only all provisions fit for the use of man; but
also all that the extremest hunger could compel the uncleanest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to convert to food: they yet found they had not exhausted
the King's Royal goodness, who had enough left to pardon the
miserable remains of those wretched people, the length, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of the Siege had yet left alive, preserving so those that had
try'd, and had not been able to effect their own destruction, and
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:63412:243"/>
exercising his Clemency, upon such as had no compassion of
themselves. To conclude he made himself Master of <hi>Rochelle,</hi>
that is to say, absolute King of <hi>France,</hi> which, till this City was
reduc'd, he could not properly have been said to be.</p>
                  <p>This glorious year was concluded by this happy Victory,<note place="margin">Anno 1629.</note> a
success by which all the occasions of those civil discords, which
the difference of Religions had hitherto almost continually fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
were so totally rooted up, as gave us for the future leisure to
prosecute our Forein designs; wherein we have since been so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
as by the success of our Arms to be secur'd of a firm, and
last repose for the time to come, if we can continue this good
union, and intelligence amongst our selves; the breach whereof
can alone encourage our Neighbours to attempt upon our
Peace.</p>
                  <p>The King being yet before <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and the Town upon the
point of Surrender, his resolution was absolutely bent upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the remaining Cities of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party to the same obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
in order whereunto his Majesty sent a Letter to the Duke
of <hi>Espernon,</hi> to acquaint him with so much of his design as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
the Province where he had the honour to Command; a
Dispatch that was sent away by <hi>Servient,</hi> who was to be both the
Bearer of this Missive, and the Interpreter of his Majesties fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Intentions. The Employment this Gentleman had been upon
into that Countrey the preceding year, about the business of the
Carrick, and the dexterity, and prudence he had discover'd in the
management of that Affair, had made him by the King thought
worthy of, and sufficient for the Office of <hi>Intendant de la Iustice,
&amp; Police</hi> in <hi>Guienne,</hi> with which he was at this time invested: but
that being such a Commission as is hardly to be executed in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
that have Parliaments of their own, without intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon, or at least, giving offense unto their Authority, soon
begot a feud betwixt the Parliament of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> and him; which
grew at last to such a height, that <hi>Servient</hi> was fain to prefer a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to the Council of some affronts he had receiv'd from that
Assembly; whereupon he had granted him a Sentence of Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
together with a Citation of personal appearance against the
first President <hi>de Gourgues,</hi> and some other Members of that
Court. They must therefore of necessity appear, and accordingly
the first President came in at the appointed time; where presenting
himself before the King, to justifie the proceeding that had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
this Citation, his reception was a little severe. The King,
dissatisfied with him, as was said, upon other accompts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to speak kneeling; which the President making
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:63412:243"/>
some difficulty to do, as an unusual form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King, rising from
his seat, pull'd him by the Robe to compel him to it. 'Tis said,
that even in this very act, and the confusion the face of an incens'd
Prince might reasonably have put any man into, the President
immediately recollecting himself, spoke of the violence was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to him, with an Efficacy, and Eloquence that astonish'd all
that heard him, and that was so powerful, as to extract some
gentle and satisfactory expressions even from the King himself:
but this was also the last lightning of his Wit, and he seem'd to
have mustred all his Forces for this one piece of Service, ending
his Life almost as soon as his Oration; who though of a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
stature, and an infirm constitution, but of a strange vivacity,
and courage, was so wounded with the sense of the King's severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that he was never after to be comforted; but retiring, already

                     </note> out of his Majesties presence, dyed a very few days after. He
had this obligation to the Duke of <hi>Espernons</hi> unkindness, that it
discover'd in him a great many excellent qualities, that would
otherwise have been buried in his Ashes; for had he in truth had
nothing more to do, than meerly to have exercis'd the ordinary
functions of his place, he would even in that capacity have met
with concurrences enough to have disputed that honour with
him: but having had opportunity to manifest his courage in so
mighty, and dangerous a dispute, his Eloquence in so many Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Assemblies, and his Zeal for the dignity, and honour
of his Fraternity, in so many notable, and important occasions,
has left behind him so fair a memory, that he does at this day
pass, in the opinions of all that knew him, for one of the greatest
men that ever presided in that Court.</p>
                  <p>If the King's success in the reducing of <hi>Rochelle</hi> gave a high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to the Royal Arms, the quick dispatch of that Siege was
of no less utility to his other Affairs; for every one imagining
this Victory would have cost as many years, as he was months
about it, that opinion was so generally receiv'd, and concluded
for so infallible a truth by all the neighbouring Princes, that there
was hardly one, who had not propos'd to himself some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
or other from this long diversion; either to the prejudice
of his Majesties Reputation, or to that of his Affairs. The King
of <hi>Spain</hi> therefore, the King of <hi>England,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
and <hi>Lorain,</hi> entred into a powerful League, that every one might
make his benefit of this Civil War: Wherein <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi>
doubted not, without any resistance, to possess themselves of the
Territories of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> an Ally, and a Vassal to
this Crown: The design of the <hi>English</hi> was not only to relieve
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:63412:244"/>
and reestablish the remains of the Reform'd Religion in <hi>France;</hi>
but also to revenge themselves for the losses they had sustain'd in
the business of the Isle of <hi>Ré,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> (an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and offended Prince) propos'd to himself, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much difficulty, the usurpation of the three Bishopricks of
<hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> which, as they were naturally members
of it, would bring an equal addition of benefit, and honour to
his own Dukedom.</p>
                  <p>The last of the foremention'd Princes not daring to begin the
quarrel, staid expecting when the other Confederates should
break the Ice, in the mean time concealing his designs under a
dissembled shew of Friendship; and the King of <hi>England,</hi> not
well recover'd of the late Blow, had no mind to declare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the concurrence of the Duke of <hi>Lorain:</hi> so that whilst these
two Princes sate still in mutual expectation, which should lead
the Field, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> falling
smartly to work,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua.</hi>
                     </note> had by Arms so far advanc'd their designs, that
they had already possess'd themselves of most of the Duke of
<hi>Mantua</hi>'s Cities, and excepting <hi>Casal,</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> it self, were
masters of the whole Dutchy.</p>
                  <p>The King, justly incens'd at so great an injury offer'd to him in
the person of his Ally, might reasonably enough have reveng'd
himself by the same way, by which he had been offended; but
retaining, it should seem, a greater respect for the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
than he had done for him, he dispatch'd an Ambassadour to him
to complain That without denouncing of War, and to the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their former Treaties, he had taken Arms against a Prince,
whom as an Ally he was oblig'd in honour to protect; advising
him in the conclusion, either to restore things to the condition
wherein he had found them, or to prepare himself to withstand
the utmost power of his Arms, which he was resolv'd to employ
for the vindication of his own Honour, and the protection of
his Friends, and Allies.</p>
                  <p>If the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> (a Prince truly great in all things) had
not yet been more ambitious, than he was great, it had been no
hard matter for him to have found out such a remedy, as might
easily have prevented the ensuing War; but being big with the
hope of taking <hi>Monferrat,</hi> he was not to be perswaded to give over
an Enterprize, which he thought as good as certain to him. He
could not imagine that the King's Army tir'd out, as it was, with
the incommodities of a tedious Siege, could be in any condition
of coming to trouble his designs; neither did he believe that the
King himself, who had been expos'd to the same inconveniences
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:63412:244"/>
his Army had suffer'd, could be so soon able in his own person
to undertake so troublesome a Journey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being presuppos'd,
nothing could have power to hinder his Affairs; so that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to hold his Majesty in hand, without giving his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
any positive answer, or absolutely engaging his word, he
still continued his Usurpation.</p>
                  <p>The King impatient of this injury to his own person, and more
of the injustice done to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> with a Resolution as
generous in it self, as the execution prov'd glorious to his Name,
concluded the following <hi>February,</hi> to cross the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and through
all the difficulties of Snow, and Ice, to force his way to the defense
of his Honour,<note place="margin">The King goes into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </note> which in <hi>Italy</hi> was so highly engag'd. An Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> finding he could not with all his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
prevent, he resolv'd by Arms to guard the Entry into his
own Dukedom: and to that end he caus'd the passage of <hi>Suze</hi> (a
pass nature her self had made inaccessible (if any thing could be so
to Valour) to be strangely fortified:<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> forces <hi>le pas de Suze.</hi>
                     </note> but this strong Post the
King made no difficulty to assault, in which Service the Duke <hi>de la
Valette</hi> Colonel of the Foot, putting himself in the head of the
Forlorn Hope, drawn out of the Regiment of Guards, first moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Enemies Works, and shewing himself as much Superiour
to his Followers in bravery, as he was in Command, in a few
hours overcame all difficulties, both of Mountains, and men that
oppos'd his way.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> after this defeat, not knowing what to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
against the King's victorious Arms, since his best Forces,
when fortified in a Post of so great advantage, had not been able
to withstand them, began to see his danger, and to perceive he had
no way left but by an Accommodation to defend himself from
manifest and apparent ruine; which made him sue to the King for
Peace, and obtain'd it upon condition, the Duke should favour
the passage of his Army to the relief of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> so
unjustly invaded: An Accommodation with <hi>Savoy</hi> being thus
concluded, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who despair'd of being able to make good
his ground in the open Field, against an Army that had with so
great facility forc'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s people in their own Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
thought fit to accept of the same conditions; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
not only rose from before <hi>Casal,</hi> but moreover restor'd all
the places they had already taken in the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
wisely choosing rather to give way to the King's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
than to run the hazard of a Battel, the event whereof they
fear'd would be fatal to them: though this discretion only serv'd
to defer for a time the Victories heaven had destin'd for us over that
insolent, and implacable Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="462" facs="tcp:63412:245"/>
Doubtless had the King pleas'd to have made use of this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the power he had to effect any design he would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
he might at this time with great facility have given the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Forces such a blow, that they would not of many years
after have been in any condition to have brav'd him again in <hi>Italy:</hi>
but his Majesty, contenting himself with having rescu'd his Ally
from the oppression of those two mighty Enemies, would not
in his own person seem to violate that Equity and Justice he had
travell'd so far to defend.</p>
                  <p>If the Forein Princes had taken a wrong measure in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
they had entertain'd of the length of the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was no less mistaken in the Expedition of <hi>Italy;</hi>
wherein he doubted not his Majesty would meet with so many
great, and tedious difficulties, that he hop'd himself (who was the
soul of his whole Party) might in the mean time, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
of the King's absence, infuse so much vigour into his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
cause, as that they would be in a condition for some time
at least, to defend themselves.</p>
                  <p>He had therefore taken Arms in the <hi>Sevennes,</hi>

secretly with <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence he had also obtain'd a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of some supply of money: but the King, who had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

into <hi>France,</hi> in the most violent heats of Summer, with which

in <hi>Iune,</hi> which also at his first coming he carried by assault:
after which <hi>Aletz,</hi> another of the same principles, surrendred
without any resistance. The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> observing what a

and <hi>England</hi> was already concluded, began to apprehend at last
he should be totally deserted by all his Confederates, and Friends,
and left alone to bear the shock of his Majesties victorious Arms;
which made him in time seriously to apply himself to his mercy,
to avoid the severe effects of his Justice.</p>
                  <p>One of the most powerful motives that induc'd him to sue for
this Peace, was doubtless the blocking up of <hi>Monta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="463" facs="tcp:63412:245"/>
waste that, now the third time by express order from the King, was
made round about that City. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had plac'd his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
refuge in the strength of this place, and had ever hop'd, whilst it
could maintain it self in a condition to sustain a tedious Siege,
that resistance would infallibly put him into a capacity of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very good Conditions: but the King, who had foreseen this
design, writ to the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> to joyn himself with the Duke
of <hi>Espernon</hi> (to whom he also writ at the same time to the same
effect) to deprive <hi>Montauban,</hi> by destroying their Fruits, of all
possibility of subsistance, and therein the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> of the
assistance he promis'd to himself from thence in the last extremity
of his declining Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The Prince would himself be the bearer of this Dispatch, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>Suze</hi> the 27<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and accordingly arriv'd at <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
in the latter end of <hi>May;</hi> where betwixt him, and the Duke,
all things were soon concluded on for the execution of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Commands: an Enterprize, that although the Duke had
neither competent Forces, nor other means wherewithal to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it, that no order had been sent either for money to raise men,
to furnish ammunitions of War, or to buy provisions for the
support of the Army; his affection to the Service notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
supplying all other defects, he soon put himself into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to second the Princes desires; wherein he was indeed neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
almost alone to undertake the business, how difficult so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he knew it to be: For the Prince being oblig'd by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to have an especial eye to the higher <hi>Languedoc,</hi> his presence
was there very requisite, and almost continually requir'd: but
the Duke fail'd not, for any other consideration, according to his
custom, to acquit himself very exactly of his share of the work.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke was in the heat of this execution, the Peace
was concluded with the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in <hi>Iuly,</hi> which all the

which for some days stood out; not that they did not desire
it equally with the rest, they had suffer'd too much, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to too necessitous a condition to oppose their own quiet:
but the Duke (whatsoever those of <hi>Montauban</hi> could pretend) to
wit, <hi>That having suffer'd so much by his Arms they could not consent to
allow him the honour of having subdu'd them</hi>) very well understood
that all those excuses were suggested to them by the Cardinal, who
ambitious to have the honour of totally suppressing that party at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to himself, did especially desire, that this City (which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the surrender of <hi>Rochelle</hi> was become the Metropolis of the
Faction) should be deliver'd up into his hands. He had therefore
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:63412:246"/>
acquainted the principal of the Inhabitants, that it was from him
alone they were to expect whatever advantages they could propose
to themselves from this Accommodation, and that it would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
concern them to reserve themselves entirely for him, to be
the more worthy of his protection, from whence they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
a greater support, than from all other powers upon earth.</p>
                  <p>The Duke nettled at this usage, and unable in the interests of

would so much illustrate his Triumph, as to receive a Visit
from the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> in one of the principal Cities of his
own Government, and conceiving such a Complement would
pass in the opinion of all the world for an absolute testimony of an
entire submission, he was infinitely desirous to have him won to
that complacency; which being he could not handsomely try to
do directly from himself, he caus'd him to be very highly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
to that purpose, by some of the Duke's own peculiar friends,
who were at that time about his person. These Gentlemen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and amongst others particularly <hi>Mareschal Bassompierre</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to the Duke, that all this time an enterview betwixt
the Cardinal and him was highly necessary to the good of his
own Affairs, without which he could not possibly avoid giving
a mortal Affront to a man become absolute at Court by the ruine
of a Faction, which alone had hitherto serv'd for an allay to the
excess of his power. An advice that was so well seconded by
<hi>le Plessis,</hi> who of all others had the greatest sway with the Duke,
and fortified with so many powerful Arguments, that at last he
resolv'd upon this Visit. Yet do I very well remember with how
great reluctancy it was, and with how strange a violence upon
his own humour, and haughty spirit, that he suffer'd himself to

an excess of freedom, and civility, gave manifest testimonies, that
he retain'd no memory of any former unkindness: but on the
contrary protested, that he would value the Duke's friendship
preferrably to any other persons in the Kingdom, which was his
own expression; and upon an intimation the Duke gave him, that
he had occasion to make a Journey to Court, promis'd him, that
soo soon as he should see the King, he would procure him leave
so to do; a thing, which with all the importunities he could
make, the Duke had before not been able to obtain: Neither did
the Cardinal limit his offers here, he assuring him moreover, that
he would serve him in all things, and if he would give him leave,
supply the place of a fourth Son to him, wherein he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with the other three, which should pay him the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which were the express terms of his Complement.</p>
                  <p>The next day after his arrival, the Cardinal treated him in his
own Lodgings, where he gave him the chief place of honour at
the Table, notwithstanding the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> was there
present, omitting no civility that might beget a strict League of
Friendship betwixt them: so that it is most certain, could the
Duke have bow'd a little, and discretly have husbanded these
good dispositions, he might have improv'd them infinitely much
to his own advantage: but according to his custom, either as if
he hd repented the having done too much; or as if he had a
mind to blot out what any one could lay to his charge for having
condescended too low in this visit, by retaining a kind of a grum
reservednes in the rest of his Actions, he overthrew in a moment
all the good his friends expected he should reap from this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency:
insomuch that I have often heard <hi>le Plessis</hi> wish he had
never advis'd him to it.</p>
                  <p>After they were risen from the Table, the Duke being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn

the Duke of <hi>Montpensier</hi> in private; the Cardinal, who
had the Archbishop of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> in very high consideration, came
to present him to the Duke to reconcile him to him. This Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had apply'd himself particularly to the Cardinal's Service, and by
a great complacency in all things, having adapted himself to his
humour, and by that means got into a high degree of favour with
him, had entreated the Cardinal by his Interest to put him upon
good terms with the Duke; there having since the Archbishop's
advancement to that Dignity (which fell to him by the death of
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:63412:247"/>
the Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis</hi> his Brother) some differences hapned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Duke, and him, that had begot a little distance betwixt
them. I was present at this Dinner (led thither by my curiosity as
some others were) and (if it may be call'd one) consequently at
this Reconciliation: When the Cardinal, who had already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
the Duke for the busienss, and thought he had conquer'd
his animosity, coming to him to the Window, where he stood,
said to him these words,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> gives Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> new cause of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense.</note>

                     </q> After which, and a salute
as cold as his complement, he turn'd again without more Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had no friend, nor Servant there,

a more obliging fashion: but that was all could be got from him.

an Empire over the Duke's haughty spirit, as by his great civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he hop'd he had gain'd upon him: he nevertheless retir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Chamber without taking any more notice at all, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
his own passion, chose rather to attribute that odd carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to the Duke's imperious humour (which he had practis'd so
long, as to be well enough acquainted with it) than to lose the
earnest he had already given towards the purchase of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
He continued therefore to use him with the same respect he
had hitherto done, and was yet so highly civil to him, that
the next day when he departed from <hi>Montauban</hi> to go towards
the Court, accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Montpensier, Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Bassompierre,</hi> and several other persons fo very great quality,
that follow'd his Litter on Horseback; he was so highly respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the Duke, that he would not offer to go into it, so long
as the Duke staid with him, which was nevertheless half a League
at least from the City, but entertain'd him all the way on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
though so soon as he took his leave he went into his Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
without retaining the same respect to any of the rest.</p>
                  <p>I cannot, before I proced any further, omit an observation I
made at the Entertainment, of which we are now speaking, and
of which the several misfortunes of the most eminent persons
there have often put me in mind. There was scarce any body at
the Cardinal's Table, excepting the Dukes of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and
<hi>Espernon,</hi> the <hi>Mareschal Bassompierre,</hi> and <hi>Marillac;</hi> three of which
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:63412:247"/>
were the Cardinal's most intimate friends, and he would needs
ranck the fourth in that degree: from whence, if we consider
what advantage, he amongst them all, that was the best us'd in
succession of time, reap'd from his friendship; we shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
upon how tickle, and dangerous a point, all Court-favour
depends.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was no sooner resolv'd upon a Journey
to Court.<note place="margin">The Duke acquaints the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of going to Court.</note> but that he would in the first place acquaint the Prince
of <hi>Condé</hi> with his purpose, and therein consult his advice; the
respect he bore to this Prince, and the confidence he repos'd in
his Friendship being such, as would not permit him to settle the
least resolution, without making him privy to his design: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there was nothing of dissimulation, for he was effectually the
Princes Servant, and to such a degree, that it must have been a
service of a very foul nature, he would not chearfully have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
for him. He therefore dispatch'd away his Secretary to him,
to acquaint him with his determination, and thereupon to beg
his advice. The Prince was at this time at <hi>Rabastens</hi> in<note n="*" place="margin">A Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where after the Secretary had deliver'd what was given him in
charge from the Duke his Master, the Prince with great civility
return'd this answer: <q>That he concern'd himself very much in
all the Duke's interests: That in another time, and during the
favour of the <hi>Luines,</hi> he might have been capable of giving
him such advice, as he durst have answer'd would have been
serviceable to him, they having been men of so candid disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as that their intentions might have been perfectly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd;
but that at present he was so totally in the dark, as to
any understanding in the designs of those who were now at
the Helm: That he durst not adventure to give the Duke any
counsel, lest something might happen as prejudicial to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
as contrary to his desire; only he had very good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that the <hi>Garde des Sceaux</hi> had been very busie, and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
in making a collection of what Warrant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Duke had is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
out, for the subsistence of such Forces as had serv'd in his
Government: That indeed he could not tell to what end he
had done it; but he could not imagine it would be to any good
intent, and that therefore the Duke might, if he pleas'd, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it.</q> With which uncertain answer the Secretary was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd.
The Duke, who was very secure of his own innocency
(and it is to be wish'd he had been as cautious, and moderate to
his own good, as he was perfectly honest to the King) did not,
for all this caution, desist from still earnestly soliciting his leave,
which in the end, after the Cardinal's arrival at Court, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:63412:248"/>
by a very favourable dispatch from the King himself to
that effect.</p>
                  <p>The Duke no sooner receiv'd this permission, but that he made
all the haste he could to Court,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> arrives at Court, and is very well receiv'd.</note> to avoid the inconvenience of a
Winter Journey; which he did by coming to <hi>Paris</hi> before <hi>All-Saints.</hi>
At his arrival (as at other times) he was welcom'd with a
great number of persons of Quality, who came out to meet
him, and to attend him to the <hi>Louvre;</hi> where he first alighted, and
where he was by his Majesty much better receiv'd, than he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
by reason of several ill offices he knew had been done him
to the King. It was indeed chiefly to justifie himself from those
aspersions, that he had been so passionately importunate for leave
to come to Court; and he had express'd so much in his Letters,
which was perhaps the thing that made his permission so hard to
obtain; Princes being commonly no better dispos'd to admit of
excuses, than they are to make them. From the <hi>Louvre</hi> he went
to wait upon the Cardinal, to whom he stood oblig'd, not only
for his leave to come, but also for his Majesties gracious recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
now he was come, and was by him also receiv'd after a most
infinitely obliging manner, the Cardinal still improving his civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and again making him a new tender of his service upon all
occasions, as indeed from that time forward he began to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
him by his respect, from all other great persons of the
Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Already either the multiplicity of business with which the
Cardinal was continually taken up,<note place="margin">Anno 1630.</note> or the design he had to render
his person more venerable, and more authoritative, by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
it to few, had put him upon that stately way of living,
that he was very rarely to be seen: insomuch that the Dukes, and
Peers of <hi>France,</hi> the Officers of the Crown, the blue Garters,
and whoever of the highest quality of the Kingdom, made no
difficulty to wait below in the Hall, amongst a promiscuous
crowd of Clients, and Suitors, the hours of his leisure, whether
they came only to visit, or to speak with him about their Affairs:
nay and were glad to go sometimes twice, sometimes more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could get access to his person:<note place="margin">Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Cardinal to the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> But the Cardinal, who
was well enough acquainted with the Duke's temper to know,
that such a repulse would not need to fright him for ever coming
again to see him, entreated him beforehand, never to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the trouble of coming to see him, without first giving him
notice, that he might always be at liberty to receive him: a rule
the Duke on his part so well observ'd, that he never came, but all
the Gates were open'd to him; his Coach admitted into the
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:63412:248"/>
Court, and himself to all the freedom he could desire; when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
persons of very great condition could hardly be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the Wicket.</p>
                  <p>It has however been believ'd that all these extraordinary civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
began at <hi>Montauban,</hi> and continued to this time, were not
altogether without design. Some have thought that the Cardinal,
who evidently perceiv'd that the Queen Mother (who had suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her self to be wrought upon by some ill offices had been done
him in his absence) to be grown cold in her affection to him,
would have been glad to have made the Duke his friend. He was
powerful in himself, and much more in his Sons; so that being
secur'd of their friendship (which the whole Court knew to be
faithful and inviolate where they once took) he thought he could
receive no so violent an assault of Fortune, he should not be able,
whilst back'd with so powerful a Family to withstand. There
was great probability in this conjecture, and the Duke himself
(as clear-sighted as any) was perhaps of the same opinion; but
if on the one side the Cardinal courted the Duke's friendship for
this reason, the Duke on the other side would by no means go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
opposite to the Queen Mothers inclinations. He had ever
honour'd her, though he had not always been well us'd by her;
and, having ever imputed to the Cardinal himself the greatest
part of those unkindnesses he had receiv'd from this Princess, was
more dissatisfied with him, than the Queen Mother for the ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of his Service. But another reason which made him so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in the acceptation of this precipitous friendship, was the
imperious superiority the Cardinal pretended to over all the other
great men of the Kingdom; which the Duke could never allow
him over himself to the degree that he desir'd, as still retaining a
memory how much he had known him inferious to him. All
these considerations together rendred him less complacent, than
could have been wish'd for the prosperity of his own Affairs: I
shall not nevertheless herein take upon me to censure the Duke's
conduct, nor attempt to pass so liberal a judgment upon a person
I am, for so many respects, oblig'd to honour; though the event
made it plain, that had he carried things otherwise, he had done
better. In short the Duke was so much the more reserv'd to the
Cardinal, than he expected he should be, that the ardour of his
sudden affection cooling by degrees every day more and more, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
at last into a perfect hatred, and from thence to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
as we shall hereafter, in due order of time, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
of Affairs, make more evidently to appear.</p>
                  <p>All things that had hitherto pass'd betwixt the Duke, and the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:63412:249"/>
Cardinal were well enough understood; and this good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
continued till the Cardinals departure for <hi>Italy,</hi> the Duke
being (as has been said) ever treated by him with extraordinary
kindness, and respect far different from what he shew'd to all
other persons of the same condition; yet could not the Duke
(whose humour was impatient of any thing that touch'd him)
sometimes forbear lashing out into very free expressions (giving
the Cardinal thereby very often to understand, that he was not to
expect any mean, or submiss toleration from him) of which I
shall here present you one example. The Cardinal either presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
upon the authority of his favour with the King, or the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
he pretended to have for the Duke, took one day the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betry
to give him some advice concerning his deportment;
whereupon falling into discourse of his severe humour, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him counsel to correct it, he did it merrily in the Duke's own
broad <hi>Gascon</hi> accent (from which, how long a habitude soever he
had had at Court, he could never totally wean himself) which
interweaving with some very civil expressions, he seriously desir'd
him in the end not to take it ill, if he had made a little bold with
him in imitating his own way of speaking: to which this untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
spirit (highly offended at a raillery something too familiar
for his humour) briskly reply'd:<note place="margin">A smart r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Marais</hi> was one of the Grooms of the Chamber to
the King, a pleasant fellow, and a Buffoon, that had a marvellous
faculty of imitation, who by his faces, and tricks would make
folks laugh; and when acting before the King, and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
would make a bold with the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> as other
people. It cannot be imagin'd, but that without all doubt this
comparison must needs displease the Cardinal; neither were the
Duke's Servants, and Friends, to whom he related this passage at
his coming home, much better satisfied with it: but the words
were already out of his mouth, and were no more to be recall'd.
Every one apprehended this liberty would draw upon him the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of him that was all powerful at Court; yet did nothing at

                     </note> than to
stand upon a particular Quarrel with the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> so
many other Affairs of very high concern falling upon him at once,
and at the same instant, that perhaps in his life he never had so hard
a Game to play. The Queen Mother had long been very much
dissatisfied with his proceeding; and her ill will, grown now to a
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:63412:249"/>
greater degree than ever, she could no longer forbear to profess an
open, and implacable hatred against him. She could not endure
that a man who was her Creature, and rais'd by her bounty, should
get the start of her in the confidence of the King her Son, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by all the reasons in the world she ought to be preferr'd,<note place="margin">The Queen Mother professes an open hatred to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal.</note> and
that made her directly oppose all his Counsels, which how well
soever they succeeded, she still found matter enough to render
them suspected to the King, and to discredit them by sinister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations.
So great a power as this hitherto entire, and fortified
by all the considerations of duty, and nature, was not easily to be
baffled by a Servant, and who had no other support, than the
affection of his Master, of it self mutable and uncertain; so that
the Cardinal seeing himself assaulted by so passionate, and so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
an Enemy, might reasonably enough apprehend being
crush'd to nothing under the weight of her Authority, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
but as mischiefs seldom come alone, several Forein troubles
also concurr'd with this disorder at home: The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
was grown by this time sensible of the dishonourable peace he
had concluded at <hi>Suze:</hi> to which the loss of <hi>Montferrat</hi> stuck
mainly in his stomack:<note place="margin">The War with <hi>Sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> He had reckon'd himself sure of the
conquest of this place, and indeed had not the King interpos'd,
that Countrey had by this time been wholly in his possession: He
had therefore more firmly than ever confederated himself with the
House of <hi>Austria,</hi> to the end they might joyntly invade the
Duke of <hi>Mantua;</hi> the rumour of which preparation was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
spread abroad, and they were already in Arms;
in which condition this desolate Prince had no body to fly to for
protection, save only the King of <hi>France.</hi> His interests, that could
not without infamy be abandoned, put the Cardinals Affairs into
very great danger; who, as on the one side he very well knew
that Court divisions, which are the issue of ease, and rest, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
smother'd in employment, and of all other in that of
War: So he also saw that this War being to be undertaken by his
Counsels, to which the Queen Mother was directly opposite, he
should become responsible for the event, and that the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
that should happen would infallibly be laid at his door. Yet,
as if all these difficulties had been too few to perplex him, another
of no less importance fell out at the same time, which was the
discontent of the <hi>Monsieur,</hi>

he could work nothing upon the implacable spirit of the Queen
Mother, he found means nevertheless to appease the <hi>Monsieur,</hi>
and to bring him back to Court, by obtaining for him from
the King, whatever he could either for himself, or in the behalf
of his friends, demand or desire. He sent moreover into <hi>Lorain</hi> to
sound the Duke's intentions, who for this time dissembling his
designs, protested he had taken Arms for no other end, than to
serve the King, by opposing the Emperours designs; who, he said,
could attempt nothing upon his Countrey, that must not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
redound to the prejudice of <hi>France.</hi> So that by this means
the Cardinal having either compos'd, diverted, or at least deferr'd
part of those mischiefs that most immediately press'd upon him,
he would himself undertake the expedition of <hi>Italy;</hi> whilst the
King should totally reclaim the <hi>Monsieur</hi> his Brother, and satisfie
all his discontents, by the performance of those things that had
been promis'd to him.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal was no sooner arriv'd in <hi>Savoy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </note> but that he sent
to feel the pulse of that Duke, whom finding still constant to his
old State Maxims (which was by fair words, and large promises
to amuse such, as were likely to hinder his designs, whilst he in
the mean time was still intent upon his business) he fell so briskly
to work, that having taken from him <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and some other
strong places, the <hi>Savoyard</hi> was at last constrain'd to return again
to his first Treaty.</p>
                  <p>The King awak'd by this good success of his Arms, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
the glory they seem'd to assure should derive to a Servant,
resolv'd upon a Journey into <hi>Italy</hi> to command his Army in his
own person; neither though the Cardinal was ambitious to the
height, was he at this time sorry, he should come to eclipse his
honour, since he must leave <hi>Paris</hi> to do it, where he knew all ill
offices were perpetually done him. The interest of his conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
therefore prevail'd here with the Cardinal over his insatiate
thirst of Glory: but the Queen Mother stifly oppos'd this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
by representing to the King the interests of his health, and
safety; to which she forgot not to add the Cardinals inordinate
ambition,<note place="margin">The King resolves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </note> who she said car'd not to expose both the one, and the
other for his own particular vanity. But all these remonstrances
prov'd in the end too weak to prevail; so that the appetite of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
prevailing above all other considerations, and his Majesty
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:63412:250"/>
being not to be staid at home: the Queen Mother to give the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
less time to reestablish himself with the King (who had after
much importunityconsented at last to his banishment) was resolv'd
to follow the King her Son to <hi>Lyons,</hi> to try if she could, whilst he
was in this good disposition, obtain the effects of his promise.</p>
                  <p>The King then in <hi>April</hi> set forwards from <hi>Paris</hi> towards <hi>Italy,</hi>
the glorious success of which second Expedition, making up one
of the most illustrious parts of General History, it ought not
to be contracted within the narrow bounds of a particular Life;
wherein the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> having also had no share, I should
not have waded so far as I have done into these secret Affairs of
Court, had they not at last proceeded to involve him further
therein, than he had himself intended to engage.</p>
                  <p>Before the King's departure from <hi>Paris,</hi> the Duke especially so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
of his Service within the Precincts of his own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
intreated his Majesty to appoint him an <hi>Intendant de la Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;</hi>
he having at his coming out of <hi>Guienne</hi> left there neither Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
nor Intendant in his absence to look after his Majesties Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in that Province: a request that the King being very willing
to grant, as it principally concern'd himself, he gave the Duke li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to choose whom he should think fit out of his Council.
The Employment, being one of the greatest honour, was covered
by several persons of very great desert; but the Duke preferring
above all those who made suit for it, one of the Council, that
perhaps least dream'd of any such thing, entreated <hi>Monsieur de
Verthamont</hi> Master of Requests to accept it. This person of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
honesty, and equal capacity, had, in several Employments
of very great importance, given very good proofs both of the one,
and the other: but these qualities how eminent soever, were yet
accompanied with another that serv'd no less to recommend him
to the Duke's Election; and that was the great friendship betwixt
him and <hi>Monsieur d' Autry,</hi> at that time President <hi>Seguier,</hi> and since
<hi>Gard des Sceaux,</hi> and Chancellor of <hi>France;</hi> with whose good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
in the same Commission, the Duke had been so highly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that he desir'd nothing more, than one that would imitate his
Vertue to succeed him: and he hop'd to find in this Gentleman,
what he had already prov'd in his Predecessor; neither was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in his Judgment, he found his expectation answer'd to the
full. And for ten years together that <hi>Verthamont</hi> serv'd the King in
the Duke's Government, he gave the Duke so many testimonies of
his integrity, and vertue, and in return receiv'd from the Duke so
high, and so just applause, that I dare be bold to affirm, there was
never observ'd the least dissent, or contrariety betwixt them.</p>

his Majesties Command, been sent away befoe, upon the first
jealousie the Court had conceiv'd of the Emperours, and the Duke
of <hi>Lorains</hi> designs: but the Duke, prudently considering, that a
Frontier of so great importance could not be too carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, went with some of his friends to put himself into it,
having moreover engag'd several other persons of condition (who
had staid behind at <hi>Paris</hi> after the King's departure) if occasion
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:63412:252"/>
were, to come, and joyn themselves with him, for the defense of
the place: So that had it ever come to a Siege, the respect that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral worthy men bore to the Duke's person would, without all
doubt, have invited a great many persons of great quality, and
approv'd valour, to serve in so honourable an occasion. But
there hapned to be no need of any such thing; and perhaps the
presence of the Duke, and the prudent care he, together with the
Duke his Son, took for the preservation of that City, made the
Emperour alter his design, by putting him out of all hopes to
effect it.</p>

                  <p>The Duke to add effects to this promise, departed from <hi>Metz</hi>
about the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to raise money for
his Leavies, and to provide himself of such men of Command,
as were willing to take employments upon this occasion; but
the threats of the Imperialists by little, and little, vanishing at

<hi>Moyenvic,</hi> which was soon after taken, and demolish'd by the

wholly to discover his evil intention, staid to expect a fitter sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which also was not far off, wherein to do it; as he afterwards
did, but with very ill success, as will in its due place appear.</p>
                  <p>The Duke being thus return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi>

<pb n="478" facs="tcp:63412:253"/>
was increas'd to such a degree, that in the greatest height of
the King's sickness, which at this time was exceeding violent, she
omitted no opportunity of incensing his Majesty against him,<note place="margin">The King falls sick at <hi>Lyons.</hi>
                     </note> as
the sole author of his Disease; wherein her importunities were
so great, as at last to obtain a solemn promise from the King,
that so soon as the War of <hi>Italy</hi> was at an end, he would give her
the satisfaction she desir'd, by removing this great Minister from
the Administration of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>Though the peril the Cardinal was now in, was very great, and
that the Duke had continual intelligence of all that pass'd at
Court, yet did he notwithstanding still continue towards him the
same civility, and respect; he writ to him very often, and in truth
so long as that great cloud of disgrace hung over his head, the
Duke would have been really sorry, that it should have broke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him: though he had by his dexterity no sooner clear'd the
sky of Favour, but that the Duke, who could not brook his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Authority, and Power, converted all his former compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
into testimonies of hatred; that fail'd very little, as we shall
hereafter see, of rebounding back upon himself, to his own ruine.
Which till it shall more plainly appear, I shall only say this by the
way, that the Duke had doubtless a very great esteem for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
never speaking of him, so much as in private, but with a
Character of Honour, and respect; so that, had he not expected
from his friends an over servile, and submiss regard, I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Duke's friendship would have been constant, and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to him: but a civility that went very far with the haughty
humour of the one, appearing nothing to the excessive ambition
of the other, the Cardinal enduring no equal, and the Duke
hardly admitting of any superior; it was impossible so to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
things betwixt two so aspiring spirits, but that they would at
last break out into an open feud.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Court at <hi>Lyons</hi> was agitated with this Tempest of
Division, of which we are now speaking, the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>
in the greatest calm, and serenity of repose, enjoy'd at <hi>Paris</hi> the
honour, and applause, that his well known, and long continued
vertue, had acquir'd to his person, and name; insomuch that, as
his Coach pass'd through the streets, we had continually the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of seeing the people flock together in crowds from all parts of
the City to gaze upon him; considering with admiration so
vigorous a health in so great an extremity of age, pursuing him
with acclamations wherever he went; and the old hatred, that the
former Factions had stirr'd up against him, being now converted
into love, and esteem, gave us to understand, that envy is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

the concomitant of Vertue; but that there is a certain
pitch, to which the one, being once arriv'd, is got clear out of
sight of the other, which of a mean and earthy composition
cannot shoot its darts so far as to reach the Station, where Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Vertue is enthron'd.</p>
                  <p>In this great, and undisturbed leisure, that the Duke enjoy'd at
<hi>Paris,</hi> he who was himself a great lover of Building, could find
no better entertainment wherewithal to divert himself, than by
going abroad to see the Houses, in and about the City, which were
then erecting, with the magnificence that we now admire in our
proud and stately Structures. Amongst others, going one day in
very good company to the <hi>Hostel de Luxembourg,</hi> that the Queen
Mother was then finishing, they entred the Gallery, where she
had caus'd the manner of her escape from <hi>Blois</hi> (as the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
passage of her life) to be painted in Story. One of the
most apparent evidences the Duke could possibly receive, that
that service of his was no more regarded, was, that he, who had
been the sole Authour of the whole Action, was no where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in that painting, though so much as the very Footmen
that opened the Boots of her Coach had not been omitted. He
had heard before of this injustice that had been done him; but
though it had touch'd him very near, had never manifested the
least discontent: neither do I believe he would have said any thing
upon this occasion, if the company who were with him, had not
provok'd him to it: But every one asking him questions of a
thing whereof they knew he was able to give them the best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
at last some one freer than the rest, ask'd him how it
came to pass that he was only left out of the story? to which the
Duke modestly reply'd:<note place="margin">A sudden answer of the Duke of <hi>Espersion</hi> to a very nice q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <q>That he did not know who had done
him that wrong; but that whoever they were that intended to
disoblige him in it, had doubtless therein more offended the
Queen, than him: That he was very certain (however exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the story) that no one could condemn him for having any
ways fail'd in the action, or in any thing he had undertaken for
the Queen upon that occasion, his carriage of that business be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too generally known for that; neither did he believe they
would much magnifie her, for having deny'd him so poor an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement.</q>
                  </p>

Famine ensu'd throughout the whole Province of <hi>Guienne.</hi>
Neither did the Duke fail in this exigent to try all possible ways to
relieve them; for after having given order for the distribution of
all the Grain that could be gather'd in his own. Territories, he
moreover dealt with some Merchants of <hi>Paris,</hi> who undertook,
that provided they might have Commission from the King, out
of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and <hi>Britanny,</hi> to make sufficient provision wherewithal
to supply that Province. They had no sooner made this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Duke, but that he immediately dispatch'd away an
express Courrier to the King to obtain that leave, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
granted; upon the return of which dispatch those, who
had so largely promis'd, did indeed perform something; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
near what they had made the Duke expect: so that nothing
could so divert the Judgment Almighty God was pleas'd to inflict
upon this delicate part of <hi>France;</hi> but that in less than six months

bread; a number that had in all probability yet been much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
had the Duke's care to their preservation been less, by which
the evil was at least moderated, though it could not be totally
overcome.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the King's health was so miraculously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
at <hi>Lyons,</hi> that his Majesty resolv'd to return back to <hi>Paris;</hi>
during which Voyage 'tis said the Cardinal employ'd all manner
of industry, and offer'd all sorts of submission to the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to reconcile himself to her favour; but all in vain, she was
still so implacably bent against him, that the Peace of <hi>Italy</hi> being
already concluded, and consequently the time come wherein the
King had promis'd her to remove the Cardinal, they were no
sooner arriv'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> but that pursuing this Affair with the same
vehemency she had begun, and so as if she had already foreseen
all those evils she justly had to fear, she was importunately instant
with the King for the accomplishment of his Royal Word. What
repugnancy soever the King might have to deprive himself of a
Servant he had found very useful to him in the management of his
Affairs, yet the respect to a Mother, and the obligation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had so prevailing a power over his own interest, and delight,
that the Order was at last sign'd for the Cardinal's removal; when
the King to avoid either the Ceremony,<note place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Rich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had the Queen Mother gone along with the King this little
Journey, she had made her self absolute Mistriss of Affairs, and
there had been an end of the Cardinal: But she thinking the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:63412:254"/>
work already done, though she had but begun it (a common
oversight) and out of that belief stopping short in the heat of her
persecution, gave the Cardinal by that means leisure to reestablish
himself with the King, and totally to subvert the power, that
had been employ'd to his ruine.</p>
                  <p>Yet was it not by his own prudence, and conduct, that he was
thus suddenly restor'd, who on the contrary had set up his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and was content to submit to his Fortune by withdrawing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from Court; a resolution wherein he had been so precipitous,
that he went the very evening of his disgrace to lye at <hi>Pointoise,</hi>
from thence to continue his journey to <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> the place he
had made choice of for his retirement. His equipage was already
prepar'd, already he was by the most of his friends (the first, and
most ordinary effect of disgrace) slighted, and forsaken, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but solitude remain'd in his House; when the Cardinal <hi>de la

                     </note> prompted by a design more generous in it self, than advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to, or perhaps expedient for the concerns of his own
Family, rousing up the subdu'd spirit of his dejected Friend,
made him by force of Arguments recollect himself, and see his
error. He remonstrated to him, as it is sufficiently known to all
the Kingdom (though so long as the Cardinal lived no one durft
record it) <q>That he could not assume a more dangerous resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than to think of retiring himself: That such as had once
rais'd their fortunes to that height to which his was now arriv'd,
had no steps left them by which again to descend: That he had
no way to maintain himself in the height he then was, but by
aspiring higher, that therein the way before him was honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and secure; but that there was nothing but precip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, which upon the least motion of retiring would give
him such a fall, that he would never be able to rise again: That
he deceiv'd himself, if he thought his adversaries would satisfie
themselves with what they had already done; it being plain that
they must still apprehend the recovery of his power, which
would be so much the more formidable to them, as he had
been by them more justly provok'd: That he was therefore to
go boldly to the King, whilst the memory of his Services was
yet recent, and whilst his enemies (blinded with their good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess)
had left a passage open to him, through which he might at
great ease, and with great safety, travel to the ruine of their
designs: That he would himself accompany him to run his share
of the danger (if any could be) in the execution of what he did
advise; and that having made him a promise of his friendship,
he would preserve it inviolate to him in the one, and the other
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:63412:255"/>
Fortune.</q> What might not a friend have reasonably expected
in acknowledgement of so prudent, and so generous a counsel,
and that was crown'd with so favourable a success? we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
in a short time see a sad return of that seasonable
kindness.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> fortified by this advice,<note place="margin">The two Cardinals go together to the King to <hi>Versaille,</hi> where whilst the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> they overthrow all her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</note> instead of taking his
way towards <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> went directly to <hi>Versaille,</hi> where ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
himself to the King, and being better acquainted than
any with all the little Labyrinths of his Majesties humour, he
soon, by the charms of his Eloquence, overthrew whatever his
Enemies thought they had establish'd by more powerful ways.
In the mean time the Queen Mother, dreaming of nothing less
than so sudden a change, already reign'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> behaving her
self to all that came near her person like one who was now got to
be the Sovereign Arbitress of all Affairs; no more caring ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to improve, or retain her Interest with persons whose Service
she conceiv'd for the future unnecessary to the support of her
Power. The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> hapned (to his good Fortune) to
be one of these, he had the day preceding the Thunder-clap
against the Cardinal, and of a long time before, receiv'd all kind
of civil respect from this Queen; but after his dismission pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
himself before her as he us'd to do, she had so little regard
for him, as before his face to hold discourse an hour together
with people of far inferiour quality, without so much as vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safing
him one word. A neglect which if it was resented by the
Duke (as it was to the last degree) it was notwithstanding of no
little advantage to him: for the Cardinal, who knew how solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
the Queen Mother had been to win him to her party before
his disgrace, who was not ignorant of the strong connexion he
had with the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> and above all of the great intimacy
that was betwixt the Princess of <hi>Conty</hi> and him; and who had
been moreover inform'd that the night preceding his disfavour, he
had been long in secret Conference with the <hi>Mareschal de Bassom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre</hi>
one of his most passionate enemies, had from all these
knowledges conceiv'd a violent presumption, that the Duke must
of necessity be deeply engag'd in his enemies interests, and designs.
But the Queen's indifferency did in part justifie him from that
suspicion,<note place="margin">An alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at Court.</note> though some have believ'd that that alone would not
have been sufficient absolutely to have clear'd him from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's
jealousie, nor to have secur'd him from imprisonment at
least, if the late merits of the Cardinal his Son had not rescu'd
him from that danger. It was in truth very necessary some body
else should have that care of him, he being so far from contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting

from the command of an Army to undergo an infamous Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
In fine after the fatal day call'd <hi>la journée des Dupes</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
so many dire effects, that not only all the men of Quality,
but almost all of any name at Court, went to visit the Cardinal,
to dispossess him of the opinion, that they might have been any
way inimical to him:<note place="margin">Except the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was perhaps the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man that would not go to see him, nor once offer to justifie
himself from the jealousie he might reasonably enough conceive
of his disaffection, and that purposely the more to manifest it to
him. He went 'tis true to <hi>Versaille,</hi> where he saw the King, and
had the honour to talk with him; but he would never be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
upon to go into the Cardinal's Chamber, though very near
the King's, to pay him the least civility, or respect. I saw <hi>le Plessis</hi>
the same night infinitely afflicted at this carriage; this Gentleman
who was very discreet, well vers'd in Affairs, and much more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
for his Masters interests, than for any thing that concern'd
himself, had importun'd him to give the Cardinal a Visit; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his custom, the more he represented to him the danger
of not doing it, the more obstinate he was not to do it, his haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and undaunted spirit, rather choosing to transgress the Maxims
of Policy, and Prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than those of Bravery and Honour. It
is indeed true that he went two days after to see him, where the
Cardinal knowing every tittle of what had pass'd) it may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
how he was receiv'd; though the Duke, without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
at his cold entertainment, said to those who spoke to him
of it: <q>That he had done as he ought to do; that every one did
not understand the distinction that ought to be made betwixt
the Master and the Servant; that those were respects so different
in themselves, as they ought not to be slightly confounded; and
that he was old enough to carry the authority of Example.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of all the means that can be propos'd for the establishment of
a prodigious power,<note place="margin">Anno 1631.</note> there is none so certain as attempts that are
vainly made to suppress it; it appearing that whatever is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the one, does ever give increase to the other; neither can
there be any so imprudent, or so dangerous a resolution, as to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
a great Minister by halves; since by making him sensible of
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:63412:256"/>
the power he has to revenge himself, you give him at the same
time a pretense to do it with some colour of Justice. It fell out so
in the violent, but fruitless endeavours the Cardinal's Enemies
made use of to work his ruine; by which being made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the interest he had in the King's bosom, and employing that
interest under the sole pretense of retorting the injuries he had vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
receiv'd, he found his Majesty so much the more inclin'd to
take his part, as he saw there was a kind of equity in the case:
wherein he would not do his business by halves, as his enemies
had done; but vigorously pressing them, who either had already
fall'n foul upon him, or who had yet the power to do it; he put
himself by that means into a condition of living not only in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal falls foul upon his enemies.</note>
but also in repose for the time to come, by removing all

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was yet at Court in the midst of this

restraining the licence of the unruly Souldiers, that were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
in the Countrey; the good order he took for bringing in
the relief of Corn; and the care he had, that he Magistrates, and

that without all doubt, both <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
stand eternally oblig'd to his vigilancy and care.</p>
                  <p>After having taken the best order he could for the preservation
of the Capital City, he departed thence with a resolution to
continue some time at his house <hi>Cadillac;</hi> but he could not make
so long a stay there, as he intended. This little place being in a
manner necessitated by its situation so near to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and lying
upon the same River, to have continual intercourse, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with the principal City, had thence caught the Infection,
which, for ten or twelve days that the Duke made his abode
there, made miserable havock among them; yet was it only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Inhabitants of the Town, as if it had had a respect to his
Family: insomuch that although he never refused to admit any
of the people into his house, that he went himself frequently to
visit the sick in their Cabins, and that so numerous a Train as his,
could not long continue in so little a place, without having some
communication with infected persons; yet was there (which
was a kind of Miracle) a continual health throughout his whole
Family. At last at the importunity of his Domesticks, who
were much more solicitous of him, than he was of himself, he
resolv'd to leave the lower, and infected, to go seek out a better

themselves to open Arms, shut up their Gates, and deny'd entrance
to those Companies. Neither was this all, they proceeded from
words to some untoward effects, some Souldiers were kill'd
from the Walls of the City; neither did these seditious people
fail of their endeavours to engage <hi>Millant,</hi> and some other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

Cities of that Province, which had engag'd with the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi>
in the late Commotion. So that the Walls of <hi>Millant,</hi> one of
the strongest Holds of that Party, were soon seen levell'd with the
ground, as also those of <hi>Saint-Afrique,</hi> of <hi>Pont de Camarés,</hi> of
<hi>Saint-Rome, Tarn,</hi> and several other places. Wherein so good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was taken, that there was no more fear this little Countrey,
one of the hardest to be reclaim'd in the whole Kingdom, and
that had been likewise one of that last, that had return'd to its obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
should for the future commit any more offenses, or be
guilty of any new Commotion.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Montauban</hi> cannot in this part of my story,
without great injustice, be deny'd the due praise of behaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
exceedingly well upon this occasion;<note place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Montauban</hi> behave themselves very well upon this occasion.</note> who no sooner heard
the Duke design'd to come into their Countrey, but that they
dispatch'd away some of the chiefest amongst them, to beseech
him, that he would honour their City with his presence. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
wherein some scruple might reasonably have been made,
and would the Duke have been govern'd by the advice of many
of his Servants, he had not perhaps so easily given up himself to
the discretion of a people, that it had not been in his power some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to useso kindly as he desir'd. To this consideration the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
juncture of Affairs, rendred their complement much more
suspected, <hi>Saint-Afrique</hi> (a Town of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party) was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
revolted, and had solicited all the other Cities of the same
Religion to concur with them in the maintenance (as they call'd
it) of that little Liberty, they had left remaining; but the Duke
by his generosity overcoming all these jealousies (sufficient of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themselves
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:63412:257"/>
to have made a loss daring man lose the opportunity
of performing that Service for the King, he then did him) acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
their invitation, and went confidently to <hi>Montauban;</hi>
where, if those of the Town had really any evil intention (which
did nevertheless no ways appear) having by his presence dissolv'd
that ill humour, he thereby rendred the mutinous designs of
<hi>Saint-Afrique</hi> so inconsiderable, that they fell at last upon the heads
of them, who had been the contrivers of the mischief.</p>
                  <p>The Duke at first had intended to have continu'd for some
time at <hi>Montauban,</hi> believing that the Commotion of <hi>Roüergue</hi>
would not so soon have been appeas'd; but having by his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
care compos'd things sooner than he expected, he in a few
days found himself at liberty to go as far as the Frontier to the
Baths at <hi>Banieres.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke goes to the Baths of <hi>Banieres.</hi>
                     </note> This Countrey, abounding with Gentry equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to any other of the Kingdom, had been the Nursery from
whence <hi>Monsieur de la Valette</hi> his Father, the Admiral his Brother,
and himself had continually drawn out most of the brave men
with which they had so gloriously serv'd their Kings, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
their own Fortunes; as it was also out of them, that he had
constantly chosen most of his Officers for Foot Commands. The
acknowledgment therefore of his former favours, being by no
better way to be express'd, than by the great conflux of those he
had oblig'd, they came to wait upon him in so great numbers, and
so handsomely attended, that he could hardly have been better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
in any other part of his Government. They here
pass'd away the time, as people usually do in the Bathing season,
in all sorts of innocent Recreations, to which the good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there had invited the Ladies, as well as the Gentlemen of the
Countrey: when the Duke, after having bestow'd more of his
time upon his friends, than to the consultation of his own health
(which at so great an age continued in a marvellous vigour) would
return back towards the lower <hi>Gascony,</hi> to see the miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of that part of the Province, still groaning under the same
heavy judgments, wherewith at his first coming from Court he
had found it afflicted.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke was preparing for his return, he receiv'd news
of the Grace his second Son had receiv'd from the King, who had
lately conferr'd upon him the honour of Duke, and Peer;<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de la Valette</hi> takes his Oath for Duke and Peer of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </note> he
had long before receiv'd his Patent for that Dignity, which has
made me so often in the preceding discourse, give him that Title;
but he had neither taken his Oath, nor assum'd his place in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
till this time. The Territory of <hi>Ville-Bois</hi> settled upon
him by the Duke his Father at his Marriage, was also honour'd
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:63412:258"/>
with the Title of a Dutchy, by that means leaving its former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,
to take that of its Lord, and Owner. That which
rendred this new Dignity more remarkable was, that Cardinal
<hi>Richelieu</hi> (at this time advanc'd to the greatest height a Subject
can be capable of) would at the same Session be installed in the
same degree of honour; so that they were both receiv'd together
in Parliament, and both their Letters Patents the same day veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and confirmed.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, though at present ill enough dealt withal at Court,
and inwardly not over-well satisfied with former passages, could
not however, but acknowledge this for a favour; so that, once in
his life accommodating himself to the time, he writ a Letter of
Complement to the Cardinal: to which he soon after return'd an
answer obliging enough; wherein, after he had reply'd to the
Duke's civility concerning his Sons promotion, he proceeded to
acquaint him that the Cardinal his youngest Son had been lately
created Governour of <hi>Anjou.</hi>

highly pleas'd: but as joy seldom arrives without some mixture
of bitterness; this was soon follow'd by one of the most just,
and most sensible afflictions that could almost arrive, which was
the Death of <hi>le Plessis</hi> his beloved, and faithful Servant. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
equally wise, and valiant, dextrous, and faithful, and
who had all these qualities eminent in him, to a very conspicuous
degree had been so happy, that the Services which had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the Father, were no less pleasing to his Sons; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that not one of them but was passionate for his advancement,
and ambitious to contribute something to his Fortune; a thing he
himself so little considered, that had he not met with Masters li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
in their own Natures, his deserts had been the worst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
of any mans of his time: but such was the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they all paid to his merit, that the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> was
no sooner provided of the Government of <hi>Anjou,</hi> but that he
cast his eye upon <hi>le Plessis,</hi> to bestow upon him one of the best
and principal Commands of that Province, which was that of
the Castle of <hi>Angers.</hi> He had already that of <hi>Chasteau Trompette</hi>
of <hi>Bordeaux;</hi> neither would the Duke consent to be totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of his Service, all that he could condescend unto to satisfie
his Son, being to share with him in this good Servant, and to
give way that he should serve at the Castle of <hi>Angers,</hi> still keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the command of <hi>Chasteau Trompette. Le Plessis</hi> having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
taken his leave of the Duke at <hi>Condom</hi> to go to take possession
of his new Government staid by the way to keep his <hi>Christmas</hi> at
<hi>Bordeaux,</hi> with an intention after the Holy days were pass'd, to
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:63412:258"/>
continue his Journey to <hi>Angers:</hi> but his Devotion making him
commit a violence upon his health, at this time something im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd,
by an indisposition that began to grow upon him, his
Disease increas'd to such a degree at midnight Mass, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of his Prayers was almost the end of his Life. He went
out of the Church seiz'd with a Catarre,<note place="margin">The death of <hi>le Plessis Baussonniere</hi> the Duke's principal Servant.</note> by which his breathing
being stop'd, and all sense and memory taken away, he was in a
few hours totally suffocated. He could not certainly by a more
Christian, nor a more easie death have finish'd a very excellent
life: but the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> could not of a long time after be
comforted for his loss; neither indeed could a greater almost have
befallen him, he having scarce any other Servant left, that was
allow'd the liberty to tell his Master, what he conceiv'd was best
for the good of his Service: the Duke, who would never slacken
the severe hand he ever held over all his Servants, not enduring
that any of them should presume to advise him: this only by the
prerogative of his Age, and approv'd Fidelity, was dispens'd from
that Law; a dispensation that he notwithstanding ever made use
of with so great modesty, as to make it appear it was rather a
Priviledge granted by the Master's bounty, than any Empire
usurp'd by the Servant over his Masters affections.</p>
                  <p>The life of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anno 1632.</note> and his particular actions,
have so great a connexion with the publick interest, that his story
is no where to be long continued without putting the writer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a necessity of interweaving something of the general concerns
of the Kingdom; which obliges me in this place to resume the
gross of Affairs, and with the year to enter into transactions of
very great importance, wherein the Duke had so eminent a share
that his greatest enemies, and such as were most emulous of his
glory, cannot but do him that right as to confess that he strook
the greatest stroke in the success of the Royal Arms.</p>
                  <p>The Queen Mother and the <hi>Monsieur</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Troubles arise upon the retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur.</hi>
                     </note> being retir'd out of the
Kingdom, it was not likely, but that two so great persons, being
open, and profess'd enemies to the Cardinal (whom they had
publickly declar'd to be the Author of their discontents) would
do their utmost endeavours to make him feel the effects of their
indignation: but it appearing that the King was in a manner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
in honour to protect his Minister, and that he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to be assaulted without offending his Majesty himself,
they were to expect a great, and vigorous opposition, to whatever
attempts they should make upon the Cardinal's Fortune. These
two discontented Princes therefore, well foreseeing this difficulty,
willingly accepted the offers made them by the Emperour, the
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:63412:259"/>
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> to take Arms in their
favour: but as it was impossible these separate Forces should unite,
and move at the same time, whereas those of the King embodied,
and acting by one sole authority,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</note> could in a moment produce the
effects of all their power: it was no hard matter for the Cardinal
to frustrate the attempts of all these Forein Princes, and to repel
even upon them themselves, who were most active to destroy
him, the designs they had projected for his ruine.</p>
                  <p>If the Cardinal's wisdom was of great use to him (as question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it was) upon this occasion, it must likewise be confess'd that
Fortune did no little contribute to his safety, who from the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of the North, rais'd him up a Prince, one of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and great in all qualities both Military, and Civil, that latter
ages have produc'd, and that was the great <hi>Gustavus Adolphus</hi> King
of <hi>Sweden.</hi> This Prince (in truth inconsiderable enough, had not
his single Person, and Valour in themselves, been worth the
greatest Armies) undertook to invade <hi>Germany,</hi> and to assault
the Emperour in the heart of his own Dominions; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that this mighty Prince, who had already subdu'd all the
powers that were opposite to him, possess'd that Empire (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of many Kingdoms) in a greater degree of Sovereignty,
than any of his Predecessors, who had sway'd that Scepter for
many Ages before him, had ever done.</p>
                  <p>These difficulties, sufficient to have discourag'd, and withheld
the mightiest powers serv'd only for Spurs to the ambition of this
generous, and magnanimous Prince. He entred then into <hi>Germany,</hi>
where at his coming he proclaim'd liberty to all the Princes, and
People; a great allurement indeed, but his large promises with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some advantageous effects were not of force to draw many
Partizans over to his side. He sought therefore with great eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
an occasion wherein to make tryal of his Arms, which he
knew was the only way to win himself Reputation, and Friends;
and the Emperour, who had no less Interest to stop the impetuosity
of an Invader who came to brave him in the heart of his own
Empire, oppos'd to this Torrent (and that under the command
of the best, and most fortunate Leaders he had) his Army hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
victorious over all the Forces they had met in the Field: but
the glory of all those Victories serv'd only to render that of the
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> more illustrious, which he obtain'd over these
Conquerours at the Battel of <hi>Lipsick;</hi> by which great, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
action, having rendred his name (till then almost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known)
formidable throughout the whole Empire, he ran from
one extremity thereof to the other, almost without any resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:63412:259"/>
at least without meeting any impediment that could stop
his way.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal (as he had good reason) rendred himself very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile,
and favourable to this Prince, who seem'd to be come out
of his Rocks, and Desarts for no other end save only to defend
his quarrel. He assisted him therefore in the beginning with some
few men, and a little money; which though not very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
the <hi>Swede</hi> nevertheless gave so important a diversion to the
House of <hi>Austria,</hi> that having their hands more than full of their
own Affairs, they were far from being in any capacity of traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Neighbours designs. If the Emperour had enough to
do at home, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had no less need of all his Forces at
the Siege of <hi>Mastrick;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> depriv'd of the
support of these two great Princes, under whose shadow, and
protection he had taken Arms, being of himself unable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the King's Power, was necessitated (as he had done
some time before) to fly to his Majesties mercy. By the Treaty of
<hi>Vic,</hi> concluded in the beginning of the year, he had d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>liver'd
<hi>Marsal</hi> to the King by way of caution for the performance of his
word; and for this second of <hi>Liverdune,</hi> he moreover assign'd to
him <hi>Stenay, Iamets,</hi> and <hi>Clairmont;</hi> upon which good security his
Majesty having granted him peace, he was constrain'd to observe
it, though it was only not long after to break it: from whence
ensu'd the loss of his whole Dukedom.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Monsieur</hi> seeing himself thus defeated of all hopes of any
Forein assistance, his Servants assay'd to procure that for him at
home, they saw was not elsewhere to be expected; to which end
Letters from the Queen Mother, and himself were presented to
the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> to try if by that application they could
interest that Assembly in their grievances, and inveagle the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
into a good opinion of their cause: but all in vain; they
practis'd moreover several discontented persons, whose assistance
consisting only of a very few men, was also of no great effect;
the remains of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> party were likewise tamper'd withal;
but besides that they were reduc'd to such a low condition, that
they had greater need of some Potent Prince to protect them, than
that they were in any capacity to repair the fortune of a great
Prince declin'd; there was so good order taken to hold them in,
in all parts of the Kingdom, that not a man amongst them durst
once offer to stir. The Cardinal having from the beginning of
the year foreseen, that the discontents of the Queen Mother, and
the <hi>Monsieur</hi> exasperated, and fomented by strangers, would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
bring a War upon the Kingdom, had omitted no manner
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:63412:260"/>
of precaution that might serve to frustrate their designs: he had
caus'd the Kings standing Regiments both of Horse and Foot to
be reinforc'd, had put sufficient Garrisons into all the important
Cities, had by very severe prohibitions forestall'd all such as were
likely to engage with the Enemy; and those of the Religion,
though already upon the matter subdu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

even in their impotency to be suspected, he had taken a particular
care to make sure of them upon this occasion.</p>
                  <p>What difficulties soever the punctual execution of these Orders
had strew'd in the way of the <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s designs, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that he saw himself abandoned by his Forein friends,
sufficiently taken up with their own particular Affairs, he thought
nevertheless that the sole interest of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi>
who was absolutely at his Devotion, would of it self enable him
to execute his revenge for the injuries he had receiv'd.<note place="margin">The <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi> enters the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> Upon which

without making any discovery into what part of <hi>France</hi> he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to retire: and then it was that the King's Orders, and dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were redoubled, and sent with great diligence into all parts
of the Kingdom, to which it was probable those Forces would
direct their March. They seem'd principally to threaten either
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> or <hi>Guienne;</hi> the Governours of which two Provinces
having no great reason to be very well satisfied with the Court,
the Cardinal did not well know what to think of them, nor what
to promise to himself from their Fidelity in so critical a time. Of
these the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> the more reason the Court had
to be jealous of his behaviour, the more industrious he was (as
guilty men usually are) to wipe off all shadow of suspicion they
might justly conceive; insomuch that 'tis said he dispatch'd post
after post to the King to give him assurance of his Loyalty; a thing
that afterwards prov'd one of the most dangerous circumstances
of his offense. The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> did not promise so much,
and perform'd much more, he only sending the <hi>Sieur de Camp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

causes of his discontent, many at that time allow'd them to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
just, though no one could approve the course he took to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

nevertheless so satisfie the Court, that they were not yet in great
anxiety, and suspense, what his resolution might be: the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
friendship, and strict alliance, betwixt the House of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi>
and him, were sufficiently known; neither were they
ignorant that the tender, and passionate affection he had for the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:63412:261"/>
person of this Duke, was equal to that he had for his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they knew moreover that two days before the Duke had
declar'd, the Marchioness of <hi>Montferrant</hi> of the House of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi>
widow to the Baron <hi>de Montaut</hi> the Duke's Cousin
German, and now Wife to one of the most intimate friends he
had in the Province, had parted from the Dutchess of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi>
to return into <hi>Guienne</hi> to her Husband who was then with
the Duke of <hi>Espernon:</hi> so that this Lady, a woman capable of
the greatest Affairs, above what is usual in persons of her Sex,
there were few who did not conclude, she had been purposely
sent by the Duke her Kinsman to labour an intelligence with the
Duke his ally; though in truth there was no such thing. In fine,
the good or ill success of Affairs depending without all doubt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
upon him, the Court had all the reason in the world to be
in some fear of what his determination would be. All the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of his Government were wavering, those of the Reform'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
who had been constrain'd to accept of an incommodious
Peace, in all apparence, waited only expecting a fit opportunity
to begin a new War; thereby to obtain more advantageous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
than those that had been impos'd upon them; and the
people oppress'd more than ordinary by new Taxes, desir'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than trouble, and confusion, which they conceiv'd
to be the best, and only remedy for their present calamities. These
evil dispositions were not only in <hi>Guienne,</hi> but <hi>Angoumois</hi> also;
<hi>Xaintonge, Limousin,</hi> and <hi>Poictou,</hi> panted with the same thirst of
Innovation: so that in all these Provinces (where the Duke had
long govern'd) they yet retain'd for him so great a love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
that what resolution soever he had taken, would without
contradiction have been follow'd by them for the best. Neither
had he needed to have made any great ado, to procure a great
deal of mischief; since by only sitting still, and conniving never
so little at those who were ready for Commotion, he might have
wrought matters into such a confusion, as would infallibly have
put the Kingdom into very great disorder; and then the
<hi>Mareschal de Schomberg,</hi> shut up betwixt the Forces of <hi>Languedoc,</hi>
and <hi>Guienne,</hi> would have been irrecoverably lost. But this good
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> what aversion soever he might have to the Cardinal's
immeasurable greatness, what affection soever for the Duke of
<hi>Montmorency,</hi> or what advantage soever he might reasonably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to himself from the alteration of Affairs (the face whereof
he might doubtless have chang'd) he still preferr'd the Service of
his Prince, and the good of his Countrey, before any particular
Interest of his own, and remain'd unshaken in his duty, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:63412:261"/>
all the overtures had been made, and the importunities
had been us'd to debauch him.</p>
                  <p>The Duke acting with this sincerity and candour, thought it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
requisite to confirm the King in the assurances he had formerly
given his Majesty, of his fidelity, and truth, which he did by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the <hi>Count de Maillé</hi> to that effect: and proceeding from
words to actions, after he was arriv'd at <hi>Montauban,</hi> his first care
was speedily to dispatch away two Gentlemen throughout the
whole Province, to summon in to him all the persons of quality,
whom he had most reason to suspect. There were very few who
did not promptly obey this Summons, which being deliver'd them
by men of Repute, they could not make any excuse, that they had
not receiv'd his Commands; and it was no hard matter for the
Duke when he had them so near his person, to keep them there,
and so narrowly to watch them, that they were not conveniently
to be practis'd; by which means, besides this advantage, which
was none of the most inconsiderable, he from this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
deriv'd another of exceeding great moment, which
was insensibly, and as it were almost without design, to fortifie
himself in a City, where he was very weak, and the disposition
whereof was as yet very uncertain.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be believ'd how great an effect these prudent precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
produc'd to the security of Affairs, nor how much several
persons were disabus'd thereby, who otherwise might have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
themselves to have been deceiv'd by false impressions of the
Duke, and such as were utterly contrary to his intention: but
his fidelity was so legible throughout the whole order of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and he gave so little hopes to those who were seditiously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
of being to be tempted to embrace any disloyal motion,
that in so great a disposition to evil, and in so favourable an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to do it, there was not one man of quality of <hi>Guienne,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<hi>Saint Croix d' Ornano,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
Servants, that went out of the Province to joyn with
him; the Duke's good Example, and Exhortations, so containing
all the rest within the bounds of their Duty, that the King had a
very good issue of an Affair, his Majesty himself thought would
not so easily have determin'd. It was after all these important ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
that it was justly said of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> that <hi>In doing
nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e had done all;</hi> for in effect, without stirring from the place,
without arming any other than his own Guards, without having
spilt one drop of blood, or spent six pence of the King's money,
he procur'd his Majesty, without danger, or expense, a Victory that
settled the whole Kingdom in repose.</p>

                     <pb n="496" facs="tcp:63412:262"/>
The King, inform'd by the Duke's dispatches of the good order
he had taken in his Government, by very gracious Letters (which
the <hi>Count de Maillé</hi> brought back at his return) signified to him
how highly he was satisfied with his conduct;<note place="margin">The King writes very graciously, and the Cardinal very kindly to the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his good Service.</note> wherein, amongst
other things, his Majesty acquainted him with his intention to
leave <hi>Paris,</hi> and to take the way of <hi>Lyons,</hi> there to command his
Army in his own person (a thing the Council would never consent
unto, till they were secure of the Duke's intentions) and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
in his Letters bearing the same date with the King's, writ
to him in these express terms: <q>I shall content my self with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you this assurance, that nothing can possibly be added to
the infinite satisfaction his Majesty has receiv'd in the Zeal you
have manifested to the good of his Service in the present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and that I shall with great diligence seek all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that may contribute to the desire I have to let you see, that no
one is more really than my self, Your, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> To these during the
King's Expedition, he receiv'd several other Dispatches, of the
same obliging style, which I forbear to copy here, that I may not
importune my Reader,</p>
                  <p>But how great soever the Duke's Merits and Services were, and
how large soever the promises, that had been made him, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of those Services was notwithstanding so short liv'd, that
even before the storm was well over, they sought an occasion to
quarrel with him, thinking it, belike, better cheap to cavil at some
little passages, (which ought rather to be imputed to his humour,
than his intention) than to stand oblig'd to him for this Service.</p>
                  <p>I should never have done should I undertake to relate all the
particularities (though remarkable enough in themselves) or
should I so much as insist upon the more eminently consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
passages that hapned upon this occasion, which makes me

to come to the main business of all, which is the defeat of
of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and his being taken prisoner.</p>
                  <p>'Tis well enough known after what manner this unfortunate
Lord precipitously, and almost alone, engag'd himself against a
whole Army; a rashness by which he became the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of his enemies Victory: insomuch that had he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd
with them against himself, he could not more blindly, and
wilfully have run upon his own destruction. He compell'd the
<hi>Mareschal de Scomberg</hi> to fight against his intention, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him against his will; he had not, 'tis true full fifty men slain
in this Engagement, which will yet appear a great number, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that he had not above an hundred, that charg'd with him
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:63412:262"/>
upon this occasion. The <hi>Count de Moret,</hi> a young Prince of great
merit, and much greater expectation, was so unfortunate as to
lose his life without the Trenches that separated the <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s
Army from that of the <hi>Mareschal;</hi> some other persons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ran also the same Fortune: but although this loss was small in
respect to the number of men, the taking of the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi>
made it nevertheless so highly considerable, that every one
concluded the ruine of the whole party infallible. For the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi>
having upon him repos'd his whole confidence for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Army, the Cities and Forces of <hi>Languedoc</hi> being
wholly ty'd to his person, and interest, and all things absolutely
depending upon him; he was no sooner taken, but that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
revolted, and the Army disbanded: so that in a few days the
<hi>Monsieur</hi> saw himself so totally deserted, that what attempt so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he had a desire to make to rescue the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>
out of the enemies hands, and yet to dispute the Victory, he
had so few left wherewith to execute his desire, and those few so
dejected with the late misfortune, that he was reduc'd to a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of relying upon the faith of a Treaty for the preservation of
a Servant, who contrary to his order had lost himself.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> advertis'd of this accident, by a dispatch
from the <hi>Mareschal de Scomberg,</hi> dated the second of <hi>September,</hi>
which was the next day after the fight, was afflicted beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
at the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s misfortune. He gave him
at the first for lost, and being very well acquainted with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Maxims of that time, together with the implacable hatred
the great Minister had conceiv'd against him, did forthwith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that this first Offense would also be the last he was ever like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to commit.</p>
                  <p>Yet not to fail upon this event in any of his respects, he wrote
to the King to signifie to his Majesty the joy he conceiv'd for the
prosperity of his Arms; he sent likewise the same Complement
to the <hi>Mareschal de Scomberg,</hi> and to the Marquis <hi>de Brezé,</hi> who
had behav'd himself very gallantly upon this occasion: but he
also manifested to the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> his great grief for
his misfortune. It was by a Gentleman dispatch'd on purpose to
that end (and before the liberty of receiving his friends addresses,
was taken from him) that he sent to assure this Duke of whatever
without reservation,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> sends a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Duke of <hi>Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in Prison.</note> he could expect from the passion, he had
ever had, and was oblig'd ever to have for his Service. He did
not write to him, but he writ to the <hi>Mareschal de Scomberg,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
he would permit him to pay his friend in so great an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
what their mutual Affection exacted from his duty: a request
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:63412:263"/>
in the granting whereof, the <hi>Mareschal</hi> was so exceeding civil, as
to cause the Duke's Gentleman (which was <hi>Naugas</hi> the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of his Guards) to be forthwith conducted to the Duke of
<hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Chamber. <hi>Naugas</hi> had there full liberty to deliver
all he had in charge from the Duke his Master; whereupon this
unfortunate Lord, who had ever honour'd the Duke, as if he had
been his Father, touch'd with the sense of this seasonable mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of a Friendship, which he knew to be unfeigned, would
needs upon the instant return an acknowledgment of the timely
kindness, by a word in writing under his own hand, though very
much weakened with ten great wounds, and roul'd up with Lints
and Plaisters. Wherein he briefly told him according to his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way of writing, <q>That he acknowledg'd himself infintely
oblig'd for the favour he had done him: That he would not
however in return offer him his<note n="*" place="margin">Not otherwise to be rendred without spoiling the sense.</note> 
                        <hi>good Graces,</hi> which, at this
time were none of the best (intimating thereby his wounded
face) but that, if it should please God to restore him to his health,
he would imploy that, with his life in his Service.</q> To which he
added by word of mouth, several passionate expressions of the
Affection he bore to the Duke; not then dreaming without
doubt that he should so soon be depriv'd of all means whereby
to make it appear. All which, being brought back by <hi>Naugas,</hi>
only serv'd to augment the Duke's Affliction, who was the more
compassionate of his friends condition, by how much he himself
was ignorant of his own misfortune, and insensible of his
danger.</p>
                  <p>The news of this defeat having met the King at <hi>Lyons,</hi> who
with new Forces was following his other Armies, his Majesty no
more doubted, but that all the <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s Party would suddenly
dissolve, as in a few days it did; so that having nothing more to
do, save only to settle what had been discompos'd by the late
Commotion, he mov'd with so great deliberation towards <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louze,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke advances to <hi>Tholouze.</hi>
                     </note>
that he arriv'd not there till the 22. of the month following.
The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> in the mean time, seeing there was now
nothing that could oblige him to make any longer stay either at
<hi>Montauban,</hi> or upon the Frontier of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> went to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Encausse,</hi> a journey he rather undertook to divert himself,

                  <p>The King being (as has been said) arriv'd at <hi>Tholouze</hi> the 22.
of <hi>October,</hi> there was present order given for the bringing thither
of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who accordingly arriving there,
was, as soon as brought, committed into the custody of two
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:63412:263"/>
Judges of the Parliament: a proceeding by which his Relations
and Friends, being given to understand, that they aim'd directly at
his life, there was not one of them who was not ready to serve
him, with the hazard of his own; but yet not one of them
durst be so bold, as to speak for him to the King. His Majesty
seem'd to have bolted the door against all manner of intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by denying his pardon to the <hi>Monsieur,</hi> who had not (as it
was said) sign'd the Articles of the Treaty upon any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
save only to preserve him. The Princess of <hi>Condé</hi> was
moreover forbidden to enter into <hi>Tholouze,</hi> by that means being
rendred incapable of paying so beloved, and so noble a Brother
any other duty than that of her fruitless sighs, and tears. In this
general consternation, whilst the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> was using
his utmost interest, and endeavour with Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was no less importunate with the King, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the only man that had the courage to speak directly in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and to be the Orator of his
other Friends, wherein if his success was not such, as he did
heartily desire; yet ought he not in this place to be deny'd the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of his vertuous endeavour for the preservation of so
precious a life.</p>
                  <p>He address'd himself therefore boldly to the King,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> intercedes for the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</hi>
                     </note> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kneel'd down, with greater submission to prefer his most
humble Suit, the King was pleas'd to raise him up, and to give
him leave to say: <q>That he did not throw himself at his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
feet to justifie the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> in the least, nor by
excuses to extenuate the greatness of his offense: That he did
acknowledge him to be guilty, his Crime being too high, and
manifest to admit of any excuse; but that if it were less, it
would be less worthy of his Majesties mercy: That that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
truly Royal, never appear'd in so great lustre, as when em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
upon great Subjects, and after great Offenses: That his
Majesty would hardly meet with another occasion, wherein it
would be so conspicuously eminent, as in this, all Europe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at this time their eyes fix'd upon him, to observe what he
would please to determine of so illustrious a Head: That he
was the bolder to sue to his Majesty for this pardon, by how
much having in his own person, and upon almost the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
receiv'd the same Grace from his Majesties bounty, he
flatter'd himself to be so happy as that his Majesty had never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
himself of that favour: That he was not the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
amongst his Servants, who stood oblig'd to his Clemency
for the same benefit, but that <hi>Monsieur,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>de Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu</hi>
                        <pb n="500" facs="tcp:63412:264"/>
was equally concern'd: That they had both of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in the Queen Mothers interest in a time when his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Royal Name was oppos'd against them, though they had
therein no other intention, than to do him service; and that if
in that juncture his Majesty had left them to the severity of Law
and Justice, he had depriv'd himself of the great services of the
one, and the gratitude of the other: That the youth of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Montmorency</hi> deserv'd no less to be excus'd, than their
good intentions: That his person being in his Majesties pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
he would be secur'd from doing any thing to the preujudice
of his Service; but that his preservation might serve eternally
to his glory: That he did humbly beseech his Majesty to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the great name of <hi>Montmorency</hi> was now only survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in his single person: That the merit of his Ancestors
(who by a long succession extended their race almost to the first
foundation of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy) pleaded so highly for his
Pardon, that one rash Act ought not to forfeit so brave a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
to the severity of his Majesties Justice. That if he
should be so fortunate as to obtain a second life for his friend, he
would with all his heart become his Security, that for the future
it should never be employ'd, but in his Majesties Service, and
that his Blood should serve for no other use, than to wash away
the Stain, and for ever to obliterate the memory of his Offense.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King with great patience, and without once offering to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
him, gave the Duke free liberty to continue his discourse to
the end, seeming moreover to hearken to him with some kind of
hopeful attention: but that favourable audience was also the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fruit of his address; for his Majesty having from the beginning
of the Duke's Speech fix'd his eyes upon the ground, never lifted
them from thence so much as once to look upon the Duke who
was speaking to him; neither when he had concluded did he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
him one word: by which silence the Duke perceiving the
ruine of his friend to be absolutely decreed, he spoke again, and
said,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> not being able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </q> When though the King had been dumb to the first,
he found words to make answer to this last request, by telling him,

                     </hi> Whereupon the Duke afflicted to the last degree, that

common misfortune. He found at his coming thither that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Richelieu</hi> was but newly parted thence, whose visit, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her no satisfaction, having put her into the last despair, the
Duke's hapned to be exceeding seasonable for the composing of
her mind agitated with so violent a Passion.</p>
                  <p>Though the Duke from that very day prepar'd himself for his
departure, yet had he time enough before he went, totally to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
a proposition made to him on the Cardinal's behalf, presently
after the King's arrival at <hi>Tholouze.</hi> He had caus'd the Duke to be
treated withal to quit the Government of <hi>Metz</hi> in his favour;
offering him in exchange the survivancy of that of <hi>Guienne,</hi> for
the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son, who was already seiz'd of that of
<hi>Metz</hi> in reverson. <hi>Bullion,</hi> newly created <hi>Sur-Intendant des Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi>
was chosen by the Cardinal, as a person most acceptable
to the Duke to make to him this Overture: a proposition at which
the Duke, having serv'd the King so well as he had done in the
last occasion, was not a little surpriz'd; and the rather because
his Services having been of great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>portance to the Cardinal's
Fortune (which was much more strook at in the late Rebellion,
than any thing that concern'd either the King or the Kingdom)
he had reason, besides the satisfaction the King had been pleas'd
to manifest of his performance, to expect also a very grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the Cardinal himself. It was the belief of many at that
time, that the Cardinal's design was, to accommodate himself
with the Bishoprick of <hi>Metz,</hi> together with five or six great Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys
in that City of above an hundred thousand Livers a year
Revenue, besides the Bishoprick which was worth twice as much,
and to add thereunto the Government of the City, and Countrey,
with those of the Cities and Cittadels of <hi>I houl</hi> and <hi>Verdun;</hi>

the end that by providing for himself so certain, and secure a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
he might in time be arm'd against all disgrace; to which
others have added an opinion, that he had a project to reunite all
the Provinces that had formerly been members of the Kingdom
of <hi>Austratia</hi> in his own person, to hold them in the quality of a
Sovereign Prince, whereof <hi>Lorain,</hi> and <hi>Alsatia,</hi> which were in
his Majesties possession, together with the three forenamed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> made up the greatest part;
it had been a matter of no great difficulty for the Cardinal to have
possess'd himself of this Estate, by any title he would have desir'd
of the King: So that, if he ever had this thought, it is not to be
wondred at, if he was sensibly offended that the Duke refus'd to
treat and to comply with him in a thing, he had set his heart upon
for the establishment of his Fortune.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="502" facs="tcp:63412:265"/>
However it was, it is concluded by all, that this Affair made
the Cardinal take up a resolution absolutely to break with the
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> whom he saw to be too stiff to stoop to his
Authority, and look'd upon as the only person of the Kingdom,
who had either the power, or the spirit to mate his greatness.
Wherein nevertheless though the Duke appear'd to be very averse,
yet did he not absolutely reject the Cardinal's proposal; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
he did not offer enough, demanded moreover a <hi>Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi>'s
Staff for the Duke <hi>de Candale</hi> his eldest Son. This was a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that could not indeed be deny'd to his merit, though it had
never been laid in the balance against the Government of <hi>Metz:</hi>
but if the Duke had a kindness for this Son, the Cardinal had no
less aversion, who (it was said) having been wounded to the quick
with some smart touches of the Duke <hi>de Candale</hi>'s Wit (as pleasant
a one indeed as any of his time, but withal as tart, as pleasant)
he could by no means forget it, but would rather choose to leave
a thing of so great importance to the establishment of his Fortune
imperfect, than to be instrumental to the advancement of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
by whom he conceiv'd himself so highly offended. Having
therefore broke off with the Duke upon these terms, it is to be
presum'd, he only for the future waited an occasion, or at least a
pretense wherewithal to colour his revenge. Wherein though the
Duke's haughty humour was likely enough to furnish him with
as good as he could desire, it appear'd nevertheless that fortune
(who will ever have a hand in all humane Affairs) seconding the
Cardinal's passion, produc'd him one much sooner, than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
It was in truth, at this time, contrary to the Duke's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
who, although he would not discover a weakness in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
below his own Dignity, had no desire notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to provoke the Cardinal's Almighty power, by insisting upon
any thing he might irreproachably do.</p>
                  <p>After that, by the death of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> the King
thought he had absolutely appeas'd the storm in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> his
Majesty thought of nothing more, than by the nearest way, and
with a very slender train, of returning back to <hi>Paris.</hi> The Queen,
who was attended by the Council, and all the Court, two days
after the King's departure, began her Journey towards <hi>Bordeaux,</hi>
at greater conveniency to send away her equipage down the River
<hi>Garonne,</hi> where being arriv'd, her Majesty was pleas'd to honour
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> so far, as to cross the River, to go see him
in his House <hi>Cadillac.</hi>

<pb n="503" facs="tcp:63412:265"/>
of her love and esteem; so that it is not to be doubted,
but he was overjoy'd to have so favourable an Opportunity,
wherein to manifest, in some measure, his Gratitude for her
Grace, and Favour. Nothing therefore was spar'd to that end,
and the Duke, having a few days preceded her Majesties coming,
had made so plentiful provision of all things, and she was receiv'd
at his House after so splendid a manner, that as on the one side it
was impossible for him fully to satisfie his Duty, and Affection;
so could he on the other very hardly have done more, than he did,
or have added any thing to the Splendour, and Magnificence of this
Entertainment.</p>
                  <p>The Duke's ill Fortune would have it that Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>
came this Journey with the Queen; who since he had fortified
<hi>Broüage</hi> to such a degree, that it is at this day reputed one of the
strongest places in <hi>France,</hi> had never been there, and would
now therefore for all the money he had laid out upon it (which
was a vast Summe) give himself the satisfaction of taking a view
of his Work. The Duke was not sorry for this Resolution; but
on the contrary, no public unkindness having hitherto hapned
betwixt them,<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal comes to <hi>Cadill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Accidents that hapned in this Journey making the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
which had so long been hatching in the Cardinal's Bosom,
to disclose themselves, occasion'd soon after the first Disorder the
Duke had ever receiv'd in his Fortune. Of these Accidents the
first was this.</p>
                  <p>The Queen being to pass the River betwixt <hi>Cadillac,</hi> and <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
to come to the House, the Duke had prepar'd Coaches rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to receive her Majesty, at her landing; giving order withal to
some of his Servants to reserve one for the Cardinal, that he might
have no cause to complain of any want of respect towards him:
an Order nevertheless so ill observ'd, that the Queen first landing,
and the Coaches design'd for her Train proving too few to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them all, they also made bold with that, which was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the Cardinal.<note place="margin">The C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's first complaint.</note> At the Queens coming ashore, the Duke,
having paid her the respect that was most justly due, by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Majesty to her apartment, that first duty perform'd,
went back in all haste to receive the Cardinal upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
himself taking a Coach along with him for that purpose;
but for all his diligence he came too late, meeting the Cardinal
already advanc'd a pretty way towards the House on Foot; where,
though the Duke made him all imaginable Excuses for the fault
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:63412:266"/>
had been committed contrary to his Order; they were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
of force to dispossess him of the distaste he had taken,
that he had not been so well us'd as he ought to be: so that though
he receiv'd them with some shew of satisfaction, his actions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
sufficiently manifested his discontent, he being not to be
perswaded to make use of the Coach the Duke had brought him;
and although already seiz'd with the beginning of a distemper, of
which a few days after at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> he had like to have dy'd, he
was nevertheless obstinate to finish the remaining part of his way
on foot, though with great trouble and inconvenience, till he
came to the Lodgings that were made ready for him.</p>
                  <p>This was the first cross accident the Duke met with upon this
occasion, and in this every impartial Judge must of necessity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
him. The second hapned soon after at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> wherein,
though it be true, that there was something more of the Duke's
haughty humour, yet was his intention nevertheless infinitely
wide of the sinister interpretations were put upon it. The Queen,
having staid two whole days at <hi>Cadillac,</hi> caus'd her self to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
thence back to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> in order to the continuation of her
Journey, where at the same time the Cardinal also arriv'd: but
his Disease was by this time so much increas'd, that finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
then in excessive pain, within a very few days they began to
despair of his life; and in truth without the assistance of a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon
of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> he had then infallibly dy'd of a suppression
of Vrine.<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's second complaint.</note> Whilst he lay in this extremity, the Queen resolv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
leaving <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> to advance towards <hi>Paris,</hi> by taking <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle</hi>
nevertheless in her way; a place she would by all means take
this opportunity to see, as an eternal Monument of the Kings
Victory. The Duke very well understanding what respect was
due to his Queen, and Mistriss, whilst her Majesty staid in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
had caus'd his Guards to lay aside their Liveries, and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets;
divesting himself moreover of all other Marks, and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of a Governour in her presence: but so soon as she was
gone, and that he had had the honour to attend her to her Boat,
he did not conceive himself oblig'd to retain the same respect for
the Cardinal. He therefore immediately after the Queens departure
commanded his Guards again to put on their Cassocks, and to
take their Arms; and very well attended, presented himself at the
Cardinals Lodgings, who continued yet very ill, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
better than before. Upon this occasion, that was interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for a premeditated Violence, which was only intended for a
Civility, and Respect; and those of the Cardinals Servants, who
saw him come to the House so accompanied, ran to alarm their
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:63412:266"/>
ster, by telling him that the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was coming to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
something upon his person. Whereupon follow'd a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub
throughout the whole Family, every one was agast, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
themselves confusedly to their Arms. In the mean time the
Duke enters the House, where not knowing what to think of
the general Disorder, and astonishment he observ'd in every face
he met, he went on to the Cardinal's Chamber door, follow'd
by very few (having forbidden his Guards to set so much as one
foot upon the stairs) where after having enquir'd of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
health, and having been answer'd, he was exceeding ill, and
in such a condition that he intreated to be excus'd, he could not
see him, he return'd back in the same posture he came, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neither more nor less in this Affair.</p>
                  <p>This is indeed the naked truth of the Story: but it was not so
represented to the Cardinal; those who were about him on the
contrary to insinuate into his Favour, and to make him believe
they had done him a notable piece of Service, assuring him that
without their extraordinary care, and the good posture they had
put themselves into to oppose the Duke, he had infallibly been
lost.<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity against the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> fomented by the Archbishop of <hi>Borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux.</hi>
                     </note> The Duke was afterwards inform'd, and had it from very
good hands, that the Archbishop of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> was one of those
who possess'd the Cardinal with this belief; so that the Duke,
and he not having been (as you may have observ'd) very good
friends before, an Office like this could not but incense him
anew, and the more justly, by how much his Honour was
therein so highly concern'd. He was impatient to think they
should represent him for a man that would harbour violent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
against the person of a Cardinal, and a Priest; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
was the thing that most contributed to the great Disputes,
that hapned betwixt them the ensuing year; of which you will
have a suddain accompt, and such a one as will take up a great part
of this last Volume.</p>
                  <p>The Duke who neither then, nor of some time after, knew
any thing of the ill impressions the Cardinal had been possess'd
withal, continued to use him at the same rate he had begun; his
Guards attended him where-ever he mov'd; he never went abroad
but extraordinarily well accompanied, and many Gentlemen of
the Country, who had come in to him upon the Queens arrival,
still continuing about his person: The day that the Cardinal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
for <hi>Broüage,</hi> the Duke, thinking thereby to pay him a
greater Civility, and respect, follow'd by his Guards, and Friends,
conducted him to his Boat. By which new Complement he so
reviv'd his former Apprehension, that some have since said, the
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:63412:267"/>
Cardinal had a mind to make the world believe, he had avoided
a very eminent danger, by escaping out of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s
hands. The Duke could never perswade himself that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
could have any such apprehension, he being a man of too
great judgment not to see, that had he had any design upon his
person, nothing could have hindred him from the execution of
that design. He had been, without dispute, the strongest in the
Cardinal's Lodgings, when he took the first alarm, and during
the whole time of his stay at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> the favour of the people
being nothing inclin'd to him, his Domesticks alone had not
been able to have made any resistance against those of the Duke,
especially fortified, as he was, by such a number of his Friends of
the Province. It is therefore evident, that the Duke never had
any intention to hurt him, forasmuch as he did not do it: but
he had nevertheless an opinion, (and that opinion was grounded
upon great probabilities) that the Cardina'ls ambitious spirit
was offended to the last degree, that he had not paid the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to his Person, he had done to that of the Queen; and that,
being he could not handsomly publish the true cause of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
he had palliated it with this pretense, to have the more
plausible colour of revenging himself upon the Duke, as upon an
enemy, who had plotted against his life.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal was no sooner got to <hi>Broüage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal arrives at <hi>Broüage.</hi>
                     </note> but that (whether
it was the change of Air, or the joy to see himself in a place of
safety that produc'd this good effect) his health began visibly to
improve; when the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> ignorant as yet of the ill
impressions he had been possess'd withal, concerning his former
Visits, dispatch'd a Gentleman to him to enquire of his
amendment. It was by the return of this Envoy, that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with all the former story, of which the Cardinal <hi>de la
Valette</hi> his Son, who had never departed from Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi>
during the whole time of his sickness, gave him a full accompt.
This suspicion so lightly grounded, and so much contrary to his
intention, did much more offend, than any way incline the Duke
to offer anything in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>his own justification: And although he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well foresaw that a jealousie of this nature, whether feign'd,
or true, threatned him with some great, and sudden mischief; it
was nevertheless so far from rendring him more flexible, or more
complacent, that he chose rather to expose himself to the worst
effects of the Cardinal's unresisted power, than to recede in the
least from his ordinary way of living.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Anno 1633.</note> and the morosity

been said) resolv'd upon at the same time; the reasons of which
disgrace are to this day a secret, though the thing it self was soon
enough publickly known: for the Cardinal had no sooner seen
the King, but that <hi>Chasteau-Neuf</hi> had Orders sent him to retire
to <hi>Ruffee</hi> in <hi>Angoumois,</hi> who being upon his way in Obedience
to that command, a second Order overtook him, by which he
was carried away Prisoner to the Castle of <hi>Angoulesme.</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who stood highly oblig'd to this Gentleman's
friendship, for several acts of Favour in his Affairs, and who
had moreover his Vertue, and Integrity in very great esteem, was
very much afflicted at his misfortune; yet did he even from the
accident it self derive such a consolation, as serv'd very much to
sweeten his discontent. And that was the choice the King had
made of President <hi>Seguier,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">President <hi>Seguier</hi> made <hi>Garde des Sceaux.</hi>

from his first Employments, he had made so advantageous a
judgment, that he conceiv'd there was no advancement how
high soever in his Profession, to which he might not justly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
if his Vertues once came to be sufficiently known. But if
the Duke began the year, with so great an occasion of joy, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
who never suffers the Affairs of this world to continue long
in the same posture, did also not long defer to poyson his content,
by one of the rudest Assaults he had met withal in the whole
course of his life; and since the Archbishop of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> was the
Instrument by which she wrought this disgrace, it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to give a brief accompt of that which kindled their first
Divisions, and the ensuing causes, that occasion'd this last Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
                  <p>This Prelate, Brother to the Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis,</hi> had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

                     </note> and him; not that the Duke
had not this mans merit, which was very great, in high conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
also, he had Wit, Courage, Dexterity, and many other
good qualities, which had formerly acquir'd his esteem: but the
intimacy he had with Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> rendred his friendship
so suspected to him, that he could not confide in a person, he
saw engag'd in so strict a League with another he did not love.
As for the Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis,</hi> who had no such connexion, the
Duke had ever liv'd with him in so perfect an Intelligence, as has
rarely been observ'd, betwixt two persons of so eminent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to have been maintain'd so inviolate, and sincere: Yet was
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:63412:268"/>
it not without the admiration of all that knew their Humours;
they were both in the one, and the other haughty, and fierce,
there was much of fire and ambition, in both their natures;
and little would have serv'd to have kindled a fewd betwixt them:
but perhaps knowing one another to be so Subject to Heat, they
would not interfere, foreseeing that whoever should begin, would
doubtless in his adversary meet with a vigorous Opposition. This
Cardinal had formerly had great Disputes both with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Governours of the Province, which Disputes had
begot him much trouble; so that his more mature, and more
temperate Age, having cool'd the violent Ardours of his more
ungovern'd, and inconsiderate Youth, he began to relish the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of Peace, choosing rather to busie himself about the
well ordering of his Diocess (which he did equally with any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of the Church, about laying Foundations of Monasteries,
Hospitals, and other Actions of great Lustre, and Example, than
to spend his Spirits, and consume his time in fruitless and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Quarrels. The Duke also on the other side, who had his
share of Contention with the Parliament, found himself suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
perplex'd with them, without drawing new inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by forcing a man of the Cardinal's condition to
his Adversaries side; so that as to any thing else, these two Lords
observing a great Correspondency in their Complements, Visits,
and all other Punctilio's of mutual respect, this former conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
serv'd not a little to the continuance of this good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
betwixt them. In fine, whether it were their Interests, or
the sole respect of their common Vertue, that begot this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
they had for one another, it could hardly have been greater:
but after the death of this Cardinal, his Brother having (as has
been said) been promoted to that See, the Duke did not pay him
the same Honour, he had done his elder Brother; who on the
other side impatient of that distinction, joyn'd himself with the
Parliament, at this time high in contest with the Duke, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the interests of that Assembly, with the Credit he had
with the Cardinal (which was very great) procur'd some determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
in their favour, concerning the things so highly contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
betwixt the Duke, and them. In acknowledgment of
these Obligations, the Parliament augmented in his Person the
Honours that had usually been paid to his Predecessors, and the
Duke on the contrary cut off some of those he had formerly paid
even to him himself; an usage which the Archbishop publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting,
oblig'd the Duke (who never engag'd in a quarrel, but
to push it home) to be more obstinately bent, not to give him the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:63412:268"/>
least satisfaction in any of his complaints: So that he still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
not only to use him, as he had begun: but to this abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ceremony, added moreover some disobliging effects.
All this had preceded the Accommodation made at Cardinal <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu</hi>'s
being at <hi>Montauban;</hi> but this Reconciliation having sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
neither the interested persons, nor him who had interpos'd
to reconcile them, they rather remain'd in a disposition to do one
another a Spight upon the first occasion that should present it self,
than to live in the good Intelligence could have been wish'd for
their common repose. Since that time the Duke had been adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd,
that it was principally the Archbishop of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> who had
exasperated the Cardinal against him, and who had rendred his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
at <hi>Bordeaux</hi> (when he went to see him, attended by his Guards)
suspected to him. A thing that had offended him to the last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and he had publickly complain'd of that proceeding (for
his Passions were never conceal'd) which was also reported to the
Archbishop who was at this time oblig'd to come into his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to make some Residence there.</p>
                  <p>He departed therefore from Court, and took the way of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi>
Some have believ'd that it was by the express Order of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Richelieu,</hi> that he undertook this Journey, who having up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the late distastes he had taken at the Duke, summon'd all his
old animosities to his remembrance, had sent the Archbishop of
<hi>Bordeaux,</hi> whom he knew the Duke did not love to brave him,
his spirit being the better known to him, as he had made tryal of
it, upon other occasions, and found it bold, and capable of the
highest resolutions. I shall not however take upon me here to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
my judgment in any of these Transactions; I shall only
report things true, and as they were, without disguise, hatred, or
envy, any of which it would certainly very much mis-become me
to retain after the Duke's death, whose desire it was they might
be buried with him, that being one of the most express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
he gave his Family at the last hour of his Life.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop being upon his way towards <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> turn'd
a little out of the ordinary Road to go into a Territory belonging
to his Bishoprick, call'd <hi>Monravel;</hi> where being arriv'd, he was
inform'd, that one of the Duke's Guards had been assisting in the
execution of some Acts of Justice, wherein he was himself im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n'd, and which would otherwise perhaps have
met with some opposition. He would therefore take this occasion
to send a Gentleman to the Duke, to return his thanks for so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
a kindness: who having found the Duke at <hi>Berdeaux,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> sends to complement the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note>
told him from the Archbishop his Master, <q>That he took the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:63412:269"/>
assistance one of his Guards had given some of his people to
the support of his interests, and in the time of his absence for a
singular favour, and obligation; and that he had therefore
commanded him to come kiss his hands, and to return him his
hearty thanks.</q> Some have drawn a consequence from this way
of proceeding, that the Archbishop did not come with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to offend the Duke, it being unlikely, that had he had any such
intention, he would have sent to him to have sought his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
by the acknowledgment of an obligation receiv'd. others
(and perhaps too critically) have believ'd, that it was only artifice
to make the Duke appear more in fault, and that the Archbishop,
knowing the Duke's humour had made no difficulty in making
this dissembled Application, to the end, that it being rejected, as
he expected it should be, the Duke might be more universally
condemn'd, even when being provok'd, he should break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
just and necessary resentments.</p>
                  <p>Whatever the design of this Complement might be, it was very
ill receiv'd, and so ill, that if the Archbishop had therein any
clandestine end, to extract from it some new cause of offense, he
could hardly better have succeeded. The Duke made answer to
the Gentleman who came from the Archbishop, <q>That thanks
were neither necessary, nor due to a person, who had no design
to oblige: That if any thing by his orders had been perform'd
to his Masters advantage, it had been done upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
than the meer consideration of Justice, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to his Friendship: and so dismiss'd him.</q> The Duke ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
all his people surpriz'd at so slight, and so crude an answer,
to satisfie them in some measure, told them, <q>That they ought
not to wonder if he had made a rude return to the Archbishop's
Complement: That it was without doubt no other than a
feign'd Civility in <hi>Monsieur de Bordeaux,</hi> who he very well knew
did not love him, to seek an advantage against him: That he
would be glad under a colour of seeming Courtesie, to lay a
weakness at his door, and to make the world believe, that he
had first sought his Friendship: That had the Bishop sent to
him by the way of a simple <hi>How d'ee</hi> only, he should have
receiv'd his Visit with the respect due to a man of his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but having added terms of thanks, which presuppos'd a
favour receiv'd, he would not the world should believe, that he
had made the first application to a man he did not take to be
his Friend.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Archbishop might very well judge by this first repulse,
that he should have a very hard game to play with the Duke of
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:63412:269"/>
                     <hi>Espernon,</hi> which made him hover very near a month about
<hi>Bordeaux,</hi> before he could resolve to enter the City. It is most
certain, that in the mean time he sent to Court to acquaint the
Cardinal with what had pass'd betwixt the Duke and him, and
to receive Instructions from him, how he was to behave himself,
if matters should grow to a greater height betwixt them. To
which the Cardinals answer was (as it was a few days after Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd)
that he assur'd him of a powerful Protection, and such a
one as he had promis'd him before his departure; whereupon the
Archbishop made no difficulty to engage in the Affair, to such a
height, as even to be himself the Aggressor, as at the first dash,
by giving the Duke very sensible, and very publick Affronts, he
manifestly appeared to be.</p>
                  <p>The first was, when upon his arrival at the City, he did not
find the Jurats (that is the Magistrates) upon the River, ready
to receive him at his Landing; which he pretended to be a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
due to his Place, and Dignity, as having formerly been
paid him: but the Jurats, who declar'd to have sometimes done
it only upon Courtesie, and without any intention to draw it
into Example, would by no means consent, that what had been
perform'd meerly in the nature of a Civility, should become a
Right. This therefore he would interpret for a hainous offense,
not only from the Jurats, but also from the Duke, who he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
(with some reason) to have been the cause, that Honour had
been deny'd him. So that without longer dissembling his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
the Jurats having deputed two of their Corporation to
Harangue him so soon as he should be alighted at his own Palace,
he answer'd them in these very words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Gentlemen, I have reason at my arrival to be satisfied with
the people of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> who have behav'd themselves civilly
towards me; and I look upon it as a continuation of the good
affection, they have formerly had for the late Cardinal <hi>de Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi>
my Brother: but I have reason to be dissatisfied with the
Magistrates of your City, and cannot but believe, that if those,
who put the words you have deliver'd me into your mouths,
had given you leave to pay me the respect you ought to have
done, you would have done it after the accustomed manner,
and in the usual place: but by having made your selves slaves
to your Offices, and by having forfeited your Liberties in so
doing, you have committed this neglect. I must needs think
this proceeding would have been against the sense of the People,
might they have been allow'd the freedom of their Voices, and
consequently can take nothing ill from them: and as to your
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:63412:270"/>
particular, I shall also pardon you; forasmuch as I know what
you have done, was by the Instigation of others, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your own account.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was too evidently glanc'd at in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
to be insensible of the Injury was done him, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
sought nothing more than an occasion wherein to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
his Resentment. It was nevertheless contrary to the advice of
all the Friends and Servants he had about him, that he took up
that Resolution; there being none of them who did not very
well foresee, that having to do with a man of the Archbishops
condition, and upheld as he was, by the most powerful Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Kingdom, he must of necessity put his Affairs into
very great disorder.</p>
                  <p>I would omit nothing of what pass'd upon this occasion, this
being the first occurrence whereby the Duke's Fortune was really
wounded; the others that had pass'd before had only rippled up
the skin, and hitherto he had bravely overcome all the difficulties
had been oppos'd against him. Since therefore the Scene is now
to be chang'd, and that a new prospect of his Affairs will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to your view, it should not methinks be impertinent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
every Circumstance, that contributed to this Alteration: but
on the other side I must, in being so particular, descend to such
little things, as I fear will importune my Reader. I shall however
do the best I can to avoid that inconvenience, by touching at
every thing; but with so much brevity, as shall be no durable
penance, even to those who are least delighted with such recitals.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, nettled to the quick with the Archbishops Speech
to the Jurats, began rather by trifling Peccadillo's, than by down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Injury to manifest his resentment: for it must needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd,
that never man was more ingenious than he, to offend
such as he did not love; so that he set all Engines on work, little
Affronts, as well as high Abuses, and spar'd nothing that might
any way contribute to his Revenge. Having therefore found the
Archbishop so sensible of this first Assault, he persisted to wound
him deeper by new and more legible Offenses. He had in proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Puipaulin,</hi> the Royalty of the <hi>Clie</hi>
of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> (which is the Fish-Market there) so as that he might
lawfully forbid the entrance thereinto to any, he had no mind to
admit: He therefore commanded the Archbishops Officers one
Fish-day to be excluded, to the end they might be necessitated to
take their Fish without the Bar, with the rest of the people.
These men refused to receive it after that manner, and otherwise
they could not have it; neither was the Duke content with doing
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:63412:270"/>
this alone; but, knowing it would be brought in from other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
caus'd his Guards moreover to watch all the avenues to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it; by whom some were turn'd back, who would have done
the Archbishop that Service, and in the end some of his own
Domesticks very roughtly handled.</p>
                  <p>Upon this occasion it was, that the clandestine Animosities,
they had hitherto in some measure smother'd in their Bosoms,
flam'd out to an open Feud betwixt them; and from this begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all the Disorders we shall hereafter see ensue, took their rise
and being. The Archbishop by Publick Declarations complain'd
of the Violence had been offer'd to him by a sort of men set on
purposely to do it, describing them by the name of the Russet
Cassocks, which was the Duke's Livery; demanding of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
protection, and assistance to oppose them, and protesting
to Retire with his Clergy, if they would not provide for his Safety.
Whilst the Archbishop was thus busie to vindicate himself by
Forms of Law, the Duke, conceiving it very unbecoming the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
he had in the Province, to proceed by the same ways, would
try to do his business by other means: He therefore commanded
the Lieutenant of his Guards, the next day after the Archbishop
had exhibited this injurious Bill, against his Guards, to go with all
his Souldiers to present himself before him, and to ask of him,
If amongst all those he knew any one man who was likely to
commit an unhandsome action? The Lieutenant did as he was
commanded, and waited near to the Archbishop Palace his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the City; when seeing him come in his Coach, he
presented himself to speak to him: It was about Dinner time,
when the Archbishop seeing so many Souldiers attending the
Lieutenant, and not imagining they could come after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
for any civil end, he commanded his Coach-man to drive on.
The Lieutenant was still earnest with him, and (with his Hat
nevertheless in his hand) beseeches the Archbishop he would be
pleas'd to hear him; assuring him withal he had nothing to say,
that could any way offend him: but all was in vain, the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was still call'd to to drive on; when the Lieutenant fearing
to lose the opportunity of executing what he had in charge (and
having on the other side not much studied the<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Siquis suadente Diabolo,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Canon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
so many persons by this Contest have since been made perfect)
call'd in the end to one of his Companions to lay hold of the
Reins, and to stop the Horses: which being accordingly done,
the Archbishop came immediately out of his Coach, crying out
there was violence offer'd to his person, and so retir'd himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his house.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="514" facs="tcp:63412:271"/>The Duke, inform'd by the Lieutenant of his Guards how all
things had pass'd, perceiv'd by the manner of it, that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
had been put into a terrible fright; which was the only
thing he had intended, and so turn'd the whole business into
Mirth, and Laughter. But the Archbishop did not so; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on the contrary the afternoon of that very same day, being
the 29<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> summon'd in all the Orders, and Societies of
Ecclesiasticks in the City, he there expos'd before them the open
Violence he pretended had been offer'd to him, rendring the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as foul as he could possibly make it, and omitting nothing he
thought would conduce to the interessing the whole Body of the
Clergy in his Quarrel. Wherein he succeeded so well, that at
the very instant most of the Assistants, fir'd by his Eloquence,
concluded upon an Excommunication; some notwithstanding
there were, more moderate than the rest, who a little allaying
the fury of this first Sentence, perswaded them in the end to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
upon a Deputation to the Duke, to complain to him of the
ill usage their Prelate had receiv'd since his arrival, and therein
chiefly of the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>olence committed by the Lieutenant of his
Guards, and to demand his Justice.</p>
                  <p>This Complaint was preferr'd to the Duke the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi>
at which he was a little surpriz'd; and now better considering
what this Affair, by the interest all the Ecclesiasticks would take in
it, might produce; would, it was conceiv'd, have been glad that
things might have continued in the same posture they then were,
without running on into greater extremes; neither would he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the suddain return any precise Ans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er. He therefore told the
Canon, who had been deputed to him in the behalf of the whole
Clergy: <q>That the Speech he had made to him consisted of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Heads of great importance: That he was old, and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
so ill, that it would be hard for him to remember all he
had said: That he therefore desir'd he might have it in writing,
and that then he would consider of it, and return his Answer in
writing also.</q> The Duke thought that during this respit he
desir'd, the Archbishop would suspend the Publication of his
Censures, and that in the mean time, what had pass'd might by
the mediation of Friends, in some amicable Treaty be hush'd, and
taken up: but he did not in his Adversary meet with a spirit so
flexible to an Accommodation, who on the contrary was so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
deaf to all overtures of Agreement, that upon <hi>All-Saints</hi>
day he thundred out his Excommunication against the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

himself in all haste to <hi>Bordeaux;</hi> but notwithstanding all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
he could use, the Animo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t in vain.</note> shuffled
matters into so strange a confusion, that it was utterly impossible
to find out any way to compose them.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> exasperated to the last degree, that the
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:63412:272"/>
little respit he had so modestly desir'd, should be denyed him, and
to find that the Archbishop would not a little bend by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
from that time forward excluded all thoughts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
and for the future only meditated how no settle his
Conscience in repose, by paying the respect, and submission that
was due to the Church. To this end therefore he call'd an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of several Learned Divines in his own House, to consult
about the Excommunication had been pronounc'd against the
Lieutenant of his Guards, and implicitely against himself. In
this Debate there were very few who did not conclude it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
groundless; of particular Opinions therefore they drew up a
Publick Act, which being subscribed by all the Doctors, to the
number of more than thirty, was publish'd throughout the City,
to the end, they said, that all Scandal and Scruple might be taken
away, which the Archbishops Excommunication might have
rais'd, and begot in the minds of the people.</p>
                  <p>But that which was design'd for so good an end, produc'd, as
we shall see, a very different effect. Amongst the Doctors, the
Duke had Assembled, there were several Religious, and other
Ecclesiasticks, who were under the Archbishops Jurisdiction;
this Prelate therefore being strangely incens'd, to be abandoned
by his own Party, in a Cause wherein the Church was so highly
concern'd, and impatient to have the Lye given him, by those
very men, by whose advice (or the greatest part of them at least)
he had Publish'd his Censures, would once more call them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
his design therein being either to make them retract from
what they had subscribed to in the Duke's favour, or to punish
them for having submitted themselves to a Secular Power. He
therefore cited them to appear before him, by the publication of
an Ordinance, bearing date the 10<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> day of <hi>November</hi> 1633.</p>
                  <p>The Doctors, surpriz'd at this citation, were very much afraid
of their Metropolitan's Indignation, and some severe Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that would be inflicted on them. This apprehension made
them fly to the Duke's Protection, who, to secure them, the same
day issued out another Ordinance, wherein he prohibited all sorts
of persons, of what quality, condition, or profession soever, to
meet in an extraordinary Assembly, either in the Archbishops Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
or elsewhere, without his especial Licence; excepting ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
the Religious, and Ecclesiasticks immediately belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Archbishop's Congregation, and whose Councils he
customarily made use of, for the better ordering the Discipline of
his Diocess. The Doctors, not yet believing themselves sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
secur'd by this Edict, entreated the Duke that he would more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:63412:272"/>
place the Archers of the Watch of the City upon all the
Avenues, and Gates of the Archbishops Palace, to hinder such as
would pretend to obey the Bishops Summons. A request the
Duke as readily granted, conceiving himself so far oblig'd in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to protect them, that whatsoever could be represented to
him, to hinder that determination, the consequences whereof,
were in all probability like to be exceedingly untoward, it was
notwithstanding, impossible to divert him.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop had no sooner notice, that the Captain of
the Watch, with his Archers, had planted himself at his Gates;
but that immediately putting on his Pontifical Robes, and causing
himself to be follow'd by some Ecclesiasticks, together with
what people he had about him, he went on foot out of the House,
crying out in the Streets as he pass'd along, <hi>To me my people, there is
no more Liberty for the Church.</hi> In this posture he went to several
Religious Houses of the City, gathering after him a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of people (who ran from all parts to the Novelty) as he went
along, and in the end return'd back towards his own Palace,
without effecting any thing more, or being able to raise any
Commotion in the City.</p>
                  <p>Whilst all these things were in doing, the Duke was at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins,
in one of the remotest parts of the City, where
having news brought him by two Presidents of the Parliament
of what had pass'd, and of the danger there was, lest the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
should stir up any Mutiny to the prejudice of the common
Safety; he was at last by them intreated to interpose his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Wisdom, for the conservation of the Publick Peace. In
the heat therefore this sudden intelligence had put him into, the
Duke speedily mounted his Coach, commanding they should
drive that way he heard the Archbishop was gone. He had in
company with him the <hi>Count de Maillé,</hi> and the Commendator
<hi>de la Iustice,</hi> both of them men of very eminent Vertue, and in
whom he had a particular confidence: but in this sudden passion
their Counsels could by no means prevail. The Duke made his
Coach-man still drive on, and through all, till he came near the
Archbishops Palace, whither he heard he was upon his return,
and where he overtook him. The Bishop thus overtaken, still
continued on his pace, when the Duke having staid him by the
Arm, and demanded of him by what Authority he stirr'd up
this Commotion in his Government, he was by the Archbishop
interrupted, who cry'd out aloud, <hi>Strike Tyrant, thy blows will be to
me Flowers, and Roses, thou art Excommunicated.</hi> In the heat of this
bustle, the Duke catching him by the hand, lifted it up twice, or
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:63412:273"/>
thrice, and set it against his Breast: but in the end, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
still provoking him with injurious Language, and with his
Hat on, the Duke with a Cane he had in his hand, touch'd the
Brim of his Hat, and thrust it off his head to the ground, telling
him at the same time, he did not know the respect he ought him;
but if the Reverence to his Profession did not restrain him, he
would make him know it. Something worse might perhaps have
pass'd, had not the <hi>Count de Maillé,</hi> and the <hi>Commendator de la Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
interpos'd, who stepping in betwixt them, put an end to this
untoward bustle, very much unbecoming both the one, and the
other.</p>
                  <p>After this action had thus pass'd, the Duke return'd to his own
House, and although he very well knew no good issue could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, manifested notwithstanding no shew of apprehension,
or repentance, discoursing of it with his Friends (who were more
in suspense than he himself appear'd to be, of what would be the
event) as of a thing of an indifferent nature, and a just resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an Affair wherein his Honour was concern'd. The
Archbishop was no sooner disingag'd from the Duke, but that
he fortwith repair'd to his Church, where he pronounc'd his
Sentence of Excommunication,<note place="margin">The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication pronounced against the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> both against him, and all those
who had been in company with him, prohibiting Divine Service
in all the Churches of the City, and also in that of <hi>Cadillac,</hi> by a
publick Act, I shall forbear to Copy in this place, that I may not
importune my Reader.</p>
                  <p>This first Spiritual Thunder-bolt having been darted by the
Archbishop, he had moreover recourse to the Temporal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
very well foreseeing, that if that did not justifie the Blow he
had already levell'd at the Duke, it would be no very hard matter
for him to evade it, and to frustrate any mortal effect by very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
and powerful Reasons. He sent away a dispatch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to Court, wherein he gave Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> an account of
the Violence had been offer'd to him; at which the Cardinal was
so highly incens'd that nothing now had power to appease him.
He therefore talk'd no more of attempting an Accommodation,
<hi>Villemontée's</hi> Commission (who had been sent away upon their
first difference to that purpose) was at an end, even before he
could arrive at the place; so that nothing now was thought of,
save how by the Kings Authority to enquire into the Riots con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Archbishops Complaint: and his Majesty as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
and eldest Son of the Church, was counsell'd by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
(particularly concern'd in the Affair, by the interest of his
profession, which he would render inviolable) to make a signal
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:63412:273"/>
example of his Piety and Justice, in the Person of the Duke of
<hi>Espernon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is believ'd, that if the Duke had taken the same course, the
Archbishop did, and had sent to Court in time to give his
Reasons for what he had done, he had infinitely discredited his
Adversaries Cause; but it was for some days impossible to prevail
with him to do it. He still carried on the business with the same
indifferency, saying to such as urg'd him to that course (with a
generosity something out of season at this time) <q>That he was
not to give an account of his Actions to any, but the King
himself, which he was ready to do when-ever his Majesty
should please to call him to it: That he very willingly gave the
start to such, as were diffident either of themselves, or their
Cause; and that he had done nothing, but what he ought to
do, for the maintenance of the King's Authority entrusted with
him.</q> So that carrying himself at the same careless rate, it is
not to be imagined how much he fortified his Enemies side by
his own negligence, nor how many advantages he gave him,
which he would otherwise perhaps never have obtain'd, had not
he himself contributed to them.</p>
                  <p>In the end notwithstanding for fashions sake, he dispatch'd
away one of the Souldiers of his Guards to Court, but it was not
of four days after the bustle; and then he did it after such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as made it appear it was rather out of complacency to his
Friends, who were importunate with him to that effect, than
out of any respect to his own Interests. His Sons, who before
this Courriers arrival knew not what to oppose to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

                     </note> The Parliament
there had taken cognizance of the Quarrel, and though the Duke
had several very good Friends in that Assembly, yet the number
of those who were not so prevailing, and the news that came
every day from Court, to the Duke's disadvantage, having given
mens minds very ill impressions of the success of his Affairs; the
Company could not be disswaded from sending a Deputation to
the Archbishop, to let him know how highly they interested
themselves in his Offense, and to make him a tender of all the
good Offices, they were capable to do him upon this occasion.
After which, from Offers, going on to Effects, they began to fall
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:63412:274"/>
to fall to work, about drawing up an Information against the
Duke, and notwithstanding he made several Protestations to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
from the Parliament, as a Court prohibited in all his Causes,
nothing could stop the Torrent of their proceeding; but they
would perfect what they had begun, as they did, and so exactly
for the Court Palat, that they would hear talk of no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Villemontée,</hi> who had heard nothing before his departure of this

to him, by having been represented for a great Creature of
the Cardinals, and that was consequently like to be very partial
to the Archbishops side; but the Duke, having at their first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
found him much more sway'd by his Duty, than all
other Respects, he made no difficulty to repose his entire Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in this man's Vertue, and to give him a full account of the
whole action, to the end that he might draw up his answer in due
Form of Law,<note place="margin">The Duke Signs his Answer, wherein he gives a true Relation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

every thing that had pass'd to be laid open at length, and without

it; and although it was often represented to him, by very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>standing
men, that so ingenious a Confession was not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in an occasion wherein he saw his Adversaries prosecute with
so much heat, and that in this case, his single Confession would
more prejudice his Cause, than the Depositions of all the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
could be produc'd against him; yet those Remonstrances
were not of force to disswade him, he sma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tly replying: That
he had not done an action to disavow it, and that whatever the
issue might be, it would be much more supportable to him, than
the shame of being reduc'd to the necessity of disowning any Act
of his life. It was in truth upon this single confession of the Duke's,
after the Parliaments Information had been sufficiently canvas'd,
that the Cardinal pronounc'd the Excommunication to be valid,
and right; and that the King was oblig'd both in Equity, and
Honour, to repair the Injury committed by one of his Officers of
that condition, against the Person, and Dignity of a Prelate,
and the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>The first reparation was a command the Duke received

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Friends at Court, being inform'd of
the severe contents of this Dispatch, were not a little in doubt
after what manner he would receive it. They fear'd his great
Spirit, full of those generous Maxims, which had for so many
years, and in so many froward occurrences supported his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Fortune, would with great difficulty submit to Laws,
so different from what they had been in former times. Amongst
these the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> (a man as well read in the Court,
as any whatever of his time) upon this occasion laid aside the
complacency of a Son, to assume the austerity of a faithful Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
and writ to him to this effect, <q>That he did beseech him to
look upon this Affair, as one of the greatest Difficulty and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
he had met withal in the whole course of his life:
That to avoid any inconveniences might befal him, he must
immediately submit to the King's Pleasure, and Command, and
refer the business wholly, and without reservation to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
which was the only way to put a good end to this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</q>
                     <hi>Monsieur de Seguier Garde des Sceaux,</hi> the Duke's inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
friend, and a man that appeared more for his Interest, than
the condition of the time seem'd conveniently to permit, did the
same, writing him word, <q>That a prompt and absolute Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
was the only way whereby a cause, his Enemies Favour
rendred generally disapprov'd, might be brought to a success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
issue; but that without that, it was utterly impossible for
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:63412:275"/>
his Friends, and Servants, to do him those Offices were necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the bringing of matters to any tolerable conclusion.</q> All
the Duke's other Friends having confirm'd the same thing, he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
saw, that he must of necessity obey; yet was it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
an incredible violence upon his own Humour, and great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
He had at other times resisted the greatest powers of the State,
when arm'd against him with the King's Authority, and Forces,
whereas now he saw himself reduc'd to submit to four lines of
Paper; they made him indeed to depart out of his Government:
And though it be true, that in these latter Times, the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
was rais'd to a more illustrious height, than formerly it
had ever been; yet I do not know that any one has observ'd a
greater example of his Power, than upon this occasion. All
<hi>France</hi> acknowledg'd the Duke, for the eminent qualities he was
master of, to be a man of the greatest Reputation of his Age;
he was possess'd of the greatest, and most important Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Kingdom, powerful in Riches, Commands, Places,
Servants, and much more in his Children. His three Sons had all
of them great Offices, and great Employments, and yet with all
these advantages he was not able to resist four words; and then
it was, that he plainly saw a Subject had no way to support him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his Fortune, and Reputation, but by Obedience; and that
the Power of a King, manag'd as it ought to be, can meet no
difficulties, nor impediments, it cannot easily master, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
He had seen a time, when by making a shew of Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Discontent, men had sometimes obtain'd part of what
they desir'd, or at least defended themselves from what they had
not a mind to do. Under the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the III, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Factions, which then divided the State, had so weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Authority of the Sovereign, that he durst scarce pretend to
more than a voluntary Submission from his People: And <hi>Henry</hi>
the Great his Successor, by an excess of Bounty and good Nature,
had continued to do, what the other had been constrain'd to by
inevitable Necessity. This Mighty Prince was of so noble a Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that he would destroy none; so that, excepting the <hi>Mareschal
de Biron,</hi> who would have no compassion of himself, almost all
the great men of the Kingdom, were either actually Rebels, or
highly Disobedient, without ever feeling either the Sword, or so
much as the Hand of Justice. The Regency of Queen <hi>Mary de
Medici,</hi> was equally moderate, and gentle, and the Tempests that
arose in her time, being appeas'd with money, men did not only
offend securely, but made moreover a profit of their Crimes.
The <hi>Mareschald' Encre</hi> try'd to change those milder into rougher
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:63412:275"/>
Maxims; but he lost himself in the practice of this premature se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.
In the Ministry of the Duke <hi>de Luines,</hi> there was no more
of violence, than in the preceding Reigns: the good success not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Royal Arms, always had in all Enterprizes, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of his favour, made it plain, that there was nothing
his Majesty could not with great facility effect in his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
He had with great ease supprest the Queen Mothers Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
he had invaded the Party of the Religion with very
great success, wherein having found their weakness by their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
amongst themselves, he was by that discovery encourag'd
to undertake their total ruine; and the Cardinal entring into the
Ministry in so favourable a juncture of Affairs, press'd the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Faction so home, that in a very short time he remov'd all
Obstacles, which could any ways oppose the Royal Authority,
or impede the establishment of his own. The Party of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was totally suppress'd, the House of <hi>Austria</hi> infinitely
weakened; all the other Princes who were ill affected to the
Crown, reduc'd to a necessity of complying with whatsoever
was impos'd upon them; and those of the Nobility who were so
bold, as to oppose the King's will, had been so roughly handled,
that not a man durst any more expose himself to the punishment
they all knew would inevitably follow the least forfeiture of their
Duty. It had been but of very late years, that this new form of
Government had been introduc'd into the Kingdom, and the
Duke was grown old in the practice of other Maxims: It is
not then to be doubted, but that it must needs be with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy,
and unwillingness, that he could Accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to a thing so unusual and severe; he did notwithstanding
do it, and without delaying time, or spending any more than
was requisite for the making of some few Visits, and taking leave
of his Friends, he departed out of his Government, suspended
from his Functions, Excommunicated from the Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to the conversation of his own Domesticks only. Though
in a condition so different from what it had formerly been, and
so contrary to his ordinary way of living, he could not but be
very much afflicted, he nevertheless so well conceal'd his grief, that
he was not observ'd to be either more melancholy, or dejected,
than at other times; and he had so great a command over his
own passions, as not to utter so much as one word unbecoming
either his courage, or his piety, ever retaining in all things the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Reverence due to the Holy Church.</p>
                  <p>So oft as any one writ him word from <hi>Paris,</hi> that his Friends
could have wish'd he had retain'd a greater moderation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:63412:276"/>
towards the person of a Prelate, he would still maintain,
<q>That in repelling an injury done to the Royal Power, he had
done no more than it was his Duty to do: That the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
might prostitute his Authority as he pleased; but that as
for him who was oblig'd in his Majesties Right to maintain all
the Priviledges of his Command; he neither could, nor ought
to have done otherwise, than he did, and that he would ever do
it, though he was thereby certain to forfeit, not only his Offices,
and his Estate, but also his Life.</q>

his Excommunication, though he wanted not the advice of

and unjust; wherein his submission appear'd to all so much the
more to be commended, in that he was willing to undergo the
punishment of an Offense, he was not convinc'd he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Thus banish'd to a Countrey House, where his only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
should have been to have convers'd with his God, even
there also the doors of his Church were bolted against him; so
that he assisted no more at Masses as he had formerly ever done;<note place="margin">And sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the Church.</note>
he moreover deprived himself of the participation of all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:
but he omitted nothing withal that might any ways
serve to manifest his respect to the Holy Church, and her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
He made all the Protestations that could be prevailing to
the vindication of the integrity of his Obedience, and to that
purpose sent away an express dispatch to Cardinal <hi>Bichi,</hi> the Pope's
Nuntio in <hi>France;</hi> he sent also to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where he knew the
Archbishop of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> had call'd together an Assembly of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
to make the same Declarations; but it was all in vain: and
it was decreed he should undergo all, and all the severest Forms
of Penance, before he should receive his Absolution.</p>
                  <p>But as the Spiritual Authority was not arm'd against him alone,
and that it was not that (though he had it in the highest reverence)
he had the greatest reason to apprehend; it was also necessary for
him to employ his principal care, and endeavour, to divert the
Fury of the Royal Power, which was already display'd against
him.<note place="margin">The D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Commissioners his Majesty had made him hope for in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
might be sent away, that by the return of their Report,
his Majesty might be fully inform'd of the truth of his Actions:
but after the Information of the Parliament of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> which
was altogether favourable to the Archbishop, the Court had no
ear left open, either to his Prayers, or Complaints; and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:63412:276"/>
having solemnly espous'd the Quarrel, and made it his own,
was so far from permitting the Duke's Friends to dispute his
Will with their best Arguments, and Reasons, that he would not
so much as endure any one should dare to propose them.</p>
                  <p>How great soever the Cardinal's passion was herein, or how
great soever his Credit with the King, they were not however
such as could hinder the Duke, and the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> from
paying (with equal Generosity, and good Nature) the respect
which by all sorts of Obligation, they so justly ow'd to the Duke
their Father. The first of which had no sooner notice of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
his Father had with the Archbishop, but that he departed
from <hi>Metz,</hi> to come first to Court, there to observe the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of things, and from thence to go to <hi>Plassac,</hi> either to comfort
the Duke his Father in his Affliction; or to give him his best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in his Affairs. As for the Cardinal his Brother, what depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
soever he had at Court, he very often expos'd all that Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
to perform his Duty, and so far as to engage sometimes in
so hot Disputes with the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> that it was often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
they would never again be so fully reconcil'd, that there
would not still remain a Core in the bosom of the one or the
other.</p>
                  <p>So soon as the Archbishop had got his Information perfected,<note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> goes to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </note>
and so well to his liking, that he conceiv'd his proofs could admit
of no Dispute, he departed from <hi>Bordeaux</hi> to go to <hi>Paris. Plassac</hi>
the place to which the Duke was retir'd, was in truth in his way,
but not so, that he might not without any inconvenience have
balk'd it; and all the world believ'd he would have been so civil
to the Dukes Disgrace as to have done it: he did not nevertheless,
but on the contrary, pass'd along by the Park Wall after so bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a manner, that he made the noise of his Equipage rattle
against the very Walls of the Duke's House. And then indeed it
was, that the Duke felt himself most sensibly wounded, and that this
Bravado had like to have transported him to something that might
have made the Archbishop's Cause better than it was, by offering
to him some signal Violence. I was my self a witness how much
ado he had to forbear; but his Friends and Servants representing
to him the importance of the Action he was about, he in the end
gave way to their Reason, though I do believe with the greatest
violence he committed upon himself, and his great Spirit, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole progress of this troublesome Affair.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop was no sooner arriv'd at Court,<note place="margin">Anno 1634.</note> but that all
the Prelates, who were then in <hi>Paris,</hi> assembled after an unusual
manner, to deliberate amongst themselves what was best to be
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:63412:277"/>
done in the bebalf of their Brother; which Convocation the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had no sooner notice of; but continuing to do,
as he had formerly done, he sent to them his Protestations of an
absolute submission to the Holy Church. The Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi>
therefore, who was return'd back to Court, demanded Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the Assembly, in the name of the Duke his Father; which
being granted, he there laid down his Reasons before them, with
so much efficacy, and elocution, that of five and twenty Prelates
who were there present, thirteen were of opinion to take upon
them the quality of Judges, under the good pleasure of the Pope,
and the King, the Duke having absolutely submitted himself to
their Determination: but this resolution was not for the gust of
the Court; by this way the business would have been too soon
decided, and it was resolv'd the Duke should pay much dearer
for his re-establishment in his Offices and Commands. The next
day therefore what had been agreed upon the day before, was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
overthrown, and <hi>Messieurs</hi> the Prelates would by no means
accept the high degree of Judges, the Duke had so submissively
offer'd, but would humble themselves to the qualities of simple
Parties only. They assembled then again at the Archbishop of
<hi>Bordeaux</hi> his Palace, and from thence sent a Deputation to the
King, wherein the Archbishop of <hi>Arles</hi> was to speak for the rest.
All that (they say) was observable in the Bishop's Oration, was
only an excessive vehemency; in the heat whereof he made use of
all the odious terms he could invent, to allure his Majesties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
and to possess him with the highest sense of the Duke's
Misdemeanour. Upon which occasion it was that <hi>Caspian</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Nantes,</hi> one of the greatest, and most vertuous Prelates of his
time, cry'd out, <hi>
                        <q>That if it were possible for the Devil to submit
himself to God Almighty, to such a degree as the Duke did, he would
infallibly obtain pardon for all his Offenses; and that notwithstanding
the Church deny'd this Pardon to a Christian, who had ever serv'd
God and his Church.</q>
                     </hi> But neither this true Remonstrance, nor
any other whatsoever that could be offer'd in the Duke's behalf,
could produce any good effect to the composing of this Affair.</p>
                  <p>He had very good intelligence of all the Severity was practis'd
to his prejudice; for although the greatest Powers were declar'd
against him, he had notwithstanding friends in the Assembly, that
were sway'd by no other consideration, save only the pure interest
of Piety and Justice. Of this number were the Archbishops of
<hi>Sens,</hi> and of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Nantes;</hi> before mention'd,
that of <hi>Mans,</hi> of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> and some others. These Prelates ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
by the whole Kingdom for men of great Merit, and
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:63412:277"/>
Example, no sooner had intelligence of what the rest of their
Order were contriving against the Duke, but that they came in
all haste to <hi>Paris,</hi> to do him all the good Offices, the condition
of the time would permit: but there was an over ruling power,
that rendred all their endeavours fruitless; so that after having
long sustain'd the Torrent of Authority, that opposed their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
they were constrain'd at last to give way to force, that ever
gives the Law to the best Arguments.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Complaints of the Clergy preferr'd to the King, by
the mouth of the Archbishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> his Majesty commanded
that the Informations of the Parliament of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> should be
put into the hands of <hi>Lauzon,</hi> Master of Requests, to make his
Report. <hi>Villemontée,</hi> who was also at the same time at Court, was
likewise order'd to give in his Answer; after which, and that the
Depositions of the Witnesses, had been sufficiently canvas'd, the
Cardinal, who was present at the Council, was of opinion,
<q>That upon the Duke's single Confession contain'd in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,<note place="margin">A Sentence against the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                        </note>
he ought to be reputed Excommunicate, and as so, that the
King ought to declare him laps'd from all his Offices, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
till by vertue of his Absolution he should be re-united
to the Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the King's Sentences were by the Duke himself obey'd
with all manner of submission; his Friends, and Servants never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
did not forbear, even in the face of the Court, with many
powerful Arguments to move for his <hi>Quietus est;</hi> of which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
there were enow of themselves, to make an entire Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn:
but I have nothing to do to transcribe them here, both in
regard they were of no advantage to the Duke at that time, and
that his intention remains sufficiently justified, by his Respect,
and Submissions to the Church. The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> fail'd
not however to urge, and dispute those Reasons, as he had ever
done; but not having been able to prevail, that the Clergy might
themselves be Judges of his Father's Cause; nor that the King
would please to take off the punishment he had impos'd upon
him, till after he should be absolv'd; The Duke was constrain'd
to apply himself to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> first to obtain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of his Conscience, and after his Restauration to his Offices,
and Commands.</p>
                  <p>His Secretary was therefore dismiss'd from <hi>Plassac</hi> to go to
<hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke sends a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch to <hi>Rome</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</note> furnish'd with several Dispatches directed to several of the
principal persons of that Court. The Duke's name, famous in
all parts of Europe, was with his Holiness in very great esteem;
he had had the honour to be acquainted with him in the time of
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:63412:278"/>
his Nuntiature in <hi>France,</hi> and he was then reputed no ill Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
His Holiness therefore very graciously receiv'd his Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and, contrary to the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>stom of that Court, where delays
are very usual (chiefly when the Authority of the Apostolick See
in any Debate of Consequence, is concern'd) cutting off a great
many of the tedious Forms, caus'd the Expeditions necessary for
the Duke's satisfaction to be dispatch'd, and sent them away to
Cardinal <hi>Bichi,</hi> his Nuntio in <hi>France.</hi> So that, had the Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time had less dependence upon
those of <hi>France,</hi> the Duke had from thence obtain'd a speedy, and
full satisfaction. But so many rubs were on this side the <hi>Alpes</hi> laid
in the way, that four whole months were laps'd, before the Duke
could receive his Absolution, which when it came, was no other
neither than, <hi>Ad Reincidentiam,</hi> a term us'd by those who treat of
such matters, when it is not a plenary Absolution.</p>
                  <p>Who is it that, reading the progress of this Dispute, but must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
that a little Complement ill receiv'd, and a few words ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
should grow to be one of the most important Affairs of
two of the greatest Courts of Europe? I was very unwilling to
have been so tedious in being so particular: but others having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
it so as they knew would please the Great Ones of that time,
who were no Friends to the Duke, I thought my self oblig'd to
render here an account of things as they truly pass'd: which if
it will not here absolutely excuse the Duke for being in his sudden
passion too violently transported against an Ecclesiastical Person,
it will at least serve to manifest the respect he bore to the Church,
and to a Dignity he ever had in the highest Reverence, and
Esteem.</p>
                  <p>From this time forward the Duke's Affairs began to appear
with a much better face at Court,<note place="margin">The Duke's Affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter face.</note> his Sons having by their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and discretion so moderated Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s heat, that
nothing remain'd to do, save only how to contrive a durable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
and from this breach (as it often falls out) to derive
an occasion of inseparably uniting their two Families The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
notwithstanding would first have his Will: he had (as has
been said) in the Year 1632. desir'd that the Duke would demise
his Government of <hi>Metz</hi> in his favour; wherein, having not
met with that complacency he expected, he must now be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Neither would promises serve the turn, the laying down
the Government of this place must also precede the Absolution,
the Cardinal being by no means to be perswaded to consent, that
the Duke should be allow'd to be a Christian to God, and his
Church, whilst he continued a Rebel to him. Yet was it not
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:63412:278"/>
nevertheless at this time to make any private advantage of this
Demission, he had alter'd that design; and the possession of <hi>Metz</hi>
seeming to be superfluous, in the assurance he had of the King's
Favour, which he thought he had absolutely acquir'd by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of his Service, the sole end, he could in all apparence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to himself herein, was, to let the world see, that no one
was thenceforward to contend with him, and by an example of
this nature to establish his Authority over all the other great men
of the Kingdom. The place however only chang'd the hand
without going out of the Family, it being transferr'd to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>de la Valette;</hi>

by a Marriage wholly to piece up, what the late Disorders had
disunited. And then it was that they began in good earnest to
treat about a plenary Absolution, of the satisfactions were to be
made to the Church, and other things that were of course to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
the Duke's Restauration to his Offices, and Commands.</p>
                  <p>But before I proceed to the conclusion of this Affair, it will
not I conceive be impertinent, to give an account of two passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which will render the Duke's constancy, and generosity high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considerable, even in the greatest cloud of his Disgrace; the
first whereof was this. In the time that the Court Persecutions
were most violent against the Duke, many of his Enemies, both
of the Parliament of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and other parts of the Province,
out of a vanity of Generosity, would needs offer themselves to
be reconcil'd to him, believing that in such a time of affliction
he would be more flexible to an Accommodation, and that seeing
how many Enemies he had to deal withal, he would be glad to
leslen their number; at least they doubted not but he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
into his Favour, and good Opinion, those who in so malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
a Juncture should, out of the sole respect to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Vertue, offer their Service to him: but he on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
apprehending, that to appear facile to Reconciliations in a
time of disgrace, would be interpreted weakness, and want of
Spirit, sent them word, <q>That he could not deny his Friendship
to such as should desire it of him, in a time when he should be
in a capacity to oblige them; but that he would never recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
himself to receive any good Offices from any, who had not
been his Friends.</q> And he remain'd so constant to this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he was never to be perswaded to alter it, what prudent
considerations soever could be laid before him to that effect.</p>
                  <p>The other thing was a Proposition made to him by a Letter
from <hi>Paris,</hi> writ by an unknown hand, Seal'd with an unknown
Seal, and without Superscription. In this Letter there was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:63412:279"/>
to him an infallible way to cut off Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi>
his worst, and implacable Enemy, and bent to his ruine (which
were the express terms of the Letter.) He who was the Author of
this design deliver'd himself to be a Gentleman of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and an
Engineer; who for this piece of Service would demand no more,
but six hundred Pistols only, three hundred in hand, and the rest
when he had done his business. The Duke had the very thought
of so great a wickedness in the greatest horror, and detestation;
and what cause soever of unkindness, or offense he might have
against the Cardinal, he had his person notwithstanding in very
great esteem; which had it been less, or that his Animosity had
been greater, it is most certain, that he would never have chosen
so base a way to his Revenge. He therefore burnt the Letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speaking a word of it to any, save one of his Domesticks on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though the Proposition was thrice repeated. The Servant the
Duke was pleas'd to entrust with this secret, observing with what
obstinacy the Villain persever'd in his damnable resolution, did
very rightly judg, that it was not to the Duke alone he would
discover his treacherous intent, well foreseeing he would say as
much to all the great men of the Kingdom, that he thought to
be discontented, and that in the end he would be trap'd, as it fell
out. That if then he should accuse the Duke to have hearkened
three times to his Proposition, without making any discovery of
it, his silence in such a case might pass, in the Cardinal's Opinion,
for a tacit consent. He was therefore of advice that the Duke
should acquaint the Cardinal with it; but it was impossible to
perswade him to that resolution, whilst he was in disgrace. He
always profess'd that he would never consent to the death of an
Enemy by so infamous a way: but that withal he would not give
him that advantage, to perswade himself that he had invented this
Artifice (he not being able to produce the Author) by that pittiful
way to seek his Favour. The business then rested in this posture,
till after the Duke's return to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> that he was restor'd to his
Government; when the same person, persisting in the same
wicked design, and importuning the Duke to accept his offer,
without securely sleeping (which were his own words) under the
dissembled shew of a counterfeit Reconciliation, he then yielded
to the advice of the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son, who was now
with him, and at his perswasion resolv'd in the end to send his
Letters to the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> to communicate them to
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu.</hi> And they could not have been sent in a better
time, for the same proposals that had been made to the Duke,
having also been tendred to the Dutchess of <hi>Lorain,</hi> she had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:63412:279"/>
them to the Cardinal, who, being alarm'd with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of these Intelligences, set spies upon the actious of him
that propos'd them. He was therefore Arrested upon the marks
he had given of himself in his Letters; neither was there any
thing, how daring soever, that might not be expected from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity
of this man. He was known to have been formerly a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and for one of the most resolute
fellows of his time; of which at his being taken he gave notable
proof, having kill'd two men of seven that came to apprehend
him, and dangerously wounded two more; but in the end, gor'd
with Wounds, he was taken, and had life enough left to end his
days upon a Gibbet.</p>
                  <p>Some of these things having hapned before the overtures of

This Lady, who was Neece to the Cardinal, and one of
the best Families in <hi>Britany,</hi> equally considerable, both for the
rare Endowments of her Person, and the advantages of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
was sought after by all the great men of the Court; but
the Cardinal her Uncle, having long had a design to engage the
Duke, and his, in the Interests of his own Fortune, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
preferr'd the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> above all other persons that
pretended to her.</p>
                  <p>So soon as this Affair, which put an end to all the rest with
Honour, and cut off all difficulties whatever, was agreed upon,
the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who had been sent for to Court to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it, return'd back again to the Duke his Father, to ask his
consent. The Duke gave it him 'tis true, but that also was all: and
although this Match had been made for no other end, than meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to disingage him from those troubles wherewith he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd,
he would notwithstanding grant no more, than his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
only, nothing more being to be obtain'd of his severe,
and untractable humour, but a generous denial. He said, <q>That
he had esteem enough for the person, who was to enter into his
Alliance, to gratifie her with a good share of his Estate, which
in due time he would also do; but that he had much rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the posture he then was all the days of his life, than
that it should be said he had redeem'd himself by his money, or
by Bribes been restored to his Command.</q>

                     <pb n="532" facs="tcp:63412:280"/>What offense soever the Cardinal took at this disobliging carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of the Duke, he proceeded notwithstanding to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of the intended Match; which being done, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
away the Abbot <hi>de Coursan,</hi> one of the Ecclesiasticks in
his dependence, with Orders from the King to end all Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Wherein the Archbishop had order to give the Duke his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
as the Duke also had his, about what he was to observe
in the receiving of it.<note place="margin">The Duke's Absol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

might have been perform'd in the Chappel of his Castle of
<hi>Coutras,</hi> that his House might have been rendred famous by so
memorable an action: but the Archbishop would never consent
to have it done there; on the contrary obstinately insisting, that
he would have it at the Gates of the Parish Church of that place,
and in the face of all the people; wherein although <hi>Caspian</hi> at that
time Bishop of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and <hi>de Esprüet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> now Bishop of Saint
<hi>Papoul,</hi> who were the Mediators of the Duke's Interests with the
Archbishop, endeavour'd all they could to conquer this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it was all in vain. The Duke, who, for a nicity like that, would
not defer the accomplishment of an Affair, which through so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
difficulties had been brought on to the pass it then was, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
his own humour, submitted in the end to all the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
could desire. But it was withal an odd beginning of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
the two Parties before they parted from the place,
being perhaps more dissatisfied with one another, than they had
been before.</p>
                  <p>The day for the Absolution being appointed, the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon,</hi>
attended by the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and several persons of
quality, went to <hi>Coutras;</hi> where being come, the Archbishop,
who was already there, accompained with his Ecclesiasticks,
went first to the Church, where the Duke following after, and
presenting himself before him, kneel'd down upon a Velvet Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
laid ready for that purpose. In this posture, and in the
presence of five Councellors of the Parliament of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi>
who were, by the King's Order to be assisting at this Ceremony,
the Archbishop pronounc'd his Absolution in these words.</p>
                  <p>Et Ego Autboritate Ecclesiae,<note place="margin">The Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note> &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

meum in via sisterent, misisti; Statione dispositâ Palatium nostrum
vallasti; Iurisdictionem Ecclesiasticam violasti, eámque tibi arrogasti;
Nos, Clerumque nostrum insignibus, &amp; indignis contumeliis affecisti:
In nomine Patris, &amp; Filij, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="533" facs="tcp:63412:280"/>Though the Duke was no great Latinist, he had nevertheless so
much, as to understand many words of this Absolution, by which
he observ'd, they were not according to the ordinary style of the
Church; so that (as he afterwards said) he was once going to
interrupt the Archbishop, as he was speaking: but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to do any thing that might either look like an Irreverence
to the Church, or retard the satisfaction he hop'd for, both as to
his Conscience and Affairs after the business was done, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him to proceed, choosing rather to pass for an indifferent
Clerk, than to play the Doctor out of time, and to his own preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
The Absolution being pass'd, there were mutual Visits to be
paid, wherein the Duke in Obedience to the King's Order, began
first, and went to give the Archbishop thanks for his Absolution;
a civility that was soon return'd by the Archbishop: but with so
much coldness on both sides, that it was easie to judg this Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
was likely to beget no very good intelligence betwixt them.
In plain truth the Duke could not digest the Severities the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
had made him undergo, which he interpreting to be done
out of a premeditared design to provoke him to something that
might either hinder, or de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er his Absolution, he was much more
sensible of those publick Manifestations of his ill will, than of
any obligation for the invol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntary Grace he had imparted to him.</p>
                  <p>There ensu'd therefore, and that immediately upon the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
high complaints on both sides; of which upon the instant
great Relations were made, and whereof those of the Duke were
justified by the testimony of the Abbot <hi>de Coursan,</hi> who, by seeing
how hardly he had been dealt withal, was become altogether of
his Party: But whilst these Remonstrances were upon their way
to Court, the Duke, to divert himself, took a turn into his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of <hi>Angoumois,</hi> beginning now to make use of that liberty,
which, by his Reconciliation to the Church, was once more his
own. At his return from this little Journey, by an express Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
from Court, he receiv'd his Majesties Orders to return into
<hi>Guienne:</hi> neither could they have been couch'd in more obliging
terms, there being therein not one syllable of any thing that had
pass'd; and the King's Letter, without speaking of any re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which would have presuppos'd a former Suspension, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
only these words.

Farm'd the Crown Revenues of that Province exercis'd over the

Exactions, and their Poverty, which is ordinarily accompanied
with despair, had so stirr'd them up, that they were ready to rush
into Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to shuffle all things into confusion. The Duke
could have been glad, the Court would have order'd some mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:63412:282"/>
in these Impositions to have prevented those mischiefs,
which are usually the issue of general Discontent, and the certain
effects of popular fury; and to that end had made so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Remonstrances to the Council, and urg'd them so home, that
what he did for a good, that as much respected the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
as the Publick Interest, was in the end so misinterpreted,
as to turn to his own disgrace: Seeing therefore he could by his
Prayers, and Importunities, prevail nothing with the Court, he
was necessitated to make use of the Authority he had in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
to prevent a total Revolt, to which the generality of men
were too visibly inclin'd. Wherein his conduct was guided by so
admirable discretion, that what by convincing such by Reason, as
were capable of it, by feeding such by Hopes, as would be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

be satisfied with neither, he for a long time continued all things

in of this Impost, with five, or six other persons concern'd in the
same Employment, had the same measure. The Jurats at the
first rumour of this Tumult, had caus'd the Captains of the City
to take Arms for the defence of <hi>l' Hostel de Ville,</hi> which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
threatned to assault, who accordingly did indeed put themselves
into some posture of defence: but being presently besieg'd, and
hem'd in on all sides, by the multitude, soon capitulated, and
retir'd. This first success having by the easiness thereof, increas'd
the insolence of these rascally people, they in a moment over-ran
the whole City; so that in less than two hours time, they had
got together betwixt four, and five thousand people.</p>
                  <p>So soon as the Parliament saw the Sedition increase to such a
formidable height, they endeavour'd to stop the progress of it, by
issuing out an Act for the suppression of the Edict: but the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers
believing (as it was true) that nothing, but the sole terror
which had possess'd all the Orders of the City, had procur'd this
Arrest in their favour, raising their Impudence higher, upon the
presumption of this Fear, would not so much as suffer it to be
Publish'd; and the Multitude was seen to hurry up and down
the Streets after that audacious and threatning manner, as very
much affrighted all the well dispos'd Inhabitants of the City.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of this uproar the Duke was at <hi>Cadillac</hi> in a
course of Physick, for the confirmation of his health, which he
had not yet perfectly recover'd; where he was very much surpriz'd
to see in the close of the evening a Courrier come in, that the first
President <hi>d' Agnesseau,</hi> had caus'd to steal privately out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to bring him the first news of this Insurrection, of which he
writ him a Letter in these terms.

                  <p>The Duke had no sooner receiv'd this Dispatch, but that he
order'd Letters to be sent forthwith to some Gentlemen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
whilst himself took order for the raising some men
amongst his own Tenants to accompany him the next day to the
City. In the mean time he dispatch'd away <hi>la Roche</hi> the Captain
of his Guards the same night to the first President, to assure him
of the speedy relief he was preparing for him, and to inform
himself more particularly of the state of the City.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was busie about this preparation, he had news
brought, that the Rebels drunk with Wine, and tir'd with the
work of the day, were in the evening retir'd every man to his
own house, with a resolution to be quiet, provided no notice
might be taken of what was pass'd. Had things remain'd in this
condition, their offence, though very great, might have had
some colour of excuse: but these people at their awaking, puff'd
up with the success of their last days temerity,<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the Sedition.</note> broke out again
the next morning into new, and greater Fury than before. In
which heat they drew up a List of above four hundred of the
best Families of the City, under the Title of Gabellers: In which
List many of the principal Members of the Parliament were
compriz'd, and the rest were all Citizens of the best quality; all
which the night following they intended to Massacre, and to rifle
their Houses.</p>
                  <p>The Duke had present notice of this design. The Officers of
Parliament,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sends to the Duke to quicken his haste.</note> astonish'd at the extreme danger they saw themselves
expos'd unto, had dispatch'd to him in all haste <hi>Lacheze,</hi> and <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut,</hi>
two young Counsellors whom they knew to be acceptable
to him, to beseech him to make haste to the City. These Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
gave him an account of the condition the Town, and the
infinite peril all good men were in; declaring withal that their
Lives, and Fortunes depended upon his Presence, and Protection.
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:63412:284"/>
These two Deputies found the Duke just ready to set out, as they
came; he therefore took them into his Coach, and his House
being but five Leagues distant from the City, arriv'd there the
same day, which was the 16<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> in very good time.</p>
                  <p>The Authority and Power,<note place="margin">The Duke's presence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peases the tumult.</note> that the esteem of an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Vertue exercises over the minds of men, is hardly any where
more remarkable, than upon this occasion; there being not one,
even of the most Seditious, who did not manifest shame, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for his past offences. They were no more the same men,
who had determin'd to cut throats, and to plunder the richest
houses the ensuing night; insomuch that even the very Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
themselves came, mix'd with the honestest Burgers of the
Town, to meet, and receive their Governour, a great way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Gates of the City, with Acclamations that sounded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Obedience, and Submission.</p>
                  <p>With this general applause, the Duke went to alight at the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Windows broken, the Prisons set open, and all things as in the
desolation of a City taken and sack'd by a Forein Enemy.</p>
                  <p>After having taken the best order he could for the securing the
<hi>Hostel de Ville,</hi> he retir'd himself to his own House; and thus far
all things look'd well: but afterwards his design being to proceed
about the late tumult, rather by moderate, and gentle, than by
severe and exemplary ways, (the first being at this time the safest,
and best, if they could succeed) the Mutineers began to gather
heart from their impunity, and to believe they were fear'd. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
therefore being so sweet, and tempting, as Dominion, and
Power, to those who are not acquainted with it, these men would
by no means so soon lay down, that which they had so rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
taken up, and which they thought with their great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
they could so easily maintain. They began then to assemble
themselves anew, giving out terrible threats of what strange
things they would do; by which the Duke judging they would
from high words, doubtless proceed to some mischievous effects;
he sent the Court an account of all the evil dispositions he had
observ'd, not only in the spirits of the Inhabitants of the City,
but also of the whole Province; desiring withal the assistance of
such Forces, as might be sufficient to remedy the evil he saw was
already as good as concluded. But all his Remonstrances were
neglected, they thought he only made this his pretence to Arm,
and fortifie himself in his own Government; and the design of
the Court being to keep him weak, and disarm'd, they rather
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:63412:284"/>
chose to expose the Province to the danger of popular Sedition,
than to enable him with Honour to maintain the King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Interest.</p>
                  <p>The Duke seeing himself thus naked, and alone, did very well
judg he should not in this posture be able to suppress the Faction;
so that their insolence daily more and more increas'd, till in the
end either stirr'd up with the fear of being made examples, prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
on with the avarice of booty,<note place="margin">The people run into open Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of ill doing, without danger of punishment (which to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
minds is no small temptation) they betook themselves open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Arms; and after many insolent Discourses, and several Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
scatter'd up and down the Streets, to excite the people to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
they canton'd, and fortified themselves in one part of
the City, whereof they possess'd themselves of the half, and, by
making great Barricado's upon all the Avenues, made themselves
absolute Masters of it. Within this Precinct there were five
Gates, several Churches, with some Towers, and Fortifications
which were joyn'd to the City; all which they had carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, and were therein so well accommodated, that it seem'd
to them impossible they should be forc'd, having many more men
than were necessary to defend their Works.</p>
                  <p>This disorder hapned the 15<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> it began about ten of
the Clock in the morning, and the Duke had notice of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after Dinner; upon which Intelligence judging that a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of this high nature, and premeditated as this was, was not
to be tolerated without manifest danger both of the City, and the
whole Province, and a very great diminution both of the King's
Authority, and his own; he forthwith commanded those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
he had about him to mount to Horse, and <hi>la Roche</hi> the
Captain of his Guards to put himself in the head of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
on Foot;<note place="margin">The D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

further deliberation, went out about one in the afternoon, to
execute one of the boldest actions he ever undertook in his whole
life.</p>
                  <p>Neither would he herein so much as consider his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or the temerity, and number of those he was to encounter,
that the disproportion of their Forces might not divert him from
his design. He had not with him above two and twenty Horse,
and six and twenty of his Guards on Foot, whereas no less than
the one half of the City were already in Arms against him, and
little better to be expected from the rest. For the greater part of the
Inhabitants look'd upon these Mutineers, as the Champions of
their Liberty; so that those of the bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er sort, and some few honest
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:63412:285"/>
Citizens excepted, the rest were prepossess'd with so strange a
blindness, that there were very few, who did not at least contribute
their wishes to the prosperity of so Lewd a Cause. In fine, had not
his promptitude and courage (and that beyond all probality) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
him the success of this Action, there had been an end of the
City of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and the whole Province of <hi>Guienne;</hi> and an
invading Enemy could not have wrought a greater desolation,
than had been justly to be fear'd from the wild Fury of a people,
puff'd up with the success of the least Victory they could have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
He therefore indeed hazarded a great deal to prevent so
dire a mischief, and to preserve the whole: but there was also a
necessity upon him, that he should do so; neither would the
evil have been less, if he had rendred his Authority contemptible
by his Toleration: of two extremes he therefore made choice of
that, wherein, 'twas true, there was more danger; but that gave
him withal opportunity, either suddenly to suppress the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
or to end his Life with Honour in the Service of his
Prince and Countrey.</p>
                  <p>So soon as the Duke was on Horseback, the first place he went
to was the Lodgings of the Premier President, to secure his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
from danger; which he did, by prevailing with him to retire
himself to his House, and from thence advanc'd towards the
Barricado's. The <hi>Hostel de Ville</hi> was comprehended in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,
the Mutineers had possess'd themselves of; but they were
not Masters of the place: he would therefore, before he advanc'd
any further, make some stay there to encourage the Guards, he
had before there plac'd in Garrison, in their Duty. As he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his March thither, at the entry into the Market place, he
found all the Chains up, and several of the Inhabitants in Arms,
resolute to defend the pass. Whereupon <hi>la Roche</hi> by the Duke's
Order, commanded them to make way, and retire; when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them in suspence what to do, whether to obey, or stand
upon their defence, <hi>la Roche</hi> wisely taking advantage of their ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolution,
leapt upon the Barricado, disarm'd those who were
more advanc'd, and forc'd the rest to retire, without any other
violence to any.</p>
                  <p>Though the little respect these first opposers manifested for the
Age and venerable Person of their Governour, gave him very
well to understand he was to expect no better from the rest, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
not nevertheless to go on. He alighted therefore at the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel
de Ville,</hi> where, after he had taken the best Order he could, for
the security of the place, and put it into a condition to send him
some assistance if occasion were, he commanded <hi>la Roche</hi> to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:63412:285"/>
a Barricado that was made at the entry of the Street call'd <hi>la
Rüe Saint Michel.</hi> Those who defended this pass were too many to
keep any good order; they indeed made shew of great resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and receiv'd the Guards with several Musket shot, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly
made, and at random: but how irregularly soever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any shot was fir'd against them, they wounded one of the
Duke's Guards to death,<note place="margin">The Duke, though stoutly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the first B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Duke had expressly commanded his people not to shoot till the
last extremity, and as much as was possible to spare the Blood of
the people, whose blindness he much more lamented, than he
was with their temerity and insolence offended: but after this first
Volly, his Guards having discharg'd theirs almost at the Muzzle
of the Musket, it was soon seen how much Valour can prevail
over Numbers, and what Experience, and Discipline can do
against Brutality, and Disorder, They shot so right, and to so
good effect, that few gave fire, who did not carry his man; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that nine were kill'd out-right at this first Volle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to break it down, where they yet met with some oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and where a Gentleman call'd <hi>la Serre,</hi> who would fight on

Arms, in mounting the Barricado, was by a thrust with a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert

                  <p>Yet was it not nevertheless to retreat very far, the squander'd

his Deaths wound by a Musket shot that broke his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
five or six more were also wounded, what with Muskets

him on Horseback; all which opposition notwithstanding,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:63412:286"/>
every thing must give way to the valour of this little Party; and
<hi>la Roche,</hi> seeing his Master engag'd in so manifest a danger of his
life, so bravely expos'd both his own, and his fellows for his
preservation, that nothing was able to withstand them.</p>
                  <p>The five first Barricado's being forc'd,<note place="margin">The Duke goes into another quarter of the City, which was also in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, and Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do'd.</note> and taken, the Duke was
inform'd, that in that part of the Town towards <hi>St. Croix,</hi> there
were several others, some perfected, and others only begun: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which intelligence he thought it very requisite to make use of
the astonishment his first successes might possibly have imprinted
in the minds of the people, and to go immediately to this second
occasion. He met in truth with less resistance at these, than the
former, there was notwithstanding something every where to do,
and he had also here some men wounded: but it is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
what infinite hazards he ran that day in his own person;
for being on Horseback at the head of his Troop, and very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
by his gray Beard, and Head, he seem'd to be the
mark at which all the Musket-shot, Pistols, and Stones were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
Neither was he only to apprehend those that were shot
at him from the Barricado's, his greatest danger being from the
Windows, and so much the more, by reason the Streets being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
narrow, took from him all possibility of avoiding the
shot, that was pour'd perpendicular upon him. Even the women
put him into no small danger, one of which fail'd but little of
braining him with a Flower-pot, which came so near as to fall
upon his Horses Crupper; and a man through a Casement, with
his Musket couch'd at his Cheek, was about to let fly at him, at
no more than ten paces distance, had he not been prevented by
one of the Duke's Guard call'd <hi>Caudere,</hi> who espied, and kill'd
him.<note place="margin">The Duke's danger.</note> A greater resolution, than this day appear'd in the people,
has hardly at any time been observ'd; which was such, that even
when the Duke's followers had made themselves Masters of the
Barricades, they had much ado to make them retire; and when
either they had taken their Arms from them, or that themselves in
despair had thrown them away, they cry'd out, and intreated, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be dispatch'd than permitted to live to see the Gabelle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

                  <p>They could not nevertheless either by their obstinacy, or the ill

him to consent to more Blood, or greater Slaughter, than

next Chirurgion's; where having caus'd it to be totally cut
off, and a Plaster to be apply'd to it, he return'd immediately to
another Barricade, which he again defended with great bravery,
and resolution, till in the end being taken, and presented to the
Duke, with an account of his action, he commanded him to be
carried back to his own house, and that care should be taken for
his cure: but his life was not to be saved; for this unluchy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
by his obstinacy opposing the Grace the Duke had shew'd
him, a new Sedition a few days after arising (for this was not the
last) he start out of his Bed at the first noise of it, to put himself
again in the head of his Comrades; which second agitation ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
put him into a continued Fever, he dy'd a few days after.</p>
                  <p>The Duke having scour'd this great quarter of the City, and
forc'd above three thousand persons to lay down their Arms, who
had taken them up in this Commotion, carrying off with him his
dead, and wounded, return'd back to the <hi>Hostel de Ville,</hi> to give his
men a little breath, who were almost tired out, and spent with the
heat, and continuation of the Fight: But it was only to take a
very short repose; for he was scarce alighted from his Horse,
when he was advertis'd, that near to the Port <hi>de Saint Iulien,</hi> which
is one of the principal Gates of the City, eight or nine hundred
men were intrench'd, within five great Barricades, that shut up all
the Avenues,<note place="margin">The D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Mutineers had a design to make themselves Masters of this Gate,
which had been no hard matter for them to do, by that means to
have let in the Country people thereabouts to their assistance;
which they from without the Walls mainly cry'd out for, that they
might share in the Plunder of the City, which they had already
swallow'd in their imagination, and look'd upon it as a certain,
and infallible Prey. The Duke was a little surpriz'd to find he was
to enter into new engagements, before he was well clear of the
former: he knew very well that the small number of men he had
left, would be too few to undertake this second Enterprize; yet
would he not leave an action imperfect, which unless it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on to an absolute, and total Victory, he must of necessity lose
the fruits of what he had already perform'd with so much Bravery
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:63412:287"/>
and success. He resolv'd therefore to draw fifty men out of
the Garrison of <hi>Chasteau-Trompette,</hi> all that could possibly be
spar'd from thence, and some small Field-pieces to force
those Entrenchments with less danger, than he had done the
other Barricado's before. He had no sooner made his preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and was ready to go against these people, when either a pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
terror, or the consideration of their Duty, or the Respect to
their Governours person, whom they saw so freely to expose
himself for the publick Safety, touch'd the hearts of some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Burgers of that part of the City; who had, it should seem,
so much credit with the Seditious, as to make them capable of
Reason, and sensible of their Duty, so far as to prevail with them,
without staying to be compell'd unto it, to send the Duke a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
that they would return to their Obedience; which they
accordingly did, at the same time falling to work to open their
Barricado's: So that the Duke, presently advancing to see what
condition they were in, caus'd them to be totally beaten down in
his own presence.</p>
                  <p>Whilst on this side of the Town the Duke went on at this pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
rate, there was new work cutting out for him in the other
part of the City, had he been less successful here: For although that
Quarter call'd <hi>du Chapeau Rouge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The whole City upon the point to run into Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</note> was inhabited with a great many
persons of very good quality, who were heartily concern'd at
these disorders; there were also very many who had been so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd
with false opinions, that they were much more enclin'd
to joyn with the Seditious, than any ways to help to suppress them.
These were doubtless the greater party, and these had been put
into Arms under the Captains of the City, if occasion had been
to have gone to the Duke's succour: but by good fortune he stood
in no need of so dangerous a Relief; it being almost certain that
they would have turn'd to the other side, and, had never so little
misfortune befall'n him, their Captains would have had very much
ado to have with-held them;<note place="margin">But are with-held by the Duke's suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</note> but his success prevented their evil
purpose: So that seeing him return Victorious with so few For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
their Fury was turn'd into admiration; and they for that time
satisfied themselves with muttering some discontent at their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
defeat, without farther manifesting their malevolent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
by any considerable effects.</p>
                  <p>Though this Action, that had had so violent a beginning, and so
miraculous a conclusion, had made the Duke's generosity, and
good conduct admir'd by all; it had nevertheless withal made the
people sensible of his weakness, by the few that came into his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
in a time of so great, and manifest danger. The Seditious
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:63412:287"/>
therefore taking from thence a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and comparing their numbers with his, doubted not, should they
come to a second Tryal, to do their work with greater facility:
So that prepossess'd with the hope of their cursed advantages, they
highly, and publickly threatned what they would do; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
had not the sole respect to the Duke's person with-held them,
they had again betaken themselves to Arms, and he would have
been in very great danger to have perish'd by the hands of the
people, and to have suffer'd the most unfortunate death could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
have arriv'd to any person of his condition.</p>

those that were reasonably to be fear'd for the time to come. In
this Dispatch he, above all things, was importunate that the Duke
<hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son might be sent away to him, that he might be
assisted by a second self in occasions where the whole burthen of
Affairs were to depend upon his Fidelity, and care. In the
mean time he writ to some Gentlemen of the Country to come
speedily in to him, and moreover gave order for the raising some
Forces in such of his own Territories, as lay nearest to the City.
He had from thence often drawn out to the number of above two
thousand good men, by which he had been exceedingly well
serv'd upon several important occasions: but at this time (which
will appear very strange, and at which I observ'd him to be more
aftonish'd, than at any thing that had hapned during the whole
disorder) he could not get so much as one man: so great was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

vigour than was to be expected from a man of his profession, it
is certainly believ'd, that not one man of condition would have
been left alive, in the whole City. Neither had the disorder been

people, enclin'd to Licence, had entreated <hi>Vertamont</hi> to go thither,
under colour of some Commission of his Intendancy; where
he was scarcely arriv'd, when the people rose in Commotion, as
in other places, falling upon some Officers of the Election, and
other innocent persons, to make a horrid Massacre: And then it
was, that <hi>Vertamont,</hi> abandoning the care of his own person, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
the Magistrates boldly to oppose the popular Fury, and

some poor people, who were going to be sacrific'd to their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
cruelty, out of the hands of the insolent rabble: So that
with an extraordinary fortune, the effect of his generous resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he contain'd this City in its Obedience, giving in himself
at the same time, a great Example of Justice, and Moderation in
so dangerous an occurrence.</p>
                  <p>Though the Duke had enough to do in the City of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke sends his Orders into all parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</note>

all parts of the Province; in the remotest parts whereof, the

also by the same consideration; by which means the Licence
of the people was kept within some moderate bounds; a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
nevertheless that hung by so slender a thred, that upon the
least occasion worse, and more dangerous Commotions were to be
expected. The Duke had no Forces, neither was any to be hop'd
for out of any part of the Province; and it was a matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
difficulty to send him any from any other place; so
that he was constrain'd in so great an exigency, to have recourse
to other means, and to cause some of the promoters of this Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be treated withal, for the bringing about of that, which
he saw no other possible way to effect: Wherein he also succeeded
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:63412:288"/>
so well, that these people allur'd by promises of Indemnity, and
some hopes of reward, gave themselves up absolutely to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
so that it was by this politick way of proceeding he in the
end totally secur'd both the City of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Guienne.</hi> The disorder had continued so long, and with
so much noise, that there was few of the Incendiaries, who were
not in every quarter particularly known, of which there were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many who had formerly born Arms in the King's Regiments
of Foot; and who, being grown weary of that profession, were
return'd again to their old Trades. These men wrought upon by
the Duke's Exhortations, and the greatest part of them more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
touch'd with the sence of the moderation he had exercis'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, notwithstanding the greatness of their offences, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him, that nothing should pass amongst the people, of which
he should not have continual notice; and they were as good as
their words, giving him by their constant intelligence, means and
opportunity to prevent those evils, which otherwise would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
have given the last blow to the publick Peace.</p>

to make their way into the City it self; where they were
so much desired by the basest of the people, that they did their
endeavours also to let them in. The greatest appearance of them
was in the Suburb <hi>de Saint Surin,</hi> to which place the Duke's house
was near enough for him to hear their clamours, and hideous
yells, and from his Chamber Window that look'd into the Fields

Riots, it was impossible to detain him; but, although he
was at last fall'n into an almost unintermitted indisposition, he got
out of his bed, mounted to Horse by night, and with forty or
fifty Gentlemen, his Guards, and some of the Town Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
went out towards these Mutineers. They had fortified
themselves in several places of the Suburb, had Barricado'd the
Church, and made a countenance of resolution to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:63412:289"/>
nevertheless at the Duke's arrival, they almost all disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and ran away, none saving those in the Church making any
resistance, who also at the first Volley was discharg'd upon them,
fled after their fellows; when the Cavalry putting themselves in
pursuit of those who had recover'd the Fields,<note place="margin">And disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses them.</note> some forty or fifty
of them were miserably slain. It is not to be imagin'd how
strangely the Duke was afflicted at the death of these wretched
people: This little evil nevertheless conduc'd very much to a far
greater good; for the report of this Execution dispersing it self in
a moment, throughout the whole Province, the other Country
people who sate, expecting the good, or evil success of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
made themselves, for this year, wise by the example of their
misfortune; and without engaging in the folly of the greater
Cities, were content to sit spectators of their Tumults, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.
There were indeed hardly any more after this action; for
the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> coming presently after to the Duke his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they bent their joynt endeavours to the healing of some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
discontents that yet remain'd in the minds of the people;
when having, by gentle and obliging ways, made them sensible of
their late miscarriages, and of their Duty, and Obedience for the
time to come,<note place="margin">From whence a calm ensues.</note> they soon after, by the King's Order, publish'd an
Act of Oblivion for all things that were pass'd; a Grace his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

                  <p>Who could have imagin'd that so many brave Actions of the

they were carried on, or the utility that deriv'd from them to the

pretence to the blackest, and most hateful calumny, that could
possibly have been invented to the prejudice of his Honour? It
was nevertheless the fruit, and reward of his brave Service, after
which no man certainly is ever again to repine at Detraction, or
complain of Envy. <hi>Briet,</hi> a Counsellor in the Parliament of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
openly profess'd himself to be no friend to the Duke, and
secretly nourish'd in his bosom an implacable hatred, both to his
Person and Name; instigated therefore with this accursed passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he writ to the Archbishop of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> (who was no better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to the Duke) that it was to be prov'd, the Duke himself had
been the Author of all these Commotions; that it was he who
had so long fomented them, and that he would again revive them
whenever he thought it convenient so to do, for the promoting
of his own Authority in the Province, and to get himself a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:63412:289"/>
at Court. He had not always writ after this manner, but
on the contrary, after the action of the Barricades, the 15 of
<hi>Iune,</hi> compell'd to it by the vertue of Truth, which will dart her
Rays through the darkest Clouds of Malevolence and Envy, he
had writ to <hi>Monsieur de la Vrilliere,</hi> Secretary of State, with
whom he had a particular Familiarity and Correspondence, a
Letter that was sent to the Duke, containing these words.

                           <p>If you be curious to know what pass'd here upon Friday last,
I send you this short, and true Account of it, as I could inform
my self from the best hands. This Action of our Governour
was very great, and perform'd with great Bravery, Judgment,
and Fortune: had any sinister Action befallen him, we had all
been lost, and for my part I cannot but highly esteem him. I
have nothing more at present, but that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        </body>
                     </floatingText> But if he had in the beginning so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applauded this Action, he had with no less malignity censur'd
the sequel of it, and the sinister interpretation he put upon the
Duke's good intentions, wrought so much the greater effect, by
how much they fell upon a spirit dispos'd of old, and of it self to
convert to ill, what god soever could come from the Duke's
side. The Archbishop therefore with open Arms embrac'd this
new occasion of doing him a new mischief; he spoke of it to
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> of whom he easily obtain'd order to write to
<hi>Briet,</hi> as he also did, that he might promise both impunity, and
reward to such as should prove the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to be the
Author of these Disorders. The Archbishop's Letters to <hi>Briet,</hi>
which were intercepted, spoke in these terms, and in others far
more odious than these. <hi>Briet</hi> having receiv'd this Order, caus'd
the <hi>Host</hi> of the <hi>Petit More,</hi> the first, and one of the chiefest Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders,
that had appear'd in this Sedition, to be temper'd withal,
causing him to be often spoken to, and tempted by one of his own
Domesticks, who was very familiar with him: but the Fellow, what
promises soever they could make him,<note place="margin">The hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of one of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers.</note> would never be corrupted
into so foul a practice; and the Duke's good Fortune would have
it, that there was honesty enough in this man to secure him from
those dangers, wherein persons of a much more eminent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would otherwise have involv'd him.</p>
                  <p>The Duke as yet knew nothing of the Mischief that was brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against him; but on the contrary, relying upon the merit of
his Services, and the acknowledgment the King had made him
hope for in all his dispatches, he had never liv'd at greater ease in
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:63412:290"/>
his Government, than he thought he might expect to do for the
time to come. In his Majesties Dispatch of the last of <hi>Iune,</hi> he
writ to the Duke these words.

and without dreaming in the least of any such matter, he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
reduc'd to the necessity of a Justification. He did not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
do it after the submiss and abject manner of a guilty man;
but on the contrary, confident in the security of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
he had no sooner notice of the aspersion had been cast upon

his Majesties Justice, and writ to the Cardinal himself, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that some persons had made use of his name to suborn false
Witnesses, to the prejudice of him, and his Honour. The King
granted him his desire, permitting him to prosecute his satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on in the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> and the Cardinal, after having
utterly deny'd the giving of any Order to the prejudice of the
Duke's Interests, or that he ever doubted of his Candour, and
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:63412:290"/>
the sincerity of his intentions, writ him an answer in these

conferr'd with <hi>Mounsieur de Magnas,</hi> about the occasion of his
Journey; in answer whereunto I have nothing to return, but
this, that neither the King, nor any of his Servants, have ever
doubted in the least of the sincerity of your affection to his
Service, or of your passion to the prosperity of his Affairs; or
that you had in the late business of <hi>Guienne,</hi> any other, than the
same desires with his Majesty, and his Council; for which I
shall ever very willingly be your Caution. If any persons have
reported otherwise, they must have done it meerly out of design
to vex you, and not that they could themselves believe it; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not to be imagin'd, that any one can be so sensless, who
knowing what has hapned at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and how you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
your self in those disorders, can possibly doubt, that you
did not upon that occasion contribute all that in you lay, or
that could be expected from your Vigilancy, and Valour to
the security of the Province. I do therefore conjure you to set
your heart at rest, for any thing of that kind; and to believe that
neither the King, nor any of his Servants, who have the honour
to be about him, can possibly either upon this, or any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
entertain the least thought to your prejudice. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinal could not in truth have writ to the Duke after
a more obliging manner, or have carried himself more civilly to
him, than he did at the beginning of this Affair; permitting Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to be executed upon the fellow <hi>Briet</hi> had employ'd to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the <hi>Petit More,</hi> who by Sentence of Parliament was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to make the Duke honourable satisfaction, and with a
Torch in his hand, and a Halter about his Neck in his Shirt, to
be Carted through the City of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke receives some satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and to serve ten years in
the Gallies, which was accordingly executed upon him: but
when it came to the business of <hi>Briet</hi> himself, who had reason
to apprehend the issue of his cause, since he who had only been
the Instrument of the Mischief, whereof he had been the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver,
had been so roughly handled, the Cardinal interpos'd his
Interest with the Parliament in his behalf; who having once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in his favour, his Power had so great an Ascendant over all
other Powers, how great soever in the Kingdom, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:63412:291"/>
upon this occasion to obtain Justice contrary to his will
and pleasure; so that the Duke notwithstanding all the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
he could after use, could never obtain from <hi>Briet</hi> the least
Reparation.<note place="margin">But not full.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Duke was wounded to have this Justice deny'd him, in
so publick and so sensible a wrong, he was no less afflicted at the
Order he soon after receiv'd, to permit that <hi>Briet</hi> might come,
and execute the Functions of his Office in Parliament, in all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and freedom: He had expected at least that he should be
detain'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that his Majesty would have had that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
to his just indignation, as to have remov'd so hateful an
object from his sight. But he saw very plainly, that the Cardinal
was the Author of this Command: He knew also very well,
how dangerous a thing it was, either to contradict, or provoke
him. But how great soever his Credit might be, the violent effects
whereof he had already felt, he would notwithstanding never
submit to his will, nor lay down the Animosity he had justly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up against a person from whom he had receiv'd so irreparable
an Offence.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke was perplex'd with these troublesome Affairs,<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi> sent at the head of a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </note>
both in his own Government, and at Court, the Cardinal <hi>de la
Valette</hi> his Son had been employ'd in the conduct of the greatest
Army his Majesty had at that time on foot; the Command
whereof was equally divided betwixt Duke <hi>Veimar</hi> and him. And
if the Jealousie of our Confederates (who had oblig'd our two
Generals to enter a good way into <hi>Germany</hi> to their Succour) had
not bounded their Conquests, it is most certain they had made a
very considerable progress into this mighty Empire. But those
who had implor'd their assistance, choosing rather to be left weak,
as they were, than to see the <hi>French</hi> Name rais'd to a greater
height of Glory, and Reputation, by the Victories they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
have obtain'd over those of their own Nation, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to perswade them to joyn their Forces with ours. By
which tergiversation, if (as they did) they depriv'd our Generals
of the advantages they might reasonably expect, it was also to
make them acquire the honour of so brave a Retreat, as might
justly be rank'd with the most famous Victories. Our Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advanc'd a great way into <hi>Germany,</hi> had all the Forces of the
Emperour pour'd upon them; in which condition they had not
only the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but several other Rivers also, and difficult passes to
go over,<note place="margin">A brave Retreat of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette.</hi>
                     </note> and break through, before they could return into their
own Countrey. Which notwithstanding they did, with their
Swords in their hands; neither the incommodities of the ways,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:63412:291"/>
nor the interposition of the Enemy, being able to stop them: so
that they fought eight days together almost without intermission,
leaving the ways, by which they made their retreat, much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
by the blood of their Enemies, than by that of their
own Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Though the mouths of all men were full of the praise of this
Action, that the Court appear'd to be infinitely satisfied with it,
and that the Duke himself from all parts receiv'd congratulatory
applauses of so great an exploit in the person of his Son;<note place="margin">The Duke dissatisfied that the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son should follow the profession of Arms.</note> he had
notwithstanding much rather this Son, advanc'd into the Church
by his Learning, Birth, and Fortune to so eminent a degree of
Dignity, and Reputation, should wholly have apply'd himself to
her Service, than that he should expose so dear a Life to so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a Profession. He ever apprehended it would be fatal to
him, and therefore had done all he could to disswade him from it,
employing to that end the endeavours of several his most
intimate Friends and Servants: but all in vain, either the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the Time, the inclination of his Son, the necessity of
his Destiny, or all together still prevailing with him, above the
fears or foresight of so affectionate a Father.</p>
                  <p>The Duke arriv'd now at an extreme old Age, worn out,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> falls dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously sick.</note> and
spent with the labours he had undergone during these Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the Vexations that had succeeded, was again in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Winter seiz'd by a very troublesome, and very violent
Disease. This season, for several years, had never pass'd over,
without producing strange alterations in his health; insomuch
that he would often say, he perceiv'd in the end it would do his
business, and that he could not long defend himself against two
Winters at once, that of Age, and that of the Season; as it indeed
fell out. At this time every one despair'd of his Life, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of his Death, that was spread in all parts, follow'd a few days
after with the certain news of his Recovery; having astonish'd
all the world, that now scarce pass'd any longer for raillery, which
had so pleasantly been said, <hi>That he had out-liv'd the Age of dying.</hi>
In truth all Forein Parts, having for the space of threescore and
eight, or threescore and ten years been continually full of the
great Name of <hi>Espernon,</hi> finding him still in their Gazetts, one
while taking Towns, another in the head of Armies; now Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing,
and again in Disgrace: but ever in some great and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Occasion; Strangers conceiv'd of him, that this must
be the Grand-child of that Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who had been the
Favourite of <hi>Henry</hi> the III. of <hi>France,</hi> and could not perswade
themselves that the lives of two men could furnish this History
with so many important Actions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="556" facs="tcp:63412:292"/>The Duke, whilst he was yet sick,<note place="margin">Anno 1636.</note> and even in the worst of his
Sickness, had an inckling of some designs the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had upon
several Frontiers of this Kingdom, and particularly upon those
of his own Government; of which to be better assur'd, he was
careful to send thither such persons,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> as were capable of discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and as he durst trust, to bring him true intelligence of what
pass'd amongst our Neighbours abroad. By these Spies he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that all the Frontiers of <hi>Arragon, Biscay, Guipuscoa,</hi> and
other finitimous Provinces of <hi>Spain,</hi> had order to make Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Arms, and were to set out a certain number of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by an appointed day: That to these Provincial Forces they
would moreover adde several standing Regiments, and of both
together to make up a considerable Body. Of all which the Duke
was so precisely inform'd, that he did not only know the number
of men, but even the names of all the Captains who were to
Command them. Neither did he fail to send the King an Account
of the Intelligence he had receiv'd:<note place="margin">The Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rt neglects the Duke's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,</note> but our great Ministers were
so taken up with other nearer, and more immediate Affairs, that
they were not much concern'd at a danger two hundred Leagues
from <hi>Paris.</hi> They therefore contented themselves with writing to
the duke, that he should cause <hi>Bayonne</hi> (the place that was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
threatned) to be fortified at the Charge of the Inhabitants;
and as to the rest, that he was by his Wisdom, and Interest, to
provide for all things within the Precincts of his Command.
These Orders so general, and of so vast a Latitude, had formerly
been the fullest Commissions the <hi>Romans</hi> were wont to give their
Generals in the greatest necessities of Publick Danger: but they
were in our times the narrowest, and the most limited that could
possibly be granted, who had the King's Interest committed to
their Trust. There were, already others establish'd by Law, which
no one without being Criminal was to exceed, and those were,
<hi>That no one should make Leavies, either of Men, or Mony, without
Order by Letters Patents from the Council: That no one should mount
Artillery, or take necessary Arms out of the Arsenals, without special
Order so to do.</hi> So that all the Power of the Kingdom, residing
in the persons of the Prime Ministers, no Governour could make
use of his own, without incurring the danger of Censure. The
Duke knowing, that in the evil disposition the Court then was
as towards him, this was only a device to make him run into some
error, that might draw the King's Indignation upon him, wisely
fear'd to be involv'd in those Calamities, under which, for Causes
light enough in themselves, he had seen men of great Quality,
and Merit to perish, was not easie to be trap'd that way. He
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:63412:292"/>
therefore again writ to the King for more precise Orders in occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
that might happen, and in those dangers he had humbly
represented to him; and in the end, with much importunity,<note place="margin">And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides very slenderly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Frontiers.</note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
Order to send an Engineer to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> to see it fortified as
far as forty thousand Livers would extend; the one half whereof
was to be rais'd out of his Majesties Revenue, and the other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Inhabitants of the place. The Duke, seeing he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
no more, did as he was commanded, and began some For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
which the want of money caus'd to be left imperfect,
and by that means the Town left in a weaker condition, than if
nothing had been done at all.</p>
                  <p>This Affair, which at this time was the only one of moment in
the Province, being put into this forwardness, the Duke conceiv'd
he had now leisure to look a little after the recovery of his own
health; which that he might do at better convenience, and greater
vacancy, from the perpetual distraction of the Affairs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
he humbly intreated the King to give him leave for a few
days to retire himself to <hi>Plassac,</hi> to the end he might at greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
make use of those remedies, that were proper for his Disease.
The King without any difficulty, and in very favourable terms,
granted his so just request: whereupon he accordingly in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>May</hi> came to his House of <hi>Plassac,</hi> but it was to make
a very short stay, he being scarcely there arriv'd, but that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Order to return speedily into <hi>Guienne,</hi> to look after the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
that very much requir'd his Presence there. The great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
that were every where making by the Enemies of
<hi>France,</hi> to invade it, obliging him to provide also for his defence;
as he did, and that so well, as in the end turn'd all their designs to
their own confusion. There never perhaps in this Kingdom had
been more to do for the great men of it, than at this time; and as
the Government of <hi>Guienne</hi> by its vast extent, made up one of
the most important, and considerable Members of the State; so
did it consequently produce for its Governour, so many, and so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Affairs, that it is to be wondred at, a man of so extreme an
Age could undergo so many, and so continual labours.</p>
                  <p>The first thing the Duke did after his return into the Province
(which was in the latter end of <hi>May</hi>) was to execute an Express
Commission had been directed to him from the King, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolling
the<note n="*" place="margin">A Statute of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> Edict <hi>de Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e,</hi> newly pass'd by his Majesty, for the
addition of one President, and twelve Counsellors to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Bordeaux.</hi> This Affair could not pass without encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
several Difficulties, all the other Parliaments of <hi>France</hi> were
charg'd with the same Augmentations proportionably to the extent
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:63412:293"/>
of their several Jurisdictions; this being therefore a common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
amongst so many men of condition, it begat also a great
correspondency amonst them to oppose it. The King having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen,
and expected all these obstacles from the Parliament of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
thought fit to invest the Duke with as much Authority, as
he could himself desire to overcome them; wherein his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
and those of his Council doubted not, but that he would
with great alacrity put all his Orders into severe Execution: they
knew very well that there had been perpetual feuds betwixt him,
and that Assembly, and, as it usually falls out, design'd to make
their own advantage of those Divisions: but the Duke taking a
quite contrary course in this Affair, than what they had expected
at Court, satisfied himself with only giving the Parliament to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what, should it come to the push, he had power to do,
in case the King should not be obey'd; exhorting them withal
by their Wisdoms to prevent, what he for his part would avoid,
as far as was consistent with his Duty; and remonstrating to
them, that in a concern of this kind, they should not find him
any ways to act by his own particular passion; neither would he
either use, or abuse the King's Name to satisfie his own Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This discreet, and moderate way of proceeding, having
in time wrought upon some spirits, that a more violent course
might perhaps have provok'd into more untoward resolutions,
succeeded so well, that by this means he procur'd a very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
assistance to the advancement of his Majesties Affairs; and
that even with the good will, and free consent of the Company,
whose interests in return he husbanded, upon this occasion, with
the same tenderness, and care, as if they had effectually been his
own.</p>
                  <p>At the same time that these Affairs were in agitation in <hi>Guienne,</hi>
the Enemy, who had been long preparing for some notable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
was now ready on all sides to invade the Kingdom; to
provide therefore for the necessary expence in so critical an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(all ordinary, and extraordinary ways besides having been
found to fall short) the King was constrain'd to lock up his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
from all other Expences, which did not directly respect the
War: so that all the great men of the Kingdom saw themselves
excluded from all possibility of extracting from thence their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
Pensions, or other Assignments of right belonging,
and annex'd unto their several Offices, and Commands. To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
which defect, part of these expences were thrown upon the
people; they began at least to impose upon them the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Governours of Provinces to be Leavied upon them,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:63412:293"/>
by Commissions of the<note n="*" place="margin">Taxes, or Imposts.</note> 
                     <hi>Taille. Bullion, Sur-Intendant</hi> of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi>
who profess'd a particular Friendship to the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon,</hi>
and pretended to be very solicitous of his Interests, offer'd
him one of these Impositions for the payment of his Salary; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
him moreover, that out of this stock he should pay himself

                     </gap>everal Arrears that were due to him: but the Duke rejected the
proposition, with a generosity never enough to be commended;
sending him word, <q>That having for above threescore years
serv'd the Kings of <hi>France,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Duke's love to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> without ever touching peny of the
Assignations they had pleas'd to think him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worthy of, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what came immediately out of the Exchequer, he would not
begin towards his latter end, to extract a subsistence out of the
poor and miserable people, he saw every day perish before his
eyes for want of Bread: That being plac'd in his Government
to serve the King, and to govern his People, it was from the
Master he serv'd, and not from those he commanded, that he was
to expect his Reward: That he had much rather be reduc'd to the
bare Revenue of his own Estate, than to see his Name in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
Office, or his Table furnish'd out at the price of the Poor.</q> Such
as solicited his business for him at Court, to render him more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
to their perswasions, represented to him the example of all
the other great men of the Kingdom, as well Princes as others,
who they said received now not one farthing any other way: But
all would not prevail; he returning answer, <q>That he did not
take upon him to condemn any one for so doing, but that he
did not nevertheless conceive himself oblig'd to follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of any whomsoever; and that he had much rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the imputation of Singularity, in doing a thing he thought
to be just, than to do the contrary in imitation of all the world
besides.</q> And indeed he continued to the last so constant in this
noble, and generous Resolution, that he never after receiv'd one
peny of any of his Assignments, not so much as of those that
<q>were due for the year before:</q> So that at his Death he had near
upon seven years Arrears due to him, amounting to above five
hundred thousand Livers: By which it may be judg'd how much
his strongest inclinations (for I cannot deny but that he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
close handed in very many things) gave place to Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
wherein his Honour was concern'd,</p>
                  <p>If in this particular he was so solicitous of easing the King's
Subjects that were under his Government, even to the prejudice of
his own Interests; he was no less careful to keep them within the
just limits of their Obedience, and Duty. The gathering in of
the <hi>Tailles</hi> was at this time a matter of so great difficulty, that in
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:63412:294"/>
several neighbouring Provinces, as in <hi>Poictou, Xaintonge,</hi> and in
<hi>Angoumois,</hi> the people were in manifest Rebellion. The Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately
oppos'd himself against this ill example, and would
never tolerate the least Disobedience to his Majesties Royal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
a strictness that being for their licencious Constitutions,
or at least in their Opinions too severe, made the people no less
murmur at him, for being too rough, than he was censur'd at
Court for being too indulgent: But he was no more mov'd with
Complaints of the one, than the Jealousie of the other; and his
own satisfaction being his only Object, he did not much regard
any other, than what he found in his own Conscience.</p>
                  <p>Though the Duke's mind was taken up with so many Affairs
of great difficulty, and trouble, he had yet so much room left
there, as to allow something to his own particular resentments,
which would ever upon occasion crowd in for a place with the
Publick Concerns.<note place="margin">The Duke for all the injuries he had receiv'd of <hi>Briet,</hi> would take no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but only to put him into a fright.</note> The impunity of <hi>Briet,</hi> and the liberty had
been granted to him again to execute his Office in the Parliament
of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> before his face, and as it were in defiance of him,
was insupportable to such a spirit, as that he was possess'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
so that, what command soever the King had been pleas'd to
lay upon him, to permit him so to do, it was impossible for him
to pay his Majesty that chearful Obedience in this, he did in all
other occasions. To which indigestive humour of his, his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity
(but too just in it self) being every day exasperated more,
and more by new Provocations; he, in the end, was no longer
able so to conquer his passion; but that his patience, being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the last degree, must of necessity overflow all bounds of
moderation, and proceed to some effects of Revenge; so dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
nevertheless to the Injuries he had receiv'd, that if on
the one side he was frugal of his own Conscience in sparing the
Blood of an Enemy, he was not however excus'd from the
blame of undertaking, and that with great bustle and noise, a
thing of little, or no moment, and that notwithstanding had like
to have turn'd very much to his own prejudice. After therefore
the Duke had rejected the proposal of one of his own Souldiers,
who offer'd to stab <hi>Briet,</hi> and to do it after such a manner, that
he could never be suspected for the Murther; he commanded four
of his Foot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> men to kill his Coach-Horses in the open Street. This
Command was executed one day, that <hi>Briet</hi> was returning out of
the City to his own House; when his Coach-man being assaulted
by these four Foot-men, they first pull'd him out of his Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box,
and afterwards thrust their Swords into the Flancks of the
Horses; whereupon the poor Beasts enrag'd with the smart of
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:63412:294"/>
their Wounds, ran away full speed, hurrying the Coach, and
their Master in it three or four hundred paces along the Streets,
till at last, at one and the same instant, upon the pavement they
fell down, and dy'd. <hi>Briet,</hi> who had at first been terribly frighted
with the sight of the Swords, was not much less afraid of his
Horses precipitous Career, which was also all the harm he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
the Coach stop'd, and overturn'd at the death of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
giving him time to come out, half dead with Fear, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire

                     </note> The Relation of this business was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
carried to the Duke, which shadow of Revenge was to
him matter of entertainment, and laughter for an hour after:
But the Parliament took it after a quite contrary manner, who
offended to the height at the Injury done to one of their Robe, the
next day assembled their several Chambers, to enquire into the
Fact: There was none of them who were not very well satisfied
with the Justice of the Duke's resentment, and who would not
have approv'd of his Revenge, had it proceeded a great deal fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but there was also hardly any one of them, who did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
himself in the offence offer'd after so publick a manner to
the Dignity, and Honour of the Assembly. Without doubt the
business would have gone very ill with the Duke, had matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
upon these terms, and those of the Parliament after having
declar'd themselves Parties, remaining still Judges, would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have spar'd the Duke's Footmen, nor any other could have
been prov'd concern'd in the Action; they had already prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
the Cardinal, by representing to him, that neither the King's
Aut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an Officer in the Execution of his Duty, in the most honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Body of the Province: but besides that the Cardinal (ever
very ill satisfied with the Duke, who on his part also did not
much study to please him) was of himself sufficiently dispos'd to
do him a mischief, had not the occurrences of the time involv'd
the Court in the greatest disorder, wherein perhaps it had ever
been.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy, after having long threatned the Kingdom, was in
the end with a powerful Army entred into <hi>Picardy;</hi> and at their
first coming had carried <hi>la Capelle,</hi> and <hi>le Catelet,</hi> assaulted <hi>Corbie,</hi>
which they also took, and alarm'd <hi>Paris</hi> it self to such a degree,
as is sufficiently known to all. They were likewise enter'd into
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> and were preparing for the like attempt upon <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc:</hi>
and <hi>Guienne</hi> was not to be spar'd; neither was it a little while
after: So that the great Minister, wholly taken up with concerns
of so high importance, had no leisure to look after the Duke's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:63412:295"/>
neither did he think it convenient to nettle him, in a time
when his services were so necessary to the Kingdom; and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
who still retain'd his old affection to the Duke's Interests,
seeing himself absolute Master of this business, concealing it from
the Parliaments knowledge, referr'd it to the ordinary Justice,
where being animated with very little passion, it soon fell of it
self.</p>
                  <p>At this time of all others the Greatness of the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
seems especially to appear,<note place="margin">The great Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</note> by the important Employments,
and Commands wherewith his whole Family were invested. The
Duke <hi>de Candale</hi> his eldest Son was <hi>Generalissimo</hi> to the Armies of
the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> an Ally to this Crown. The Duke <hi>de la
Valette</hi> his second Son, was in the Army of <hi>Picardy,</hi> wherein
though he had not in truth the Principal Command (the <hi>Count de
Soissons</hi> being General there) yet had he the honour to be chosen
out by the King, to infuse life, and vigour into that Army, the
Souldiers whereof, by some ill successes had befall'n them, being
exceedingly dejected, which were the express terms wherewith
his Majesty allur'd him to that Service. The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi>
was also employ'd against <hi>Galas</hi> in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> into which Province
the Enemy being entred with a formidable Army, had already
made some Conquests before his arrival there. <hi>Mirebeau</hi> had been
taken, <hi>Saint Iean de Laonne</hi> was besieg'd, and the best Cities of the
Country were highly threatned; the fear there was exceeding great,
and the danger had been no less, if the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> by
opposing himself to their designs, had not stop'd the progress of
their Arms. He fought them with advantage in five or six several
Engagements, and without ever being able to tempt them to a
Battel with all the provocation he could use, forc'd them in the
end to retire, with the ruine, and dissolution of their whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that unprofitably mouldred away to nothing. As for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
his business lay in <hi>Guienne,</hi> a Province, that as it made up a
principal part of the Kingdom, of how great utility must the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
necessarily be, that preserv'd it from disorder in so critical a
time? A thing nevertheless fortunately effected, by his Wisdom so
moderating the discontents of the people, as to keep them in so
dangerous a Juncture of Affairs, from lashing into those extremes,
whereinto by their former behaviour, it might reasonably be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
should they find an opportunity of this nature, they
would precipitously run.</p>
                  <p>This was indeed one of the most important,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                        <hi>Guienne.</hi>
                     </note> but not the only
Service he did the King upon this occasion. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Council
having (as has been said) determin'd to invade the Kingdom in
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:63412:295"/>
several places at once, principally hasted to enter into <hi>Guienne;</hi> to
come to which Province, they were to pass through the Country
of <hi>Labourt</hi> (which is that of <hi>Biscaye</hi>) and by the way highly
threatned the City of <hi>Bayonne.</hi> They knew very well the Duke of
<hi>Espernon</hi> had no Forces to send into that Country; neither had
he had them, durst he indeed have done it, without the consent
of the Inhabitants; lest, being a cholerick, and impatient people,
as they naturally are, any thing he should do of that kind, out of
care to preserve them, should put them upon desperate resolutions,
and make them wilfully lose themselves. They had before they
came so despis'd the Enemies Forces, that they would not endure
any one should think of contributing to their preservation; a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
that did nor a little afflict the Duke, who had been of old
acquainted with the humour of this people, and knew them to
be as timorous, and dejected when any danger was near at hand,
as they were stout and haughty, when it was remote, and out of
the prospect of their fear. Not daring therefore to rely upon the
valour, and Fidelity of such a people in an Affair of so high impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and moreover importun'd by the intelligence he receiv'd
from all parts, that the Enemy was ready to enter the Country, he
departed from <hi>Bordeaux</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> arriv'd the tenth at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac,</hi>
and the sixteenth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Bayonne;</hi> with a diligence so much above
the strength of a man of his Age, that at his arrival there he was
surpriz'd with a sharp,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> falls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> and a dolorous distemper, so violent a
Fever accompanying his pain, that for some days his Friends, and
Servants knew not, what to hope would be the issue of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.
Though the Duke had with him no other Forces, save only
his Company of <hi>Gens d' Armes,</hi> his Guards, and an hundred or
sixscore Gentlemen Volunteers, he notwithstanding stuck not,
boldly to expose his Person, for the security of that Frontier, in
the preservation whereof consisted the safety of the whole
Country.</p>
                  <p>He was scarcely there arriv'd, when the people came running
in crowds with news that the Enemy was upon the point to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
who also on their part follow'd the intelligence so close, that
there was scarce any interval betwixt the report of their coming,
and their being come.<note place="margin">The <hi>Spanish</hi> Army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into <hi>Biscay.</hi>
                     </note> The Duke, though exceedingly ill, would
by no means, that in an Affair of this Consequence they should
conceal any thing from his knowledge; neither did he upon the
first intimation fail to take order for all things with as much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and care, as if he had been in the greatest vigour of health:
wherein his instructions were also such, as had they been duly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,
and observ'd, the Enemy would have met with greater
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:63412:296"/>
difficulties than they did; and their Entry into this little Country,
though open on all sides, would have cost them, both more time,
and more blood, then they laid out upon this occasion. But what
he had order'd with so much prudence, and foresight, was very ill
obey'd; and the people of the Country no sooner saw the Enemy
appear, than they fled before them, none of their Leaders being
able to prevail with them to stand, or so much as once to face
about in any place of what advantage soever.</p>
                  <p>The Duke sometime before he advanc'd towards this Frontier,
foreseeing what work and trouble the invasion of a Forein Army
was likely to create him, had intreated the King to send the Duke
<hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son, who also had the Government of <hi>Guienne</hi>
settled upon him in reversion, to his assistance; who according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
came to him to <hi>Bayonne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> comes to his Father to <hi>Bayonne.</hi>
                     </note> the same day the Enemy entred the
Country, and who having, as he pass'd by <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> heard of the
Sickness of the Duke his Father, was by that ill news oblig'd to
take Post, and was but newly alighted when intelligence was
brought, that the Enemy was entring, and that thereupon had
followed a great confusion amongst our own people. The Duke
at this news was not a little distracted, betwixt two contrary Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
by which he was at one, and the same time assaulted, either
of paying the assistance to which he was in Nature, and Duty
bound, to a good and languishing Father, or of pursuing what
his Honour, and Bravery exacted from him, for the Service of
his Prince, and Master: But that debate betwixt his Piety, and
Honour was soon determin'd by the Father himself; and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
tenderness they had for one another was soon overcome, by
the Affection they both had to their common duty. It was in
the close of the Evening when the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> arriv'd at
<hi>Bayonne,</hi> and the night was no sooner pass'd, when mounting
on Horseback with some persons of on Condition, who had
there waited in expectation of his coming, he went out to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Countenance of the Enemy: but neither his Presence,
Exhortations, nor Example could work any effect upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people; whose Spirits had by the first days fright been so
strangely subdu'd, that it was impossible to raise them the next, to
any tolerable degree of resolution: so that in this general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation,
all he could possibly do was to retreat without disorder,
which also was not to be done without a very great deal of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
The Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> engag'd his Person so far to make good
this Retreat, and to preserve the little Honour he had to manage
in this Encounter, that he very often ran a very great hazard of his
life, and certainly expos'd himself more, than he was any way
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:63412:296"/>
oblig'd to do, when being in the end retir'd (himself always the
last man) he commanded <hi>la Roche</hi> Captain of the Duke his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Guards, and also of his own, to make good the Bridge
(which separates the <hi>Bourg</hi> of <hi>Siboure,</hi> from that of <hi>Saint Iean de
Luz</hi>) against the Enemy that follow'd very close in his Rear.
This Order was not to be executed without infinite danger, but
the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> well enough knew, that he, to whom it was
given, would not bely his former Actions; neither did <hi>la Roche</hi>
deceive his expectation, who with forty Musketeers only which
he had under his Command, stop'd the torrent of a Victorious
Army, and after having kill'd two hundred of their men upon
the place, amongst whom were eight or ten of their best Officers,
and having by that means given our Foot time to put themselves
into a place of safety, after he had sufficiently manifested his own
Conduct, with the Valour and Dexterity of his Souldiers, he
drew up the Draw-Bridge that lay over the middle of the River,
and with very little loss retir'd to the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi>'s Troop,
who staid to make good his Retreat.</p>
                  <p>After this manner the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces possess'd themselves of the

point of Land, jetting out into the Sea, convenient, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
enough for Fortification; but those of the Country would
never consent to have it fortified. Which notwithstanding
the place of it self was of so advantageous a situation, that they
had ventur'd to put into it two hundred Souldiers; who having
had leisure to cast up some Works, made a countenance before
the arrival of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, there bravely to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
but their Resolution was of no long continuance, the
fear of the people soon infected the Souldier; and some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who upon other occasions had given testimony of their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
having been appointed to command them, were so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as not to preserve the same Reputation here. So that to be
short, contrary to the opinion of the two Dukes, the Father, and
the Son, and of all the men of Command about them, the
place was deliver'd up without the least resistance, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
at the same instant there fortified themselves.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be believ'd what a terror the entry of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and

out of this belief to present themselves before <hi>Bayonne,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnish'd
of all things necessary for its defence, gave the Duke
time by that means to make the Inhabitants reassume their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
courage; and that to such a degree, as from the despair of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to defend themselves, being grown to a confidence of
doing it with honour, and advantage, they were soon in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to repel any thing the Enemy could attempt against them.
The Duke seeing them in this good disposition,<note place="margin">They are encourag'd by the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> caus'd a Review
to be made of all such as were able to bear Arms, which upon
examination were found to be nine hundred only; and which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he so encourag'd, what by the consideration of their
Duty, and their own Interest (an Argument as prevalent at least
as any whatever in the minds of men) that they all unanimously
swore to him, to live and dye in the defence of their City. Such
as were not capable of bearing Arms, were employ'd at the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
which were yet imperfect; a labour wherein the more
delicate Sex would no more be spar'd than the men; by which
means the work was follow'd on all hands with so unwearied a
Diligence, that what remain'd to be done, was perfected in fewer
days, than months would have been requir'd before the Enemies
approach. This being thus provided for, they proceeded in the
next place to examine what Grain was in the City; of which
search <hi>Vertamont, Intendant de la Iustice</hi> had the charge committed
to his care:<note place="margin">The order taken by the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi> for the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such, that in three days the place must infallibly have been lost,
had the Enemy presently clap'd down before it; for there was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little Corn to be found, and no Flower at all, all the Mills
were without the City, and the nearest of them a League distant.
This defect was therefore of all things to be supply'd, which alone
renders all sorts of Provision, how great soever the Store, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
useless: that therefore in a few days was accordingly done;
and being the City, which is divided from the rest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by the <hi>Doux,</hi> a great and deep River, was not to be reliev'd
but on that side: The Duke was especially solicitous to secure
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:63412:297"/>
the wodden Bridge that affords the City communication with the
Suburb <hi>du</hi> St. <hi>Esprit,</hi> and from thence with the rest of <hi>France,</hi> by
the County of <hi>Lannes.</hi> To that end therefore he caus'd two good
Forts to be trac'd out in his own presence upon two Eminences
that commanded that Bridge; and made the Work to be so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
follow'd, that they were in a few days put into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of defence. They also by his order hastened the Leavies for
some Recruits that were raising in <hi>Guienne,</hi> that they might be put
into those two Forts, by which means they were sufficiently
man'd. He moreover put three months Provision into the City,
gave order for the perfecting of the Fortifications, wholly reassur'd
the Inhabitants, and put the place into so good a condition, that
nothing for the future, but by a regular Siege, was to be effected
against it. After having thus provided for the safety of this City,
he prepar'd himself to go take order for the defence of the other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that were upon this Frontier, which were also in no little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
yet was it not before he had further supply'd the necessities of
the Inhabitants of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> who complaining to him that their
Corporation was reduc'd to so great poverty, that it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for them to provide against a thousand little Accidents
that might happen to them, mov'd at their entreaties, he left with
them all the money he had left of the Expence of his House, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to four and twenty thousand Livers, which was owing to
him at his Death, and was the only money he ever lent upon Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
and at Interest in the whole time of his Life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew nothing of the ill condition of this place,<note place="margin">A remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight in the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>

was then too late. They declar'd however, to the Duke's Glory,
and in their own Vindication, <hi>That they did not repent them of their
wary manner of proceeding; but that if it were to do again, they should
do the same, and that they could never think a place ill Fortified, that
had a Duke of</hi> Espernon <hi>to defend it.</hi> The Duke, what testimonies
soever they so highly, and publickly gave, of the esteem they had
of his Vertue, was not notwithstanding so to be charm'd with
the Harmony of their Praises: but that being inform'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
despairing for the future of being able to effect any thing
upon <hi>Bayonne</hi> by force, was determin'd to pass the River <hi>Doux,</hi>
to fall upon <hi>Dacqs,</hi> by that means to cut off all Relief that could
be put into <hi>Bayonne;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> goes from <hi>Bayonne</hi> to <hi>Dacqs.</hi>
                     </note> to the end, that of it self, and without the
expence of a Siege, it might fall into their hands; he departed

in all the cares and troubles of this Expedition, to take order
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:63412:298"/>
for the defence of this little place, which they also in six days
that they made their abode there, what by their Vivacity, and
good Conduct, and partly at their own expence, put into so
good a posture of safety,<note place="margin">And from thence sends a Dispatch to the King.</note> that it was out of all danger of Surprize.
Having thus provided for the security of the most Important
Places, they dispatch'd away a Gentleman to the King, to give his
Majesty an Account of what they had done for his Service, and to
receive his Commands, what they were to do for the time to
come.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Dacqs</hi> they went to <hi>Mont de Marsan,</hi> where they yet
made some stay, as well in reference to the securing that place, as
also to be better satisfied concerning an intimation had been given
them, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army was resolv'd to pass the River in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to some notable Attempt. To this end Captain <hi>la Roche</hi> was
sent to discover nearer hand the depth of the Enemies Designs;
who soon perceiv'd by the Works they had begun at <hi>Socoa,</hi> that
they had no thoughts of making any further progress into the
Country that Winter. Having therefore at his return given his
Masters this assurance, upon his Report, which they found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be very true, they continued on their way towards <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux.</hi>
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the other side applying themselves to their
Fortifications, labour'd more successfully, than they imagin'd, to
the Glory which was reserv'd for the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
the ensuing year; and having in the mean time lost all hopes
of advancing further into the Country by force of Arms, fell to
Caballs, and practices to seduce the Inhabitants of <hi>Labourt</hi> over
to their side. They promis'd them Peace, freedom, Security, and
all other advantages they could desire, if they would cohabit
with them; they offer'd Protection to all such as would continue
Neuters in their own Houses: but they threatned no little punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to those, who should retire into <hi>France.</hi> All which Artifice
nevertheless prevail'd nothing with the <hi>Biscains,</hi> there being not
so much as any one Family, that did not prefer a voluntary Exile,
before any Benefit, or Immunity that could derive from the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                     </note> So that if they were in the beginning
condemn'd by some, for having manifested too little heat at the

who would rather choose to abandon their Country, and
Fortunes, than to enjoy them in the greatest quiet, and security,
under the usurpation of a Forein and invasive Power.</p>
                  <p>As it was evident enough both by the number of the Enemy,<note place="margin">Anno 1637.</note>
and the good condition wherein they had had the leisure to fortifie
themselves, that it was impossible to attempt any thing against
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:63412:298"/>
them, but by means proportionable to the greatnes of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
the Duke sate still at <hi>Bordeaux</hi> in expectation of Orders from
Court for their future proceeding. But they waited not long, <hi>Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
which was the Gentleman they had dispatch'd thither, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to <hi>Bordeaux</hi> almost as soon as they, furnish'd with several
very favourable Dispatches; wherein after the King had highly
magnified the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>'s Conduct, who by so little means
had preserv'd that Frontier, his Majesty proceeded to let him
know, he infinitely desir'd the Enemy might be disoblig'd from
the places they had already possess'd; promising in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
Men, Provisions, Ammunition, a Train of Artillery, and
what was necessary to the execution of so great a design: All this
notwithstanding remain'd in terms of a bare promise only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever coming to the least effect; nay, there was not so much
money to be had, as would serve for the raising of two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Foot, and four Troops of Horse; though the Duke
had not so much as one Souldier in the Province: a Summe,
which though it amounted not to above fifty thousand Livers, yet
the Exchequers of the several Provinces, and the King's other
Bancks being totally exhausted, there was a necessity for the Duke
to advance it,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> raises For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his own money.</note> out of his own private Stock, which he also was
willing to do; and though it went something hard with him, had
much rather in this urgency of his Majesties Affairs, lay out the
money of his own private Revenue (for of two years he had not
touch'd one peny of the King's) than that the Country the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had invaded should be left unto them, which also was not to
be preserv'd, but by the opposition of some considerable Forces.</p>
                  <p>While the Frontier of <hi>Bayonne</hi> found work enough for the two
Dukes, the Royal Arms were employ'd for the recovery of <hi>Corbie;</hi>
that being almost the only place of importance, the Enemy had
made a Conquest of, with all their long, aud mighty preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In the beginning of this Siege, there was scarce any who did
not believe the Fortune of the Cardinal depended upon the event
of that Enterprize, and that, should the King happen to be baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
before it, his Majesty weary of maintaining the Quarrels of
his Minister (for such were all the Wars of Europe at that time
time reputed) at so vast an expence of Treasure, and with so much
disquiet to his Kingdom, would infallibly sacrifice him to the
Animosities of Strangers, and the Discontents of the Great Ones
of his own people, who equally desir'd his Ruine: But the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of this Leaguer, more speedy, and fortunate than was to be
expected, having reconcil'd the Cardinal to the Kings opinion,
and astonish'd all those who had prophesied an alteration in his
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:63412:299"/>
Fortune, every one was strook with admiration at a prosperity so
beyond all example, insomuch that even those who had most
thirsted after his Ruine, were the first to congratulate him for
the good success. 'Tis said that of those there were some, who,
that they might with greater Elegancy shrowd themselves from
any jealousie the Cardinal might entertain against them, made no
difficulty to prostitute their own Fidelity, and Honour, in disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Secrets either of their Masters, or Friends, to him who
was their common Enemy. It was by that sort of people (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd)
that the Cardinal had intelligence of a Plot, wherein the
<hi>Monsieur,</hi> and the <hi>Count de Soissons</hi> had conspir'd against him,
with whom the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> was also deliver'd to him for
one, who had a great hand in this Affair;<note place="margin">The fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that from thence the Cardinal laid the design to persecute his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
and his own particular Fortune to the last extreme; so that
from that time forward, there was neither bound, nor moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the implacable Hatred he conceiv'd against him upon this
very account. How far the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi>'s Resentments might
transport him towards the Cardinal, I cannot tell; but I am well
enough inform'd in the ill usage he receiv'd from him, as well in
the person of the Duke his Father, as his own, to be bold to say,
that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and his own condition; so that he only paid him what
respect was due, and nothing more: a way of living that by no
means satisfied the Cardinal, who would exact from all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, a Reverence without all reserve. A vanity of his,
that although the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> was very perfect in, yet did
not that knowledge make him alter his resolution, choosing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to live with him in a less degree of Favour, than to beg Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and Employments at the price of his own Honour. Many

with one another, and so equally dispos'd to a final Rupture,
would at one time or another produce their ordinary effect. An
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:63412:299"/>
occasion presented it self at the Enemies entring into <hi>Picardy,</hi> and
about the taking of <hi>la Capelle.</hi> The Baron <hi>du Bec</hi> was Governour
of this place, which this Gentleman very well known to, and
entirely belov'd by the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> had surrendred sooner,
than the Cardinal could have wish'd, for want (as he pretended)
of Provision. The Cardinal, who by an example of high severity,
would oblige the Governours of other places to hold out to the
last extremities; or perhaps by that means to justifie himself to
the King, from any censure he might undergo, as Prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of State, in not having sufficiently provided for the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of so important a place, caus'd an Honourable Council im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to be Assembled. This Council consisted of all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Crown, who were then to be found in <hi>Paris,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with some Counsellors of State, whose business it must be
to condemn the Baron <hi>du Bec,</hi> as convict of Cowardise, and
Treachery, to a privation of his Life and Honour. The Duke
<hi>de la Valette</hi> was amongst the rest summon'd to this Assembly,
wherein as he saw he was not call'd to it to deliver his free Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the Gentleman was beforehand mark'd out for Ruine,
and that Sentence of Death must consequently ensue; so did he
endeavour with all the art he had to decline having any thing to
do in that business: but it was altogether in vain. The Cardinal
would admit of no excuses, but after having sent three times to his
House to seek him, <hi>Chavigni,</hi> Secretary of State, went the fourth
time to tell him plainly, he must either satisfie, or absolutely break
with the Cardinal. This express, and positive Declaration prevail'd
in the end with the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> to go to the Council; but it
was not nevertheless to comply in the least with the animosities
of others. The Baron <hi>du Bec</hi>'s Affair was laid open in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the King, and the Cardinal, and the greater part of the
Judges concluded the Crimes laid to his charge, sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the party accus'd: but the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> did not think
himself oblig'd to be of that opinion, and consequently could
not consent to his Condemnation. If the Cardinal had manifested
something of vehemency, in importuning the Duke to come
to the Council, he express'd yet a far greater indignation to find
him of a judgment so far dissenting from his own, insomuch
that at his coming out of the Council, taking the Duke <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi>
aside, he could not contain himself from breaking into very
unhandsome Language, proceeding to so bitter, and so injurious
expressions, that the Duke was not able to forbear giving a very
smart Reply, the Reverence due to the place where they then
were permitting him at that time to do no more; though such as
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:63412:300"/>
were acquainted with his temper, will easily judg, that he would
omit no occasion of manifesting a higher resentment. In the heat
of this Discontent he receiv'd the Command of which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
spoken, to go joyn himself with the <hi>Count dc Soissons</hi> in
<hi>Picardy;</hi> and then the Cardinal could find some expressions of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
and Complement, to smooth him withal, at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but an Offence being much harder to be repair'd, than
committed, the Wound the Duke carried along with him in his
Bosom, was not to be clos'd by so slender a Remedy. It was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after this that the Cardinal was inform'd, the Duke <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi>
had hearkened to the Propositions had been made to him by
the <hi>Count d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that the <hi>Monsieur</hi> was also consenting with them.</p>
                  <p>At the time the Cardinal receiv'd this intimation, the Duke <hi>de

                     <note place="margin">And send to the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to engage him in their Quarrel.</note> they dispatch'd away thither first

address themselves to the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> that by his perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Father might be rendred more favourable to their desires:
But this Duke, who had much rather be alone expos'd to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's
whole stock of hatred, than to disquiet the old Age of the
Duke his Father, by interessing him in his Quarrels, freely told
them, <q>That the <hi>Monsieur,</hi> and the <hi>Count</hi> were to expect nothing
from his Mediation in this Affair: That he was indeed resolv'd
to follow his Fathers Resolutions; but that he would never
prompt him to any thing that might trouble his repose.</q>

who came last, and who would not depart without a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
resolution, finding no hopes of concurrence in the Duke <hi>de
la Valette,</hi> desir'd to talk in private with the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
He was accordingly admitted into his Chamber, at ten of the
Clock at night, after all his Servants were retir'd, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to him, <q>The immediate danger wherein two great
Princes of the Blood were at this time engag'd by the violence
of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> their, and his particular Enemy: That
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:63412:300"/>
in securing their lives he might also establish his own Fortune,
and that of his Family: That he knew very well how great was
the number of discontented persons, how violent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of the people, and how intolerable the oppression of all
the several Orders of the Kingdom: That all these favourable
dispositions wanted only some considerable heads, to work
their common safety by the ruine of the Cardinals Affairs:
That there was not a person in the Kingdom, who would not
be ready speedily to joyn with these Princes, seeing their good
intention for the Redress of the Publick, should their cause be
supported by his prudent Conduct: That this Act would
crown all the other actions of his life, for ever establish the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of his own Family, and render oblig'd to him for their
Lives, and Honour, two Princes, the one the Son, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the King his Master's, his own Nephew, and Friend;
and the other so passionately enamour'd of his Vertue, that he
would with all his heart lay aside his condition, to obey his
Orders in the conduct of those things they were to pursue for
their common safety.</q> All these Reasons, how plausible soever
in themselves, and how handsomly soever laid before him, were
not yet of force to shake a man so firm, and so confirm'd in his
Duty, as the Duke of <hi>Espernon;</hi> who, although he very well
knew, and that it was no hard matter for him to judg by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of these Princes, and of most of the great men of the
Kingdom, that the Cardinal would not long hold his hand
from striking at his Fortune, which was the only one almost that
remain'd unshaken, would nevertheless rather choose to lie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

                     <q>That he
was the <hi>Monsieur</hi>'s most humble Servant, that he was the <hi>Count</hi>'s
also: That they did a great deal of Honour in reposing so
great a confidence in him, as to communicate so much of their
Interests, and Designs: That they could not do it to one that
was a more faithful Servant both to the King, and to them, or
more passionate for their good: That the greatest testimony he
could possibly give them of that passion, was, humbly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech,
and (if he durst be so bold) to advise them, to have
speedy recourse to his Majesties Bounty, and Royal Favour:
That for what concern'd himself, he was very sensible of all the
ill usage he receiv'd from Court; but that he did by no means
impute it to the King: That seeing also he could not do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
right, without offending him, he rather chose still to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the oppression under which he now suffer'd, than to revenge
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:63412:301"/>
himself of his particular Enemies, by troubling the Peace of
the Kingdom, and by adding the mischief of a Civil War to
those miseries wherewith the poor people were already afflicted:
That he did most humbly conjure these Princes by the name,
and quality they bore, and by the Interest they had in the Good
of the Kingdom, to do the same, and to surrender all their
Animosities, and Discontents to the Publick, leaving to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which was just, the Revenge of their Wrongs: That as
to the rest, they might assure themselves the Secret they had
been pleas'd to entrust him withal, should be faithfully lock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d
up in his heart, and that he would suffer all sorts of Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
rather than revel it.</q> 
                     <hi>Montresor</hi> being able to obtain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more of the Duke, return'd with this answer back to the
<hi>Monsieur</hi> his Master; who either prevail'd upon by the Duke's
advice, or obeying the natural affection he had to the good of the
Kingdom, very readily embrac'd the first overtures of Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
that were from the Court presented to him: But the
<hi>Count de Soissons,</hi> not thinking it convenient to trust the Cardinal,
what faithful, and sincere reconciliation soever could be promis'd
to him, retir'd himself to <hi>Sedan,</hi> from whence he never more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd.</p>
                  <p>As there is no secret that time does not in the end discover, the
advice the Duke had given the <hi>Monsieur,</hi> upon the Propositions he
had sent him, was not long conceal'd from the knowledge of the
Court. I am certain the discovery was neither made by the Duke,
nor by any of his, the Fidelity, and Secresie he observ'd towards
these Princes, giving on the contrary the Chancellour <hi>Seguier</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to complain of him. This true Friend of his having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
his Prudent, and Loyal Conduct, in this so important
Affair, writ to him, after other things, in these terms, <q>Give
me leave to assure you that the King is infinitely satisfied with
your Behaviour: I was ever confident, and have ever said, that
the Princes solicitations would never prevail with you, who can
entertain no overture, nor embrace no Proposition inconsistent
with your Masters Service. I have learn'd this excellent Maxim
from your self, and your Actions have ever been so pure from
any blemish of that kind, that your Fidelity, which will stand
for a President to succeeding Ages, was never in any possibility
of being suspected; and did you stand in need of any one to
undertake for you in this case, I should offer my self to be the
man. I hope the Answer you sent this great Prince will
make him see his own good, and consider that of the Kingdom:
We here expect his Resolution, which we doubt not but will be
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:63412:301"/>
very good; forasmuch as all things he has desir'd of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Bounty are granted to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> The Duke, who little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
such a Complement as this, and that had not given the
<hi>Monsieur</hi> this counsel with any intent to obtain thereby a thanks
from the King, return'd the Chancellour a very civil Answer;
but sent him word withal, <q>That if he had observ'd him in those
times wherein they had serv'd the King together wholly intent
upon his Majesties Interests, he was so far from having lost any
thing of that Zeal, and Affection, that on the contrary those
years which had pass'd over his head, had only serv'd to confirm
him in his Duty; but that he was infinitely surpriz'd to hear
the Court should be inform'd that he should have us'd any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to the <hi>Monsieur</hi> concerning the present Affairs, of force
to make him consider what he did owe to the Service of the
King, the good of the Kingdom, or his own preservation:
That he could assure him since his Highness depa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ted last from
Court he had not seen him, nor any one employ'd by him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had he directly, or indirectly heard from him at all: That
the discourse therefore which had done him this good Office
with the King, must be something he might perhaps have said
in publick without other design, than the vanity he had upon all
occasions to manifest his passion to his Majesties Service, and to
exhort all men to continue firm in that Duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
was by no means satisfied with this Answer, it seeming to
him that the Duke was therein more reserv'd, than became their
old acquaintance, or the entire confidence he might safely repose
in his Friendship: but the Duke, who would by no means do the
<hi>Monsieur</hi> the least ill office, or fail in his Fidelity to him, chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to give his friend this little discontent, which he also knew
would soon be forgot, than to fail in his Faith, which would be
an eternal blemish to him, and so great a forfeit to Honour, as he
could never have forgiven himself, as it had been impossible for
him ever to repair.</p>
                  <p>Although the Cardinal prepossess'd with the ill Offices had
been done by the Duke <hi>de le Valette</hi> had conceiv'd that high distaste
against him, he usually manifested in such cases; he nevertheless
made shift to smother it upon this occasion.<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction with the Dukes of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette.</hi>

things necessary for the execution of a great Design. Had any

would have needed little perswasion to undertake the Enemy in
what posture soever they had been: but the whole Winter almost
being laps'd in vain expectation, the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> conceiving,
that, if he did not do something of himself, the Enemy might be
so establish'd upon the Frontier, that it would be afterwards a
matter of extraordinary difficulty to dislodge him, advanc'd with
the sole Regiments of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and of <hi>Mun,</hi> compos'd of the
Duke his Father's Servants, and his own, and rais'd at their own
charge. He found upon the place their Company of <hi>Gens-d' Armes,</hi>
and two Troops of Light-Horse, with which small Forces he
undertook to oppose the progress of an Enemy three times as
strong as himself in number of men; he forc'd them from some
posts of Advantage they had fortified in the Country; and so
straitned their Quarters, and constrain'd them to lie so close in their

Peasants, but old Souldiers of the most Warlike Provinces of
the Kingdom, who having long follow'd the Profession of Arms,
and not being able so soon to reduce themselves to their former
condition, would in the disorders of popular Insurrection seek
out that licence, the sweets whereof they had sometime tasted,
when their Riots had been in some measure justified by their Arms.
Most Commotions of this nature have been observ'd to proceed
by certain degrees, and the forming of the design has usually been
discover'd, before the clap of Thunder has been heard; they
commonly advance step by step, and proceed from one gradation
to another, to their determinate end: but this at its very birth
appear'd in that excessive and formidable height, that like great
Conflagrations which have long been smothering before they have
broken out, it cast out flames in a moment, which were hardly
possibly to be extinguish'd.<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Rebels,</note> The first Intelligence the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>
receiv'd of this accident, was, that there were already
above thirty thousand men in Arms, and it was true: amongst
whom many Gentlemen of good Quality were so indiscreet as to
engage; who though none of them was able to govern so unruly,
and so confus'd a rabble, they nevertheless made choice of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
a Borderer of <hi>Perguex,</hi> call'd <hi>la Mothe-la-Forest</hi> to be their
General, enforcing him to accept of that unhappy Command.
This poor Gentleman finding himself the first day oppress'd with
so great a burthen, after having in vain tty'd all ways to disingage
himself, was fain in the end to undertake to Head them; wherein
the most prudent thing he did, was to reduce this great multitude
to regular number, by choosing out of the best Souldiers, and
such as were best Arm'd, ten thousand good men, and dismissing
the rest home to their own houses with order to be ready to March
upon the first Summons.<note place="margin">And their progress.</note> This crew of Rakehells, made indeed
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:63412:303"/>
in a few days a very considerable progress; but it was without
any manner of opposition; the people generally having so great
a kindness for the Rebellion, that there was scarce a City in the
Province, which they might not conclude to be their own. They
were receiv'd into <hi>Bergerac,</hi> and had possess'd themselves of the
Stone-Bridge which is upon the River <hi>Dordogne;</hi> they were
moreover so confident as to fall upon <hi>Saint Foy,</hi> and had not the
Duke fortified the honest Inhabitants, against the licence of the
baser sort of people, by sending first <hi>Coderé</hi> a Souldier of his
Guards, a brave, and understanding fellow, and after him one
of his Gentlemen call'd <hi>Friget,</hi> with an hundred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd fifty Foot,
rais'd amongst his own Vassals, the place had infallibly been lost.
It was a Town of no little importance at this time; for beside the
advantage of its situation, all the Arms the <hi>Mareschal de St. Luc,</hi>
the King's Lieutenant of the Province, and particular Governour
of this place, had formerly taken away from <hi>Broüage</hi> when he
left that Government, were in the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> as also some pieces of
Cannon, which would have supply'd the Rebels with such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,
as would have encourag'd, and enabled them to attempt
the best Cities of the Province.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> having in this extremity no more, than
three very weak Regiments, which had been lately reform'd,
and that by little and little, were drawing together in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
to go towards the Frontier, the Service to which they were
design'd; writ to <hi>St. Torse Aide de Camp,</hi> who commanded them, to
draw them out against the Mutineers: but that Gentleman, more
discreet, and circumspect, than the Duke could have wish'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so urgent an occasion, chose rather betimes to abandon his
Quarters to the Rebels, than to do them the honour to dispute
them by any the least opposition.</p>
                  <p>The Duke after this seeing no means left to suppress this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Faction, which every day increas'd to a more formidable
height, and startled with the news he receiv'd from all parts, that
some of the best Cities were ready to revolt, and only expected
the approach of the Rebels to receive them; writ in all haste to
the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> to come speedily to the Relief of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
with some of those Forces he had with him upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
since those in the Lower <hi>Gascony</hi> were not able to make head
against the mischief already grown too great to be withstood. The
Duke at this Summons, without deliberating upon the Duke his
Father's Command, immediately put himself upon his March;
but yet so that the Forein Enemy still continued shut up within
their Trenches by the Marquis <hi>de Poganne Mareschal de Camp,</hi> with
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:63412:303"/>
whom during his absence he left the Command of the Army,
whilst himself came to do the King, the Kingdom, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>Being come to <hi>Cadillac,</hi> where his Father expected him sick (for

as he was at that time in a condition to give, he early the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
took Horse to go in all haste to <hi>Marmanda.</hi> The Duke his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had already there caus'd some Troops to be gather'd together
under the Command of the Marquis <hi>de Monferrant Mareschal de
Camp,</hi> and Lieutenant of his own Company of <hi>Gens-d' Armes;</hi>
where the Duke was no sooner arriv'd, but he understood
that at <hi>la Sauvetat,</hi> a little Town about four Leagues off, there was
a considerable Body of the Rebels, who had there fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and made shew of a resolute Defence; an information
that made him immediately March his Forces that way to go to
assault them. All the strength he had with him were no more
than two thousand five hundred Foot; but the Enemy were very
many more, which notwithstanding he made no difficulty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to go view the place. At the first sight he apprehended the
danger of assaulting them without Cannon, fortified as they were
on every side either with Walls, or strong Barricado's; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Officers about him were of opinion, he should stay
for some Field-Pieces, he had order'd to follow after: but having
consider'd, that to dally with these kind of people only, were to
give them greater encouragement, and to augment their Insolence;
he gave order upon the instant to go on to the Assault. I have
heard several who were present at, and had a share in this Action,
say, that the Assault was as vigorously given, and as obstinately su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staind,
as any they had ever seen, though they had been in many
very memorable occasions, and that they should eternally lament,
that what was there on both sides perform'd, had not been done
against the Enemies of the Crown; since doubtless whatever
they had undertaken must have succeeded to their immortal Glory.
The Duke's men fir'd no further off than at the Muzzle of the
Musket, and the other party did the same;<note place="margin">The Rebels suppress'd by the Duke <hi>de la Valette.</hi>
                     </note> so that on either side a
great many men, with some Officers of the Duke's Regiments
were slain: and the slaughter had questionless been much greater,
had the besieg'd been furnish'd with Pikes, to their Fire Arms;
but being destitute of that sort of Defence, they were constrain'd,
after they had discharg'd their Muskets, to abandon their Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado's,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:63412:304"/>
and to retire. <hi>Madaillan</hi> who commanded the Rebels gave
the first example of a cowardly, and shameful flight, whom they
pursu'd as far as <hi>Quercy,</hi> to which place he fled for refuge: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
escap'd the hands of the pursuers, he sav'd himself out of the
Kingdom, from whence he return'd not but to execute one of the

ever have entred into the imagination of an accursed Villain. The
fatal and unhappy circumstances whereof, we shall soon present
before you, wherein this wicked, and abominable wretch will
appear to be both the instrument, and the cause of the Duke's
approaching Death, and Ruine.</p>
                  <p>The forcing of this place was presently follow'd by the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of <hi>Bergerac;</hi> the Mutineers had there made a countenance
of defending themselves: but the example of their Complices
being taken by Assault, render'd them more facile to the perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their General, who was otherwise averse to War, than
as he was compell'd to it by the unbridled Fury of some of the
more violent Spirits, who as they prompted their fellows to
greater mischief, would also urge him on to the greatest extremes.
These two places being thus reduc'd to their Obedience, secur'd
all the other Cities of the Province; so that although some few
of the people continued still on foot, they were rather thought fit
to be undertaken by the ordinary<note n="*" place="margin">Des Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vosts.</note> Officers of Justice, than worth
the pains, or notice of men of Arms.</p>
                  <p>The report of this Defeat soon spread it self into <hi>Angoumois,
Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Poictou,</hi> whither the Duke <hi>de Valette</hi> also sent
some few Forces, of those which were now supernumerary after
this success, and where the people, through fear of punishment,
remain'd in a posture of Obedience; by that means delivering
the Court of one of the greatest, and most troublesome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
wherewith the minds of the great Ministers could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly

                  <p>This Victory was by the Marquis <hi>de Duras</hi> judg'd of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

his Dispatches from Court, wherein he had order, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
power to serve himself with the King's money, and strength
of the Province; and moreover to lay what Impositions they
should together think fit upon the people, for the execution of his
Majesties Designs. The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> very well judg'd what
was to be expected from these kind of Leavies, he knew with
what difficulties, and delays the King's own Revenue was gather'd
in: He was also not ignorant of the little kindness they had for
him at Court: He knew very well that his Obedience herein
might be converted to a Crime, all Leavies of money being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
forbidden, excepting such Taxes as should be impos'd by
the King himself: all which being duly consider'd by him, made

were very ready franckly to expose their Lives for the execution of his
Majesties Commands, provided something of what was necessary might
be added to their Endeavours, that they might attempt to execute his
Orders with some possibility of success: but that he should ever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Tax upon his Majesties Subjects, he most humbly beg'd to be
dispens'd from any such Employment, and that his Majesty would be
pleas'd, since hitherto he had kept his hands clean from any thing of that
kind, he might still preserve his Reputation without exposing it to the
Clamour of his miserable Subjects, whose Necessities were to him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
too well known.</hi>
                     </q> These last words wrought the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
effect imaginable against him, the Court perswading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that he affected Popularity, and sought this way to ingratiate
himself with the people, to the end that he might by their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
be able to maintain himself in his Government, and was
in effect the principal Cause, if not the only Motive, that caus'd
him to be remov'd from thence the ensuing year,</p>
                  <p>Whilst the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was engag'd in these troublesome
Disputes with the Court, the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> continued the
War with the Enemy, after the same manner he had begun,
keeping them close mew'd up in their Trenches, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them to receive any relief from the Country, or so much
as to taste of the Air of the Field, where they never presented
themselves without some notable disadvantage. This way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
War having continued for two whole months together, had
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:63412:305"/>
reduc'd the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to Necessities were no longer to be endur'd;
they were necessitated to have all their Provisions out of their own
Country, and those to be brought to them by Sea, with infinite
hazard, and inconvenience, and at an intolerable expence. The
Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> was very well inform'd of the ill condition to
which they were reduc'd, their Necessities had bred an infinite
number of Diseases in their Camp, and the number of six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men which they were at first, was diminish'd to that degree,
that not above half of them were left alive. In this condition
he prepar'd to make some attempt upon them, and to that end
caus'd those Forces, which by reason of the late Commotions, he
had been oblig'd to leave in the Lower <hi>Gascony,</hi> to advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Frontier; not doubting but at this time to effect that,
which they would have had him some time before have attempted
with almost certain, and apparent ruine: but the Enemy inform'd
of his resolution, by a shameful, and precipitous flight (which
was the highest acknowledgment of their weakness he could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
desire) prevented his design. They embark'd therefore all
their Artillery, their Equipage, and their Sick by night; the Port
of <hi>Socoa</hi> (which they were Masters of) affording them conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
so to do, by the same way, and with so little noise drawing off
the rest of their Forces, that their design was not discover'd, till they
were all aboard. The Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> was no sooner inform'd
of their flight,<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> defeats the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my without Fighting.</note> but that he drew up to the Fort, which was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
to him without resistance: But it is not to be imagin'd
how many several Objects of Misery were to be seen in their
Camp; nor to what extremities, by his long perseverance, they
had been reduc'd. They then quitted him their Forts, giving him
thereby the most absolute, and most happy Victory could possibly
be desir'd; so that he had the good fortune almost without men
(at least with Forces not half so great as the Enemies) without
money (having never touch'd a peny of the King's) almost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Victuals (having had none save what by the industry, and
providence of <hi>Vertamont Intendant de la Iustice</hi> had been convey'd
to the Frontier) and without the loss of any one man of note, to
ruine an entire Army of an invading Enemy, to make them
spend ten months time in vain, to consume Provisions sufficient
for the plentiful subsistence of the greatest Army, and to leave
three thousand of their men behind them, for a testimony of their
Defeat. Yet how great, and of what utility soever this Victory
might be, to the Kingdoms Honour, and Safety, the Court was
notwithstanding dissatisfied with the success; who seeing he had
done more, than any one durst propose to himself, and outstrip'd
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:63412:305"/>
the hopes, and expectation of those who were emulous of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and would have been glad some disaster had befall'n him, were
by no means satisfied with this performance; as if he had not
done enough in doing so much with so little means, and with so
great safety, and reputation to his own Person, and Name. Had
he been at this time in a state of Favour, what recompence might
he not reasonably have expected for two Services of so high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and both perform'd in one Campagne? Which though
he fail'd of through the ill Offices of some, that blinded by Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity
could not discern his Merit; yet such as will make a right
Judgment of things, must maugre the ingratitude, and injustice
of the Age, set a right Value upon them.<note place="margin">Which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless is but cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd at Court.</note> I know very well (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mentioning the Defeat of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, which speaks
sufficiently for it self) that the other exploit has been highly magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by disinterested persons, that had at that time the principal

and absolutely enclin'd, not been suppress'd by the vigour

                     </note> under the
command of the Duke <hi>de Candale,</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi>
his Brothers. These two Generals joyntly commanded the King's
Army in those parts, and so well, that they had in a short time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the Castle of <hi>Cambresis, Maugbeuge,</hi> and <hi>Lendrecies</hi> in the end.
That which was most remarkable in the Siege of this last place,
was, that they employ'd fewer days to take it, than the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had formerly squander'd away months to go
without it; who after a six months Leaguer, had been constrain'd
ingloriously to quit the Siege: And all these things were done in
the very face of the Cardinal <hi>Infanta,</hi> who having been baffled in
two signal Engagements, durst no more make trial of our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
Arms. The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> victorious in two extremities
of the Kingdom, by the Valour of his three Sons, and hoping
that the utility of these important Services for the Crown, would
at least secure the repose of his old Age, thought of nothing more,
than by a gentle hand to compose the Affairs of his own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so to order all things by his Moderation, and Justice,
that the people committed to his Charge, might enjoy the sweets
of Peace, even in the greatest tumults of War. To this end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he with great generosity, and constancy, rejected the offer
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:63412:306"/>
that was made to him, of the Command of a great Army where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to invade the Enemies Country, proposing to himself a
greater glory in maintaining that little part of the Kingdom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
to his care, in security, and peace, than in all the Pomp
that was laid before his eyes to allure him. How great a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
had it been if he could have effected this good design, and by
that means have spun out the remainder of his exceeding old Age
in the calms of Vacancy, and repose? neither was the fault his,
that he did not bring this vertuous intention to the desired end: but
some ambitious, and interested Spirits, having infatuated the
Court with propositions of vain and imaginary Conquests, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
so far with the great Minister, that it was determinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,
the Scene of the War should be transferr'd into <hi>Spain,</hi> and
that by the Siege of <hi>Fontarabie</hi> it should be begun. The Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
was of no small difficulty, as it has since been prov'd;
which the Cardinal also was very perfect in, as having long before
caus'd the place to be consider'd by the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> himself,
who had then diverted him from that design: upon this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
however he would no more remember the reasons by which
he had sometimes suffer'd himself to be over-rul'd; but having
premeditated to engage both the Father, and the Son in an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
wherein he resolved they should both perish, he sent them
positive word, that they must either absolutely undertake this
War, and advance so much money, as was necessary to begin it,
or that the King would send the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> to command his
Arms in <hi>Guienne.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> accustomed of old to
the ill usage of the Court, was nothing surpriz'd with these
Threats; but on the contrary what was laid before him in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Penalty, being conformable to his own desire, he gave
the Court to understand, that he should ever esteem it a great
Honour, to have this Prince a Judg of his Actions; and that he
should be very glad the King would please to give him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in his Government. He wanted not Servants about him,
to disswade him from sending such a Message, and to represent
to him the danger of inviting a greater person than himself into
a place where his Authority was absolute, and where he had no
rival to dispute it with him; laying before him withal many
more examples of such as had repented the having submitted their
Power to a Superiour, than of such as in so doing had found their
expectation answer'd by the event: But the Duke was so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the Affection the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had manifested to him in
these latter times, that he could not possibly entertain the least di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust,
and moreover seeing it was absolutely determin'd, that the
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:63412:306"/>
Province of <hi>Guienne</hi> should bear the burthen of the War with
<hi>Spain,</hi> he had much rather the Expences of the War should be
stated by a great Prince, who by his Quality was priviledg'd from
all Forms, than that he by imposing them should be constrain'd
to submit to the severity of an Inquisition, and be brought by his
Enemies to an Account. But that which most of all confirm'd
him in this Resolution, was the advantage that would thereby
accrue to the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son, who having nothing to
do in Military Affairs, but to execute the Prince's Orders only,
would by that means be nothing accountable for any event of the
War; and as to any thing else, he was very well assur'd, that
what Employment soever should be conferr'd upon him, he
would ever so behave himself, as to deserve no other, than the
greatest honour and applause.</p>
                  <p>Upon these prudent Considerations it was that the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to write to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> to entreat he would please
to accept the Command that was offer'd him in <hi>Guienne,</hi> assuring
him (as it was very true) that nothing could be a greater satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to him, than to have the Honour to kiss his Hands in a place
where he might have opportunity to give him some testimonies
of the passionate affection he had for his Service. Neither was he
satisfied with sending him this Complement from himself alone,
he would moreover make the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> do the same; so
that the Prince, who before would never consent to take upon
him any Employment in the Duke's Governments made thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
no difficulty to accept it: However, things not succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to the Duke's desire, men took hence an occasion
to censure his Discretion, and to condemn his Conduct, (as it
usually falls out) because he prov'd unhappy in the end.</p>

                     </note> but,
before he receiv'd it, had sent to desire leave to retire himself to
his House <hi>Plassac;</hi> of which Request though the pretence was
to enter into a course of Physick for the recovery of his Health;
yet the true reason was, that he might be out of the way of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Disputes with the Prince about the Affairs of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which he could not, without great grief, have seen
afflicted with those miseries wherewith it was threatned; nor
perhaps without expressing such a dislike of that harsh way of
proceeding, as might have given him Offence. A thing which
all the Friends and Servants he had at Court having foreseen, they
had advis'd him to this course; his Sons, who were best acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his tickle, and impatient humour, were of this advice:
but there is great apparence that the first thoughts of retiring were
inspir'd by the Prince himself, who having in other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where the Duke and he had serv'd together, had tryal
enough of his difficult humour, would no more be subject to
those contrarieties he had formerly endur'd, and had therefore
doubtless prompted him with that resolution. The Duke's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
therefore being so conformable to the Princes desires, and
to the sence of the Court, it was no hard matter for him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that in the quality of a favour, which had doubtless been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
him as a punishment, had he not by speaking first preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Command from the King to the same effect; for it had been
from that time forward (as it has been evident since) been resolv'd
upon to withdraw him from his Government, and to suspend
him from all the Functions of his Command. Nevertheless ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lighted so pat upon the humour of the great Ministers, by
the advice of his Friends, he was very civilly treated in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Answer, which was couch'd in these terms.

very well satisfied with this answer, began to make himself ready
to begin his Journey, so soon as the Prince should be arriv'd in
<hi>Guienne;</hi> where, whilst he waited in expectation of his coming,
he pass'd away the time with the Duke <hi>de Candalé</hi> his eldest Son,
entertaining him with greater familiarity, and freedom, than
till that time he had ever done; whose complacency, and fine
Behaviour made at this time so great an impression upon the
Duke his Father, that certainly this Son had never been so dear to
him, as when he was upon the point to lose him; in somuch that
his present joy was no little disposition to augment the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grief soon after occasion'd by his unexpected Death.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> had in the interim of these Dispatches
from the King,<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> is constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make a journey to Court,</note> and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> been oblig'd to make a
Journey to Court, to which he had been engag'd contrary both
to his Majesties express Order, and also his own resolution. He
knew very well the ill Offices had been done him to the Cardinal
since the business of <hi>Corbie,</hi> glanc'd at in the preceding Discourse,
he was moreover very well acquainted with the implacable nature
of the person, who conceiv'd himself so highly offended by him,
to which his power was no less known to him, than his malice;
considerations that altogether had made him positively determine
not to put himself into his hands, that he might not add to the
number of those who had already tasted the utmost effects of his
Indignation; choosing rather to live in his Government in safety,
though in disgrace, than to expose himself to the almost inevitable
dangers he was to wade through to a faint, and dissembled Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.
But how determinate soever he had been in that reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
it was impossible for him to keep it; for those who had
imprudently engag'd his Majesty in a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> as malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
made the Cardinal some overtures of Accommodation, as
a thing solicited by the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> himself, who desir'd
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:63412:309"/>
nothing less, exposing him by that means to the greatest hazard he
perhaps ever ran in the whole time of his Life. The Treaty how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
being thus set on Foot, the Duke seeing himself reduc'd to
a necessity,<note place="margin">But with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</note> either of breaking openly with the Cardinal, or of
going immediately to him, chose in truth the most dangerous
course; but withal that by which he could at that time alone
secure the Fortune of his Family, and the repose of the Duke his
Father, which he ever preferr'd before his own particular safety.
This last consideration therefore prevail'd with him to undertake
this Journey, so that he went to Court, and had some Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the Cardinal; who, because he would make all the use
of him he could before he would destroy him, thinking fit to
spare him at that time, with a dissimulation peculiar to himself,
receiv'd him at the greatest rate of kindness, and feeedom could
possibly be put on; protesting an absolute Oblivion of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
discontents, and making the King to give him the same as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance;
which being done, he dismiss'd him, much more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that he had escap'd the present danger, than any ways se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
of his good intention for the time to come</p>

                     </note> he found the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>
already arriv'd in <hi>Guienne.</hi> The Duke his Father had receiv'd
him at <hi>Bordeaux</hi> with all imaginable Honours; wherein, though
doubtless there was a great deal due to his Quality, as being a
Prince of the Blood; yet it is most certain, that in this unusual
complacency the Duke had an equal regard to his Person. His
respect proceeded so far, that not content to pay him all the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and submission he was capable of in his own person, he
would moreover extend his civility further, by employing his
Authority, and interest with the Parliament of that City for his
full satisfaction. The Prince would that at their coming to visit
him, they should Complement him by the title of <hi>Monseigneur,</hi>
and the Company insisted upon the contrary, as a term at that
time not in use: but the Duke interposing thereupon, the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
he had in the Deputies of that Assembly, prevail'd with them
so far, that the Ceremony pass'd in the end according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
desire.</p>
                  <p>All these Civilities paid by way of advance, met not however
with that acknowledgement the Duke had reason to expect; he
was not ignorant, that although the Prince us'd him with respect
enough in outward shew, he nevertheless did him underhand all
the ill Offices he could; he knew that scarce any, but such as
were his known, and declared Enemies, were admitted to his
presence: That he made himself merry with Stories they repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:63412:309"/>
of his behaviour, and was very attentive to, if not inquisitive
after the Informations of such as were discontented with him:
all which notwithstanding, the Duke very secure in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his own Conduct, did not much concern himself at this
unfriendly way of proceeding, but continued to live with the
Prince at the same respective rate, paying him all imaginable
Honours; and the inclination he had for his Service making him
slight, or give little credit to those flying rumours that daily came
to his ear, he could not be jealous in the least of an Affection
he had by so many Titles so highly deserv'd. It is also true that the
Prince on the other side shew'd him in publick the best counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
he could possibly put on, would do him the honour to dine
with him at his House, and to that purpose invited himself, where
the Duke entertain'd him after his accustomed manner, and with
a splendour natural to him upon such eminent occasions. To
this Entertainment the Prince brought some of his particular
Servants, as the Duke also invited some of his own Friends; so
that the Company consisted of eighteen persons. It has been
thought by some, that this was an appointment purposely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
by the Prince, and those about him, to make themselves
merry with the good old man, and with an intent to put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an extravagant recital of his old actions, full of Honour, and
Glory, to turn afterwards his <hi>Gascon</hi> humour into Mirth, and
Laughter. Neither did they fail to tempt him to it, by falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
discourse of his Favour, Wars, Mistrisses, and other things,
which vain and ambitious men are commonly well enough
pleas'd withal, that they may have an occasion to vent their vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
by speaking loud in their own praises; but the wise old
Duke deceiv'd their expectation; answering to all that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with so great modesty, and discretion, and therein so
highly satisfying all the Company, as gave the Prince impressions
much contrary to those wherewith he had perhaps been prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd,
confirming him more than ever in the opinion of his vertue,
which to him was already well known, and that to such a degree,
that rising from the Table, full of admiration, at so prudent, and
so happy an old Age, I my self heard him say to some of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents,
who perhaps had been brought thither to have their share
of the sport, that certainly (speaking of the Duke) he was the
greatest man in the world.</p>
                  <p>But how great soever he might be, he was not, it seems, so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
to please him now, as he had been at other times; and either
the Prince had chang'd his inclination with the face of Affairs, or
if he yet retain'd a kindness for him, the strict Orders he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:63412:310"/>
from Court, would not give him leave to discover it; so
that he grew impatient of his stay at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> from whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the Duke was resolv'd not to depart, till some Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were first paid him, lest after his back should be once turn'd,
that money might be converted to other use.</p>
                  <p>The delays therefore growing insupportable to the Prince, he
resolv'd to complain of them to the Court, from whence that he
might the more speedily obtain the thing he desir'd (which was a
positive command for the Duke to depart the Province) he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
his Complaint with a very ill Office, which though
deriv'd from a very light occasion, yet in the evil aspect of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Planets of that time, the least pretext was but too powerful
an argument to prejudice a man already proscrib'd for ruine. It
was then no hard matter for the Prince to obtain his desire of the
Court, and that in terms of the greatest severity, it being said that
he had Orders for the Duke to depart from <hi>Bordeaux</hi> without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay, and to retire himself to his House <hi>Plassac,</hi> according
to the leave he had desir'd, and obtain'd, with an Injunction
moreover not to stir from thence till his Majesties further Pleasure.</p>
                  <p>It should seem that the Prince would retain so much respect for
the Duke upon this occasion, as not to afflict him before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
with the knowledge of this severe Command, contenting
himself with communicating the Dispatch to some few only of the
Duke's Friends, and Enemies, without delivering it to himself: but
not one of his Friends would take upon him to be the bearer of
so unwelcome news, all of them generally aprehending lest the
Duke, after so ill usage, and so contrary from what he had reason
to expect at the Princes hands, might lash out into some passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
expressions, that would beget ill blood betwixt them. At last
he departed from <hi>Bordeaux</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> when not conceiving himself to
be so ill us'd either by the Prince or the Court, as he really was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he began his Journey, he would go to receive his Commands;
where after some expressions of Complement, and Respect, he
told him, <q>That he was going to undertake a War, wherein he
would infallibly meet with greater difficulties than had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to him: That it was not likely the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
whose Power throughout all Europe was sufficiently known,
would suffer one of the best places of his Dominions to be lost,
without attempting to relieve it: That he did therefore
humbly beseech his Highness, if any occasion should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
wherein he might be serviceable, either to the King, or
to himself, he would be pleas'd to honour him with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
that in case he would do him that favour, he would
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:63412:310"/>
engage within fifteen days after he should receive his Summons,
to bring him a thousand Gentlemen to the Frontier, at the head
of whom he should take it for a great glory to die, thereby to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his Highness the Honour of a signal Victory.</q> The Duke
might without all doubt have been a great deal better than his
word, had he been made use of upon this occasion, and have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by that means the Battel of <hi>Fontarabie</hi> as illustrious, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful,
as it prov'd cloudy, and malevolent to the <hi>French</hi> R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nown.</p>
                  <p>The Duke was no sooner gone, but that the Prince began to
prepare all things for the War. The Land Army by the exceeding
diligence he used was quickly set on foot: but the Sea Forces were
so long in making ready, that the Prince impatient of their delays,
by which he was likely to lose the season, and opportunity of doing
the Service the King expected from him, advanc'd to the Frontier,
invested the place, and began the Siege. The Enemy alarm'd at the
vigour, and Celerity, wherewith the Prince made his Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
by Land in order to the taking of the place, having the Sea
open to them, two several times convey'd Relief into the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress
in the very face of our Land Army,<note place="margin">The Royal Army baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled before <hi>Fontarabie.</hi>
                     </note> and at one of those put
a Governour into it; a Relief of so infinite importance, as that it
was first the cause of the places preservation, and afterwards of the
disaster that befel the Royal Arms.</p>
                  <p>I shall not trouble my Reader with a long Narrative of the
manner of this Siege, I could on the contrary wish it were in my
power to extinguish the memory of it for ever; not that the
Enemy however obtain'd any so signal reputation by it, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
making use of a kind of Lethargy, of which our whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was at that time sick; so that although they made shift to kill
a few people, that lay without motion, and consequently unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any resistance; yet had they no other advantage by it,
than what their Fortune, and our mischance combin'd together
put into their hands, even beyond their own aim, or expectation.
And this is all I should have said of this business, had not some
endeavour'd to have engag'd the Duke <hi>de la Valett's</hi> Honour in the
miscarriage: but his interests being not to be separated from those
of the Duke his Father, and the concern here being the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Truth, and the defence of both their Honours, from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
and the malice of malevolent men, I co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

open'd the way into the Enemies Country, beating them from

the Trenches they had cast up upon the Banks of the River, to
defend that Pass: That at the Quarter where he commanded in
the Siege,<note place="margin">Reasons for his Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> he had very much advanc'd his Approaches, and so as
had infallibly reduc'd the place to a necessity of being taken on that

but that he gave advice to Fight th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Relief so soon as ever it began
to appear. They know moreover very well, that he had nothing
at all to do in the Siege, at the time it was rais'd, he having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
his Post to the Archbishop of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> by express Order
from the Prince, and under his own hand; that he was above a
League distant from the Battel, when it was sought, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
totally ignorant of the disorder, till he had it from the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways,
who brought the Alarm into his Quarters; he thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
immediately put himself into the head of those men he had
with him: That he rallied as many as he could of those that were
squandered, and that with these, and his own men having staid
the pursuit of the Conquerours, he by that means preserved all
those, who had escap'd from the Defeat. These truths, though
sufficiently known to all the world, were not nevertheless of force
to hinder his Enemies from laying the whole miscarriage of this
business at his door, and from charging him, who was certainly
innocent, with the fault of ten thousand who were guilty. He
was not so much as permitted without a Crime, to set a manly
coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Assurance upon so dangerous an occasion; even his Valour, and
constancy (an unheard of injustice) were the main things in his
Accusation, it being objected against him that he was glad of the
mischance, and was observ'd to laugh at the Defeat; because he
did not appear dejected, and shew'd a countenance, void of fear,
and confusion. He was not however so unjust to them, but has
ever commended (as there was just cause) both the Actions, and
Intentions of those who commanded at this Siege, never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the least of their Sincerity, and passionate desire to serve
the King effectually, and well; and ever believing, that had their
Valour been seconded, as it ought to have been, they would have
obtain'd those advantages over the Enemy, was reasonably to be
expected from their Bravery, and good Conduct: But if the chance
of Arms was contrary to them, if the panick Terror that seiz'd
the Souldier, would not permit them to follow the example of
their Leaders; and if his Counsels which would have procur'd
safety to the Army were not follow'd, or approv'd, why should he
be rendred criminal, for not having been able to prevail upon the
humours, or opinions of other men?</p>

neither would he so much as go to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> to the end
that what accident soever should happen, nothing might reflect
upon him; nor that he might any ways appear responsible for the
event of things, which he ever apprehended would be finister
enough; and seeing the Orders had been left in the Province, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited
in the hands of men of very little Experience, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and who had scarce any other argument to recommend
them to that trust, save only the hatred they openly bare to him;
he very well judg'd by the apparence (which prov'd also in the

were like to be) nothing but disaster, and confusion could

Throne of <hi>France,</hi> that there is not that prosperity can fall within
the limits of Humane Expectation, we may not reasonably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to our selves from so auspicious a beginning. By a Dispatch
from the King, dated the fifth of <hi>September</hi> (the precise day of this
illustrious Birth) the Duke was to order a publick Thanksgiving,
and to cause Bonfires to be made for Joy of this Blessing to his
Majesty, and the whole Kingdom. The Courrier, who had been
expressly dispatch'd away to the Duke, having found him at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillac</hi>
(willing (without all doubt) to flatter his credulity) told
him, <q>

                     </q>
a deceit that gave a strange addition of joy to the good old Duke,
who could not in himself but hug and applaud his own foresight,
by which he had so seasonably prevented the King's desire; and
in that pleasing error he departed from <hi>Cadillac</hi> the 29<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of the same
month to go to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> where being arriv'd, he began the very
same Evening by Bonfires, thundering of Cannon, and by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
numbers of Lights, set up in all the Windows of the City,
to manifest no less his own, than the public contentment; and
for a final testimony of the high satisfaction he had receiv'd by
this good news, he rewarded the Courrier with a Chain of Gold,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:63412:312"/>
to the value of 500. Crowns, which he gave him at the time he
dismiss'd him back with his answer to the King.</p>

The Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> though infinitely surpriz'd, at this evil suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;

and the reputation of his Arms: but understanding soon
after that their commond Enemies endeavour'd to lay the blame of
this baffle upon the Duke his Son, he then began prudently to
apprehend, that in the evil dispositions of the Court against
them at that time, such as were emulous of their Vertue, or that

he commanded me to stay behind in the City, there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
his return. According to which Order I remain'd in the
Town, when hapning one afternoon to be in a House opposite
to the Duke's Place of <hi>Puipaulin,</hi> about three, or four of the
Clock, on a sudden, though the day was exceeding clear, and
bright, there arose so violent a Storm, that after two, or three
Claps of Thunder, a Bolt falling upon the highest Tower of his
Lodgings, first carried away part of the covering, and from thence
piercing through the roof of the main Body of the House, set
fire on some Furniture of considerable value, that were bestow'd
in the Garret, from whence descending lower into the Duke's
own Chamber, it made a great Breach in the Chimney, and
thence piercing further still into the Chamber underneath the
same, wherein his Sons were us'd to lie, it left its mark there also
in the Transom of a Window, which it brake in two pieces, and
proceeded thence to lose it self in the Foundations of the Fabrick.
Who is it that would not have been strook at this ill <hi>Omen?</hi> I must
confess that at that time I was rather willing to ranek this accident
amongst things of chance, than thence to derive conjectures of
any misadventure to come; considering the Portent (if such it
were) threatned him, in whose Honour, and good Fortune, I
was my self so nearly concern'd: So that all I made of it was to
run to the Lodging with a Kinsman of mine, who had been
spectator with me of this Tempest, to look if the flash of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
we had seen to dart upon the Tower, had not fir'd the House;
which prov'd to be no unseasonable precaution, we finding the
Furniture already flaming, so as to threaten the whole Pile with a

was also the only fruit of our Care, and all that could be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Dispatch to the Duke his Father, to entreat him, that by
some one of his Servants, in whom they might equally confide,
he would send him his opinion concerning his Journey to the
King. This Servant accordingly arriv'd at <hi>Bordeaux</hi> the same day
that the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> himself came thither, where he told
him from the Duke his Father, <q>That in an Affair of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of that which was now in agitation, he ought not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
advice from a Father, who was much more solicitous of
his safety than he himself could be: That herein his tenderness
and affection ought to stand equally suspected to them both:
That as he durst not give him counsel to go to Court, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he did, to what a dangerous degree it was animated
against him; so could he not advise him to depart the Kingdom,
perhaps never to see his face again: That therefore he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to clear all those doubts, and thereupon to form his own
determination; wherein if he should resolve upon withdrawing
himself out of <hi>France,</hi>

a Visit would only serve to augment their mutual Affliction:

the more dangerous and unseasonable, as it was the less suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and unforeseen, now totally forsook his Interests to leave
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:63412:313"/>
him in the Arms, and to the protection of his own single Vertue.
The first, and the rudest shock his constancy could possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
was the absence of the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> his beloved Son;
which after he had a few days lamented,<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

compassion of an excellent, and passionately affectionate Father,
he had news brought him of a rumour, that was already spread
at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was to be made sole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and had already receiv'd Orders to dispossess
him of <hi>Chasteau-Trompette,</hi> therein to place one of the King's
Domestick Servants. The Duke had all his best Furniture, besides
other Riches, laid up in this place; who having not so much as
once dream'd of being so suddenly divested of his Command, had
not consequently at his departure out of the Province, remov'd
any thing from thence: Sudden order was therefore to be taken
in an Affair of this importance, and even the very moments of
time to be husbanded, which also were not many more, than
was necessary for the effecting his purpose. Those to whose fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and care he entrusted the management of this business were
so diligent, and so faithful, that in one night, they secur'd to the
value of above a million of Livers, what in Money, Jewels, and
Plate; of which the Money, and Jewels were carried to <hi>Plassac,</hi>
and there safe deliver'd into his own hands, and the Plate was
convey'd to <hi>Cadillac,</hi> and all done with so great secresie, that those
to whom the Government of the place was a few days after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
expected to have found all this Treasure there; which
if they had, it would have been in great danger of being put into
the King's hands, as the Arms, and other of the Duke's own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Goods were, which he could never again recover, to the

their common Enemies began openly to labour the persecution
not only of the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> but of the Duke his Father
also; wherein the Father being no ways questionable for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
of <hi>Fontarabie,</hi> as having had nothing at all to do in that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
he was blemish'd with all the ignominy that malice could
invent, or the tongue of Calumny utter, against a man of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Honour; and his Son, who by his absence lay expos'd
to all the mischief was intended against him, was proceeded
against as a Criminal, and a Traytor. In order to the Duke <hi>de
la Valett</hi>'s Tryal, Accusers, and Witnesses were found out, some
whereof were frighted by menaces, and others suborn'd by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
(for nothing was spar'd upon this occasion) into these excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:63412:314"/>
Offices; and out of this kind of Evidence an Information
was suddenly drawn up, sufficient to darken, and overwhelm the
clearest, and most unspotted innocence in the world. The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
and Services of the Duke <hi>de Candale,</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>de
la Valette,</hi> who commanded the Army of <hi>Italy</hi> were fruitless, and
invalid upon this occasion; nay, they had much ado to prevail
for a little Truce, and cessation from those persecutions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Ruling Powers were resolv'd to disquiet the old Age of
the Duke their Father; and that was granted to them in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of an extraordinary Grace, and Favour, which was hardly to
be excus'd without shame: With so unjust a return were they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for the expence of their Fortunes, the hazard of their
Lives, and their continual vigilancy and care, with an Army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnish'd
of all necessaries of War, to withstand the greatest pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the most dangerous Enemies to the Crown, and
Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>All these Afflictions,<note place="margin">Anno 1639.</note> how great soever, were yet but the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of those, which by the Divine Justice, or Bounty were
prepar'd,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> falls dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously sick.</note> wherewith to exercise the Duke's Vertue. They soon
shifted from outward things, to wound him more sensibly in his
own person; and whether it were the unkindness he took at the
ill usage he daily suffer'd, or the infirmities of his very great Age
only, that occasion'd his distemper, so it was that he fell into the
most acute, and most dangerous Disease, he had ever before su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd,
during the whole course of his Life. He was for four
months together seiz'd with a defluxion of Rhume, by which all
his Members were strangely benumm'd, and that numness ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with excessive dolours in all his parts: from which
pain he no sooner began to find some ease the <hi>March</hi> following,
but that the joy of his Amendment was soon quash'd with the
sad news of the Death of the Duke <hi>de Candale</hi> his eldest Son.<note place="margin">The Death of the Duke <hi>de Candale.</hi>
                     </note> This

with the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Brother; where the tenth day
of <hi>March,</hi> falling ill of a Tertian Ague, and that growing to a
double Tertian at the third Fit, and afterwards to an unintermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Fever, it prov'd in the end mortal the eleventh day of his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
The Cardinal his Brother immediately upon this accident
dispatch'd away a Courrier to the Duke their Father to acquaint
him with it; but some days pass'd over before any one durst tell
him the news, for fear left the grief, which could not but be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great, might cause him to relapse into his former disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from which also he was yet but upon the mending hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="601" facs="tcp:63412:314"/>At last his Servants apprehending it might by some, or other be
indiscreetly and unseasonably blurted out, they conceiv'd it better
with some preparatory arguments, to sweeten the bitterness of
his loss, to make him acquainted with it, than to detain him still
in ignorance of a thing, which could not always, nor very long
be conceal'd from him. The Duke had kept about him during
all the time of his last Sickness, a Father Capuchin, in whom he
repos'd a singular Confidence: This good Father therefore as he
was one day talking with him, having fall'n into a Discourse of
the inconstancy of Humane Life, and the necessity of dying, and
therein slip'd in some mention of the Duke <hi>de Candale</hi>'s Sickness,
the Duke presently understood the rest, and thereupon spar'd the
good man the pains of any further preparation. When his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
wherein before this part of their Discourse something of
chearfulness had appear'd, suddenly changing into a more severe
Gravity (though only so as to compose it to his constancy) he
said, <q>Father, I have ever been dispos'd to submit my self, and
all my concerns to the good pleasure of God; and I beseech him
of his goodness to give me Fortitude enough to conform my
self also to it upon this occasion: My Son is dead, I am certain
of it; and if he died in the fear of God, he is happier than we,
at least out of the reach of those persecutions Fortune is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for us who are left behind.</q> After which they presented
him the Letters that contain'd the Relation of his Death; by
which the Duke being satisfied, it had been very constant, and
Christian, he said again, <q>That he praised God from the bottom
of his heart, that in depriving him of one of his chiefest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
he had yet left him the hope in a short time to see his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on
in a better Life.</q> He afterwards entertain'd himself some time
in pious Discourse with that Holy Man; after which being
again laid in bed, that he yet quitted not, but by intervals, he was
heard in that privacy, a great while to weep those tears, and vent
those sighs, which with extraordinary violence upon himself he
had suppress'd whilst there was any witness by: But after having
paid what was due to the impulse of Nature, he summon'd his
wonted constancy to encounter this Accident; the bitterness
whereof, though he could by no art banish from his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;
yet did he ever keep himself upright from manifesting
his sorrow with the least weakness. There were very few persons
of condition in the Kingdom, who did not signifie to him by
very civil Messages, and kind Letters, the part they shar'd with
him in his grief upon this occasion; amongst whom Cardinal
<hi>Richelieu</hi> himself was one, who made shift to find out some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solatory
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:63412:315"/>
Complements for a man he at the same instant persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the most bloody effects he could possibly inflict upon
him, he at the same time prosecuting the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> to the
last extreme:<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> sentenc'd to Death, with Confiscari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and Estate.</note> For the information that had been drawn up against

<hi>Believre,</hi> amongst the rest, taking upon him the honest
boldness, to defend the innocence of the accus'd, and by an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
no less Judicious, and Eloquent, than hardy and equitable,
acquitting his own Conscience, and confirming himself in the
high esteem already conceiv'd of the great Worth, and Integrity
which for so many happy years have been eminent in his Name,
and Race.</p>
                  <p>It would not become me in this place to inlarge my self upon
the words of this Sentence, it having been pronounc'd by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to whom too great a respect is due, for any one to dare to
complain: neither in truth is it to them, that the severity of it
ought to be imputed: for in criminal matters the Evidence are
the chief Judges, and consequently they at whose doors all that
was extraordinary or severe in his proceeding ought of right to
be laid. It has since appear'd by the high and publick justification
of the party accus'd, and that in the face of the most August Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of Justice in all Europe, what has been thought of the
Depositions that were preferr'd against him, the Parliament of
<hi>Paris</hi> having restor'd him to his Honour, Life, Offices, and Estate,
which had been all taken from him by the Arrest of the Council:
And he has this Obligation to his Enemies, not only by their means
to have had an occasion wherein to vindicate his Innocency, and
Honour:<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> solemnly justified.</note> but moreover to have receiv'd the Eulogies for his
brave Services, which his modesty would not have permitted him

                  <p>But this last good not arriving in time to serve for any consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

occasions he had at this time wherein to exercise that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Vertue. Disgrace knock'd at his Door from the first arrival
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:63412:315"/>
of the Prince in <hi>Guienne,</hi> as you may have already observ'd, and his
Afflictions began to unveil themselves in the ill usage he at that
time receiv'd by Order from the Court, very much contrary to
what he had all the reason in the world to hope for, and expect;
they were continued to him by the Command he receiv'd to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
himself out of his Government, which seem'd to blast
him with some kind of Ignominy and reproach: But what an
overplus of vexation must it needs be, when by the ill success of
<hi>Fontarabie,</hi> he saw all the miscarriage of that Expedition cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Son? what a grief to see him prosecuted for a Criminal,
and himself at the same time look'd upon as a guilty man? They
were both of them divested of their Offices, and Commands, and
those transferr'd into the hands of their mortal, and most impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Enemies: So that the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> was constrain'd
to give way to their Power, and through infinite dangers to fly
for Sanctuary into <hi>England,</hi> a Kingdom at that time agitated with
Mutinous Factions, and Civil Discords of their own; whilst the
Father in a Country House, expos'd to their discretion, saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
strip'd of all his Employments, and his venerable old Age, so
highly reverenc'd, and esteem'd throughout the whole Kingdom,
become an Object of Scorn to such as a few days before had
truckled under his Authority, and trembled at his Name. If he
was touch'd to the quick by these Afflictions, he was no less sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the privation of all his Priviledges, Appointments, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and other Emoluments, that were the lawful Perquisits of
his several Offices, and Commands; whereby they cut him off
at one blow above fifty thousand Crowns of yearly Revenne, and
by which means he found himself reduc'd to the bare Revenue of
his own Estate, wherein he also suffer'd a very considerable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution.
These Affronts, and injuries were succeeded by long,
and painful Diseases, and those by the death of his eldest Son, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Condemnation of the second, by which Sentence
he also was dead in Law. Yet was not this all, and Almighty
God, who upon so great, and illustrious a Subject would please
to manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st the strength of his Arm, left him nothing entire, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which He did not evidently make it appear. There remain'd
to him in all these mishaps one refuge, that might still afford some
stay, and support to his Affairs, and cherish him with some hope
one day to restore them to their primitive condition: The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son, was in a great Employment, he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
oblig'd Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> to the highest degree, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
to be in great favour, and consideration with him; he had
at least obtain'd a promise from him, that the old Age of the
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:63412:316"/>
Duke his Father should not be molested; this Son was also ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd
from him with the rest, and nothing left him to which he
could in his greatest extremities have any visible recourse. We
have often heard mention of the several afflictions and chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
wherewith Almighty God hath sometimes been pleas'd to
visit sinful men:<note place="margin">The Death of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de la Valette.</hi>
                     </note> but let us consider whether amongst all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of his Justice, there be many more eminent, than these
in the case of the duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi> It had now been threescore
and two years since the Duke first tasted the sweets of Favour,
from which time Fortune, together with his own Vertue had rais'd
him to all the degrees of Greatness, that render men considerable
upon earth: There had scarce a year pass'd over his head, which
had not added something to his Prosperity, he had acquir'd as
great Riches, as many Offices, and Titles, as much Respect, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and Authority, as any other whoever of his time: but
above all, his Greatness seem'd to be establish'd, and secure in the
support of his three Sons; any of which by his merit was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
alone to sustain the Burthen, who all three in less than six
months space were ravish'd from him, and himself reduc'd to the
most deplorable soli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ude was possibly to be seen, or conceiv'd. He
acknowledg'd the Finger of God to be in all this, he submitted
to his Justice, and was never observ'd more to reverence his unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
Power, than when his hand lay most heavy upon him.</p>
                  <p>But would it not be too light a preterition, to pass over the
Death of the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> with so little Ceremony, and
to take no further notice of it, than by what has been already
said? Yes doubtless, and it was of too great importance to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of the Duke his Father, to be slipt over with so slight a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I shall therefore tell you, that this Cardinal, after the Death
of the Duke <hi>de Candale</hi> his Brother, had alone sustain'd the King's
declining Affairs in <hi>Italy,</hi> and with a very inconsiderably Army,
had at once withstood the power of our Enemies, and the infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of our Allies: but in the end, either worn out with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
toil of so many Affairs, or wounded with the ill usage he
saw his Family daily receive, he fell into a Melancholy, that put
him at last into a desperate Disease. The beginning of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
was as light, as it had been in that of the Duke <hi>de Candale,</hi>
and the issue of it as fatal. At the first news the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi>
receiv'd of his indisposition, though he had an account withal,
that it was without any symptome of danger, he could not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
forbear crying out aloud to those who were about him,
That his Son was a dead man. A saying which, though at first
spoke in passion only, in a few days turn'd into a Prophesie; the
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:63412:316"/>
intelligence, that came in from time to time of his condition, still
signified an encrease of his Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>temper, till after having seventeen
days strugled with a Disease, that at the fifth had been concluded
mortal, he ended a glorious Life, by a very constant and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Death. The Prince of <hi>Ioinville,</hi> eldest Son to the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> exercis'd at that time his first Arms, under the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of so dear, and so generous a Kinsman; the <hi>Mareschal de

the Duke, so soon as he should be in a condition to endure the
reading. Here it was that his Servants were in the greatest strait:
they doubted not, but that this loss, which apparently gave the
last blow to all his hopes, would afflict him to the last degree;
and although Nature, and the Vertues of this Son, should have
taken a less impression upon him, than all the world knew they
had done; they yet fear'd, his Constancy being exhausted by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
misfortunes, he had not a sufficient stock left wherewithal
to sustain the assault of this new affliction. In this perplexity they
had recourse to <hi>d' Espruets</hi> Bishop of <hi>Saint Papoul,</hi> a Prelate whom
the Duke, as well for his profound Learning as his exemplary Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
and Goodness had in great Reverence, and particular Esteem.
The Bishop at the first word very readily put himself into his
Coach, and in all diligence came to <hi>Plassac,</hi> where presenting
himself before the Duke, after he had some time entertain'd him
with indifferent things, falling at last into discourse of his
Sons Sickness, he told him that all his Friends and Servants were
in great suspence at some uncertain rumours that were spread
abroad in the Country. At that word the Duke was no more in
doubt, but that he was dead; yet would he not upon the instant
extract the utmost truth of his unfortunate loss: but changing
his Discourse, entertain'd the Bishop with Affairs of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
till they were both call'd to Dinner, as they soon after were.
It may easily be judg'd what a Dinner this was for the Duke, who
could feed on nothing save his own sad Imaginations; his rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness
all the while he sate at meat, sufficiently mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esting the
anguish of his Soul: he notwithstanding contain'd himself in
this violent agitation of mind, and continued at Table so long as
was necessary to satisfie what was due to Decency, and Respect,
without suffering himself to be transported into any action unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
his Gravity, and Wisdom. The Table being taken away,
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:63412:317"/>
and he having retir'd himself into his Chamber sooner, than he
ordinarily us'd to do, he caus'd his Secretary to be call'd in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
to write to <hi>Messieurs de Ioinville, de Turenne, de Thou,</hi> and <hi>de
Fontravilles,</hi> to recommend to them the care of his Sons health,
to whom all humane help was already fruitless, and vain; wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
moreover to him himself some few lines under his own
hand. One of his Gentlemen, who had lately been sent on the
same errand, was now ready to depart with this new Dispatch,
when the Duke, overcome with the violent agitations of his
mind, was constrain'd to cast himself upon his Bed; where cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Secretary to him, he said to him these words: <q>I do not
know why you should all dally with me thus long, nor to what
end you should conceal from me the Death of the Cardinal my
Son: is it that you imagine me so weak, I have not fortitude
enough to support the News? Do not you deceive me, as the
rest have done, but tell me the naked truth, which also cannot
long be conceal'd from me.</q> At which words the poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who for four or five days had had the power to govern his
Tongue, had not now the same command over his Eyes; so that,
his Tears having whether he would or no betray'd him to be the
Messenger of the ill news he had hitherto so faithfully conceal'd,
he proceeded by word of mouth to interpret, what was before
but too legible in his tears,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</note> and told his Master, <q>That what he
had prophesied the first hour he heard of his Sons Sickness, was
but too true: That the news of his Death had been brought
four days ago, but that his people, apprehending left so great a
blow of mishap might ruine his health, had address'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to <hi>Monsieur de Saint Papoul,</hi> to fortifie him with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
in acquainting him with the fatal News.</q> At which
words he lift up his hands to Heaven, and after a profound Sigh,
cried out aloud, <q>O Lord, since thou hast reserv'd my old Age
to survive the loss of my three Children, be pleas'd withal to
give me strength wherewith to support the severity of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q>
Hereupon the Bishop of <hi>Saint Papoul</hi> was presently
call'd in to him, who, after having highly commended his resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of himself, and his Affairs to the Will of God, made him
a Learned Discourse infinitely full of such admirable Arguments,
and Examples both Christian, and Moral, as were proper for his
disconsolate condition: And then it was that they presented him
with the relations of the Sickness, and Death of the Cardinal his
Son; wherein was observ'd so many testimonies of Piety, and
Resignation, so firm a confidence in the Divine Mercy, and so
little concern for Humane Life, that every one concluded him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:63412:317"/>
happy, to have take his leave of it in so good, and so
holy a disposition; and it was also from thence that the Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
his chiefest Consolations. After this he requested some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
from his Friends wherein to satisfie the resentments of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in private to pay some tears to his Affliction. His Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
were therefore drawn, when his tears, which he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
with so great violence to his sorrow suppress'd, having now
liberty to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ally out flow'd in so great abundance, that those about
him began to fear his immoderate passion might endanger his
health: but having remain'd two hours in this condition, he
himself at last rows'd up his spirits so long overcharg'd with grief,
and was heard to say, <q>That Tears were to be left to women, and
that it would be a shame a man could not allay his grief, but by
so poor and effeminate a Remedy: That he would live perhaps
to survive his Enemies:</q> When starting from his Bed, he had
so great a power over himself, as the same day again to appear in
publick. He entreated the Bishop of <hi>Papoul</hi> to bear him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
where he walk'd with him above two hours on foot, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
him all the while, either with Discourses of Piety, or the
state of his present Fortune, and that with a constancy this good
Prelate could never sufficiently magnifie, and admire.</p>
                  <p>It must nevertheless be confess'd,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> receives many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solatory Letters, both from the King, Queen, the <hi>Monsieur,</hi> Cardinal, and most of the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Kingdom.</note> that amongst all these affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which were many, and extreme; the Duke likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
very many, and great Consolations, or at least what were
intended for such, there being few persons of any eminent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in <hi>France,</hi> who did not manifest the part they shar'd with
him in his grief. The King did him the Honour to write very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly
to him; he receiv'd the same Favour from the Queen, the
<hi>Monsieur,</hi> all the Princes, Cardinal <hi>Richelieu;</hi> and almost all who
were any ways considerable, either in Birth, or Dignity in the
Kingdom, gave him testimonies, either of their Affection, or
Esteem upon this sad occasion. But if out of all these Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he did extract any real Consolation, it was chiefly from the
gracious manifestations of the Queens Royal Favour to him,
which took so much the deeper impression upon his mind, by how
much he knew they proceeded from the heart of this excellent
Princess. He had ever made her the object of all his Services;
neither was there any he would not have been very ready to have
perform'd for her, even in this moment of his greatest Adversity:
An inclination, that as it gave him a legitimate Title to her Grace,
and Favour, so was he the man of all the other Great Ones of
the Kingdom, that had the highest place in her Esteem: but the
condition of the time not permitting her to manifest it to that

degree her Majesty could have desir'd, she did upon this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all she had the liberty to do; which was to send him a very
obliging Letter, written with her own hand, of which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
were these.

I shall therefore take the liberty to represent them to you, and to

with which I have not by my Enemies been unjustly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended:

Neither have they been satisfied with attempting upon
my single Person, and the Persons of my Sons only; but I

consented to write it, though it produc'd no good effect, the
Duke notwithstanding who had expected no better success, reap'd
this advantage by it, that he by that means deliver'd himself from
the importunities of those who otherwise would upon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
have been pressing with him to have been still imploring
the Cardinal's Favour. But after this Repulse nothing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was ever more to be extorted from him; so that if he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
writ, it was ever either to preserve the Decorum of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
civility, or upon pure necessity, or to the end his Friends
might not condemn him for having by his own obstinacy pull'd
upon himself the mischiefs which had long been preparing against
him. Thus therefore depriv'd of all humane assistance, since the
Cardinal (without whom all the rest of what Quality soever sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
nothing) was opposite to his Interests, he wholly resign'd
himself into the hands of God, and would no more make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to any other but to him alone. He had ever born a great
Respect, and Zeal to Religion; and for above twenty years before
his Death, had been observ'd to be so constant to his Beads, that
not a day pass'd over his head wherein he did not spend three
whole hours in Devotion. At this time, as the persecutions of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent
men grew more violent against him, so did he redouble
his Prayers to Heaven, and has ever believ'd, that it was from
thence he deriv'd the strength, and fortitude to support all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
that befel him, and the disgraces that were hourly multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
upon him.</p>
                  <p>This calm and innocent way of living created either so great an
esteem for his Vertue,<note place="margin">Anno 1640.</note> or so great a compassion for his Adversity
in the minds of men, that there was scarce any who did not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
some tendernes for a person of his eminent condition so
unjustly oppress'd. Insomuch that the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who had
not been able (so positive his Orders were) to avoid employing
his Authority to the ruine of his Fortune, could not but discover,
that he also amongst the rest was touch'd with commiseration of
his Wrongs, and deplorable condition; so that whether it were,
that he therein glanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d at some particular advantages to himself, or
that it was meerly an act of his Generosity in order to the Duke's
repose, he sent him word as he was upon his Journey to <hi>Bordeaux:</hi>
                     <q>That he had compassion on his Misfortune,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi> upon some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> and Solitude, and if
he unluckily had formerly had a hand in the Disgraces had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall'n
him, he would much more willingly employ it to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress:
That his Afflictions how great soever, were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without remedy; but that he had one Son still surviving,
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:63412:319"/>
from whom he might yet derive comfort: That although the
Court was highly animated, and incens'd against him, he would
notwithstanding do his utmost endeavour, and set it hard to
obtain his return into <hi>France;</hi> provided he would be content
to resign his Governments, in lieu whereof he would also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him some reasonable recompence; and that by this means
he might spend the remainder of his days in company, which
it self would render the worst of evils supportable to him.</q> 
                     <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neste</hi>
a Counsellor in the Parliament of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> known of long
to have been a particular Friend to the Duke, was made choice
of by the Prince to offer this proposal to him; but he had Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
withal, not to own he did it by any express Order from the
Prince, unless he should first perceive the Duke very ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the motion. The Duke, unable to endure the first overture,
would return no answer at all, thinking by that means to disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
himself from that unpleasing Treaty: but the Prince, who
(as it was said) having cast his eye upon <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and openly
discovered a desire to be invested in that Government, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a design to make that of <hi>Guienne</hi> the Price of the other. It
was moreover believ'd he had a mind to translate the Office of
Colonel into the hands of a Favourite, thereby to promote his
own pretence: For one, or both of these reasons therefore he
would not be repuls'd at the Duke's first tacit denial: but not
long after having left <hi>Bordeaux</hi> to return to Court, his way
through <hi>Xaintonge</hi> gave him opportunity, as he pass'd by to see
the <hi>Count de Ionzac,</hi> the King's Lieutenant in that Province, and
one of the most intimate Friends the Duke at that time had in the
Kingdom. To him therefore he gave express charge to go to the
Duke, and to go through with that Negotiation, he had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occasionally committed to <hi>Geneste;</hi> to which he also requir'd a
precise and positive answer. The <hi>Count de Ionzac</hi> could do no
other, than obey the Prince in this particular, though he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
very well assur'd, he should bring him no satisfactory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the Duke concerning this Affair. This Gentleman was
without all doubt the depositary of the Duke's most secret
thoughts, and intentions; and I am certain in several very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
occasions had prov'd exceeding faithful to him: So that,
there being scarce any thing reserv'd, which he did not freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to his Secresie, and Trust, it is to be presum'd the Duke had
not conceal'd from him this Proposition from the Prince, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the fix'd and determinate Resolution he had put on as
to that business. He therefore only confirm'd to him anew, what
he had already sufficiently assur'd him of; desiring him withal,
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:63412:320"/>
since the Prince would have a positive answer, to tell him on his
behalf, <q>That he could have wish'd, having ever honour'd him
as he had done,<note place="margin">Which are rejected by the Duke.</note> he had sooner had those considerations for him,
he was pleas'd at present to profess: That his compassion was
now out of season: That he was content alone to undergo all
his misfortunes the remaining part of his life, and that he had
much rather never more see the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son, than
to see him reduc'd to the condition of a private person: That
he would accept no Recompence for his Offices, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
forasmuch as he was resolved never to part with them;
and that he had enough remaining through the favour and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the Kings his Masters, to spare those profits, and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments
he had formerly receiv'd.</q> And to the end that for the
time to come he might secure himself from being any more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
with such distasteful proposols, he declar'd aloud, that
should any of his Friends ever entertain him with the like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
he should never take that man for his Friend again: but
in case any over whom he had an Authority should presume once
to open his mouth to such a purpose, he would handle him so as
should manifest to all the world how highly he was offended at
the motion.</p>
                  <p>The Duke soon perceiv'd that the Court was by no means
pleas'd with this answer, the ill usage he had hitherto receiv'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after this refusal evidently doubled upon him; insomuch that
he had news brought the Cardinal had been importun'd by the
Enemies of his Family, to remove him from <hi>Plassac,</hi> that being
(as they pretended) too near to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> where, by the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of so dangerous a vicinity, he might still maintain a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
there, and set what practices he pleas'd on foot, to the
prejudice of the Publick Peace.<note place="margin">New perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions for the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> Thus even when confin'd to a
Country House, disarm'd, and naked, as he then was, and as it
were buried under his own ruines, his sole Name, and Authority
was formidable to his Enemies, even in so low a condition. Such
as were most violent against him, advis'd to have him shut up in
Prison, and the more moderate sort would only have him confin'd
to some remote places, which they had already pointed out for
him i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

time produce no evil effects; and it was said the Cardinal would
keep his word, he had given to the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> not to
add to the persecution of the Duke his Father; but if he did not
openly do it, and so as to own his own act, he at least gave the
Duke's most implacable Enemies leave to do what he himself was
either asham'd of, or had no mind to own; men who abusing
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:63412:320"/>
that liberty committed out-rages against him, unworthy both of
their own, and his condition; and such as the Prince, who at this
time was no ways favourable to him, could not himself endure,
and therefore did him a noble right: but I rather choose to omit
the recital of it, than to revive the resentment of things almost,
if not altogether, extinguish'd and forgot, by a relation that would
otherwise perhaps, he pertinent enough to my story.</p>
                  <p>In this violent persecution, the Duke's Servants humbly advis'd
him to slacken the stiffness, he had hitherto ever maintain'd, and
especially towards the Cardinal; in hopes that by a little soothing
his vain humour (immeasurably greedy of Glory) with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
above what he had formerly us'd to do, he might obtain
some satisfaction from him. Whereupon they represented to him
the examples of the Princes of the Blood, who by having a little
warp'd from their degree, and parted with some small advantages
in his consideration, had by so doing given the other Great Ones
of the Kingdom an honourable colour, and pretext to go some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less in their Quality also in the Cardinal's Favour: but these
Arguments could by no means prevail upon his invincible Spirit.
He made answer;<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s noble constancy.</note> 
                     <q>That could he ever deliberate to submit to
civilities beyond what he had usually done, he should how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
much less do it in the time of his Disgrace, than at any
other: That he ought no more to consider the condition to
which Fortune had now reduc'd him, than that from which
he was fall'n: That what at another time would pass only for
Complement, would now be interpreted an act of Fear: That
if he must perish, he had much rather have the injustice of his
Enemies whereof to complain, than to stand oblig'd to his
own weakness for his preservation: That the example of the
Princes of the Blood signified nothing to him: That their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was inseparably annex'd to their Birth: That therefore it
could never by any demission of theirs be alienated from them:
That what would be call'd Prudence in persons of that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to accommodate themselves to the time, would be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an inexcusable meanness in him; and that they should never
see him do any thing, either by example or perswasion, that
should in the least prejudice, or reflect upon his Honour.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before this, and soon after the Death of the Cardinal <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette,</hi>
some there were who endeavour'd to perswade him to ask
of the King, and the Cardinal some of the Benefices which were
become vacant by his Decease; but he with the same constancy
refus'd to do that also, telling those who urg'd him so to do,
<q>That he would not augment the grief of his loss, by the dishonor
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:63412:321"/>
of a repulse: That being depriv'd of the person of his
Son, his Estate was to him of very little consideration; and
that if his Enemies had had the pleasure of making him unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
they should never have that of reproaching him, that they
had made him do any mean, or unhandsome thing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So long before this also, as from the Duke's first arrival at <hi>Plas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac,</hi>
some of his Servants thinking thereby to flatter his thrifty hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
had propos'd to him, in the great diminution of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
some retrenchment in his Expences also: a proposition
in truth by the Duke well enough receiv'd, considering that in a
private Country House, neither his Table, nor his Stables requir'd
the same Splendour, as when he resided in his Government; so
that he moreover gave way an account should be stated, to see
what they could reduce his Expences to: but when it came to
the push, he rejected all, saying, <q>That he had for above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
years together maintain'd himself in the same Port, and
Lustre, and that those who were his persecuters should never
have that advantage over him, as to make him abate in the least
of his ordinary way of living, and that finally in the same Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
he had liv'd, he was resolv'd he would dye.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis methinks a very strange thing, and very well worthy our
observation, that amongst all the Alarms were daily given him,
in all the adversities he was made to undergo, and with all the ill
news, which either to afflict, or forewarn him, he hourly receiv'd,
he never lost (as he himself did profess) so much as one nights
sleep. A thing no one can impute to his insensibility, who was
but too tender that way, and over-sensible of the least touch of
Offence. Who is it then, but must admire the stability, and unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
constancy of that noble Soul, which in the fury of all these
Tempests (sufficient to disorder the greatest resolution) remain'd
as calm, and undisturb'd, as in the most tranquil estate of his most
prosperous Fortune?</p>
                  <p>Neither was he content to maintain this serenity, and Stoical
contempt of injuries in his own person: he would moreover
that his Servants should be inspir'd with the same Courage, and
generous Principles, of which I have seen some incur his disgrace,
for having only wept before him. He thought men of such mean
Spirits unworthy of his Dependence, and would above all things
that without disguise, or reservation, they should acquaint him
with the true state of his Affairs, how foul soever it might be;
being accustomed to say, <q>That it was a kind of Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to know the worst of things, and to what a degree a
man was unhappy; since Doubts, and Fears, rendring an evil
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:63412:321"/>
infinite to the imagination, it was in that incertitude utterly
impossible, for any one to take a true measure, or to form right
resolutions, from things that were boundless, and unlimited:</q> But
withal, he whose Office it was to acquaint him with any thing of
that nature, was also to have a care so to compose his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that he might not therein discover either sorrow, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.
Nay he would himself oftentimes antedate his own
Affliction, by asking such as were oblig'd to discourse his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
to him, if they had heard no ill news that day? occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
comforting those in whom he repos'd the greatest confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and appearing himself, in all outward shew, the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
at the misfortunes befel him.</p>
                  <p>In the greatest Confusion of things, and the most violent heat
of his Persecution, he was with nothing so much delighted, as
to hear what a fear his Enemies were in, and how much they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
his Power. Unhappy as he was, he yet retain'd so much
vanity, as to suffer himself to be transported with that kind of
adulation; a frailty, which as it soonest, and with great facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
insinuates it self into the most generous minds, was also the
last thing almost that forsook him.</p>
                  <p>He was never heard in the greatest height of Adversity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of Fortune; but on the contrary, when some of his Friends
have sometimes put him upon that Discourse, would say, <q>That
he should be very ungrateful for the benefits of Fortune, who
had for the space of threescore years been continually favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him, should he murmur, or repine, that she should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
him for the small remainder of time he had now to live:
That he had rarely observ'd a whole life to be fortunate, even
of those had been much shorter than his; and that in the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
and instability of Humane Affairs, it was no little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to have been reserv'd for the Trial of Disgrace, till a
time when he was hardly any more capable of tasting the sweets
of a more prosperous Fortune.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which ought yet further to make us admire the Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Vigour he ever kept entire in all his Words, and Actions
is, that he was neither with-held by a morose Gravity in the one,
nor hurried on by an impetuous Fury in the other. He very well
understood that his way of living was utterly contrary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the time, and in speaking of his own Conduct,
would sometimes confess to his particular Friends, that having
often reflected upon his own Carriage, long before it had pull'd
upon him those Disgraces which now lay so heavy upon him;
should he have discover'd his Sons inclin'd to follow the same
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:63412:322"/>
Maxims, he would have disswaded them from it: but that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
himself kept up something of a steady humour throughout
the past Reigns, he thought it now unfit to deprave, and give the
lye to threescore years of life, to preserve what yet remain'd, with
imbecillity, and shame; and that if he must fall he would perish
altogether.</p>
                  <p>But though he obstinately maintain'd this sullen, and wilful
humour in matters wherein he conceiv'd his Honour to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
he wanted not nevertheless complacency, and respect
enough in things that only respected his Duty. This year there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having produc'd the King two brave Conquests, namely, that
of <hi>Arras,</hi> and that of <hi>Turin,</hi> he would not, upon this occasion,
fail to manifest the interest, that, as a good <hi>Frenchman</hi> he pretended
to, in the prosperity of his Majesties Arms. A Complement that
was further directed to the Cardinal, who doubtless had a very
great share in all the successes of his Majesties Affairs. The <hi>Count
de Maillé</hi> was the Envoy of this Dispatch, by whom this Affair,
and some other of the Duke's concerns, were so discreetly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
that he brought back a very favourable Letter from the
Cardinal, together with several expressions by word of mouth of
far greater kindness: but the effects were very different, as we
shall see in the revolution of the ensuing year.</p>
                  <p>But before we take our leaves of this, I must present you with
the Relation of a little Accident, by which it will appear, that
even in the height of his Disgraces, Fortune could not so altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forget the Duke, but that she must impart some of her petty
Favours to him; which though not sufficient to compensate his
Adversity, she, at least by those trifling Obligations, made it seem
she could not find in her heart totally to abandon a person who
had formerly been so dear unto her.<note place="margin">Three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable stories of the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s good Fortune, whereof this is the first.</note> A young Fellow the Duke
had bred, and brought up from his Infancy to the age of man,
and by whom he had long been attended in his Chamber, so far
at last forgot his Duty, as to design to rob his Master. He was
not long before he executed that design, and with such dexterity,
that he purloin'd two thousand Pistols out of a Trunck in his
Chamber, the Duke discovering nothing of his loss till above
six months after. This Companion having thus perform'd his
Feat, was, with his Masters leave retir'd into his own Country,
upon the Frontiers of <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had either imbezzel'd, or
laid out a good part of the money. The Duke no sooner disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Theft, but that he as soon guest who had been the
Thief, and nam'd him to those who were then waiting in his
Chamber: but he was at first in some suspence, whether or no
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:63412:322"/>
he should bustle in a business, that it would be no easie matter for
him to prove. In the end importun'd by some of his Servants,
not to tolerate an Action of so ill example, he sent away a Prevost
to take him, wherein he was also so successful, as to have him
forc'd away from his own Country (the most favourable to Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this nature in <hi>France</hi>) and brought before him, where he
was no sooner come, but that he confess'd his fault, and restor'd
the money he had taken to a<note n="*" place="margin">A piece of money to the value of xviii. pence sterling.</note> 
                     <hi>Teston.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Story puts me in mind of two others,<note n="*" place="margin">The second Story.</note> which I conceive
ought not to be omitted, Being one day in the great Church of
<hi>Metz,</hi> at Vespers upon a solemn Festival: he whose Office it was
to Cense the Priests, came also to offer it to the Duke, who pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
off his Gloves with greater respect to receive the Honour was
done him, a Diamond of very great value he wore upon his
Finger, drop'd out of the Socket, and fell to ground without his
taking any notice of it at all: But the Censor was soon aware of
the accident, and that he might with the more cleanly conveyance
gather up the Diamond, having made a Reverence so low, as
with his knees to touch the ground, he with great dexterity snapt
up the Stone without being observ'd by any, and retir'd. The
Duke having again put on his Gloves, staid out the remainder of
the Office, which being done, he return'd home to his own Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Supper time being come, and the Duke being to wash be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he sate down to Table, going to pull off his Ring, as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
us'd to do, when he wash'd his hands, he perceiv'd the
Stone to be lost: Whereupon without further astonishment, or
deliberation, he gave order to have the man that Cens'd at Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers
brought before him. He had observ'd, though without any
kind of suspicion, the extraordinary low Reverence the Fellow
had made him, and his quick and ready apprehension made him
now jealous, that so unusal a Complement had not been paid
him without some design. The man being therefore brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, he without more Ceremony, or Examination, posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
demanded of him his Diamond, which the other at first
deny'd: but being commanded the second time to produce it,
and that presently, or he should be presently hang'd, the poor man,
as if that word had been of as great validity, as an hundred Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and so many Judges, without making any other reply,
humbly besought the Duke to let some of his people go home
with him for his Diamond, which he also immediately restor'd.
In this his own Wisdom was his Friend, and another l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="618" facs="tcp:63412:323"/>
nature, which was a pure effect of Chance, and of which the
example may go hand in hand with those marvellous Successes,
which are related for wonderful, even of such as have been the
most eminently favour'd by Fortune. The Duke many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all this, going one time to <hi>Paris,</hi> had taken <hi>Loches</hi> in his way,
as he ordinarily us'd to do; when being come to <hi>la Haye</hi> in <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
at the time of year when days are at the longest, he would
after supper go take a walk in the Meadows without the City.
The Grass was not yet cut, but ready for the Scythe, when playing
with some of his Followers, (for he was at this time in that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Age) a Pearl in the fashion of a Pear of two which he always
wore in his Ears, fell down into the Grass, without being at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
perceiv'd by him. Those two Pearls were noted for the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of that time, each of them being valued at ten thousand
Crowns. The men of the <hi>French</hi> Court in those days us'd to trick
themselves with such things as these, which now even amongst
the Ladies are scarcely any more in use. The Duke going at night
to put off his Pendants, before he went to Bed, perceiv'd one
of them to be lost: the night was already shut up, and in the
clearest light of day it had been almost impossible to have found so
little a thing, in so great a clutter of thick, and deep Grass, as
in that place cover'd the face of the ground. He had nevertheless
so great a confidence in his good luck, as to command one of his
<hi>Valett</hi>'s <hi>de Chambre</hi> to go seek his Pearl, and to bring it to him; as
if he had been in fee with Fortune, and that she had been oblig'd
to second all his desires. But it so fell out, that she immediately
put that into the hands of the <hi>Valette de Chambre,</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair'd
ever to find, and he brought the Pearl presently back to his
Master: a thing that rendred all the Company no less astonish'd
at the confidence the Duke had in his good Fortune, than at his
good Fortune it self.</p>
                  <p>After these digressions it is now high time for us to pursue our

a very troublesome Disease. This season for some years pass'd had
been so inauspicious to him, that he would ordinarily call it his
Enemy; as it prov'd in the end, and that to such a degree as to
deprive him of his Life. At this time nevertheless it contented it
self a second time to afflict him with another defluxion of Rhume,
which having run through all the parts of his Body with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
torment, left him at last in so great a weakness, that he
lay near six months before he could recover to any indifferent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of health. In this tedious, and troublesome Sickness, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:63412:323"/>
very great comfort in the company of the Dutchess <hi>de la Valette</hi>
his Daughter-in-law, and the Marquise <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Grand-child,
who forsook the Court to attend him in his Solitude, and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Both these arriv'd at <hi>Plassac</hi> sometime before the Dukes Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
The Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> now Duke <hi>de Candale,</hi> had been
there a good while before, the Duke his Grand father having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
himself to take care of his Education, and to form him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to those great Actions; of which his Predecessors had left him
so beautiful Examples. In the sweet Conversation of this innocent
Family, did this Illustrious old man flatter his Grief, and deceive
his Afflictions; creating to himself a kind of fruition out of that
Confinement, and Privacy, his Enemies had for a punishment
inflicted on him. Living in this Calm of Repose, which the
Tempests of his Fortune had at last fretted themselves into, and
hoping therein to spin out the remainder of his Life, he was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
with an unexpected Command from the King, to leave his
House of <hi>Plassac,</hi> and to remove thence to <hi>Loches.</hi> And seeing
this Affair (of it self untoward enough) was the fountain from
whence several other afflictions deriv'd themselves, which also in
the end occasion'd his Death, it should not methinks be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to give a full Relation of a Transaction, by which we are
now about to conclude his Life.</p>
                  <p>From the time that the <hi>Count de Soissons</hi> departed from Court
to retire himself to <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Prince had rested content with the enjoyment of his own Estate,<note place="margin">The estate of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Kingdom, from whence the Cardinal took occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to send the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to <hi>Loches.</hi>
                     </note>
and the payment of those Pensions assign'd him from the Crown;
and (it has been said) that had those Pensions been continued to
him, would have remain'd in the same quiet posture wherein he
had liv'd ever since his departure from Court, choosing rather to
languish in Sloth, and out of all Employment, than by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to discompose the Peace of his Country. But as if his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
had been disposers of his Destiny, they would never grant
him those just, and reasonable conditions he desir'd; insomuch
that they impos'd upon him a necessity of applying himself to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
Princes. These therefore having supplied him with some
Forces, his own Interest having procur'd him some others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Kingdom, and the Duke <hi>de Boüillon</hi> (who was equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
with him in his cause) having arm'd a great number of
his Friends, he of all these together made up a very considerable
Army. These Forces however, how great soever they were,
would notwithstanding have given the Cardinal no very great
Alarm, had he not found withal, that even at home there was
so formidable a Faction form'd in this Prince's favour, as that the
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:63412:324"/>
Kingdom was universally engag'd in his designs: But when he
saw that the people openly declar'd in his Quarrel, and that the
whole Frontier of <hi>Champagne,</hi> together with the best Cities of
that Province, threatned to revolt in his Favour, that <hi>Paris</hi> it self
open'd her Arms to receive him; and that it was to be fear'd, if
some sudden course was not taken, that without a blow strook,
or the least resistance, he should see himself reduc'd to his Mercy,
then it was (as has been reported) that he seriously repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
he had not been more just to him, and that he had not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
himself more facile to his equitable demands: But having
fruitlesly attempted to quiet this storm, by some overtures of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
those Propositions being rejected, there was now
a necessity of coming to the decision of Arms. The Cardinal
therefore endeavour'd with all imaginable expedition to oppose a
good Army against him under the Command of the <hi>Mareschal de
Chastillon;</hi> to whom he also gave express Orders at any hand to
hazard the fortune of a Battel, before the evil dispositions of the
people could produce those sinister effects, he had all the reason
in the world to apprehend. In this posture of Affairs, his most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Enemies, being the Great Ones he had offended, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it in the first place necessary to secure the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
not doubting but that a man of his known spirit, and so highly
offended by him, would take hold of the first opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himself of those insupportable Injuries he had so continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

                     </gap>iv'd at his hands. But over and above this jealousie which
the Cardinal had reasonably enough conceiv'd upon the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
accounts, the Duke's ill Fortune would moreover at this
time joyn with his Enemy to give him some colourable pretence
for this new injury, and injustice. All the Kingdom believ'd that
the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> had before his Decease, obtain'd of this
great Minister an assurance of repose for his Father the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of his Life; and there had been no new occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
that could justifie the violation of this promise; so that his
private, and solitary way of living sheltring him from all the
Tempests of the busie World, he thought to live quiet, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
in that harbour whereinto even by his misfortunes he had
been so fortunately thrown. In this estate a wretched Fellow, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unknown to the Duke, or to any of his, without any the least
acquaintance with any of his Family, or any frequentation in his
House, was so malicious, as in his name to go to the <hi>Sieur du Bourg,</hi>
Governour of the little Fort the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had possess'd themselves
of at their entry into <hi>Biscaye,</hi> and by me before call'd <hi>Socoa,</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in the names of the Dukes of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and <hi>de la Valette</hi>
                     <pb n="621" facs="tcp:63412:324"/>
(whom he had never seen) a very great recompence, if he would
deliver up that Fort into their hands. <hi>Le Bourg</hi> easily imagin'd
that this place being so well known as it was to these two Dukes,
could not be so ardently coveted by them, it being of very little
importance; and consequently did at the very first believe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that made him this Proposition, must be some Impostor, who
hop'd to obtain some recompence for informing against him, and
afterwards to run away; but a Rope in the end was his reward.
Though (as I have said) <hi>le Bourg</hi> well enough understood this Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to be a Counterfeit,<note place="margin">A malicious Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon.</hi>
                     </note> he notwithstanding either to render
himself more considerable at these two Dukes Expence, or more
exactly to discharge his Duty than upon such an occasion he was
oblig'd to do, fail'd not however to give the Court an account of
the Proposition had been made to him, detaining the impostor
Prisoner in the mean time. Whereupon he soon after receiv'd
Orders to deliver him into the hands of <hi>Lauson Intendant de la Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
in <hi>Guienne;</hi> by whom though he was condemn'd to die, and
the Sentence accordingly executed upon him, yet at present they
made use of this Imposture to colour a Command to the Duke of
<hi>Espernon,</hi> to depart from <hi>Plassac,</hi> and to transfer himself to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Varennes</hi> one of the Gentlemen in Ordinary to the King, was
appointed to carry this Order, who the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> about two
of the Clock in the afternoon arriv'd with it at <hi>Plassac.</hi> The Duke
was at that time a Bed, where he us'd to take two or three hours
repose every afternoon; by reason whereof <hi>Varennes</hi> being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to attend his waking, he ask'd to speak with the <hi>Count
de Maillé</hi> in the mean time; which he did to anticipate the Duke by
some excuses, in that he was so unhappy, as to be always sent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unwelcome Commissions (for it was he also who in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of the Archbishop of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> had been the Bearer of
the Order was sent the Duke to retire out of his Government to
<hi>Plassac.</hi>) The <hi>Count de Maillé,</hi> having by discoursing with him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<hi>Varenne</hi>'s Errand, doubted not but that the Duke must
needs infinitely surpriz'd at the Novelty of this Command;
wherefore having consulted with such of the Duke's Servants as
were of most consideration about him, they concluded it most
convenient, that he should by his Secretary be beforehand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, to the end he might be prepar'd to receive it
with less emotion. The business therefore being thus order'd
amongst them, was accordingly executed, and the Duke was no
sooner awake, but that the Secretary coming to his Bed-side, told
him that a Gentleman from the King was newly arriv'd, who
had brought him an Order to depart from <hi>Plassac,</hi> and go away
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:63412:325"/>
to <hi>Loches.</hi> The Duke, who had of old fortified his mind against
the worst of events, and not finding in this that extremity of
evils it lay in his Enemies power to inflict upon him, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at all mov'd at the suddenness of the thing; calmly reply'd,
and is that all? After which words a little composing himself, he
commanded his Secretary to call the Gentleman in. <hi>Varennes</hi> was
presently brought into his Chamber, who, advancing to the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
presented him with the King's Letter, which the Duke open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he found it to contain these words.

                  <p>This Letter being read, and <hi>Varennes</hi> offering a new at the same
excuses he had already made to the <hi>Count de Maillé,</hi> the Duke cut
him short, by telling him, that whatever came from the King
was infinitely welcome, and that excuses were not necessary where
a man did nothing but what it was his Duty to do; after which
he fell into a pretty long discourse, wherein he manifested so much
judgment, and constancy upon so unpleasing an accident, as made
every one admire that heard him: It was very near word for
word in these terms, <q>That threescore years being now laps'd
since he had first had the Honour to serve the Kings his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and to teach such as their Majesties had subjected under his
Authority to obey, it would be inexcusable in him, should he
in that time have profited so little himself, as not to know how
in his own person to practice the Precepts he had laid down to
others: That he was very ready to pay the King all the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
his Majesty could himself desire: That had he a sufficient
stock of strength, and health to perform that Journey Post, he
would immediately mount to House, by that promptness to
shew how every Subject ought to obey his Prince; not that he
did not nevertheless understand himself to be very unkindly
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:63412:325"/>
us'd, and look'd upon this proceeding as excessively severe to
him who had never fail'd in the least in his Majesties Service,
and to whom no one living could impute the least offence to his
Duty: That his Enemies made it their pretence to use him ill,
from the ill carriage of his Son; as if a Father could be any ways
responsible for the defaults of his Children, or ought to suffer for
their Offences. Not that I do (he presently caught himself) in
the least confess those wherewith they have charg'd my Son the
Duke <hi>de la Valette;</hi> he is an honest man, and innocent: and
had the King been rightly inform'd of his Actions, his Majesty
might with better reason have commended his Services, than
(as he is pleas'd to do) to condemn his Conduct.</q> Upon which
expression, excusing himself for that little escape of his resentment,
he proceeded to say, <q>Is it not very hard that my Enemies will
expose my old Age to the scorn, and mockery of the one half
of the Kingdom I am to pass through to the place of my Exile?
Why will they not at least give me leave to finish the small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of my days I have to live in the obscurity of this Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?</q>
After which, asking him if there was any time limited
for his setting out, or if he had receiv'd any Order to continue
with him till his departure? and <hi>Varennes</hi> having deny'd both the
one, and the other, he continued to say, <q>That since they were
pleas'd to proceed so favourably with him, he would be no ill
Husband of his time: That he would give order to have his
Equipage made ready with the soonest; but that he had let
them hang by to rust, and rot for four years together, that
he had been in that House.</q> In the conclusion of all, <hi>Varennes</hi>
having entreated an Answer to his Letter, the Duke gave him one
in these terms.

                  <p>Neither in this answer, nor in his Discourse to <hi>Varennes,</hi> had
he made any Reply to that part of the King's Letter, which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
the intelligence his Majesty had receiv'd out of <hi>Guienne;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as he was as yet totally ignorant of the business of <hi>Socoa:</hi>
but having sometime after understood that his name had been
made use of in that Affair, he conceiv'd it very necessary for him
to address himself to the <hi>Mareschal de Scomberg,</hi> to request that he
would penetrate into the bottom of that Imposture, that so he
might be able to inform his Majesty of the truth of the Story.
This <hi>Mareschal</hi> had been withdrawn from his Government of
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> as well as the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had been out of that of
<hi>Guienne:</hi> but being it had been done without any visible mark
of Disgrace, and only out of deferenee to the Prince, who was

dismiss'd with an honourable Commission into <hi>Guienne,</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
as the Kings Lieutenant in that Province. His carriage
there towards the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was very different from that
of those who had preceded him in that Employment, he highly,
and publickly declaring, that he shar'd in the feeling an honest
man ought to have of the ill usage had been inflicted upon a man
of that eminent Quality, and who had ever behav'd himself
without all manner of reproach: Neither was this the only te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of his Friendship, he proceeding from these favourable
expressions, to effects of a much more obliging nature. They had
propos'd to him the Government of <hi>Guienne</hi> in recompence of
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:63412:326"/>
that of <hi>Languedoc</hi> (with the privation of which he had also been
tacitly threatned) but all those offers, and menaces could never
prevail upon him, he professing that he had much rather choose
to be without any Employment at all, than to be invested with
the spoils of two persons of that eminent condition yet living,
and with whom he was not convinc'd that any fault could justly
be found; exercising moreover the Commission he had there with
so great tenderness and respect to them, that though he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
as ample Authority, as he could himself desire; he would
notwithstanding never come to execute any of his Functions at
<hi>Bordeaux,</hi> the Capital City of that Province. He would not so
much as come near it, but contented himself to stay at <hi>Agen,</hi>
which he made the seat of his residence till his return into <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc:</hi>
and whereas others, who had commanded there before
him, had carried themselves very rudely to the Duke's Friends,
and Servants there, the <hi>Mareschal</hi> on the contrary took them into
his especial Trust, and Favour, conceiving he could not make a
better choice, than of such men, as had pass'd the tryal of his
late Adversity. This noble way af proceeding had so highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
the Duke, that he made no difficul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y to solicite his Favour,
a thing he had never done to any since his persecution; he writ
to him therefore before he departed from <hi>Plassac,</hi> intreating him
to cause the Impostor by whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had been accus'd to be
throughly sifted, that he might be able to satisfie the Court of
what could be discover'd from his Examination. The <hi>Mareschal</hi>
upon this Letter did the Duke all the good Offices could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from his generous and noble Nature, and writ so favourably
to the Council in his behalf, as from <hi>des Noyers</hi> Secretary of State to
obtain this answer: a Copy whereof he sent to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For what concerns the Fellow that is detain'd Prisoner at
<hi>Socoa,</hi> I could have wish'd that <hi>Monsieur du Bourg</hi> had better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the business, before he had acquainted the King with
it, and brought so great an inconvenience upon persons of that
condition: <hi>Monsieur de Lauzon,</hi> who is at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> will in two
hours time be able to clear all doubts, observing the Order I
have sent him according to your desire.</q> In effect the business
was perfectly clear'd, and the Dukes Innocence sufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest:
but notwithstanding the resolutions that had been taken
against him were nothing alter'd; neither indeed did he solicit
any thing of that kind, nor would address himself to any other,
saving the <hi>Mareschal de Scomberg</hi> only, his design being only to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his Reputation, and not to receive any the least favour from
his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="626" facs="tcp:63412:327"/>Yet whatever he had said to <hi>Varennes,</hi> or whatsoever he had

himself upon his way;<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Journey of <hi>Loches,</hi>
                     </note> he did not for all that make so much haste,
that three weeks at least were not laps'd before he began his Journy.
He spun out the preparation of his Equipage in great length, and
although he at first manifested an absolute, and franck disposition
to depart, either the tenderness, and apprehension of his Friends,
or his own doubts, and diffidences, had possess'd him with so
great a jealousie, that he could not easily perswade himself to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
a thing he saw was nevertheless by no means to be avoided.
Some, who would seem to be most solicitous of his Person, and
Safety, had often represented to him, <q>That the Castle of <hi>Loches</hi>
was a Prison of State: That it had already been made use of
in that nature upon very considerable<note n="*" place="margin">One whereof I find in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vila</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Elbeauf</hi> was sent thither Prisoner presently after the Death of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> at <hi>Blois.</hi>
                        </note> occasions: That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
situate in the heart of the Kingdom, his Captivity would
be the more severe, by how much there was no possibility of
an escape, and that so soon as he should be come thither, it
would be in the power of any one of the <hi>Exempts-des Guardes,</hi>
to charge the Garrison, and to make himself Master of the Gate
to engage his Liberty for ever.</q> It was no hard matter to foresee,
that all these inconveniences might possibly arrive: but being his
forbearing to go, would inevitably convince him of the highest
disobedience, the discreeter sort of men concluded it the safest for
him to try if he could not avoid the utmost extremes, by an entire
confidence in his Majesties Justice, and in outward shew to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that with great alacrity, and freedom, which in effect there
was a necessity upon him, he must however do. The Duke saw
clearly enough into the truth of this last advice; yet could he not
without great repugnancy, and unwillingness follow that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel;
and the natural desire of the Liberty, he believ'd ready to
be ravish'd from him (or that at best depended only upon his
Enemies Capricio) possess'd him with so great a disquiet of
mind, as fail'd little of endangering his health by a new relapse.
He nevertheless by his constancy, once more overcame all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,
and mistrusts, and arming himself with a generous
resolution, determin'd in the end to do, what must either speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be done, or he must inevitably lose himself for ever. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as he discover'd some little beam of hope in the <hi>Count de
Soisson</hi>'s undertaking (whose party was tacitly favour'd by all the
Male-contents, and with greater reason by him, than all the rest)
he observ'd such an Order in his departure from <hi>Plassac,</hi> and
throughout the whole progress of his Journey, as on the one side
to avoid the imputation of Disobedience, should the <hi>Count</hi>'s Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:63412:327"/>
meet with any ill success; and on the other to be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
suddenly to return into his Government to favour his Cause,
should there be the least apparence (as there was a great deal)
that this Prince could receive any advantage by his joyning with
him.</p>
                  <p>The better then to fit all things for his propos'd design, he
was near a month in preparing his Equipage: the most necessary
things must by all means be bought at places a great way off,
though they might have been had much nearer at hand; and
when all things were got ready, he was advis'd to feign some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities
in his Health, as the remains of his late Sickness:
an advice he for a few days put in practice, though in the end he
must of necessity set out, and it was the 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> day of <hi>Iuly.</hi> He had
been sometime in suspence, whether he should take the Dutchess
<hi>de la Valette</hi> and her little Children along with him this Journey,
or no; he could not in the great apprehensions had been infus'd
into him of the loss of his own Liberty, consent that persons so
dear unto him should bear a part in so great a Disgrace; who as
they were in other things the greatest Consolation he had, so
were they in this none of the least causes of his Affliction: but
their Piety soon cut off all deliberation, and they carried that by
the violence of their importunity, which they could not otherwise
obtain of so good a Father, and were at last admitted to the
Voyage.</p>
                  <p>During these delays in the Duke's slender Preparation, the
<hi>Count de Soissons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Count de Soissons</hi> makes great preparation for War.</note> and the Duke <hi>de Boüillon,</hi> had made so mighty
ones wherewith to oppose the Power of the King, that they were
apparently the stronger Party, and in a condition to bring over
the Victory to their own side. The Armies of the one, and the
other party were so near, and both so animated against one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
that it was hardly possible they should avoid coming imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to Blows; every one in his wishes favour'd the <hi>Count</hi>'s
Designs, and all the people, the Cities, and generally all <hi>France</hi>
open'd their Arms to receive him: neither was the Duke of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi>
ignorant of these good dispositions towards him, with
whom he went along in his Heart, and Judgment; so that hoping
much on the one side, and fearing something nevertheless on the
other, he began his Journey. From <hi>Plassac,</hi> his first days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was to <hi>Pons,</hi> a League and a half only distant from his own
House, which although a very little one, and that he perform'd
it in his Litter, he nothwithstanding went to Bed presently after
his arrival, and all the next day rested there. The day following he
went to <hi>Cognac,</hi> to visit the <hi>Count de Ionzac,</hi> in which little Town,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:63412:328"/>
which had formerly been a member of his Government of <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mois,</hi>
he found a great number of Gentlemen, and Ladies of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good Quality, whom the compassion of his finister Fortune
had assembled there to pay him their last Visit, as they believ'd,
and as indeed it prov'd to be. He could not upon this occasion,
so govern his own humour, as to be perswaded to feign himself
indispos'd, that being a part he could only play, when there was
none by to see him: but in the great world his Prudence could
never obtain so great an Authority over his haughty Spirit: but
that he must ever make a shew of more Health and vigour, than
he really had. A thing his Servants were very much afflicted at,
as very much out of season; some of which having represented
to him the example of the Duke of <hi>Rhetz,</hi> who a long time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
his Life, and kept his Offices, by having with great art,
and industry given hopes, that the latter, would soon become va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
by the loss of the other; he despis'd that sort of Prudence,
telling them that the malignity of old Age, would soon enough,
and to his great grief render him altogether useless, without that
he needed to antedate that unhappy time by artifice, and dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>That which I conceive made him so resolute to despise all
Counsels that carried with them any similitude of fear, was the
frequent intelligence he receiv'd from a very good hand of the
good posture the <hi>Count</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Affairs were in: full of which good
news he departed from <hi>Cognac</hi> to go to <hi>Neuvy,</hi> a House belonging
to the Baron of <hi>Auton</hi> his Nephew, where he intended to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
the sick man, till he should have certain intelligence of the
success of the <hi>Count</hi>'s Arms: but he had no time to make a long
dissimulation of it, for two days after his arrival at this place, the
Countess <hi>de Brienne</hi> passing that way to go into <hi>Angoumois,</hi>

would moreover infallibly transfer it to the contrary side: And

they had so long made him undergo? Even his own delays, and
some too free expressions had escap'd from him in the almost cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
expectation he had been possess'd withal of a hopeful issue,
did not a little afflict him; wherefore the better to conceal all
that had pass'd, he immediately resolv'd upon sending away a

                  <p>To add yet something more to the satisfaction the Duke had
receiv'd by these two kind Letters, the Gentleman that brought
them moreover assur'd him, that he had observ'd at Court no
other than Serene, and Auspicious Countenances; and that there
was nothing which for the future threatned any worse usage, than
what he had already receiv'd: Insomuch that even his best
Friends there, and those who were most solicitous of him did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that had he not already receiv'd a Command to depart from

but seeing that Order had been already sent him, they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  </p>

from the Body in general, and the several Societies, and Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in particular, almost all the Magistrates, and Officers, at least
the most considerable of them, came in their own persons to wait
upon him; insomuch that it seem'd, whilst Courted, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented
at this unexpected rate, he was nothing fall'n from his
former Prosperity, and Greatness. All these Honours (of which
he was as sensible as any) having reviv'd his Spirits, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
quickned, and rais'd his Wit, and Fancy, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be highly admir'd, by an infinite number of the Curious,
who being continually asking him a thousand Questions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the State Secret of past Transactions, he clear'd them of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
important Doubts, which few men living could unriddle;
and explain'd to them many passages in <hi>d' Avila's</hi> History, which
at this time was so new in <hi>France,</hi> that it was in the hands of very
few. He had a complacency for all sorts of people, far above
what till now he had ever had, and a gracious and winning sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for his own Servants they had never known before: by
which obliging and free fashion, together with the antient esteem
annext to his Person, and Vertue, he in an instant won the Love,
and Applause of all the world. In this publick and universal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and Reputation, and in the assurance had been given him
from Court, that nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>inister was to be apprehended thence,
the memory of his antient Authority began again to revive in his
mind, and that put him upon a desire to exercise it in this little
Government; which that he might the better do, he particularly
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:63412:330"/>
inform'd himself of all the Affairs of the City, and Country about
it, he caus'd all the Courriers that pass'd that way to come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to himself, and suffer'd nothing of Publick Business,
to be determin'd without first giving him an account: so that in
a place where it seem'd he had nothing at all to do, he was ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enough to find himself employment, and to create himself
some diversion, and delight.</p>
                  <p>Who is it but must be astonish'd in this condition of the
Duke's, and after so many, and so great Severities exercis'd upon
him, to see the Cardinal, who was the Authour of all, make no
difficulty to address to him, and to request favours at his hands?
In the height of all his Persecutions, they had still retain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

call'd <hi>Ocamp,</hi> having been slain at the Siege of <hi>Aire, Montant</hi> his
Brother address'd himself to the Cardinal, by his Intercession to
be invested with his Brothers Command. The Duke would
never descend so low towards the Cardinal (though he had met
with several occasions wherein he might with much more reason
have done it) not so much as after the death of the Cardinal his
Son, he being (as has been already said) never to be prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ask him any one of his Benefices: but Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi>
without being mov'd at the generosity of this Example, writ this
Letter to the Duke.

There was not any about the Duke, who was not astonish'd
at this Request, and he himself to that degree, that he had much
ado to perswade himself the Letter was not supposititious, and
forg'd: having nevertheless consider'd how unlikely it was,
that in so publick a thing, any person whatever durst be so bold,
as to counterfeit the Seal of so powerful, and so fear'd a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
he began to suspect it might be some Artifice to extract from
him a denial, from thence to derive a pertext for the future to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of all Offices that should become vacant in the <hi>French</hi> Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
without having any more recourse to him for his Consent.
Knowing therefore very well, that he, who only intreated, had
Power to take; and that he would doubtless do it, did he not
presently grant his request, he rather quitted to him, than gave
him the Command, and thereupon sent him a Letter, of which
this is the Copy.

                  <p>The Cardinal would by no means comprehend the terms
of this Letter, though they were not so obscure, but that the true
sense was very easie to be understood; he accepted the Office
however very well, without considering nevertheless, how few
occasions of that kind remain'd to the Duke, wherein to oblige
his own Servants, and to add yet more to our wonder, return'd
him thanks in these words.

                  <p>Yet was not all the Favour of that time absolutely contrary to
the Duke,<note place="margin">Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at Court, stir'd up by the Favourite <hi>Cinq-Mars.</hi>

persecuted to the degree we have already seen, <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mars
Grand Escuyer</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the King's true Favourite, had
at least as great an inclination to serve, as the other had manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
a desire to hurt him. This young Gentleman one of the most
accomplish'd, and unhappy that Nature ever produc'd in his
time, either jealous of the Cardinal's Power, or prompted by
more vertuous and laudable Motives, openly labour'd to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
his Credit with the King. He had for his principal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents,
<hi>de Thou,</hi> and <hi>Fontrailles,</hi> both the one and the other a
particular Friend, and Servant to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> by whose
good Offices <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> had been wrought into so great a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the Duke, that he often receiv'd very respective Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from him. I do not believe notwithstanding, that the
Duke had any hand in his Designs, if not so far as they might be
conducing to the Service of the Queen; for in truth he had so
wholly devoted himself to the Service of this Princess (every day
threatned with the loss of the King by his continual Sicknesses)
that he was resolv'd, upon occasion, to expose all things for her
Service, and that of the Princes her Children; a disposition in him
the Queen was very well assur'd of: Neither did she a little rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Credit, and Fidelity of so considerable a Servant. As to
the other disorders of the Court, I very well know he did by no
means approve them: but on the other side fearing left <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailles,</hi>
whom he entirely lov'd, should engage himself too far
in those Factions, he never writ to him, though he did it very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
without adding in a Postscript under his own hand.<note n="*" place="margin">Above all things take heed of the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>Sur

and in good time: But for <hi>de Thou,</hi> being come to see him at <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
soon after his arrival there, I know very well, as having
been a Witness to it, that he exhorted and conjur'd him by all the
Ties betwixt them, to forsake the frequentations, and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he had at Court, and to settle himself to some moderate
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:63412:331"/>
condition in the Long Robe, which he had taken upon him.
He had acquir'd so many rare, and eminent qualities proper for
that calling, as might have rendred him one of the greatest men
of the Profession: and besides that, the Duke was induc'd to give
him these prudent Exhortations, by the consideration of their
Alliance, and the Affection and Esteem he had for his person,
he did moreover herein not a little gratifie the desire of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

with him, never ceas'd importuning him to use his utmost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,

                     </note> he had for some time lead. But his Destiny carried it
above their Prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Foresight; and he must in the end
add to the number of the Illustrious unhappy of his time. The
Duke had not the grief of seeing his deplorable end, his own
Death sometime preceding, as we shall shortly see, and of which
this in my opinion was the cause.</p>
                  <p>From the time that the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
in the Government of <hi>Guienne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny of <hi>Madaillan</hi> against the Duke, the cause of his Death.</note> he having conceiv'd,
that to add greater weight to his Authority, it would not be
inconvenient to inflict some exemplary punishment, upon some
notable Offenders: a Gentleman of that Province, but one the
most unworthy of that Quality of any that ever wore that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
called <hi>Madaillan,</hi> fell within the danger of his Justice.
The Duke therefore being solicited, and importun'd on a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
hands, to cause Justice to be executed upon this man, for an
infinite number of Crimes, whereof he stood Convict, he at
last attempted to seize him, that he might be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
Punishment: but this wretch as Distrustful and Cunning,
as Villanous, and Wicked, still found means to escape the hands
of the Serjeants, who had order from the Duke to apprehend
him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Madaillan</hi>'s Character.</note> and lay a long time conceal'd in the Province. In the end
notwithstanding he was constrain'd to fly, which he did, and
put himself into the Enemies Armies, not to Fight, for he was
never guilty of any handsome Action, but to Plunder and to
Betray; insomuch that in a very little space, he had to his other
Crimes added that of a Fugitive from all Parties. He was in
Pay with the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the
States of <hi>Holland;</hi> after which famous Exploits he return'd home
to his own house, hoping that time had worn out of the Duke's
mind the memory of his former Offences: but he soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
there was no abiding in the Duke's Government, for men
of his known and detected manners. He there liv'd therefore
in so perpetual fear, as made him to keep a kind of Garrison in
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:63412:332"/>
his House; which the Duke having notice of, he resolv'd to cause
some of his Souldiery to beset the House, and by fine force to take
him. This Deliberation, which could not be executed without
some noise, gave <hi>Madaillan</hi> leisure to make his escape: he
took therefore at this time the way of <hi>Italy,</hi> and went to <hi>Genoa,</hi>
where he presented Prince <hi>Auria</hi> with some counterfeit Letters
from the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> under favour of which, he gull'd
this Prince of some very considerable Summes of Money. From
thence he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he insinuated himself into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the <hi>Count de Brassac,</hi> Ambassadour there for the King of
<hi>France,</hi> of whom, by virtue of other Counterfeit Letters, he was
favourably receiv'd: But it is not to be believ'd how many
Cheats, Insolencies, and other abominable Crimes he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under our Ambassadours Protection; till in the end the
<hi>Count</hi> tir'd out with the Complaints he daily receiv'd of his lewd
Behaviour, was upon the point to have deliver'd him into the
hands of Justice, if he had not fairly ran away. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>Madaillan</hi> returns back into <hi>France;</hi> neither could he possibly
have arriv'd in a more favourable conjuncture for such men as he,
it being precisely at the time of the great Revolts of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and
wherein he also had the share that was his due. The King being
willing to communicate his Grace at the Duke's instance towards
such as had been guilty of those Disorders, the said Duke had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
a care, to cause such to be excepted from the general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity,
as were tax'd with other hainous and notorious
Crimes, conceiving it neither just, nor of good Example, that
by new Crimes men should pretend to Pardon for the old, and
that by great Offences they should obtain an impunity for others
of less importance. The King maturely weighing these good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Duke, proceeded according to his Advice; by which
means <hi>Madaillan</hi> found himself in much more danger after the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of the other Delinquents, than at any time before he had ever
been. His Conscience, besides the Crimes already mention'd, did
moreove accuse him of several others, of a horrid, and unheard
of nature; For the incest he had committed with his own
Daughter, had in his Process been prov'd against him; the
Parricide having moreover caus'd three Children he had by her
to be murther'd before his own eyes. He had been Convict of
having four Wives at one, and the same time, and of all the other
abominable Actions can be imagin'd: what was there then that
ought to be suspected from an Enemy arm'd with so much wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
and so many horrid, and detested Crimes?</p>
                  <p>This desperate Villain seeing himself, and his Affairs, in so lost
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:63412:332"/>
and irrecoverable a condition, and knowing the persecution
the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and all his Family suffer'd under at that
time,<note place="margin">His Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to ruine the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> took a resolution to fall upon him to his final Ruine, and
to assault him with so hateful a Calumny, as that the sole Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
should of it self, and of course, put the party accus'd
out of all manner of defence. Big therefore with this accurs'd
design, he goes to <hi>Paris,</hi> where not finding the King, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
himself to the Dutchess of <hi>Eguillon;</hi> to whom conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Name, as being too well known, in a studied Discourse
of which he was capable enough, he delivers in great secresie,
That there was a Conspiracy on foot against the proper Person
of the King himself, and also against that of the Cardinal her
Uncle. Neither was he content to make a bare discovery of the
pretended Treason, and proceeded moreover to undertake to
justifie what he had said by literal proofs, provided he might
have three months Protection granted him in <hi>Guienne,</hi> where
his Enemies, he said, had invented false Crimes against him,
on purpose to destroy him.<note place="margin">His Artifice herein.</note> It is to be presum'd, he did not
forget the Duke of <hi>Espernon's</hi> name, in this first Accusation,
though it was afterwards deny'd at Court, when the business
came to be discover'd. The Dutchess however, interested as she
was in the Person of the Cardinal, and startled as she ought to
be, with the horror of so prodigious a Treason, writ in all
haste to the Court, which was then at <hi>Amiens;</hi> from whence
without any difficulty at all she obtain'd the safe Conduct <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daillan</hi>
had desir'd in order to the producing his Proofs. He must
needs have some money also, which was likewise given him,
with an Order to take up more in the Province; so that to the
astonishment of all good men, behold this wicked Villain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
to his Country, and again settled in his own House. He
presents his Letters of safe Conduct to the Parliament, where
they were Recorded, and soon after Assembles all those whom
the Relation of their Offences could any ways render favourable
to him, to his own House. Amongst this sort of people there
were three or four notorious Impostors, to whom with the rest
of his Complices he very gravely represented,<note place="margin">He propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to his Complices.</note> 
                     <q>The Obligation
they all had to him, for the special care he had taken, both of
their Lives, and Fortunes; telling them that he had now that
of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> their common Persecutor, absolutely
in his power, to dispose of it to their Benefit, and Advantage:
That in order hereunto he had undertaken by his diligence to
prove, the Duke had meditated an Artempt upon the Persons
of the King, and the great Minister: That therefore every one
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:63412:333"/>
there was to do his utmost endeavour, that an act of that merit,
utility, and importance to them all might not be left imperfect;
especially considering, that thereupon depended their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Security, Repose, and Advancement.</q> These promises
were far greater than had been any ways necessary to allure such
mean, and abject Minds into his wicked design; so that they
immediately, and without further deliberation, put their hands
to the work: The Secretaries Character was easie enough to be
imitated; but they could never Counterfeit the Duke's Seal,
which being very intricate, was exceedingly difficult to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
to any tolerable degree. <hi>Madaillan</hi> then seeing this
way would not take, applies himself to one <hi>Grillety</hi> a notorious
Ring Leader of the Padders: This Fellow, after the Defeat, and
Dissipation of his Complices, had retir'd himself into a Forest of
<hi>Perigort,</hi> where with strange Boldness, and Impudence, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
so many Robberies, and Murthers, as had rendred his
name Famous even in the very Court it self. To this man, as
he had done before to the rest, he offers Indemnity, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
if he would accuse the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to have dealt
with him to attempt an Assassinate upon the Persons of the
King, and Cardinal <hi>Richelieu.</hi> 'Tis said, that, although nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
in Blood, and Slaughter, and opprest with Crimes, for
which he could expect no Pardon, this man nevertheless was not
wicked enough to hearken to this Proposition; insomuch that
at the first he absolutely refus'd to do it, and if afterwards the
hopes of Pardon tempted him into that damnable practice, it
was not however to persist in his wickedness to the utmost tryal,
as we shall hereafter see.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madaillans</hi> practices had alarm'd the whole Country, no body
doubting but that the frequent Assemblies of such a crew of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
would infallibly produce some prodigious mischief. The
Duke's Servants, of which there were very many in that Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
as in all other parts of the Province, did easily judg
that this Consultation was principally intended against him, and
were not a little troubled at it: but they could not at first ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the wickedness of their design to be so great, as it really was.

                     </note> very affectionate to
the Duke's Family, and who had been bred up from his younger
years with the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Son, sent the first intelligence
of this Conspiracy: but it was no other than Conjecture only;
the certainty of it was brought the Duke by <hi>Auterive,</hi> who
came post to him (and I think it was upon the 8<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> day of
<hi>November)</hi> to discover to him the whole contrivance of this
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:63412:333"/>
treacherous design. Another Gentleman a Neighbour of his
had a Nephew who was a great Comrade of <hi>Madaillan</hi>'s, and a
great Confident of his, from whom he had learn'd the whole
Affair, of which he was not content to deliver <hi>Auterive</hi> a
simple Relation by word of mouth only, but would moreover
give him the whole Circumstance of it in writing, that it might
by the Duke be the better believ'd. The Duke having read, and
communicated this Intelligence to some of his Domesticks, was
surpriz'd with so great an astonishment, as the like had never,
upon any occasion whatever been observ'd in him before. He
was in Bed, according to his custom, though it was in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
when this news came to him; and doubtless it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for him, that it should find him in that posture, the
better to resist so strange a surprize. His first thought was, that
an Accusation of so black, and odious a nature had not been
contriv'd without order, and concluded thence, that his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
weary of his long Life, would at one blow deprive
him of that,<note place="margin">And dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches his Secretary to Court, to justifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> his Estate, Offices, and Honour. In this
violent agitation of mind, which was visible enough in his
Countenance, he commanded his Secretary immediately to
depart to go with <hi>Auterive</hi> to the Court. He would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound
to the bottom what opinion they there had concerning this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair;
but he desir'd withal, that the Truth might be exactly sif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out, that so he might have means to justifie his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and to cause the Authors of so damnable a mischief to
be severely punish'd. The Secretary had order to address him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to <hi>Monsieur Fabert,</hi> at that time Captain of the Regiment
of Guards, by his means to get access to <hi>Chavigny,</hi> the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of State, by him with greater facility to be admitted to the
Cardinal's presence. The business was carried on according to
the Duke's desire; <hi>Auterive</hi> and the Secretary, without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
got to speak with <hi>Chavigny,</hi> who promis'd the next day to
procure them Audience.</p>
                  <p>The next day being come, which was the 15<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi>
they were accordingly admitted into the Cardinal's Presence,
where the Secretary having a Letter of Credence from the Duke
his Master, he advanc'd to present it; which the Cardinal having
received, and read, he told him; <q>That <hi>Monsieur d' Espernon</hi> had
referr'd the further explication of what he desir'd he should be
acquainted withal to him, who was the Bearer; wherefore he
desir'd to know what Service he desir'd of him?</q> He had been
before sufficiently inform'd of all by <hi>Chavigny,</hi> who was there
present: but would nevertheless permit, that he who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:63412:334"/>
him the Letter, should again report to him the life of the
wretched person, who had so vilely accus'd his Master. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Secretary summarily repeated, <q>All you have heard
before, setting out <hi>Madaillan</hi> in his own colours, and for such
as he truly was; acquainting the Cardinal moreover of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
the Duke had us'd to apprehend him, and to bring him
to condigne Punishment for his many, and hainous Crimes;
making it appear, that from thence proceeded the malice of this
Accuser, and that that was the thing which had prompted
him to invent this hateful Calumny, by which he intended to
eclipse the Duke's Honour; intreating him at last, as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Favour his Master could receive at his hands, to give order
that the falsity of this Accusation might be strictly examin'd
by any person he should think fit to appoint, and not to permit
that the most ancient Officer of the Crown, who had serv'd
four Kings without Reproach, should in the last Act of his
Life undergo the most odious of all Aspersions, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the satisfaction he might reasonably promise to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from his Eminences Justice, and his own Innocency.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cardinal, after he had hearkened to this Discourse, which
was pretty long, with great Civility, and Patience, the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
having done,<note place="margin">His Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> made answer, <q>That it was true, the King
being five or six weeks ago at <hi>Amiens, Messieurs,</hi> the Ministers
who staid behind at <hi>Paris,</hi> had given him intimation of a
man of the Province of <hi>Guienne,</hi> who deliver'd himself to be
a Gentleman, and whom they had found to be a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
that was purposely come thither to assure them,
that a Conspiracy had been made in <hi>Guienne,</hi> to attempt upon
the Life of the King, and that he had offer'd to prove his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
by sufficient evidence in Writing, under the Hands of
the Conspirators. You will very well judg (added the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal)
that an Advertisement of this kind, was of too important
a nature to be neglected: but he deny'd withal that the Duke's
name had ever been mention'd in that Affair; assuring him
moreover, that had it been so much as glanc'd at in that Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
he should immediately have concluded the whole
thing altogether forg'd, and false, as he now absolutely did:
That he knew the Duke to be too good a man to entertain so
criminal a thought, and that he would ever answer for him, as
for himself: That therefore he ought not to concern himself
about his Justification, and that he had been very well wash'd
(which was his own expression) but that notwithstanding they
were to consider which way to give him satisfaction, in causing
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:63412:334"/>
those who had been the Authors of his Calumny, to be brought
to exemplary punishment.</q> After which he enquir'd by what
means <hi>Madaillan</hi> might be taken, concluding in the end that the
King should give the Duke power to apprehend him, if possible,
even in <hi>Guienne</hi> it self; that in the mean time he would give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to have him sent for to Court, whither in a very short time
he had also promis'd to come; that by one means or other, it
should be a hard matter for him to escape; and, that if he did once
fall into his hands, he would deliver him up into those of Justice,
as he afterwards did, and in that was very just to his word.</p>
                  <p>The King's Dispatch was made ready at this time; but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
could not however so soon depart, as by this successful
beginning he was in hopes he should have done, <hi>Chavigny,</hi> who
had order to deliver him his Dispatch, appointing him to stay
yet some few days longer. But these few days were spun out into
some few weeks, during which interval he had notice given him
by several of his Friends, that there was an Order granted out to
Arrest him, to make him give an account of those Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Papers were laid to his charge. These advertisements, which
he receiv'd from very good hands, did much more trouble him
for the regard he had to the Duke his Master, than for any thing
that concern'd himself; he believ'd that they would proceed in
this Affair by the way, and in the forms of Justice, which was
nothing consonant to what had been promis'd him in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
The Duke's Servants, to whom he had instructions to
communicate all things, were also infinitely surpriz'd at the news:
but he forbore not, what danger soever had been represented to
him, to appear as at other times in all places where his business lay-After
he had given all the time was necessary, wherein to clear
any doubts that might have been started concerning this Affair,
and weary to see no more than the first hour he came, he resolv'd
at last, finding he could obtain nothing from <hi>Chavigny,</hi> to make
his Address immediately to the Cardinal himself, hoping from
him at least to learn the true reasons, why he had been thus long
delay'd. This design accordingly took effect, and the Cardinal
having espied him amongst a crowd of other Solicitors, and
Suitors that were attending in the Hall, caus'd him presently to
be call'd to tell him, <q>That upon the hopes <hi>Madaillan</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him of his coming every day to Town,<note place="margin">And an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der granted to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illan,</hi> and his Complices.</note> he had desir'd he
might stay to be a witness of his Confinement: but that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was no end of his delays, he might now return to his
Master, and assure him, that what he had promis'd upon this
occasion, should be punctually perform'd: That it would also
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:63412:335"/>
be necessary he on his part should employ all the Friends, and
Servants he had in <hi>Guienne,</hi> to cause the Slanderer to be taken,
and that, the thing being of that importance to his Honour, he
did not doubt but the Duke would herein use endeavours pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the quality of the Affair.</q> After which he
pour'd out himself in several expressions of very great Civility
concerning the Duke: but they were so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> distant from his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of proceeding, and so differing from the ill usage he made his
Master at the same time undergo; that giving them no place in
his belief, he scarce allow'd them a room in his memory. After
this manner the Duke's Secretary departed from Court, charg'd
with Letters from the King, and the Cardinal, which were
couch'd in these terms.

                  <p>The Duke after the departure of his Secretary was fall'n into so
profound a Melancholy, accompanied with a lingring Fever, that
the reading the favourable Letters he brought him back at his
return, was not of Vertue wholly to cure a Disease that had
already taken too deep root in his mind. He was affected with
grief to that degree, that nothing could content him: but he
was nevertheless a little reviv'd to find that this Affair had not
deriv'd it self from the source he had at first suspected, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
those dangerous effects he reasonably apprehended it would.
In this little interval of repose, he dispatch'd <hi>Auterive</hi> in all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
into <hi>Guienne,</hi> with the most express Orders he could possibly
tell how to give, to cause <hi>Madaillan,</hi> and his Complices to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended:
but it was labour lost; he went of his own
accord to put himself into the Cardinal's hands, who kept his
word with the Duke, committing him the very day of his arrival
to the<note n="*" place="margin">O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Conciergerie du Palais,</hi> from whence he came no more
forth, but to suffer the punishment of his Crimes. But that was
not till after the return of the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who with so
much passion, and generosity prosecuted this accursed Villain, the
real instrument of the Duke his Father's Death, that in the end he
procur'd his chastisement by the hand of the Hangman.</p>
                  <p>After the dismission of <hi>Auterive,</hi> of which I have now spoken,
the Duke made yet another dispatch, which also was almost the
last of his Life, and that was to Cardinal <hi>Richelieu.</hi>

                  <p>This Complement of <hi>Most Obedient,</hi> which I have here pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
transcrib'd, was none of his usual stile, it had now also by
inadvertency scap'd his Pen, and he sent an express Courrier af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Count de Maillé,</hi> to retrive his Letter so soon as he perceiv'd
he had subscrib'd it after that manner: Instead thereof sending him
another with the ordinary Subscription of <hi>Most Humble and most
Affectionate,</hi> choosing rather to be thought stiffe, and punctillious,
than to go less in the condition he then was, and to descend to an
extraordinary civility, which might rather be interpreted, and
imputed to weakness, and want of courage, than to complacency,
and gratitude. His first Letter was indeed never delivered: but he
also never saw it again. His Death preceded the return of the <hi>Count
de Maillé,</hi>
who had still kept it in his hands; and the time was
now come, when this long life, which had escap'd from so many,
and so eminent dangers, must end by a Disease that was easily
enough to be foreseen: but for which no remedy could possibly
be found.</p>
                  <p>I have already given an account of the dangerous effect,<note place="margin">Anno 1642.</note> the
news of <hi>Madaillan's</hi> Conspiracy produc'd to the ruine of the
Duke's Health.<note place="margin">The Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Death of the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi>
                     </note> And I shall now tell you that it was a wound
which had pierc'd so deep into his heart, as no Balsam, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the King's, nor Cardinal's civil, and obliging Letters, of
his Friends Consolations, or of the conscience of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
of greater vertue than them both, that could be apply'd,
could possibly cure. The assurances he had receiv'd from Court,
that this Calumny had made no impression to his disadvantage
there, nor the hopes he had thence receiv'd of receiving thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a full, and honourable satisfaction, could never so appease the
tempest of his mind, that the discontents he had deriv'd from this
accursed cause, was not continually working upon all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
Objects his unquiet thoughts could represent to his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
He was grown impatient almost of all kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
the divertisements which had formerly been most accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:63412:336"/>
to him were become nauseous, and offensive, and nothing
was now so pleasing to him as solitude, which till this time he had
ever abhorr'd. An alteration that he himself was very sensible of,
and would often speak of it to those with whom he was pleas'd to
be the most familiar about him, as a certain presage of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
End: he nevertheless did all he could to disappoint his
ill humour, which he had no way to do but by play sometimes in
his Chamber, seeing he found himself incapable of taking any
pleasure abroad.</p>
                  <p>Thus spinning out the small remainder of his life in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
trouble of mind, his strength was every day observ'd vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
to impair: not long before he had been seen to tire out
young, and vigorous men with walking (for it must needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
that never man perhaps felt the infirmities of Age so late
as he) whereas now, and on a sudden he appear'd so faint, and
overworn, that he could scarce take two turns in his Chamber
without reposing himself. It was now come to that pass, that he
must repose for good and all, and the seventh of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> having
in the night been surpriz'd with a grudging of a Ague, he past
it over with great unquietness, and without any rest at all.</p>
                  <p>The next day notwithstanding he could make a shift to rise to
talk with some of his principal Servants of his Affairs, and to
make some Dispatches, as in the times of his better health: but
he found withal so great a thirst upon him, as he could neither
by a Broth, nor two great Glasses of cold water, his familiar, and
best Remedy, quench, and overcome. He went nevertheless to
Mass in a Cabinet adjoyning to his own Chamber; but he was
not able to stay it out: insomuch that presently after the Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he was constrain'd to retire, and to betake himself to his
Bed. And it was for the last time, his Fever immediately seizing
him with so great violence, that it never after left him, but with
his Life.</p>
                  <p>Within a few hours after he had been laid in Bed, <hi>Fabert,</hi> whom
he had a passionate desire to see, and had a long time expected,
came to see him. He was by him presented with a great many
Letters from several of his Friends: But the Duke without
opening any one of them, contented himself with embracing him
only, and entreating to be excus'd, that he was not in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that day to entertain him, referr'd it till the next morning, in
hopes by that time to be in a better posture of Health. At an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
time his active, and curious Spirit, that was never tir'd out
with business, would not have referr'd the discoursing with a
Friend he so dearly lov'd, till the morrow: but now, as if he
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:63412:337"/>
had foreseen what a small share remain'd to him of Worldly
things, he had not so much as the Curiosity to inform himself of
any.</p>
                  <p>His Fever, which the first day was judg'd to be Quotidian (a
sort of Ague he us'd frequently to have, and which also did
not a little contribute to the better support of his Health) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
from the first, to the second, and from the second, to the
third Fit, with so excessive violence, that <hi>Motivier</hi> his Physician,
a man very excellent in his profession, and who had for many
years been very diligent about his Person, judg'd him from that
time forwards to be in very great danger, as well by reason of his
wonderful great Age, and the evil dispositions that had preceded
his Disease, as from the Disease it self. He was therefore of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that a Father Capuchin should be sent for, to the end he
might in due time prepare him for Confession; the Fathers of
that Order having a particular priviledge to administer that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
to him. They were the more hasty to make this provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for his Conscience, by how much they perceiv'd him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to fall into Fits of Raving, which gave them an apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that his distemper encreasing, his judgment might be totally
taken from him, which notwithstanding did not so fall out.
This good Father being come to the Duke, under pretence of a
meer Visit only, put him insensibly upon the contempt of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, and the necessity of Death, and came at last by degrees
to touch a little at Confession. The Duke though by this discourse
he presently guess'd at the ill opinion they had of him, and that
they began to despair of his Life, yet did he nevertheless make
no shew of astonishment, or surprize: but on the contrary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,
with great serenity, and calmness to the good Pleasure
of Almighty God,<note place="margin">The D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

oblig'd him in putting him in mind of his Conscience: That he
was Old, and Sick: That in a better estate of Health his end
could not be far distant from him; and that being by the Grace
of God a Christian, he intended to dye after a Christian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</q>
After which few words, intreating he would give him
some time to prepare himself for this Sacrament, he caus'd him
to retire into another Room. He commanded his Servants also
to leave him alone, and to depart out of his Chamber; which
being accordingly done, after he had two hours recollected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he caus'd the Father to be again call'd in, who could never
enough commend the Zeal, and Repentance he observ'd in this
illustrious Penitent. It was about noon that he made his Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and about four of the Clock the same day, he desir'd the
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:63412:337"/>
Holy Eucharist, which he receiv'd with so great Piety, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as was not a little edifying to all the Assistants. He at the
same time gave charge to his Almoner to acquaint him when it
was time to receive the Extreme Unction, taking order for all
these last Ceremonies, with so manly an indifferency, and so
great a tranquillity of mind, as if he had rather been taking care
for some other in a dying condition, than busie about any thing
that immediately concern'd himself. He was never heard at any
time either to wish for Life, or to repine at Death; but performing
without trouble and disorder what was to be done, so well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the one, and to part fairly with the other, he, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at this time gave the greatest proof, and example of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and Constancy, that he had ever done.</p>
                  <p>His Disease growing every day more violent than other, he
was, the fourth day of his Sickness, observ'd to fall into more
and more extravagant Ravings, than at any time before, to which
his Chest also began to be so obstructed, that there was a visible
difficulty of Breathing: All which dangerous Accidents, and
mortal Symptomes, in an Age like that of his, making every
one conclude his dissolution to be very near, they talk'd to him no
more of any thing, but God; a Discourse that he also on his
part hearkened to, with great willingness, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ention. He
had at all times had a Crucifix fastned to his Beds-feet, upon
which he now perpetually fixt his eyes, and having caus'd his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
to be put about his Arm, because he wanted strength to hold
it in his hand, he was continually lifting it to his mouth to
kiss it.</p>
                  <p>The fifth day of his Sickness was very much worse, than those
that had gone before; and if upon his other days he had had
some intervals of repose, the continuation of his Disease having
infected all that remain'd in him of found, and uncorrupt; he
was totally oppress'd without any release, or intermission at all.
The extremities of his Disease therefore causing it to be judg'd
convenient to make use of the extremest Remedies both for Soul
and Body; his Physician resolv'd upon a Bleeding, and the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks
upon the Extreme Unction, of which the last nam'd
preceded the other. About two hours after midnight, the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess
<hi>de la Valette,</hi> the Marquis, and Marquise <hi>de la Valette</hi> her
Children, got up to be assisting at this Holy Ceremony; to whom
the Servants also being come in, he in the presence of all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
with exceeding Meekness, and profound Reverence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
that Sacrament. So soon as he saw the Priest enter the
Chamber, he rais'd himself up in his Bed, and having pull'd off
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:63412:338"/>
his Cap, remain'd uncovered all the time of the Administration,
making his Responces aloud to all the Prayers of the Church,
and to all the Psalms, especially the <hi>Miserere,</hi> which he repeated by
heart, with a great many Penitent Tears. This Ceremony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over, they left him some time to his repose, and about ten in
the morning the sixth day of his Sickness, and also that of his
Death, his Physician caus'd him to be let Blood. He found
himself yet capable of this Remedy, and moreover found by it
some kind of present Relief, his Chest was much less obstructed,
and his Deliriums had far longer intervals than before; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he began to have a better opinion of himself, telling us
(as it was very true) that two years before a Bleeding had sav'd
his Life, and that he found himself very much reliev'd by this:
but all these Hopes were no other than feeble Rayes, that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
us with a sudden, and fatal Eclipse. At three in the Afternoon
he appear'd so infinitely chang'd, that it was judg'd impossible
for him to pass over that day; neither was he himself insensible
of it: and certainly it was an extraordinary mercy he receiv'd in
this Extremity, to have his Judgment more perfect, and entire,
and his mind better compos'd at this, than at any other time du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole course of his Sickness.</p>
                  <p>His last moments he employ'd in entertaining <hi>Fabert,</hi> from
the day of his arrival he had never seen him; but having now
on a sudden remembred he was in the house, he caus'd him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to be call'd, where, after he had embrac'd him in his
Arms,<note place="margin">The Duke's last req<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> new assurances of an Affection, which would hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
be useless to him: but that he would conjure him by those
testimonies he had sometime receiv'd, that he would preserve
his to his declining Family: That he did entreat him to assure
the King he dy'd his Majesties most humble, and most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servant, and in his Name humbly to beseech him, to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
his little Children, whom the Disgrace of the Duke their
Father expos'd to infinite Injuries, with his gracious Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
That they had the Honour to appertain to his Majesty:
That nothing could be imputed to their Innocency, and that
he hop'd they would one day by their Services manifest their
Gratitude for his Bounty, and Favour.</q> Though to render the
King more favourable to this Request, and to those Relations
he did recommend thereby, there seem'd to be a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
that he should also send some Complement to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
he did not do it nevertheless; which some of his people
thinking he had through forgetfulness omitted, they made bold
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:63412:338"/>
to put him in mind; to whom after a little pause, he return'd
no other answer, but that he was his Servant. The same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
but with a very great deal of difference in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
manner of delivery, he sent to the Chancellour <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
Seguier,</hi> who had ever manifested for him a constant, and
inviolate Friendship; as also to several other Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
at Court. The severity that had been exercis'd upon his
Family, making him believe that their Enemies aim'd at no
less, than their total Ruine, he would enjoyn <hi>Fabert</hi> of all
his Governments, and Commands to ask the Castle of <hi>Loches</hi>
only in favour of the Marquis <hi>de la Valette</hi> his Grandchild, and
that only, because seeing himself upon the point to expire,
he could have wish'd, that his Body after his Death, might
have been in the power of no other, than those of his own
Blood. A request so modest, and so inconsiderable in it self,
that he doubted not, but it would be easily granted, and that
he might have retriv'd this little piece from the wrack of his
great Fortune: but he was deceiv'd, and the ill nature of his
Enemies was such, that even that was also deny'd him.</p>
                  <p>After he had dismiss'd <hi>Fabert,</hi> he caus'd the Dutchess <hi>de la
Valette</hi> his Daughter-in-Law, the Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and
the Marquise his Sister to come to his Bed-side, to whom after
he had in general deliver'd himself in several expressions of
great Passion, and tenderness, and exhorted them to Unity,
and Mutual Affection; directing his Speech to the Marquis,
<q>He in the first place recommended to him the Service of God,
and next that of the King, without ever alienating himself
from it upon any colour, or pretence whatever: to honour
his Father, and in what estate soever to pay him all the Duty,
and Service of a good, and Obedient Son; and never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Injuries had been done him; of which he charg'd
him in express terms to retain no kind of resentment; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them all, that living in that Unity, and good Intelligence
with one another, he had recommended to them, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
would bless them, as he bless'd them with all his
heart.</q> After which, proceeding to some consolatory Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
wherewithal to moderate their Grief, he with
great difficulty lifted up his hand to give them his last Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This Action thus pass'd, he turn'd himself to the other
side of the Bed, either to repose himself after this last effort of
his Spirits, and Voice; or to conceal his Tears, which although
by tenderness, and good Nature, rather than want of Courage,
extracted from him; yet would he not be reproach'd with such a
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:63412:339"/>
weakness, still retaining so much vigour, as to maintain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and the constancy he had ever manifested in all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
even in death it self. He was heard indeed to fetch some
profound sighs, and often to repeat the name of his Son <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette,</hi>
who of all his Children had ever been dearest to him: but
that also was all he yielded to the impulse of nature, in this final
Separation.</p>
                  <p>Having thus paid some Sighs to his Grief, several good, and
Learned Divines, who were assisting about him, again put
him upon the Discourse of Piety, and the forgiveness of his
Enemies; to whom he still constantly reply'd, that he freely
forgave them all, naming withal those from whom he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the greatest and most irreparable wrongs: when some of
them, more zealous than the rest, seeing him in so good a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
ask'd him if he did not also forgive his Servants,
who had any way displeas'd him? To whom he again reply'd,
that yes, and withal his heart: but there being one of them,
who a few days before he had fall'n upon with very severe, and
passionate Language, the same person who had engag'd in the
former Interrogatories, proceeding (indiscreetly enough) to ask
him, if he did not also ask pardon of those he might have
himself offended? His courage, not totally abated in this last
extremity, being a little inflam'd at the proposal of this reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
submission, he made answer, that it was sufficient,
he had pardon'd those of his people who had offended him,
and that he had never heard, that to dye well a Master was
oblig'd to make<note n="*" place="margin">

Domesticks. Those who were nearest to him perceiv'd him
to be a little transported at that word: but it was very easie
to pacifie, and compose him; and after that nothing was
heard from him but ardent Prayers to God: neither was he
observ'd to do any thing more, than to turn his eyes towards
the Crucifix, and to kiss his Beads. In this condition he lay,
when his strength visibly impairing, but his mind remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

grew stiffe, and cold; which cold in a few hours seiz'd of
