         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS <hi>upon</hi> George Keith's <hi>late</hi> ADVERTISEMENT <hi>of a Meeting to be held by him and his Friends, at</hi> Turner's-Hall <hi>on the Eleventh of the Fourth Month,</hi> 1696. <hi>to which he ſaith,</hi> William Penn, Thomas Ellwood, George Whitehead, John Penington, <hi>and the Second Days Weekly Meeting at</hi> London, <hi>called</hi> Quakers, <hi>are juſtly deſired to be preſent, to hear themſelves Charged,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ALthough I might here juſtly except againſt the Conſtitution of the Meeting, the Authority and Warrantableneſs of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Summons, the Reaſonableneſs as well as Seaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Demand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet being willing to purſue Method, though I have no good Example before me, I ſhall firſt take Cognizance of what <hi>G. K.</hi> Aſſigns, under ſeveral Heads, as the Baſis of his <hi>Propoſed,</hi> as well as <hi>Impoſed</hi> Debate. If they are not of Weight, or Agreeable to the Structure raiſed, a Summary at the cloſe may ſuffice, that I dilate not the Controverſy unneceſſarily.</p>
            <p>His Firſt Article is, <hi>That</hi> W Penn <hi>hath accuſed him in a publick Meeting at</hi> Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff, <hi>of being an Apoſtate, and Impoſtor, and endeavouring to pluck up the Teſtimony of Truth by the Roots.</hi> To which I ſay, Had not his <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> been ſufficiently proved, even by himſelf, in the Scene of his Tranſactions, both Private and Publick, ſince his laſt coming into <hi>England;</hi> yet inaſmuch as thoſe ſeveral Apologetical Tract: (written by <hi>Tho. Ellwood, Caleb Puſey</hi> and my ſelf, Entituled, <hi>A farther Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, Truth Defended, A Modeſt Account, An Apoſtate Expos'd,</hi> to two of which <hi>(viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>T. E</hi>'s) he tells us, in his <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> to a late Pamphlet, Stiled, <hi>Groſs Error, It is probable a due Anſwer may be given in due time)</hi> remain as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered by him, the Charge lies upon him, and the Proof at his Door, not to be ſupplied by a <hi>Verbal</hi> Conference in a <hi>Corner,</hi> as the moſt publick Diſputes are, in compariſon of the <hi>Preſs.</hi> The Name <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> I remember not to have heard made part of the Charge till now, yet if he will conſult his <hi>Dictionary,</hi> as he once did upon the calling of a Friend <hi>Impudent Raſcal,</hi> he may find it denotes a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</hi> But the <hi>Name</hi> I fear more offends him than the <hi>Nature;</hi> yet that, and his endeavouring to pluck up the Teſtimony of Truth by the Roots, as they ſuit with his Actions, ſo have they been in Print proved upon him in the above recited and other Treatiſes.</p>
            <p>Nor will his pretence in the ſucceeding lines, That W. P. <hi>promiſed to anſwer him (before many Witneſſes) when</hi> G. K. <hi>told him, he thought to put him to prove his Charge in the Face of the Nation,</hi> ſtand him in any ſtead; for that he may yet do, when <hi>G. K.</hi> makes the onſet. Is he ſo idle to think a Provocation to meet him at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> is a putting him to prove his Charge in the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Nation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What he adds as a Charge againſt <hi>W.</hi> P. out of his Books, I refer till I come to his Third Head, wherein the objects the ſame againſt <hi>G. W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on to a Secondly, <hi>Whereas</hi> Thomas Ellwood <hi>hath printed ſundry Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory Books againſt me, I charge him to be guilty of falſe Accuſations,</hi> &amp;c. Then to a Thirdly againſt <hi>G. W.</hi> of which more at on; ſo to a Fourthly againſt me, for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36342:2"/>
               <hi>printing</hi> (as he alledges) <hi>Defamatory Books againſt him, and accuſing</hi> (he ſhould have added <hi>proving</hi> too, for that was alſo done) <hi>him to be an Apoſtate,</hi> &amp;c. and Fifthly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Second Days Weekly-Meeting at</hi> London, <hi>for approving or countenancing thoſe Books, and another ſigned by</hi> Caleb Puſey (of which above) <hi>and then Declares, if it happen that few or NONE of us be preſent at the ſaid Meeting, being conſcious</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>of the badneſs of our Cauſe, his full intention to be preſent with his Friends, at the ſaid time and place, to make good the Charge againſt us,</hi> to which he allows <hi>any moderate and friendly people of other Profeſſions to be preſent, ſo far as there is room without Crowding.</hi> And is all this buſle, I pray, to <hi>anſwer</hi> or <hi>evade</hi> our Charge? In what time doth he propoſe to enervate ſo many Quotations, Arguments, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, Inſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of his and others Books, to ſhew the fallacy of the one, the inconſiſtency of the other; the Perverſions, Forgeries, falſe Acuſations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when thoſe very Books of <hi>T. E</hi>'s (not to mention the reſt) which he hath given ſome faint Expectation he would Anſwer, are above Eighteen Sheets of large Paper, cloſe Printed? Is this Man in <hi>Earneſt,</hi> or doth he think any Judicious Man can take him to be ſo? Or doth not he rather ſeek to make ſome <hi>Bravado,</hi> ſome idle <hi>Flouriſh</hi> to ſlip from his Purgation? Indeed the very Title Page be ſpeaks ſome ſuch thing, where he propoſeth, not a clearing himſelf, but a recriminating others. He tells us, <hi>We are juſtly deſired to be preſent, to hear our ſelves Charged, and proved Guilty of the following things, and we ſhall be freely heard, to anſwer to our ſeveral Charges.</hi> But ſtay a little, all in good time; we are upon the <hi>Defenſive,</hi> he upon the <hi>Offenſive</hi> part, Defending our Friends and Society from his Repeated, Impetuous Slanders and Defamations, wherewith he had unjuſtly loaded them, and labouring to <hi>throw off</hi> the Dirt he had endeavoured to <hi>fling on,</hi> even while he would have laid claim to Memberſhip, yea Elderſhip. And in the Proſecution hereof, when he Calumniates, we detect him; when he deviates from his former Pretences and Principles, we juſtly expoſe him, and declare him to be a <hi>Detracter, Apoſtate, &amp;c.</hi> having firſt proved it upon him. Now if he (who is the <hi>Aggreſſor)</hi> find himſelf aggrieved, how can he expect Relief; by fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us, for ſo charging him, or by evidencing his own Innocency? But his Work is a meer <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he begins at the wrong end; inſtead of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging</hi> himſelf (which he knows he can never do) he <hi>re-charges</hi> us, making it a crime in us to tell him he did amiſs, though we ſhew wherein; for which we muſt (if we will anſwer his Challenge) be convened before him and his, to anſwer (in a Meeting of his own picking) to ſeveral general Heads, the diſcuſſing whereof, even before Competent Judges, as they would branch forth into many particulars, ſo perhaps (were the Auditory a more compoſed, ſettled Company, than this is like to be) would take up inſtead of a Day, Weeks to debate. And when all is done, the Controverſy hitherto hath been <hi>Publick</hi> in the Face of the Nation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there it will be in <hi>Private,</hi> in reſpect of what comes abroad in Print: Nor is ſuch an Aſſembly like to determine the matter without the Preſs, but to renew a freſh occaſion to Print, yet perhaps with this <hi>hoped</hi> advantage to the Propoſer, that running off from that Cauſe he is already hampered with, and uneaſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he may wrangle a freſh upon ſome <hi>Out-skirts</hi> of the Controverſy, and drop the <hi>Main</hi> one. And this I take to be the deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:36342:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
His <hi>Thirdly</hi> (which I promiſed even now to take notice of) is levelled againſt <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> for <hi>joyning with a Prevailing Party in that called the Yearly Meeting, to paſs</hi> (what he calls) <hi>a moſt Unchriſtian Cenſure of Excommunication againſt him, without Proof,</hi> &amp;c. But why is <hi>G. W.</hi> here ſingled out, and not the whole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Party, as he terms them, included, except that he have a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Pique at him?</p>
            <p>In the ſame Paragraph he goes on and tells us, <hi>I offer to prove the ſaid</hi> George Whitehead, <hi>out of ſome of his printed Books (which it doth not appear that he hath retracted or corrected) guilty of moſt Erronious and Hurtful Principles, contrary to the Fundamental Doctrine of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion.</hi> The like he had ſaid before of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> only with this addition, <hi>That</hi> W. P. <hi>is guilty of groſs Contradiction to himſelf;</hi> for he is forward at Charging; when it comes to Proof, he falls ſhort. Yet may I remind him, that two Books lie upon his Hands unanſwered, which treat of this very Subject; the one written by <hi>T. E.</hi> called, <hi>Truth Defended;</hi> the other by my ſelf, Entituled, <hi>An Apoſtate Expoſed,</hi> in Anſwer to three of his, called, <hi>Nameleſs Bull, True Copy,</hi> and <hi>Groſs Error.</hi> In the one they are cleared from ſeveral <hi>Falſe</hi> Deductions, Inferences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> brought by <hi>G. K.</hi> to which he pretended he would give Anſwer, but never did yet; in the other his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations out of thoſe very Books of theirs, out of which he hath ſince pickt Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, are opoſed to his later Senſe, not only of the Authors, but of the very Books themſelves, to which alſo no Anſwer hath been yet given. So that it is not ſo much his different Senſe (or <hi>Opinion)</hi> of <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> (as he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, p. 4. Of this <hi>Advertiſement</hi> but even of their Books, calling that <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> one year, which he repreſents as <hi>Hetrodox</hi> another; that I was drawn to Detect and Expoſe. However two things occur to me from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Firſt, That printed Books (not <hi>Retracted</hi> or <hi>Corrected)</hi> are good Evidence againſt <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> and are they not ſo againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> eſpecially ſeeing he hath confeſſed, <hi>True Copy,</hi> p. 17. That ſome of his <hi>need ſome further Explanation, Emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Correction,</hi> and promiſed to do it, tho' in that he keeps his word with us, as he hath hitherto done with <hi>T. E. Secondly,</hi> That it is not reaſonable for him to expect his renewed Charge againſt <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> of the ſame Nature as the former, ſhould be Heard and Debated in a <hi>Select</hi> Aſſembly of his own, when he is Debtor to two Tracts, publiſh'd ſome Months ſince, where the matter hath been ſo handled, that he hath not thought fit to Reply. Let him fairly clear his Hands of what is <hi>already depending,</hi> and which he hath <hi>choſe</hi> to concert in Print, and then offer new if he hath any. Till then he muſt excuſe us, that we cannot comply with his empty and ſhifting Subterfuges, whereby to turn the courſe of the Controverſy out of its due and proper Channel; whither he brought it, into an indirect one, where he would now lead us, to drown it.</p>
            <p>What follows being moſtly a catching at a paſſage or two out of thoſe Books of <hi>T. E</hi>'s, which he hath not attempted to Anſwer, I touch the lighter on, as eſteeming it an unmanly way of Treating an Opponent, in which I deſign not to gratifie him. And he is the more inexcuſable, in aſmuch as the odds, in his Eyes, is ſo great between them, <hi>G. K.</hi> being a Man, who (as he tells us in his <hi>Serious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> p. 29. <hi>Hath the Gifts both of Sound Knowledge and Expreſſion, with manifold other Mercies beſtowed upon him:</hi> T. E. on the other Hand, is repreſented
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36342:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by <hi>G. K.</hi> p. 3. of this <hi>Advertiſement, groſly Ignorant of Human Learning, guilty of Pedantick Trifling and Quibling.</hi> But <hi>G. K.</hi> is not the only Adverſary, who hath made up in <hi>Vaunt,</hi> what he wanted in <hi>Argument,</hi> or been forced to ſink under the weight of a bad Cauſe. <hi>For Great is the Truth, and it doth and will prevail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He tells up in p. 3. <hi>He hath neither time, nor ability of outward Eſtate, to print Anſwers to him or others, that heap Book upon Book againſt him.</hi> What <hi>time</hi> he hath, or how he employs it. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not to determine; but he ſhould, like a <hi>Wiſe Builder,</hi> have counted the <hi>Coſt</hi> before he began with us, and not blame us for anſwering his Books, after he hath given the Provocation. Yet <hi>time</hi> was, when he took <hi>time</hi> to Scribble Books very faſt, and that at a time when the <hi>Preſs</hi> was in his Parties Hands; but I muſt confeſs, from the <hi>firſt time</hi> that he hath met with Opponents, and that he hath been put upon to prove, as well as aſſert <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Ability</hi> hath mightily failed him.

But now to extricate himſelf, he would excuſe himſelf from printing, for want of time and ability of Outward Eſtate as well as that he inſinuates, p. 4. that <hi>W. P</hi>'s calling him <hi>Apoſtate</hi> hath that tendency; for he ſaith, <hi>His Wife and Children are affected with it, and that it tends to the expoſing of them to Ruine and want,</hi> as if he name among us for Outward Ends. If ſo, the diſappointment is juſt. But if he be not a Man alone, one of <hi>no People <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
