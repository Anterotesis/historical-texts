            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, it is a true saying of that royal King Salomon Prov. 19. 29. <hi>Iudgments are prepared for Scorners:</hi> that is, for such who contemne the precepts and admonitions of God, and his faithfull Ministers. And as they are thus <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</hi> so are they oft times executed upon such, even in this present life: that Gods power, truth, and justice might be manifested, and wicked men frighted from their evill courses: So the Psalmist: Psalm. 9. 16. <hi>The Lord is knowne by the judgment that he executeth; the wicked is snared in the worke of his owne hands:</hi> the reason is thus rendered by the Prophet Isay. c. 26. 9. <hi>For when thy judgements are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learne righteousnesse;</hi> though never so indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and refractory before. Neither doth God so inflict his judgements, <note n="*" place="margin">As he hath done on the 4. Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and on these Infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of it.</note> as to have them presently forgotten; but he stampes a <hi>Memento</hi> on them; <hi>having so done his marvelous works</hi> (as wel of justice, as of mercy) <hi>that they ought to be had in remembrance.</hi> Psalm. 111. 4. Himselfe therefore hath vouchsafed to record (even in sacred writ) many notable examples of his avenging justice, both ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, Nationall, and personall, for al posteritie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template;

prefacing some of them with a special <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum</hi> for our more serious consideration of them; with Luk. 17. 32. <hi>Remember Lots wife:</hi> which judgments though executed many thousand yeares past, <hi>yet they remaine still fresh upon record,</hi> as done but yesterday, even <hi>for this very end, that they might be examples unto us, not to last after evil things as they lusted,</hi> nor to trace the footsteps of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wayes, lest we should incurre the selfe same <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarie punishments</hi> as they susteined. <hi>1. Cor. 10. 5. to 12.</hi> And as God himselfe, so holy men of God in all ages, following his example, have carefully observed, and registred to posteritie the speciall most remarkable judgments of God upon obstinate sinnes and sinners of all sorts, (with which not only ecclesiasticall, but even profane Stories, are fully fraught) happened in the ages, and the places wherein they lived: Many whereof <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Iohn Fox in his Acts and monuments,</hi> neere the end, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r,</hi> Raynolds</hi> in his <hi>Treatise concerning the miraculous discovery and punishments of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Murtherers.</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Examples of Gods judgements hereunder set downe, have fallen out within the space of lesse then two yeares last past, even since the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration for sports (tolerated on the Lords day) was published, and read by many Ministers in their congregations; for hereupon ill disposed people (being as dry fewell, to which fire being put, quickly flameth forth; or as waters, pent up and restrained being let loose, breake forth more furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) were so incouraged, if not inraged, as taking liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dispensed, thereby so provoked God, that his wrath in sundry places, hath broken out to the destruction of many, would to God to the instruction of any. And the judgements are so much the more remarkable, that so many in number, as here are observed, (besides many more, no doubt which have not come to our eares) should fall within so narrow a compasse of time, so thick, and that in so many places: as we read not of such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15706:7"/>
of judgements in this kinde for this one sin through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole history of time, from the Apostles hitherto: So many there are of them, as, it were too heathenish to impute them to chance, &amp; too much stupidity, and envy of Gods glorie, not to acknowledge the speciall hand of God in them, upon such transgressors of his owne sacred day: And it were to be wished, that all the examples in this kinde, within this compasse of time; were diligently collected and compiled into one Narration, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illustration of Gods glory, and for admonition to all Sabbath-breakers, who if they repent not, nor sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease from such their profanesse, it may justly be feared, that the number of such examples will be daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, till they make a heape for all the World, to stand amazed at. In the meane time, who so is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindnesse of the Lord: Psal. 107. 43. As for the truth of them, I have good testimony under the hands of men, of sufficient credit, for the most of them; and the rest hath come to our eares by credible report. If it shall so fall out, that one or two, or so, should proove otherwise, either for the substance, or circumstance; let not the Reader blame me, who have used my best diligence to inquire out the certain truth of them all, and I am sure the most of the examples are confirmed by witnesses without all exception, and none of them is to me of any suspected credit; So as here are no fained miracles, nor fabulous stories, nor ould Wives tales, for profane Scoffers to ieare at, and play upon, thereby to disgrace and discredit all truthes in this kinde, as some of late have done (History of the Sabbath. part. 2. chap. 7. pag. 223.) but these examples are such, as will abide the

               <p>To this we will adde another example, because it fell within the same moneth, in the same city.

And now, that the plague and pestilence begins to breake forth, and spreeds itselfe much amongst us, the Lord shooting these his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible venemous arrowes, from which not even Princes nor Prelates palaces can secure themselves, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his butts and marks: What can we more impute it unto, as the cause thereof, then to this grand sinne, of the profanation of the Sabbath or Lords day, occasioned so much the more by the publishing of the late booke for sports, and that, by the Ministers themselves? For was it not the judgement and confession of King Iames of famous memory, and of the whole state and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in an exhortation published in that great plague, beginning with his raigne, 1603, where are these words: The Lords Sabbath is not kept holy, but polluted &amp;c. and therefore the cause is apparent, why the plague is broken in amongst us?

be comprehended in a Parenthesis, being now to furnish a pretty Treatise) these our Homilies (I say) so frequently and clearly called the Lords day the Sabbath day, before Iohn Knox called it so, 1554. And the same Homilies being set forth a fresh by Queene Elizabeth, 1562. will Dr. P. dare to charge the learned and pious compilers of them, a pack of Puritans, or (as <note n="*" place="margin">Doctor Wh. Bp. of Ely.</note> some other) NOVELL SABBATARIANS? But this by the way) by which violation (I say) of the Sabbath or Lords day, God is into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably dishonoured, and his Religion disgraced through outragious libertinisme: What an invention of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian tyranny hath broken in at the opening of this great sluice? What havock is made in our Church by sundry of the Hierarchy in suspending godly Ministers, depriving them of their liberty, livelyhood, and Freeholds, against all Lawes of God and man, so as they, their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are exposed to beggery and all misery, and their flocks to be devoured of the wolves, and to become a prey to that roaring Lion; and all this, because they dare not offer violence to their consciences, in doing that, which should dishonour God, indanger their owne, and their peoples soules, abase before God and man the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and dignity to their Ministry, condemne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent people of God, and call the wicked righteous, teach inferiours rebellion to their Superiours, and in a word hasten the pulling downe of vengeance from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the Land? O ye heavens, stand amazed at this sight! Tell it not in Gath, nor publish it in the Streets of Askelon, least the daughters of the Philistims rejoyce, least the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. What could the Pope have done more, then some of our Prelates have done in this kind, for the darkening of the


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15706:22"/>
glory of Christs Kingdome, and for the setting up of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists throne againe in this Land? But our Lord sayth, Ye shall know them by their fruits. Besides, what impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and impiety hath broken out from sundry aëry and ambitious spirits, who have dared in their late published bookes upon bookes, to belch out their blasphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and the power, purity, and profession of the Religion established amongst us for so many yeares. Nor only is the floodgate of all profanenesse and impiety bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, in the violation of the 4. commandement, but of the 5. also, when as, by occasion of the publishing of the sayd booke (which inhibits Magistrates and superiours, to restraine or punish youth for taking such liberty on the Lords day, as the booke alloweth, and which all other books, writings, monuments of Fathers, Councells, Kings, Emperours, Divines ancient and moderne, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants and Papists, have universally with one vote and voyce cryed downe, till now but yesterday a new genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Maleferiati hath risen up, out daring and defining the whole world, and God himselfe) inferiour persons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themselves in high contempt against their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, as the common vulgar against the Magistrate and Minister, servants against their Masters, children against their Parents, and wanton wives against their husbands, which hath caused such outcryes and complaints of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, for their servants unbridled and uncontrowled out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage on the Lords day; which must also in-jure them with pride and presumption of spirit the whole weeke after, and so their whole life, while like untamed colts they have thus learned to take the bitt betweene their teeth, and so to runne a gallop into all excesse of riot.


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15706:23"/>
So as if the booke be not all the sooner called in, and the authors of those late books against the sanctification of the Lords day condignly punished; and a speedy refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hereofset on foot: how can we looke for a stay of the plague untill the Land be consumed? Now the Lord make us wise, to lay these things to heart, least he teare in peeces, and there be none to deliver. For as never any Christian Church hath produced such monstrous impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: so never any Church hath bene the theater of such tragicall examples of divine wrath, as our Land is like to be, if we speedily repent not. Vnlesse therefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, we shall all likewise perish, as these examples have done before us.</p>
            <p>Now for these so many, so markable examples of Gods judgements inflicted upon the violaters and profaners of the Lords day, and that in so short a time, even since the booke for such sports was published, we may thus argue and conclude.</p>
            <p>That, for which the Lord inflicteth and executed so many notorious and severe judgements, must needs be a notorious and hainous sin, and so a breach of his holy commandement.</p>
            <p>But for the violation and profanation of the Lords day by sports and pastimes, or by servile works, the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth and executeth many notorious and severe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as of late we have seene. Erg. the violation &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of the Lords day is a notorious and heinous sin, and so a breach of Gods holy commandement.</p>
            <p>The Major Proposition is a Maxime in Divinity. God punisheth no man, but for sin: and sin is a transgression of Gods law: 1. Ioh. 3. 4. For the Minor proposition, it is so cleare, as it cannot be denied, except men will be sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15706:23"/>
and blind Atheists But they that feare God, shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the worke of God, for they shall wisely consider of his doing; as Ps. 64. 9. Now if the violation or profanation of the Lords day be a sin, and so a transgression of Gods holy commandement: then of what holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, but of the 4. And if of the 4. then the holy keeping of the Lords day for the Christian Sabbath, is grounded upon the 4. commandement, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in it, as God hath abundantly testified by his many remarkable judgments, even within this two yeares, as hath bene shewed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But here some may object: God may punish men for the breach of humaine ordinances, which are not the expresse commandements of God. So in this instance, God may punish the violation or profanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lords day by such sportes, or wakes, as being a breach of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ordinance, or Ecclesiasticall institution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I answere it is true, all humaine ordinances, being not against Gods word, are to be observed for conscience sake of Gods commandement, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding subjection to all ordinances of men for the Lords sake.</p>
            <p>And if it were a humaine ordinance, to dedicate this day of holy rest to God by a perpetuall vow and Decree: then the greater is their sin, that devoure that which is sanctified, and after the vow make inquiry, how it may be violated. So as they ly under the wrath of God, for so doing, and are lyable to the like judgements, without repentance.</p>

presume on this holy and venerable day to use these and the likesports, dauncings and leapings hereafter, because while they doe these things, they both darken the glory of Christianity, and give occasion to the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Christs name the more to dishonour him.</p>
            <p>We require also, and earnestly intreat, that in the observation of the Lords day, as we have a longe time beseeched you, you use due care that unlesse great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity constraine you, free your selves on that day, as much as may be from worldly cares and sollicitousnesse. And that which becometh the honour of so great a day, that both you your selves doe it, and by your example doe teach and compell yours to doe it.</p>
            <p>We wholsomly admonish all faithfull people, that they give due honour and reverence to the Lords day, because the dishonour of this day doth both much swarue and abhorre from Christian religion, and doth without doubt procure the perill of soules to the violaters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; <hi>And with that of the</hi> Councell of Burges, <hi>an. 1582. apud Bachellum Decreta Ecclesiae Gall. l. 4.

dayes are not only spent in transacting, unlawfull and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular businesse, but likewise in luxury, lasciviousnesse, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited sports and pastimes Revells, and the exercising of other wickednesses, whereupon it is not to be doubted, that for the greatest part, so many calamities wherewith we are so long since consumed are justly inflicted on us by God, who is incensed against us by so great wickednes. To appease whose present anger and likewise to avert his greater indignation hanging over our heads: we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all Parish Priests of our Province, that they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and seriously admonish the people, that on Lords dayes they not only keepe themselves from all prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited works, but likewise that they be <hi>ex animo</hi> cordially and religiously, present at all sacred misteries of the Church, and at the preaching of Gods word, and that they pretermit not the works of piety in releiving the poore, comforting the afflicted, and in doing other pious things, wherein Christian profession and charity do most of all shine forth. And we exhort all Magistrates accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their and our duety, as farre as possibly we may, that they would take care, that those holy and solemne dayes should be holily and piously celebrated, this being principally in their power, and belonging to their charge.
