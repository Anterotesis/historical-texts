            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(as no doubt it was and is in yours) But you are not to be <hi>blamed,</hi> by any unſeaſonable <hi>ſeveritie,</hi> if, as to point of execution, you firſt applied your ſelves, in the preſent diſtreſs of our times and affaires, to <hi>ſettle</hi> and <hi>ſecure</hi> as to the <hi>main,</hi> thoſe things which belonged to your civil rights, and National peace. The <hi>exigents</hi> or <hi>extreamities</hi> of which, not bearing any delayes, do ſufficiently juſtifie your indeavors, to <hi>preſerve</hi> the ſhip of the State, in which the <hi>Church is imbarqued,</hi> which being almoſt Ship-wrackt and ſincking, it had been a very <hi>prepoſterous zeal,</hi> to have left the veſſel to have <hi>contended</hi> with the <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Sands,</hi> by a <hi>ſuperdevout diligence to ſave</hi> the <hi>lading,</hi> or goods in it; Alas we had been much to ſeek for a reformed Church, in a ruined State.</p>
            <p>Your diſcreet and orderly diligence <hi>took</hi> the right <hi>method,</hi> in making way for religion, by civil <hi>juſtice;</hi> nor need you fear the dictates, frownes and cenſures of any <hi>Anaſtarchuſſes,</hi> whoſe piety like <hi>Jacobs</hi> might hope to have ſupplanted this juſt neceſſary and honeſt policy, of reſtoring our civil laws, and royal authority, by which our Religion, as Criſtian and reformed, was beſt <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</hi>

            <p>§.

contented with and kept in the compaſs of that one <hi>ſhort Creed,</hi> which we call the Apoſtles, and which was yet once ſhorter than now it is.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But, commonly <hi>brevity</hi> is attended with <hi>obſcurity; Brevis eſſe laboro, obſcurus fio</hi>; ſhort and conciſe expreſſions many times wrap things up, as it were, in clouds; whereas Laws ought to be <hi>meridiana lumina, tanquam ſolis radiis ſcriptae,</hi> ſo clear, as none need complain; ſo <hi>legible</hi> that he that <hi>runs may read them</hi>; and ſo indeed are theſe divine demonſtrations in the Text, where the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God reconcileth <hi>brevity</hi> and <hi>perſpicuity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Trajans</hi> uniting <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> by an happy temper of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Empire, which neither diminiſhed his own juſt Prerogative, as <hi>a Prince,</hi> nor oppreſſed the peoples legal immunities as <hi>his Subjects</hi>) ſo the Lord, deſigning theſe Laws for all ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, fits them for all capacities in ſuch a way, that the very <hi>babes</hi> and <hi>ſimple ones</hi> may learn, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and do them; <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>§.

only a <hi>mercy</hi> juſtly due to <hi>mankind,</hi> but an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>ſervice to God</hi>; He were a very <hi>prepoſterous Zealot</hi> and <hi>ridiculous Divine,</hi> who in the exigents of <hi>pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritick</hi> pains, and preſent <hi>faintings</hi> of ſpirits, would impoſe upon heart-ſick Patients his <hi>long prayers,</hi> or tediouſly obtrude <hi>godly diſcourſes,</hi> and other <hi>ghoſtly counſels,</hi> rather than give way to the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians</hi> or <hi>Chyrurgeons</hi> skill and <hi>applications,</hi> for blood-letting or cordials; this were to act the part not of a pious and <hi>prudent Confeſſor,</hi> but of a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout</hi> and imprudent <hi>Executioner.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>§. After the like method is that of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> which tells us, that the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>teacheth us firſt to live righteouſly,</hi> next <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,</hi> and then <hi>godlily</hi> in this preſent world; the firſt and pregnanteſt inſtances of <hi>pure Religion and undefiled</hi> are firſt to man and then to God; not but that the <hi>root of piety,</hi> and our Cloſet-religion to God is before the <hi>fruits of Iuſtice and Mercy,</hi> but thoſe are more <hi>hidden,</hi> and theſe moſt <hi>manifeſted,</hi> ſo as men may <hi>ſee our good works, and glorifie our heavenly Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Nor is the <hi>juncture</hi> of theſe three <hi>inob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,</hi> becauſe indeed they are inſeparable where they are <hi>ſincere</hi>; This is (<hi>ſancta &amp; individua trias</hi>) an holy and <hi>undivided Trinity</hi>; where one is, all will be; the root of <hi>Humility,</hi> the leaf of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and the fruit of <hi>Iuſtice</hi>; if men be <hi>proud</hi> they will be cruel and covetous, void of Mercy and Juſtice too. So if they be <hi>unjuſt</hi> and uncharitable, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them to be without <hi>humility</hi>; for theſe <hi>three</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49943:17"/>
are as <hi>one,</hi> which united bear witneſs to <hi>God,</hi> our own Conſcience and others: Proud men are prone to envy others, to over-value themſelves, and to uſe ſuch unjuſt means as may gratifie their inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate appetites, ſuitable to their high opinions of themſelves; proud, and ſo unjuſt thoughts betray men to unjuſt actions.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, We may obſerve the (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. Without <hi>Iuſtice</hi> there can be no good in the greateſt plenty, which either expoſeth to injury, or proſpers by rapine and violence.</p>

            <p n="3">3.

to what they ſow, either <hi>formal</hi> or hypocritical, or <hi>incompleat</hi> and <hi>partial</hi>; while their luſts and paſſions either tranſport them beyond, or keep them ſhort of that true and pure fountain of living waters, which while they forſake, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>broken ciſterns,</hi> and unfaithful pits, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to ſuffer evil at laſt, becauſe they do not follow that good which God hath ſet ſo free and full before them; <hi>Et ideo miſeri quia mali</hi>; they are not miſerable for Gods defects, as if he had <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed</hi> them to be ſo, or <hi>denied</hi> them, the way of being, doing and enjoying good; but becauſe they do or eaſily may <hi>know the way,</hi> and works, and rewards that are good, but will not; <hi>Maxima pars humanae impotentiae fluit exvoluntate</hi>; the moſt if not all of our immoral and ſinful infirmities, flow from our want of will rather than of skill. God is not wanting to teach us the good we ſhould chuſe and do; but we are wanting to chuſe and do the good he evidently teacheth us; we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Gods not <hi>convincing us,</hi> but God <hi>complains</hi> juſtly of our not <hi>complying</hi> with, and <hi>converting</hi> to his conviction.</p>

               <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note>If you will (indeed) <hi>do Juſtice, love Mercy, and walk humbly with your God</hi>; if you will ſhew <hi>loving kindneſs</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>honor</hi> to your <hi>Country,</hi> reſolve upon all thoſe <hi>diſpenſations, reſtitutions,</hi> and <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations</hi> of Juſtice and Mercy, which are before you: Which you will beſt do if you</p>

            <p n="3">3. If you liſten not to that wicked maxim of the Devils politicks, <hi>Fieri non debuit, factum valet,</hi> as if evil actions did call for perſeverance not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>Nullum tempus</hi> occurit <hi>Juſtitiae,</hi> no time or fact muſt preſcribe againſt juſtice, truth, God and the Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When you have undone by juſtice what hath been done by injuſtice, to the undoing of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> Prince and People; Then will mercy be ſeaſonable, by acts of ſuch <hi>amneſty, pardon,</hi> and <hi>oblivion,</hi> as may rather compoſe than irritate the ſpirits of men; <hi>praeſtat motos componere fluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. If you needed (which I hope you do not) any motives to theſe great indeavours and diſcoveries of juſtice and mercy, it is no ſmall one which the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> obſerve, as to the difference between juſt

and unjuſt, the good and evil men, which is as great as between light and darkneſs, order and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, men and beaſts, good and bad Angels, as between a King and a Tyrant, God and the Devil. God is the firſt <hi>fountain</hi> and grand <hi>example</hi> of juſtice and mercy, as the Devil is of injuriouſneſs and cruelty.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If you inquire <hi>Cui bono?</hi> what their reward ſhall be? Firſt the conſcience of well doing, and this to your Country and in its greateſt <hi>diſtreſſes</hi>; Next, you ſhall have that reward of <hi>laſting honour,</hi> and <hi>renown,</hi> by which your names, as repairers of our breaches, ſhall be <hi>embalmed</hi> in the love of their Country, and <hi>tranſmitted</hi> with a ſweet <hi>reſentment</hi> to all poſterity; where as the names of proud and cruel <hi>oppreſſors,</hi> ſhall rot and periſh like their <hi>own dung</hi>; the blood thirſty and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their dayes; not only, as to thoſe <hi>dies naturales</hi>; but as to thoſe <hi>dies civiles,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the living fame of worthy men to many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations as bleſſed; he is but ſhort-lived whoſe <hi>infamy</hi> only ſurvives; as the <hi>damned</hi> in hell, are counted <hi>dead,</hi> becauſe they only live to ſhame and <hi>torment.</hi>

            <p>§.

            <p>§. There can no better courſe be followed in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil juſtice, than that which was given by the <hi>Oracle</hi> to the <hi>Sicilian Pyrates,</hi> when afflicted by the plague, after they had gotten much booty, they enquired What they ſhould do to be releived?

            <p>§. There is neither darkneſs in your way of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and mercy, nor will there be much <hi>difficulty.</hi> God hath and will remove mountains of malice, hypocriſie and injuſtice before you, yea he hath prepared the vvay for you by levelling the leve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and confounding the confounders of all things civil and ſacred. His vvord and the lavvs of the Land vvill tell you vvhat is to be done, <hi>State ſuper vias autiquas &amp; bonas,</hi> ſtand <hi>and enquire for the good
