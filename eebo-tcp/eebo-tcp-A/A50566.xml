            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF the meaſure of my ſufferings under the creuel hands of unreaſonable men, be finiſhed in this noyſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the laying down of my life, (in obedience to the Lord that hath called me out of the way of ſinners) by reaſon of my tedious, unwholſome, and cruel ſufferings this 12. months in this little filthy hole, which if at large were declared it might appear to be much, that my life, (and others) hath been preſerved to this day, but if not much longer; this I declare for truths ſake, &amp; deſire to have laid before the eies of the chief Rulers of this Nation, that none hereafter may ſay, that lb ought theſe cruel ſufferings upon my ſelf, or that by negligence or wilfulneſs I was the occaſion of my own death as it was ſaid of <hi>Iames Parnel</hi>; for I was travelling towards <hi>London</hi> with goods upon lawful occaſions, and forth of an Inn about the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. hower of the night, was I taken with a Warrant, and no man charged any thing againſt me but <hi>Iohn Bunkly</hi> in his <hi>Mittimus</hi> falſely writ ſeveral miſdemeanors, but never proved in the leaſt: and at an Aſſiſes after, by Judge <hi>Windham</hi> was I committed to the houſe of Correction, until I engage to go home, whoſe buſineſs then lay from home at <hi>London.</hi> And a free man born in the Nation I am, and alſo for my liberty in it from ſuch cruel tyranny, have ſerved 8. years in the late war at Sea, who ſometime was a Captain of a Friggot at Sea; and ſince I was a Priſoner thus unjuſtly here, I have with the reſt of my dear brethren with me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in Print, in a book tituled, <hi>The fruits of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> brought forth by <hi>Ioh. Bunkly,</hi> who unjuſtly committed 3. of us into priſon, when he was in a paſſion as he confeſt: that we are ready to ſubmit to all the lawes of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either actively or paſſively, &amp; deſire to know by what law I am kept here, and have not been wanting to uſe any means lawful in the ſight of God, for my liberty out of this ſtinking place, but nothing hath prevailed upon the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hearts of the ſons of men; who though they keep us in cloſe priſon, to have us engage to go home, or out of the County, yet <hi>Wil. Bayly</hi> born in the county, (committed in one <hi>Mittimus</hi> with me &amp; alſo <hi>Hum. Smith</hi>) could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain liberty from Juſtice nor Jayler to go home, which is out of the County, when his Father dyed, &amp; one of his own three ſmall motherleſs children not well.</p>
            <p>Therefore let all people that fear the Lord, take notice how unmercifuly they deal with him &amp; the reſt, &amp; with me, who have been ſick many dayes (or weeks) &amp; am now waxed very weak by reaſon of the cruel ſufferings my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath here endured, and my ſoul (with the reſt of my dear friends) grieved by moſt barbarous wicked common drunken ſwearing priſoners, &amp; our bodies dayly abuſed by them, and condemned perſons, and beaten, and like to be murthered by ſuch as one of them ſaid he was for the King ſo long as he lived, &amp; termed the States ſervice at Sea pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie under whoſe cruel hands it is moſt unreaſonable we ſhould be kept: &amp; a moſt filthy beaſtly woman Jayler ſetting them on, and hath alſo lockt a rude bawling madman into the hoal where we are, on purpoſe to do me what miſchief ſhe could, which man ſoon devoured what I had to nouriſh my body when I was ſick and weak; and frinds were lockt up alſo that they could not get more <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or me; and the noyſe of the madman did me much more hurt, then the want of water or nouriſhment; for my body which now lyeth in a filthy hoal, in a weak condition upon the ground with ſtraw, where they were uſed to put condemned perſons, and where we have long wanted room to lie one by another, being a hoal more fit for ſwine, where the ſpewing and piſs of the drunken priſoners that lie above us, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly come down where we lie, and on our faces in the night, and on our food as we were eating: and moſt noyſome ſtinks and filthy ſcents have I ſuffered, by being ſhut up in it cloſe priſoner ten months, having no place for ayre, but in a ſmoaky filthy cloſe place, where for four months I cannot ſee the ſun, which place is as a dunghil, or common place of filth for all the priſon, and much more the like, or worſe may be writ of it.</p>
            <p>Out of which bonds and inhumane ſufferings, I do claim my right and freedome in the nation, which I &amp; the reſt of my dear ſuffering friends have ſo dearly purchaſed, and alſo paid tribute, ſeſements and taxes, &amp; yet of law &amp; liberty we are deprived; having not in the leaſt ſpake or done any thing worthy of death or of bonds, if I had, leſs then 12. months impriſonment ſatisfieth the law in many things, though nothing but blood, nor that neither will ſatisfie the cruel wills of men, under whoſe tyranny upon the Lord I wait to be releaſt, with the reſt of my brethren ſeven in number, who innocently do ſuffer, but if not, my life I give up into the will of him whoſe it is that redeems the ſoul out of bondage, &amp; let them by whom I thus ſuffer &amp; them who may releaſe me, &amp; the reſt, and will not, take heed of innocent blood.</p>
