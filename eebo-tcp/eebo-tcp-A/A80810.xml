            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S God hath made You Inſtruments of Glorious things, in being the Reſtorers of many Diſtreſſed, and the Repairers of the great Breaches of this Nation; So it is hoped and prayed by Your Petitioner, that yet before You riſe, You will give Relief to Your Petitioner, whoſe hard and moſt deplorable Caſe, is ſcarce to be parrall'd in this Nation; Who before the late Long Parliament was Owner of a great Fortune, and in a thriving Condition, as any man in that time of his Quality: Who only for being a Farmer of the Cuſtomes, but for Two Years, and for his Loyalty in adhering to His late Majeſty, of ever bleſſed Memory, as he was bound by Law, and his Oath of Allegiance, was not only ſpoyled and plundered of all he had, even the very Bed his Wife lay on: But which is the higheſt of Afflictions, He is now a Priſoner for above 200000. <hi>l.</hi> of the Late KINGS Debts, for mony lent and advanced for the furniſhing of his Navy, and Bread for his Houſhold at <hi>Whitehall;</hi> which Debt ſtands reported before you, to be 253200 <hi>l.</hi> paid in mony to the <hi>Exchequer:</hi> For the diſcharging whereof, and freeing the Farmers, the Long Parliament took of them 165000. <hi>l.</hi> (which diſcharged their Two Armies, aſſuring them to free them of the Debt of 253200 <hi>l.</hi> Both which Sums amount to 418200. <hi>l.</hi> which with the Intereſt, ſwelleth the Sum to about a Milleon, the Farmers Petition only being to this Honourable Houſe) to ſtate the Payment of the 253200 <hi>l.</hi> upon the remaining forraign Exciſe, Taxe, or any other way, that they may be delivered out of priſon, and be juſt to their Creditors; which though lengthned in the time for payment, will be very comfortable to thoſe that have lain languiſhing, now, neer Twenty years priſoners: Which if it prevaileth not with this Honourable Houſe, for the Farmers in general, He humbly hopeth and prayeth, in that his Caſe differeth from all the reſt of his Partners the Farmers, who beſides this being involved with them in that great Debt, was deprived by a Seizure of his Stock, Trade, and Caſtle of <hi>Guinny,</hi> which coſt him in the Diſcovering and Setling of it, above 50000 <hi>l.</hi> clear out of purſe, which he may plead as a merit from his Nation, being the firſt Diſcover and Setler of that Trade; from whence he imported half a Milleon of Gold, before it was taken from him, by the late Parliament, which Caſtle is now poſſeſſed by the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, who from thence yearly have the Gold they mannage the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Trade with, and will yearly yeild to the Nation for ever 50 or 60 Thouſand pound a year: To which his merit, your Petitioner may add (by his induſtry) the erecting of Allome-works, Copperiſe-works, bringing the Invention of <hi>Pan-tyles,</hi> Growing and Making <hi>Madther</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in which above a thouſand perſons are every day imployed and fed; Your petitioner and his Wife having ſold their Land and Houſes, by which they have freed and diſcharged themſelves of above 100000 <hi>l.</hi> of thoſe Farm Debts, (more then his Partners) that he might quit himſelf from being a priſoner, to purſue thoſe things which may provide for his numerous Family (now in great diſtreſſe) and employ his remaining time in his Service of his Countrey, and not dye in priſon.</p>
            <p rend="indent italic">His Humble Prayer to this Honourable Houſe is, (the Premiſſes being conſidered) there being due to Your Petitioner for what he hath payed out of his own eſtate, toward this great Debt, about 30000 l. That, you will be pleaſed out of ſomewhat, to order the Payment of 20000. to Your Petitioner, with which he ſhall be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge himſelf from the Remain of theſe great Debts, and free himſelf out of Priſon, which will render him not only, after the long miſery of his Family, to be a comfort to them, but give him a capacity to ſerve his Country, in his great undertakings, and will be a Badge upon him of this Honourable Houſes good affection towards him, for his Signal Loyalty, Doings and Sufferings, and in not letting him to ſuffer for it, under the marks of greateſt diſhonour, as to dye a Priſoner, and not pay his Engagements; which will be a greater affliction unto him, then the higheſt torture of the eminenteſt Rebells, Diſhonour being the greateſt wound that a man can ſuffer in this World; which falleth upon him only for his Loyalty: All which he hopeth will prevail with this Honourable Houſe, that before Your Riſing, ſome or all of you, to whom this Petition cometh, ſhall obtain it to be read, and doe ſomething for the releiving of the Farmers in general, or Your Petitioner in particular; That he may rejoyce, and not break his Heart, which certainly will be his portion, if you do nothing for him, for then his Creditors, being hopeleſſe, will be more violent then ever. Your Petitioner being yet confident that he ſhall be in the number of thoſe who ſhall ever commemorate the great Deliverance received from Your Hands,</p>
            <closer>Shall ever pray for Your Proſperity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
