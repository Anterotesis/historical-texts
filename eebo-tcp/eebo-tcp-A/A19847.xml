            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that Iason had geuen them than<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes,

and appoynted vnto the place si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified
and assigned vnto them by
Iasons letters, that is to wyt, wher
the shippe was, called Argo. Pelias
with all diligence caused the nauye
to be furnyshed with all thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and exhorted Iason and his

the thynge whiche was begonne, &amp;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11159:9"/>
so doynge that not they onelye, but al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so
all Grece shoulde obtayne greate
honour and glory. But to declare by

I thinke it not mete nor to anye

curyouse to knowe these thynges,
reade suche authors, as haue special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

then ariuinge &amp; comynge into Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,
came and broughte his shyppes
vnto the hauen of the riuer Simois,
and there all his souldiers landed.</p>
            <p>But when kynge Laomedon was
aduertised therof, he was greatelye
moued, as well for the greate number
of shyppes, whiche were aryued and
rested there, as for the multitude of

commynge thether: consydering also
to be very daungerous vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple

<pb facs="tcp:11159:10"/>
accustomed them selues so to aryue &amp;
to campe in his dominions and coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>treys.
Therfore Laomedon admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
them by Ambassadoures to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre
and departe out of his countrey,
or els that he was mynded rughelye
&amp; rudely to repulse them. The which
thinge was very straunge to Iason
and his companye, and not easelye to
be suffred, so vngentlye to be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of hym, whome they neuer offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Neuerthelesse, they fearing that
through the ire and anger of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng,
they might be destroyed and spoyled
by the multitude of the barbarous
people, if contrarye to the will and
commaundement of Laomedon, they
shulde make resistaunce, seinge they
had no preparation to warre, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

came to Colchos, where they incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent

returned vnto theyr owne countrey.
A while after Hercules hauynge in

In the meane season Hercules co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Assone as Priamus was come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne

take shyppyng, and wandered
so longe vppon the sea, that he came
vnto a place in Grece named Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia:
where Pelius receaued him, and
feasted for the space of thre dayes. At
the fourth daye he requyred hym to
declare the cause of his legation: the
whiche aunswered that it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to admonishe the Grekes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
Hesiona. Peleus vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
that, and that the matter some

            <p>Furthermore Antenor the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dor

Fyrst of al he admonished his

because that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grecians shuld

that in Europe were verye stronge

            <p>Whose counsell was greatly alowed

Priamus sent Deiphobus and Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander

to gather together men, mete for the

that the inferiors shulde be obedient

that Antenor was ignominiouslye

greuous and great iniuries commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto the Troianes. He also com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded
Antenor to shewe his
minde, whiche encouraged the Troi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>anes
to make warre vpon the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
shewynge them in few wordes

brought a woman oute of

misfortune of the Troianes:
and that it were muche more honest
and better to lyue in tranquillitye,
then thoroughe warres, and other
troubles to lese theyr auncient liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and so lyghtelye to put them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues

            <p>The people dispraysed the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell

And after that Priamus had

that in suche sorte, that nothynge
shoulde be lackynge, they all with

And in the meane season, he sent
Hector into the hye partes of Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia

now vnderstanding and perceauing

            <p>

that throughe that stroke he

and assone as it was possi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble

whiche excuse was taken of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

theyr settynge forwarde to Troye,

whether they shoulde geue the

He aunswered, that he founde

geue the assaulte by night, but in
the middes of the dai, as he thought
it most expedient, wherevnto they
all consented and agreed, and choyse
Agamemnon captaine of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> army.
The whiche sent forthwith Hesio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Demora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; Anius into Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia
&amp; other places for sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of vitelles &amp; other munitions:
whiche donne he called for his men
of warre, and praysed, admonished,
and exhorted them to be dilgente,
faythfull, and to their superiours
obedient. And after the signe was
geued, they sayled, and finally came
<pb facs="tcp:11159:32"/>
with all their shippes vnto Troye.
The Troyanes beynge aduertised
thereof, defended theyr borders and
limites ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fully. Protesilaus made
excurtions and rodes by lande, beate
downe and chased al before him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll
that Hector mete him, whome
he slewe, chased the other, and put
them out of order. But where Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
was not, there, the Troyanes
were chased &amp; ouerthrowen. And
after great occision and murther on
all partes, at lengthe commeth to
the felde Achilles, constraynynge
the Troyanes to fle, and chased the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
into Troye. And so long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the skyrmysh, that the nyght se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
the battel. Agamemnon set
the rest of hys hooste vpon the land
and campt all his men together.</p>
            <p>Hector the nexte daye folowynge
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11159:32"/>
broughte his men out of the citye,
and afterwardes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, and set them
al in good order. Agamemnon on
the other side, wente with a greate
brute to mete him, wherof ensued
a verye sharpe and furius battell,
wherin was none so valiant nor so
strong, that fel not to the grounde.
Hector euen at the first slewe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troclus,
spoylde and cast him out of
the army. Furthermore he pursued
Merion, the which he slew in like
maner. And as he was occupied &amp;
busy about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spoyle, Mnesteus ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
him a strock w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his swerd in the
thighe. But notwithstandynge he
was so wounded, he ceased not to
laye on and strike vntyl he had smit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten
downe a greate numbre of hys
enemies, &amp; manfully pursuyng the

<pb facs="tcp:11159:33"/>
If Aiax Thelamonius had not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlye
come thither, with whome
Hector incountrynge knewe that
he was of his bloude, that is sonne
of Hesiona his father Priamus si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
Therefore at hys request he
caused the fier to cease and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
from the Grecians shippes
and all his armie to retire. After
that the one had gratified the other
with gyftes, they departed good
frendes. The nexte daye folowyng
the Grekes obtayned a truce. Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon
to the honor of Protesila<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>us
made noble funeralles, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
al other to be buryed. Achilles
mourned, and celebrated funerall
playes for his frende Patroclus.</p>
            <p>Whilest the truce continued, Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes
continually moued sedition,
sayinge that Agamemnon was vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>worthie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11159:33"/>
to be principal of the army
and therfore in the presence of al the
men of warre he shewed him selfe,
and his willyng studye &amp; diligence
to the thinges pertayning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> war
he returned out of the campe to set
an order in the munitions, &amp; in the
disposition of the watche, to know
and vnderstand the vsual signes of
warre, to see equitie of measures &amp;
waightes, &amp; to be shorte, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of al the whole campe.</p>
            <p>After this dede he sayd that it was
not reasonable, that Agamemnon
which was chosen of a smal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
of men to this dignitie, shoulde
commaunde, and be superior of all
those, the whiche were to come to
the warre, consideryng that all inferiours
and subiectes do looke and
hope for some vertue in their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes
<pb facs="tcp:11159:34"/>
In the meane season that the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
quarelled and discorded thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
them selues for the superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and that two yeares were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
the warre was renued and
set vp agayne. Wherein of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianes
part were chiefe doers Aga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>memnon,
Achilles and Deome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
and Menclaus.</p>
            <p>Of the other parte: Hector,
Troylus, and Eneas. And when
they recountred and mette one
with another, ther was great mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,
and the moste valiantes of both
partes were slayne.</p>
            <p>Hector amonge all the other slew
Boetes, Archilocus, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.
But yet the nyght departed
the battell.</p>
            <p>Then after that Agamemnon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11159:34"/>
hadde called hys Captaynes to

            <p>The nexte daye folowynge in
the mornynge, the Armye of
the Troyannes was leadde and
guydyd by Hector, Eneas, and
Alexander.</p>
            <p>Agaynste whome the force and
the wholle Nobilite of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianes

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11159:35"/>There Meuelaus &amp; Aiax instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

But Hector perceyuyng hys bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this daunger came accompa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nied

whome Eneas brought out of the
myddes of the armye into the city,
but the nyght ended the battell.</p>
            <p>The next day folowyng, Achilles
and Diomedes guyded the armye:
and of the other side Hector and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,
There was great murder.</p>
            <p>Hector kylled Orchomemes, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,
Palamon, Epistrophus,
Schedius, Delpenor, Dorius, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:11159:35"/>
Polixemus al captaynes. Eneas
slew Amphimacus, and Nerius.
Achilles on the contrary part slew
Euphenius, Hipocrates, and Asce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.
Diomedes, zantippus and
Mestes. Agamemnon consideryng
that his moste strongest and moste
valiaunt men were slayne, retired,
wherof the Troyanes beynge ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
ioyfull, returned to ther campe.
Agamemnon helde a counsel, styrde
vp hys captaynes, and other to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne
and manlye to fyght for that
that was to come, and by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to leaue of: and in asmuche as
a great parte of his armye was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
distroyed, he trusted daye by
daye that a freshe company of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
shoulde come from Misya to
ayde aud succour them. The nexte
day folowing, he constrained at his

so rudely on the one part and on the
other, that there fell manye thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes,
bothe Greekes and Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes.
And thus they continued
manfully fightynge for the space of
foure score dayes. Agamemnon per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiuing
that his men decayed more

that he was so greatlye letted that

meete hym face to face, thynkynge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful
wel that if he ouercame him not
that he woulde destroye, and beate
many of hys men: but in the meane
season the battell was verye soore.
Hector in this conflicte and battell
slewe Polibetes a verye excellent
captayne, and as he enforsed hym
selfe to spoyle hym, Achilles came,
so that the fighte was augmented,
and a great brute moued thorowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the campe and citie, whome
Hector finallye wounded in the
thighe. Therefore Achilles moore
cherelye pursued hym, and lefte not
of his enterprise, vntyl he had smit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten
hym to deathe, put al the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes
to flyghte &amp; chased them with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:11159:39"/>
the Dente of the swearde vnto
their towne gates, whome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
resisted manfullye, foughte
with hym vntyll the nyghte sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
theym bothe soore wounded.
And amonge all other Achilles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
wounded departed frome the
armye. All that nyght the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes
cessed not to lament the deathe
and the absence of valiaunt Hector.</p>
            <p>The nexte daye folowynge the
Troyanes entred agayne into bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
vnder the conducte of Memon.
Agamemnon counsayled and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
hys men to require a truce
for two mouthes, that men myghte
burye theym whiche were slayne
in battell. Therfore they sent vnto
Priamus, of whome they es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lye
obtayned theyr demaunde.</p>
            <p>Then caused Priamus his son
<pb facs="tcp:11159:40"/>
Hector to be buryed before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates
Troye, and magnificent pompes
and funerall playes to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Whyle the tyme of the foresay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
truce endured, Palamedes ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to complayne of the impire
and principallitie of Agamemnon.</p>
            <p>Therefore Agamemnon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anye contradiction there vnto,
sayde that he woulde remitte the
matter to the descretion and wyll
of the people. The nexte daye
folowing, he assembled all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
where he purged hym selfe,
and shewed that he neuer coueted
suche aucthoritye, consideryng that
he was kynge and lorde of Myce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
the whiche sufficed hym: but
alonely the vtter destruction of
Troy, &amp; that he woulde be well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable
to all that the people wolde
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11159:40"/>
define, and vnto hym that should be
set and appoynted vnto hys estate.</p>
            <p>Then in presence of theym all, he
demaunded of euerye man his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyse.
There Palamedes presented
hym selfe, willynge to cause men to
perceyue and vnderstande his good
spirite, iudgement and counsayl, in
the feates of warre. Of whiche oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
the Grekes appoynted him
their graunde captayne, whiche af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had geuen theym thankes, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gan
to exercyse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right of that, that
not longe before he had enterprised.</p>
            <p>Achilles neuer approued but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlye
blamed this alteration, yet
that notwithstandynge (the truce
beynge ended) Palamedes appoyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
his hoste in good order, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
them to fyght manfully.
Deiphobus on the other parte dyd
<pb facs="tcp:11159:41"/>
asmuche for the Troyanes, the
whiche at the sighte triumphed to
fighte, amonge whome Serpedon
with his men dyd so muche pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swed
the Greekes, that he kylde
and smote downe a great numbre.
In this fyghte Tlepolemus Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
met with hym, the whiche as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
in the battel as otherwise was
finallye ouercommed. Seconde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
in hys stede and place, Perses
the sonne of Adneste fortified and
renued the conflicte, the which lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
commynge to the battell was
slayne of Serpedon almoste hande
to hand. But yet Serpedon being
soore wounded was compelled to
withdraw him selfe from the filde.
Thus for a certayne dayes the skir
mished and foughte, and diuers
knyghtes on bothe partes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11159:41"/>
and slayne, but yet of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus
his bounde the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
The Troyanes ambassadours
obtayned a truce, and for the tyme
that it endured, they on bothe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
buryed the deade, prouyded to
heale theyr wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. And when on

            <p>When their shyppes were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,

his yeare mynde, whither there

he lyued for a tyme in all solicitude
and anguyshe, partly because Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon
was deposed from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier,
and that he was subiect to Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lamedes.
Then he sente a faythfull

               </gap>unte of hys a Troyane, vnto
Hecuba to demaunde Polixena to
be hys wyfe, and so doynge heard
hys Myrnidons woulde departe,
and by that meanes the reste of the
Greekes. The seruaunte beynge
nowe come to Hecuba, shewed the
content of his legation &amp; message.
Whereunto the foresayed Hecuba
answered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she was wel contente,
yf it so pleased Priamus her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande.
<pb facs="tcp:11159:43"/>
In the meane whyle that
she declared the matter to Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
and that by her commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the seruaunte was departed:
Agamemnon wente with a greate
companye vnto hys campe. Then
Priamus to that that Hecuba had
propounded vnto him, aunswered,
that it was a thinge impossible, not
because he estemed Achilles to be
insufficient, or otherwyse vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of hys aliaunce, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
(although he gaue him Polix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena,
&amp; that he &amp; his bond departed)
would neuer the soonerdeparte.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, that it were not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to ioyne and mary his dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter
to dys enemye, And therfore
he estemed good, yf Achilles wolde
ensue and folowe hys interpryse,
that they shoulde first and aboue al
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:11159:43"/>
thinges, make a perpetuall peace
betwene theym, and that the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
hooste shoulde returne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte,
so that their aliaunces and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grementes
mighte be well assured
and confirmed, and that thynge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
once ended, he woulde wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynglye
geue hym his doughter.</p>
            <p>Achilles euen as it was appointed
sent his seruaunt agayne vnto He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuba,
for to knowe the wyl and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
of Priamus, the whiche
beinge knowen, the seruaunte by
and by brought it vnto his maister.
Therfore Achilles beganne in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of theym all, greatly and by al
meanes to complayne hym, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it to be vnlawful, that for one
Helen all Europe and Grece shuld

shoulde be loste, the libertie of the
countrei to be brought vnto bonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
and caste vnder foote: therfore it
wer good and necessary for them to
make peace, and to go their wayes.
Thus thei consumed a whole yere.
After al this Palamedes repayred
and set vp his army. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part Deiphobus. Achilles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not therwith content, was not
at the skirmish. Palamedes moued
by a certaine occasion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> prepared
him selfe against Deiphobus, that
he slew him: the warre on the one
part &amp; on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other was sharply stird
vp &amp; foughten, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which manye a

that the more frely he might

the Troiane. And thinking
to glorifie &amp; to reioyce him selfe in
this dede, Alexander shot him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the bodie with an arrow. The
other Troyanes seing that, ceassed
not to cast dartes, as though Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes
had not bene dead, for whose
death the Grekes wer disconfited,
and wente backe vnto their campe,
and the Troyanes persuing them,
brake in, putte their campe oute of

aduertised of this, dissembled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
but Aiax Thelamonius vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
sustained y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thinge vntill the

The auncient Nestor al that night
called the captaynes to counsell for
to elect and choyse a head captayne

            <p>Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Agamemno was chosen

            <p>And agayne, the nexte daye fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowynge,
the Troyanes set theym

a truce for two monethes, caused
Palamedes and other Lordes of

            <p>Durynge the tyme of thys truce,
Agamemnon sente vnto Achilles,
Nestor, Ulixes and Diomedes,
prayinge and desyryng him to take

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11159:46"/>Achilles being heuy and sore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

            <p>Agamemnon perceiuing that, calde

Agamemnon hys brother to
warre, and that for one Achilles he
shuld not leaue of the interprise, she
wyng them that the strength of the
Troyans was greatly broken and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:11159:46"/>
demished throughe the absence of
Hector, consederynge that thei in al
their bandes hadde none lyke vnto
hym. Contrarye wyse Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
and Ulixes dyd stifelye affirme
that Troylus was euen as wyse,
and as valiaunt as euer was Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Agaynst whome Menelaus
resistynge, ceased not as before to
persuade the warre.</p>
            <p>And to this purpose Calchas
(taughte by the oracle) perswaded
the warre, and in the same he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed
the Greekes to be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
The tyme of truce being expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Greekes went to the filde,
vnder the conduct of Agamemnon,
Mekelans, Diomedes and Aiax,
where thei fought very strongelye
to the great occision of the one part
and of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11159:47"/>Troylus wounded Menelaus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
greuouslye, and slewe manye,
the other he chased at the poynte of

the Greekes foughte strongelye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste
the Troyanes, prepared to
fight by Troylus and Alexander,
Troylus hurte Diomedes, and did
asmuche pursuynge Agamemnon,
and afterwardes manye other.</p>
            <p>Thus thei continued sharply figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
for certayne dayes, and a great
numbre of men were smitten down
on euerye parte. Agamemnon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderynge
that daye by daye he loste
a great number of his men, &amp; that he
could no longer bere such losses, de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:11159:47"/>
all the assembles, some with all
their power withstode it, because
of the longe truce whiche they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannded:
but rather they required
to sacke the Grecianes, to pille and
to spoyle theym of all their goodes,
and to sette their shyppes a fyre.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstandynge after that
euerye man had sayde hys mynde,
the truce by the consente of theym
all, was graunted. Durynge the

Diomedes and Menelaus the
whiche were hurte, to be moste di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlye
intreated, and asmuch did
the Troyanes on their part.</p>
            <p>Thys done, Agamemnon (the

that in this cace with honesty

The time of the war comming on,

Achilles first sent his Myrmidons

But when Achilles vnderstod

to be done, aswell for their goodes,
as for them selues. The counsel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge

euerye man to saye his minde.
Unto whom Antenor shewed that
the most valiauntest princes &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
of the Troyanes common
weale and libertie, the kinges chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and like wise the princes and

better to restore Helen, and all that
Alexander and his had taken &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

sufficiently spoken of this purpose

Priamus sonne stode vp, and
accused the dedes and the sayinges
of these, whiche fauoured the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel

that thei shoulde rather take vppon

he w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der had rauished Helen,

he trusted not onelye to defende his

Let Paris come now into the

was denied him? Or yf he
know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue endured his long
tariynge wyth anye heuynesse or
tediousnes? Hath he not cotinually
receyued were it muche or lyttle
the thynge that pleased hym?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11159:69"/>Hath he by any meanes soner kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
then reprehended our auarice

he perceyued that anye man hathe
done hym wronge? If he accuse vs
of anye of these foresayde thynges,
let him shewe it, and I shall frelye
confesse that he receyued not the
thousande part of that, that he hath
deserued. But for asmuche as in
thys matter he can say nothyng, so
lyke wyse it behoueth no man to
speake of it. But so it is that the
faythful opinion which we concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of hym, was the cause, that we
suffered hym to dwell amonge vs
with great assuraunce and liberty,
and without any suspicion no more
then of a familier frende, the which
thynge maye accustomably chaunce
to all men: and al those thynges the

               </gap>h intierly
turned vp syde dow<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
euell for good, maleuolence
for hospitalite, rapine for lodgyng,
iniurye for honour, for good say the
he hath rememberd al crueltie. He
had no feare of the goddes, nor no
reuerence to his benefactors, nor to
you, &amp; much lesse to his father Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus,
the which we learned to be
a great obseruer of the gods and of
religion, and very careful that his
son shoulde not commit anye suche
acte or misdede. But Paris
nothing regarding all these thinges
hath rauished my wife, and stolen
my treasure &amp; ryches, besides that
he hath taken away my seruantes,
and dyuers other thynges. But
what nede is it of so longe a tale,
principally vnto those to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
thinge is notorius: The thinges
<pb facs="tcp:11159:70"/>
which he hath brought hither doe
sufficiently shewe howe greatly he
hath spoyled me. Certes he is now
riche to my greate losse and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce.
And to know more largely
the vnworthynes of the fact, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not to send any man, but to go
into Paris house, and to question
with him vnder this maner. How
is this woman thine, whiche thou
possessist? Kepest thou Helen in
thy house spoused by the righte of
mariage, as Priamus holdeth thy
mother? Then other as shamfast of
the cace he shall falselye denie it, or
els yf he wil tell the trueth, he shall
openly confesse his euel dede. Nor
none of you in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane space ought
to thinke me importune, if I in my
oration do speake frely: for at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first
we can not obtayne the thyng that
is ours. And of your selues ye can
not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend the veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dede,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11159:70"/>
yf it were not largely declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you. By this meanes it shall be
easie to iudge what an vnworthye
and how vnfortunate this dede is.
And if one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do recite openly the
thyng wherwith he was offended,
he is greuous vnto those that haue
committed or done suche like thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: how
is it reasonable that they
shoulde scandalise and shame them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues,
which are wounded &amp; hurt
with the selfe same dede? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moore
it is not possible to make a
mans quarel apeare iuste, yf he first
declare not the authour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crime
to be culpable. Thou seest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how
euident and how iust our cause is.
Uerelye there are but two pointes
that maye iustifie him that is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to wete, that other he hath
committed the crime, or els yf it so
be, that with good righte he hathe
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted it. Yf Paris then can not
<pb facs="tcp:11159:71"/>
denye suche rape not proue it iuste,
that which resteth is of it selfe eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ynough. What honest reason
shall he allege? I haue taken her,
saieth he, I holde her, in no wyse
be not tedius. To haue taken her,
to holde her, is not ynough Paris.
He might haue caused some one to
take that awai, the which he ought
not to take, &amp; althoughe he possesse
the thing that is none of his, yet for
al that it is not to be sayed, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent
he hathe gotten the iuste
possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing so rauished: but
so if ther be no vnrighteousnes nor
wronge: nor we ought not to haue
respect to the thing which we haue
rauished, but muche more be what
reason, the which thing we ought
much more in suche a case to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Thou seest that sacriligious
persons remaine not vnpunished
when thei take or steale the thynge
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11159:71"/>
consecrated vnto the goddes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
yf the possession of the
thyng wer ynough to defend hym,
whosoeuer should haue possession,
should also be sone iustified. Now
(as me thinketh) men shuld thinke
that to be a vitious thing that anye
man shoulde holde and possesse the
thinge whiche of right pertayneth
not vnto him. It is not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for
a man to lai his hand vpon a thing,
but he muste of necessite haue some
right vnto it. Yf Paris after he had
chased away his father, and before
vsurped the kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wold be lorde
ouer you and your goodes, shoulde
he be estemed to tak vpon him thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
honest &amp; reasonable. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise,
his father being so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
prouoked coulde not indure
it, nor you nother being aduertised
of the thing, but should rather este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
him worthye as a misdoer to be
<pb facs="tcp:11159:72"/>
punished. Therfore thou shouldest
not excuse thy self to haue taken the
thing, but to shew in taking therof
not to haue don amis: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right is
on my side, yf Priamus be an equal
iudge. But he saieth, we that dwel
in this part of the erth, &amp; ye that do
inhabite the other, are perpetual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
There is some right &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to take, pyll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

goodes of our enemies, so there be
no other fault. Truth it is Paris: but
is it reasonable to lodge with a

(O noble Paris) approched
so, but rather auoyded the loges of
thyne enemie: thou shouldest not
haue receiued any benefit, nor haue
bene so familier with those, whose

Furthermore, to cloke thine astute

For the thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we commonlye

w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nature Yf Paris had gone
into Lacedemonia with a nauie of

had done some force, it had ben rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he should haue caried away the
victorye, other through fortune, or
els by vertu &amp; strength: be it so that
he had taken the towne, &amp; the men,
then Helen shoulde haue chaunsed
vnto him as a part of his bouty, let
him hold her, let her serue him. But
we abuse our selues, taking vice for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11159:73"/>
the wages that men ought to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
of war. And although thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
shew in al thinges, as in ships,

lyuynge, &amp; con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginninge. Let it be knowen
that victory doeth farre differ from

with warly vertue. For vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
doth declare the nobilite of the

by treason, that they can
not by the honestie of vertue. It is
not peraduenture to much vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nable
(so that the lawes of warre
permit &amp; suffer it) that greate men
father them selues with goodes of
their inferiours. Yea, but of his

of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more vertues, or who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> durst
neuer declare them selues enemies,
is truly a dede of extortion, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye
<pb facs="tcp:11159:74"/>
to be punished. And because
we haue endured and suffred great
iniury &amp; wronge, we haue brought

and perceiued by diuers poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
that there remayneth nothyng

               </gap>shamfastnes. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles
our wil &amp; mind hath ben
rather to vse words then wepons,

it is a very worthy act for an

Furthermore, leste it should seeme

the which thinge in war ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarely
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11159:74"/>

such cases should chaunce, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any

wherwith ye would not be mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
we refuse not that the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy

those that haue moste iuste cause.</p>
            <p>Wherfore this cause abatynge our

to thentent if that alone might

               </gap>
and fauour because of the equitie &amp;
truth of our cause, we come finally
<pb facs="tcp:11159:75"/>
to the second effort &amp; helpe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consider the one and the other,
and compare the fact &amp; dede of war,
with verbal disceptation, wepons
with words: lykewise considering
the present felicite, and the misfortu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may chance to suche thinges,
chuse of two wayes the better. It
is very necessarye (O ye people of
Troye) in such matters to vse ripe
and diligent counsel: for ye knowe
right wel, that an errour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted,
can not afterwardes be restored to
his perfectnes againe. But before
the war beginneth, al his entire and
whole: and easye it is not to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
smche inconuenience, but to flie
and by mature deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to auoyd
it. For when the hand is lift vp to
the battell, the euels &amp; misfortunes
encrease w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ende, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche
victory alone, &amp; no other condition
be it neuer so modest, can geue anye
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:11159:75"/>
final end. Take hede therfore, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye
chuse not war in the place of peace,
lest that after ye haue felt the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of the war, ye repent you
when the occasion shalbe voyd and
gone. Furthermore, yf nother war
nor no other daunger shuld ensue &amp;
folow, yet it were necessarye euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
to chuse the thyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wer iust
and reasonable. For this is verye
certaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> suche men haue the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishement
of their desiers. Nowe
if ye will afterwardes examine the
thinge, ye shall haue no leasure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ye haue a contrary wyll, to
do otherwyse. Se ye not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Grecians spred about al
your countrey in so great a numbre
that it being so litle and so narowe
can scarcely receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? The whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
not withstanding they be thus
gathered oute of diuers places, yet
they haue al one wyl to reuenge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb facs="tcp:11159:76"/>
vnto the end al those, that haue
receyued iniurie. And in very dede
thei are so ready &amp; so purposed to do
their best, that it is no nede to bynd
them by an othe, for they them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
haue so bounde them selues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
so religious and so strayte an othe,
they yf they would refuse it, menne
might most easely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strayne them.
Now what man is so vnprouided
of good wit, that wil not render vp
the thing, the which finally he may
leese w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greate detriment and losse?
Shal he delai it at al (O Iupiter)
because of the vncertayne yssue and
end of the warre? No by the gods,
the end is not vncertayne, nor it is
not to be doubted but that equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tie
shal receyue her rewarde before vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>righteousnes:
and that the iust shal
receyue another maner of retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then the fauters of iniquitie,
yf we nede not to doubte nother of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11159:76"/>
the one nor of the other, certaynely
it is then vndoubtful, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei which
haue the iuster cause shalbe victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and superiors in the war. And
as concerning those which ye hope
to haue to succur &amp; ayde you: I am
sure that many of our men wyl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
them no more, then if ye wer
sure to haue a greater nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre. And
I say thys, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if the rest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men of
warre woulde stande styl without
smityng of any stroke, that Ulixes
alone is sufficient to annihilate all
youre alies &amp; confederates, and by
wisedome and a fortunable spirite
to destroye the whole multitude.
This that I do saye, is not that I
refuse or auoyde the warre, or that
I am otherwyse desirous of newe
affayres. Certes it is very easy for
me to speake many other thynges,
but it is not nedeful. For if ye take
not pleasure in the thynges afore

spoken, we shoulde but in vayne
