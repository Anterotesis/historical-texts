         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It likewiſe Perfectly Cures theſe <hi>Popiſh Diſtempers</hi> Following, Though of never ſo long Continuance: <hi>VIZ. Treaſon, Murther, and Rebellion. And all other</hi> Popiſh <hi>Contrivances whatſoever, with the utmoſt ſpeed imaginable. And without the leaſt hindrance to</hi> Chriſtian-Honeſty.</p>
            <p>The aforeſaid Remedy takes immediately away the <hi>Popiſh-Clap,</hi> known by theſe Following Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, <hi>Viz. Treaſonable Contrivances againſt the</hi> King <hi>Kingdoms, and Countries good, which it</hi> Cures <hi>with ſpeed beyond Imagination.</hi>

            <p>It likewiſe quenches all <hi>Popiſh</hi>-Zeal to the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi>-Cauſe, not got by Innocency, as is by Some CONCEIVED.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Remedy</hi> will be Delivered to any <hi>Patient</hi> at <hi>Thirteen-Pence-Half-Penny</hi> the <hi>Doſe</hi>; Provided they be legally Condemned, but to <hi>Roman-Catholiques,</hi> Gratis, provided they can bring His <hi>Holineſs</hi> Hand and Seal to Certifie they have been Actors in the late Treaſonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns on Foot, in that Horrid Blood-Thirſty <hi>Plot.</hi> Together with a Letter Teſtimonial from his Holineſs to St. <hi>Peter</hi> to admit you without Scruple, yet the Hand being old <hi>Roman,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf does not well Underſtand it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>IN the Year 1582, My Grand-father Cured Mr. <hi>Babington</hi> and the reſt of his Accomplices, for attempting the Murther of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of Happy Memory; being Fourteen in number: He Cured them in two days time, with only one Doze to each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon adminiſtred. Theſe Perſons having been in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> where meeting with no Cure, their Malignity Raging worſe then ever; upon their firſt coming hither they were freely diſcharged of the ſame. Their Deſtemper being a Blood-Thirſty attempt upon the Queens Majeſties Perſon; which was perfectly Diſſolved with the firſt Hempen Doze. I could give you an account of ſome more Cured by my aforeſaid Grand-father, but hope theſe ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1605, My Father Cured <hi>Guido Faux</hi> of a Malignant Feavor, which was ſo wonderfully ſtrong, that it had like to have blown up both King and Parliament; He no ſooner came into his Clutches, but of Roaring Lyons, he made them as Tame as Lambs, and ſent them to <hi>Pluto's</hi> Territories without Bail or Main-prize.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time he not only Cured him, but the reſt of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices, beyond expectation.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1660, My Father <hi>Grigory</hi> Cured Major General <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, Hugh Peters, Olivers</hi> Jeſter, and ſeveral more, of a violent Madneſs; which Frenzy attained to ſo high a pitch, as made them deſtroy their Father, the moſt Gracious King living, and turned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Epiſcopally out of Doors; they were Cured with one Swing on the High-Rope.</p>
                  <p>Since which, my Father <hi>Dunn</hi> hath Cured ſeveral <hi>Fifth-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>-Men under Captain <hi>Venner,</hi> who ſtunk ſo much of <hi>Popery,</hi> that he could hardly diſtinguiſh at the hour of death what they were, yet they were perfectly Cured by my firſt Doſe; which had likewiſe this ſingular Opperation, that it not only Cured them, but ſome ſcores if not hundreds; Beſides, upon whom my Medicine ſo far opperated, as through fear they never ſince durſt attempt the like Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>Since that he Cured one <hi>Hubert</hi> a <hi>French</hi>-man, of a Scald Head, miſerably ſcorched by the Fire in 66, yet he is forced to ſing <hi>Lacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> in reſpect only one poor Forreigner ſhould partake of his Phiſick, whereas many of his Country-men deſerve the like. Thus much for Cures performed by my Father and Grand-father, now to my own.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I Cured Mr. <hi>Stayly</hi> living in <hi>Covent-Garden London,</hi> of a Bloody Deſign againſt his preſent Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Five Remarkable Jeſuits, <hi>Gaven</hi> and his Fellows, who though they dyed as innocent as the Child unborn, have reaſon to bleſs me for ſending them to Heaven before their time.</p>
                  <p>Next, I perfectly Cured <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Groves,</hi> who were ſo well ſatisfied with my Cure, that they gave me my Fee with conſiderable Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
                     <lb/>
Theſe are but a Touch for a taſte of my Cures; I hope in my next to make an Addition of ſome perſons now in Cuſtody, and then I hope to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelf eminent: I hope it is not only my deſire, but the requeſt of all true <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to put a final Period to Treaſon; and then I ſhall have work enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You may Speak with me at the Hour, Time, and Place aforeſaid.</hi>
