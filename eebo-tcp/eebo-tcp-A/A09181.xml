            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thoughe it be but a mannes Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, yet no man despiseth it, or addeth anye thinge thereto, when it is once alowed. To Abraham and his sede were the promises made.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not of promes. But God gaue it vnto Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by promes. Wherfore then serueth the law? The lawe was added because of transgression (til the sede came to whiche the promes was made) &amp; it was ordianed bi Angels in the hand of a mediator. A mediator is not a mediator of one. But God is one. Is the lawe then againste the promes of God? God forbyd. Howe be it, if there had bene a lawe geuen which coulde haue geuen lyfe, then no doubte righteousnes shoulde haue come by the lawe. But the scripture concluded all thinges vnder synne, that the promes by the fayeth of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christe, shoulde be geuen vntoo them that beleue.

Unto the maried commaund not I but the Lorde: that the wife se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate not her selfe from the man.

And the woman whiche hath to her husbande an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, if he consente to dwell with her, let her not put him awaye. For the vnbeleuinge husbande, is sanctifyed by the wife: and the vnbeleuing wife is sanctified by the husbande. Or els wer your children vncleane, but now are they pure. But and if the vnbele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge departe, let him departe. A brother or a sister is not in subiection to such. God hath called vs in peace. For howe knowest thou o woman, whether thou shalt saue that man or no? Other how knowest thou o man, whether thou shalt saue that woman or no? But euen as God hath distry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to euerye man.

Lykewise if a virgyne marye, she sinneth not. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse suche shal haue truble in their flesh, but I fauoure you. The single manne careth for the thinges of the Lorde, how he maye please the Lord.

And therto they whiche are fallen a slepe in Christe, are pearished, if in this life onelye we beleue in Christ, then are we of all men, the miserabliest. But nowe is Christe risen frome the deade, and is become the first frutes of them that slepte. For by a manne came deathe, and by a manne came the resurrection of the deadde. For as by Adam all dye, euen so by Christ shall all be made a lyue, and euerye man in his owne order. The first is Christe, then they that are Christs at his comminge.
