            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ltho these pieces may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
fully to express their
own real intrinsic value,
as bearing the Image and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of that great Man
Mr. <hi>Hobbes;</hi> yet since common usage
has rendred a Preface to a Book as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
as a Porch to a Church, and that
in all things some Ceremonies cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
Mode and Custom in this point is
dutifully to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>That they are genuine, credible testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
might be produced; did not the peculiar
fineness of thought and expression, and a
constant undaunted resolution of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Opinions sufficiently ascertain
their Author. Besides which, they are
now Publish'd from his own true Copies,
<pb facs="tcp:54911:3"/>
an advantage which some of his works have
wanted.</p>
            <p>The first of them, being an abridgement
containing the most useful part of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's</hi>
Rhetoric, was written some thirty
years since. Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> in his Book
of <hi>Humane Nature</hi> had already describ'd
Man, with an exactness almost equal to the
original draught of Nature; and in his
<hi>Elements of Law,</hi> laid down the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Government, and shewn by what
Arm'd Reason it is maintain'd. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
demonstrated in the State of Nature,
the Primitive Art of Fighting to be the only
medium whereby Men procur'd their ends;
did in this design to shew what Power in
Societies has succeeded to reign in its stead.
I mean the Art of speaking, which by use
of Common places of Probability, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the manners and passions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
throu the working of Belief is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bring about whatsoever Interest.</p>
            <p>How necessary this Art is to that of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic,
is clearly evident from that mighty
force, whereby the Eloquence of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="tcp:54911:3"/>
Orators captivated the minds of the
People. Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> chose to recommend
by his Translation the Rhetoric of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
as being the most accomplish'd work
on that Subject, which the World has yet
seen, having been admir'd in all Ages, and
in particular highly approv'd by the Father
of the Roman Eloquence, a very compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Judge. To this he thought fit to add
some small matter relating to that part
which concern's Tropes and Figures; as
also a short discovery of some little tricks
of false and deceitful Reasoning.</p>
            <p>The other piece is a Discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and has been
finish'd many years. Herein he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to accommodate the general noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Politic to the particular consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of no small difficulty, wherein to have
succeeded, deserves much Honour; to have
perchance miscarryed, deserves easie Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
It has had the good fortune to be much
esteem'd by the greatest Men of the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Law, and therefore may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
<pb facs="tcp:54911:4"/>
to contain somewhat excellent. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
'tis not to be expected, that al Men
should submit to his Opinions, yet 'tis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
none will be offended at the present Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
these Papers, since they will not find
here any new fantastic Notions, but only
such things as have been already asserted
with strength of Argument by himself, and
other Persons of eminent Learning. To
the Public at least this Benefit may accrue,
that some able Pen may undertake the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
being moved with the desire of
that reputation, which will necessarily attend
Victory over so considerable an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>

able in some sort to <hi>accuse</hi> and
<hi>excuse:</hi> Some by <hi>chance;</hi> but
some by <hi>method.</hi> This <hi>method</hi>
may be discovered: and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<hi>Method</hi> is all one with
teaching an <hi>Art.</hi> If this <hi>Art</hi> consisted in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
only, and the skill to stir up the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to <hi>Anger, Envy, Fear, Pity,</hi> or other <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54911:5"/>
a <hi>Rhetorician</hi> in well ordered Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
and States, where it is forbidden to
digress from the cause in hearing, could
have nothing at all to say. For all these
perversions of the Judge are beside the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
And that which the pleader is to
shew, and the Judge to give sentence on,
is this only: <hi>'Tis so:</hi> or <hi>not so.</hi> The rest
hath been decided already by the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
who judging of universals, and future
things, could not be corrupted. Besides,
'tis an absurd thing, for a man to make
crooked the Ruler he means to use.</p>
                  <p>It consisteth therefore chiefly in <hi>Proofs;</hi>
which are <hi>Inferences:</hi> and all <hi>Inferences</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Syllogismes,</hi> a <hi>Logician,</hi> if he would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the difference between a plain <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme,</hi>
and an <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> (which is a <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall
Syllogisme,</hi>) would make the best
<hi>Rhetorician.</hi> For all <hi>Syllogismes</hi> and <hi>Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
belong properly to <hi>Logick;</hi> whether
they infer truth or probability: and because
without this <hi>Art</hi> it would often come to
pass, that evil men by the advantage of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
abilities, would carry an evil cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a good; it brings with it at least this
profit, that making the pleaders even in
skill, it leaves the odds only in the merit of
the cause. Besides, ordinarily those that
are Judges, are neither patient, nor capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of long <hi>Scientifical proofs,</hi> drawn from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54911:5"/>
the <hi>principles</hi> through many <hi>Syllogisms;</hi> and
therefore had need to be instructed by the
<hi>Rhetoricall,</hi> and shorter way. Lastly, it were
ridiculous, to be ashamed of being vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in exercises of the body, and not to be
ashamed of being inferior in the vertue of
well expressing the mind.</p>

                     <hi>RHetorick,</hi> is that Faculty, by which we
understand what will serve our turn,
concerning any Subject to win belief in the

require not the help of Art; as <hi>Witnesses,
Evidences,</hi> and the like, which we invent
not, but make use of; and some require
Art, and are invented by us.</p>
                  <p>The belief that proceeds from our Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
comes partly from the <hi>behaviour</hi> of the
<hi>speaker;</hi> partly from the <hi>passions</hi> of the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Proofs</hi> are, in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> either <hi>Examples,</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN all <hi>Orations,</hi> the Hearer does either
hear only; or judge also.</p>

                  <p>If he judg, he must judg either of that
which is to come; or of that which is
past.</p>
                  <p>If of that which is to come, ther's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>The <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> out of which

and <hi>Vnprofitable; Just,</hi> and <hi>Vnjust;
Honourable,</hi> and <hi>Dishonourable;</hi> which are
the points in the several kinds of <hi>Orations</hi>
questionable. For as in <hi>Logick,</hi> where cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and infallible knowledg is the scope of
our proof, the <hi>Principles</hi> must be all <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
truths:</hi> so in <hi>Rhetorick</hi> the <hi>Principles</hi>
must be <hi>common opinions,</hi> such as the Judg

                  </p>
                  <p>And because nothing is <hi>Profitable, Vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
Just, Vnjust, Honourable</hi> or <hi>Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi>
but what has been <hi>done,</hi> or is <hi>to
be done;</hi> and nothing is <hi>to be done,</hi> that is
not <hi>possible:</hi> and because there be degrees of
<hi>Profitable, Vnprofitable, Just, Vnjust, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi>
and <hi>Dishonourable;</hi> an Orator must
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54911:7"/>
be ready in other <hi>Principles;</hi> namely, of
what is <hi>done</hi> and <hi>not done; possible</hi> and <hi>not

<hi>Greater,</hi> and what is <hi>Lesser,</hi> both in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,

                  <p>IN <hi>Deliberatives</hi> there are to be considered
the <hi>subject,</hi> wherein; and the <hi>ends</hi>
whereto the Orator exhorteth, or from
which he dehorteth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Subject</hi> is always something in our
own power, the knowledg whereof belongs
not to <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> but for the most part to the
<hi>Politicks;</hi> and may be referred in a manner
to these five heads.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Of levying of money.</hi> To which point
he that will speak as he ought to do, ought
to know before hand the revenue of the
State, how much it is, and wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth:
and also how great are the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
charges and expences of the same. This
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54911:7"/>
knowledge is gotten partly by a mans own
experience, partly by Relations, and accounts
in writing.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Of Peace and War.</hi> Concerning which
the Counsellor or Deliberator, ought to
know the strength of the Commonwealth;
how much it both now is, and hereafter
may be; and wherein that power Consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Which knowledge is gotten, partly
by experience, and Relations at home; and
partly by the sight of Wars, and of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
abroad.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Of the safeguard of the Country.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he only is able to give counsell, that
knows the forms, and number, and places
of the Garrisons.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Of Provision.</hi> Wherein to speak well,
it is necessary for a man to know what is
sufficient to maintain the State; what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
they have at home growing; what
they must fetch in through need; and what
they may carry out through abundance.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Of making Laws.</hi> To which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
so much <hi>Political,</hi> or <hi>Civil Philosophy,</hi>
as to know what are the several kinds of
Governments; and by what means, either
from without or from within, each of those
kinds is, preserved, or destroyed. And this
knowledg is gotten, partly by observing
the several Governments in times past, by
<hi>History;</hi> and partly by observing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54911:8"/>
of the times present in several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by <hi>Travel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that to him that will speak in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

Sight of Wars, Travel, Knowledge of the
Revenue, Expences, Forces, Havens, Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Wares, and Provisions</hi> in the State he

either to <hi>export,</hi> or <hi>import.</hi>

<hi>Felicity,</hi> or some part of <hi>Felicity</hi>
to be attained by the actions he exhorteth
unto: and in <hi>Dehortation</hi> the contrary.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Felicity,</hi> is meant commonly, <hi>Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with vertue,</hi> or <hi>a continual content of the

such things as we call <hi>good,</hi> in body, mind,
or fortune; such as these that follow.</p>
                  <p>1. Nobility, <hi>which to a State or Nation
is,</hi> to have been antient inhabitants; and to
have had most antiently, and in most number,
famous Generals in the Wars, or men famous
for such things as fall under emulation. <hi>And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54911:8"/>
to a private man,</hi> to have been descended law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

                  <p>2. <hi>Many and good Children.</hi> Which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
publick and private. <hi>Publick,</hi> when there
<hi>is much youth in the State endued with vertue,</hi>
(namely, of the body, stature, beauty,
strength, and dexterity: Of the <hi>mind,</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,

Houshold-stuffe; with the power to dispose of
them.</p>
                  <p>4. Glory. <hi>Which is,</hi> the reputation of
Vertue, or of the possession of such things as all,
or most men, or wise men desire.</p>
                  <p>5. Honour. <hi>Which is</hi> the glory of benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or being able to benefit others. To bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
others, <hi>is</hi> to contribute somewhat, not easily
had, to another mans safety, or riches, <hi>The
parts of</hi> Honour <hi>are,</hi> Sacrifices, Monuments,
Rewards, Dedication of places, Precedence,
Sepulchres, Statues, publick Pensions, Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Presents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54911:9"/>
6. Health. <hi>Which is</hi> the being free from
Diseases, with strength to use the body.</p>
                  <p>7. Beauty. <hi>Which is to different Ages
different. To</hi> Youth, strength of body, and
sweetness of aspect. <hi>To</hi> full men, strength of
body fit for the Wars, and Countenance sweet,
with a mixture of Terror. <hi>To</hi> old men, strength
enough for necessary labours, with a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
not displeasing.</p>
                  <p>8. Strength. <hi>Which is</hi> the ability to move
any thing at pleasure of the Mover. <hi>To</hi> move,
<hi>is</hi> to pull, to put off, to lift, to thrust down, to
press together.</p>
                  <p>9. Stature. <hi>Which is then</hi> just, <hi>when a
man</hi> in heighth, breadth, and thickness of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
doth so exceed the most, as nevertheless it
be no hinderance to the quickness of his motion.</p>

comes late, and with the least trouble.</p>
                  <p>11. Many and good Friends. <hi>Which is,</hi>
to have many that will do for his sake that
which they think will be for his good.</p>

the most, or the greatest of those goods which
we attribute to Fortune.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Vertue.</hi> Which is then to be defined,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Praise,</hi> is speech, declaring the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

                  </p>
                  <p>But to praise the Work from the Vertue

                  <p>
                     <hi>To Magnifie,</hi> and <hi>to Praise,</hi> differ in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as <hi>Felicity</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> For <hi>Praise</hi>
declares a mans <hi>Vertue;</hi> and <hi>Magnifying</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Praise</hi> is a kind of inverted <hi>Precept.</hi> For
to say, <hi>Do it because 'tis good,</hi> is a <hi>Precept.</hi>

Praise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Orator in <hi>Praising</hi> must also use the
forms of <hi>Amplification;</hi> such as these:</p>
                  <p>He was the first that did it.</p>
                  <p>The only man that did it.</p>
                  <p>The special man that did it.</p>
                  <p>He did it with disadvantage of time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:54911:16"/>
He did it with little help.</p>
                  <p>He was the cause, that the Law ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Rewards and Honours for such Actions.</p>
                  <p>Further, he that will <hi>praise</hi> a Man, must
compare him with others; and his actions
with the actions of others; especially with
such as are renowned.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Amplification</hi> is more proper to a
<hi>Demonstrative Oration,</hi> than to any other.
For here the Actions are confess'd; and the
Orators part is only this, to contribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them Magnitude and Luster.</p>

                     <p>Of Proofs Inartificial.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>OF <hi>Artificial Proofs</hi> we have already
spoken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inartificial Proofs,</hi> which we invent not,
but make use of, are of five sorts.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Laws.</hi> And those are <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>written
Law:</hi> the <hi>Law or Custom of Nations:</hi> and the
<hi>universal Law of Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Witness.</hi> And those are such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<hi>Matter;</hi> and such as concern <hi>Manners.</hi>
Also, they be <hi>ancient,</hi> or <hi>present.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Evidences,</hi> or Writings.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Question,</hi> or Torture.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Oaths.</hi> And those be either <hi>given,</hi> or
<hi>taken,</hi> or both, or neither.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Laws,</hi> we use them thus.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>written Law</hi> makes against us,
we appeal to the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> alledging,
That to be greatest Justice, which is
greatest Equity.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> is immutable;
the <hi>written Law</hi> mutable.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>written Law</hi> is but seeming Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> very Justice. And
Justice is among those things which are,
and not which seem to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:54911:24"/>
That the Judge ought to discern between
true and adulterate Justice.</p>
                  <p>That they are better men that obey <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written,</hi>
than <hi>written Laws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Law</hi> against us does contradict
some other <hi>Law.</hi> And when the <hi>Law</hi> has
a double interpretation, that is, the true
one, which makes for us.</p>
                  <p>And that the cause of the <hi>Law</hi> being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
the <hi>Law</hi> is no more of Validity.</p>
                  <p>But when the <hi>written Law</hi> makes for us,
and <hi>Equity</hi> for the Adversary, we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</p>
                  <p>That a man may use <hi>Equity,</hi> not as a
liberty to judg against the <hi>Law;</hi> but only
as a security against being forsworn, when
he knows not the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That men seek not <hi>Equity</hi> because 'tis
good simply, but because good for them.</p>
                  <p>That it is the same thing not to make, and
not to use the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That as in other Arts, and namely in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi>
Fallacies are pernitious; so in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
'tis pernitious to use pretexts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that in Common-wealths well insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
to seem wiser than the <hi>Laws,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Witnesses,</hi> we must use them thus:</p>
                  <p>When we have them not, we must stand
for <hi>Presumptions,</hi> and say,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:54911:24"/>
That in <hi>Equity</hi> sentence ought to be given
according to the most probability.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Presumptions</hi> are the testimony of
the things themselves, and cannot be bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
                  <p>That they cannot lye.</p>
                  <p>When we have <hi>witnesses,</hi> against him that
has them not, we must say,</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Presumptions,</hi> if they be false, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be punished.</p>
                  <p>That if <hi>Presumptions</hi> were enough, <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
were superfluous.</p>
                  <p>For Writings, when they favour us;
we must say,</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Writings</hi> are private and particular
<hi>Laws;</hi> and he that takes away the use of
<hi>Evidences,</hi> abolisheth the Law.</p>
                  <p>That since Contracts and Negotiations
pass by <hi>Writings,</hi> he that bars their use, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
humane Society.</p>
                  <p>Against them, if they favour the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
we may say,</p>
                  <p>That since <hi>Laws</hi> do not bind, that are
fraudulently made to pass, much less <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the Judge being to dispense
Justice, ought rather to consider what is <hi>just,</hi>
than what is in the <hi>Writing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Writings</hi> may be gotten by fraud
or force; but Justice by neither.</p>

                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54911:25"/>
That the <hi>Writing</hi> is repugnant to some
<hi>Law, Civil,</hi> or <hi>Natural;</hi> or to <hi>Justice;</hi> or
to <hi>Honesty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That 'tis repugnant to some other <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
before, or after.</p>
                  <p>That it crosses some commodity of the
Judge (which must not be said directly,
but implyed cunningly.)</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Torture,</hi> if the giving of it make
for us, we must say,</p>
                  <p>That 'tis the only testimony that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                  <p>But if it make for the Adversary, we may
say.</p>
                  <p>That men inforced by <hi>Torture,</hi> speak as
well that which is false, as that which is
true.</p>
                  <p>That they who can endure, conceal the
truth; and they who cannot, say that
which is false to be delivered from pain.</p>

                  <p>Adversary to his <hi>Oath,</hi> may alledge,</p>
                  <p>That he makes no scruple to be <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That by <hi>swearing,</hi> he will carry the
cause; which <hi>not swearing,</hi> he must lose.</p>
                  <p>That he had rather trust his cause in the
hand of the Judge, than of the Adversary.</p>
                  <p>He that refuseth to <hi>take the Oath,</hi> may
say,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:54911:25"/>
That the matter is not worth so much.</p>
                  <p>That if he had been an evil man, he had
<hi>sworn,</hi> and carryed his cause.</p>
                  <p>That to try it by <hi>swearing</hi> for a Religious
man against an irreligious, is as hard a
match, as to set a weak man against a
strong in Combate.</p>
                  <p>He that is willing to <hi>take the Oath,</hi> may
pretend.</p>
                  <p>That he had rather trust himself, than
his Adversary; and that 'tis equal dealing
for an irreligious man to <hi>give,</hi> and for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
man to <hi>take the Oath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That 'tis his duty to <hi>take the Oath,</hi> since
he has required to have <hi>sworn Judges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that <hi>Offers the Oath</hi> may pretend,</p>
                  <p>That he does piously commit his cause to
the Gods.</p>
                  <p>That he makes his Adversary himself
Judge.</p>
                  <p>That 'twere absurd for him <hi>not to swear,</hi>
that has required the Judges <hi>to be sworn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of these are to be compounded the
Forms we are to use, when we would <hi>give,</hi>
and <hi>not take the Oath;</hi> or <hi>take,</hi> and <hi>not give;</hi>
or <hi>both give</hi> and <hi>take;</hi> or <hi>neither give nor

                  </argument>
                  <p>SHame is a perturbation of the Mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
from the apprehension of Evil,
past, present, or to come, to the prejudice
of a mans own, or his friends reputation.</p>
                  <p>The things therefore which men are <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed</hi>
of are those Actions which proceed
from Vice, as,</p>
                  <p>To throw away ones Arms; to run away,
signs of Cowardliness.</p>
                  <p>To deny that which is committed to
ones trust, a sign of Injustice.</p>

                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:54911:33"/>
To have lyen with whom, where, and
when we ought not, signs of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>To make gain of small and base things;
not to help with money whom and how
much we ought; to receive help from mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
men; to ask money at use from such as
one thinks will borrow of him; to borrow
of him that expects payment of somewhat
before lent; and to redemand what one has
lent, of him that one thinks will borrow
more; and so to praise, as one may be thought
to ask; signs of Wretchedness.</p>
                  <p>To praise one to his face; to praise his
vertues too much, and colour his vices;
Signs of Flattery.</p>
                  <p>To be unable to indure such labours as
men indure that are elder, tenderer, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in quality, and of less strength than he,
signs of Effeminacy.</p>
                  <p>To be beholden often to another; and to
upbraid those that are beholding to him,
signs of Pusillanimity.</p>
                  <p>To speak and promise much of ones self
more than his due, signs of Arrogance.</p>
                  <p>To want those things which ones Equals,
all, or most of them have attained to, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a thing to be <hi>ashamed of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to suffer things ignominious, as to
serve about anothers person; or to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in his base actions.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54911:33"/>
In Actions of Intemperance, whether
willingly, or unwillingly committed; there
is <hi>shame</hi> in Actions of Force, only when
they are done unwillingly.</p>
                  <p>The men before whom we are <hi>ashamed,</hi>
are such as we respect; namely,</p>
                  <p>Those that admire us.</p>

                  <p>Those that contend with us for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>Those whose opinion we contemn not.</p>
                  <p>And therefore men are most <hi>ashamed</hi> in

                  <p>Of old and well bred men.</p>

                  <p>And of those who never asked any thing
of us before.</p>
                  <p>And of such as desire our Friendship.</p>

                  <p>OPposite in a manner to <hi>Pity</hi> in good
Men, is <hi>Indignation,</hi> which is grief
for the prosperity of a Man unworthy.</p>
                  <p>With <hi>Indignation</hi> there is always joyned
a joy for the prosperity of a Man worthy,
as <hi>Pity</hi> is always with contentment in the
adversity of them that deserve it.</p>
                  <p>In wicked Men the opposite of <hi>pity</hi> is,
<hi>Envy;</hi> as also the companion thereof, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the harm of others,</hi> which the Greeks
in one word have called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. But of
these in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Men conceive <hi>Indignation</hi> against others,
not for their vertues, as Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For these make Men worthy; and in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation</hi>
we think Men unworthy.</p>
                  <p>But for those goods which men indued
with vertue, and noble Men, and handsome
Men are worthy of.</p>
                  <p>And for newly gotten power and riches,
rather than for antient, and especially if
by these he has gotten other goods, as by
Riches, Command. The reason why we
conceive greater <hi>Indignation</hi> against new
than antient Riches, is, that the former seem
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54911:36"/>
to possess that which is none of theirs. But
the antient seem to have but their own. For
with common people, to have been so long,
is to be so by Right.</p>
                  <p>And for the bestowing of goods incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously:
as when the arms of the most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<hi>Achilles</hi> were bestowed on the most elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>Vlysses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the comparison of the Inferiour
in the same thing, as when one Valiant is
compared with a more Valiant; or whether
absolutely Superiour, as when a good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
is compared with a good Man.</p>
                  <p>Apt to <hi>Indignation</hi> are,</p>
                  <p>They that think themselves worthy of
the greatest goods, and do possess them.</p>
                  <p>And they that are good.</p>
                  <p>And they that are ambitious.</p>
                  <p>And such as think themselves deserve
better what another possesseth, than he that
hath it.</p>
                  <p>Least apt to <hi>Indignation</hi> are,</p>
                  <p>Such as are of a poor, servile, and not
ambitious Nature.</p>
                  <p>Who they are, that Rejoyce, or Grieve
not at the Adversity of him that suffers
worthily, and in what occasions, may be
gathered from the contrary of what has

                     <hi>EMulation</hi> is grief arising from that our
Equals possess such goods as are had
in honour, and whereof we are capable,
but have them not; not because they have
them, but because not we also.</p>
                  <p>No Man therefore <hi>Emulates</hi> another in
things whereof himself is not capable.</p>
                  <p>Apt to <hi>Emulate</hi> are,</p>
                  <p>Such as esteem themselves worthy of
more than they have.</p>
                  <p>And Young and Magnanimous Men.</p>
                  <p>And such as already possess the goods
for which Men are honoured: for they
measure their worth by their having.</p>
                  <p>And those that are esteemed worthy by
others.</p>
                  <p>And those whose Ancestors, Kindred, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars,
Nation, City, have been eminent
for some good, do <hi>Emulate</hi> others for that
good.</p>
                  <p>Objects of <hi>Emulation</hi> are, for things;
Vertues.</p>

                  <p>Longing mightily, and soon satisfied.</p>
                  <p>Apt to anger, and in their anger Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
and ready to execute their anger
with their hands.</p>
                  <p>Lovers of Honour, and of Victory more

                  <p>Well natured, as having not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with much malice.</p>
                  <p>Full of hope, both because they have not
yet been often frustrated, and because they
have by natural heat that disposition that
other <hi>Ages</hi> have by Wine; <hi>Youth</hi> being a
kind of natural drunkenness. Besides, Hope
is of the time to come, whereof <hi>Youth</hi> hath
much, but of the time past little.</p>
                  <p>Credulous, because not yet often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>Easily deceived, because full of Hope.</p>
                  <p>Valiant, because apt to Anger and full of
Hope; whereof this begets confidence, the

                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:54911:39"/>
Bashful, because they estimate the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

                  <p>Magnanimous, because not yet dejected

they Love too much, and Hate too much,
because thinking themselves wise, they
are obstinate in the opinion they have once
delivered.</p>
                  <p>Doers of Injury rather for Contumely
than for dammage.</p>
                  <p>Mercifull, because measuring others by

the contraries of those of <hi>Youth.</hi>
They determine nothing: they do every

they have often mistaken and been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>

                  <p>And live by Memory rather than Hope;

                  <p>They have weak, or no desires; and

                  <p>They are slaves to Gain.</p>

                  <p>OF the <hi>Principles</hi> both general and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
from whence <hi>Proofs</hi> are to be

                  <p>Now follow the <hi>Proofs</hi> themselves which
are <hi>Examples</hi> or <hi>Enthymemes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An <hi>Example</hi> is either an Example proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

(which also is, called a Parable:)
or a <hi>Fable</hi> (which contains some Action

                  <p>
                     <hi>An</hi> Example <hi>properly so called, is this;
Darius</hi> came not into <hi>Greece,</hi> till he had first
subdued <hi>Aegypt. Xerxes</hi> also conquered <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
first; then afterwards crossed the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont.</hi>
We ought therefore to hinder the King
of <hi>Persia</hi> from conquering <hi>Aegypt.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> Similitude, <hi>or</hi> Parable, <hi>is such as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi>

                     <hi>Inferr'd thus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis not good to be effeminately minded, nor
to be envyed by ones fellow Citizens. A wise

                     <hi>Confirm'd thus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A wise Man will not have his Children over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
seeing too much Learning both softens
a Mans mind, and procures him envy among
his fellow Citizens.</p>
                  <p>If a reason be added to a manifest <hi>Sentence</hi>
let it be short.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sentences</hi> become not every Man; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
old Men, and such as be well versed in
business. For to hear a young Man speak
<hi>Sentencee,</hi> is ridiculous; and to hear an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Man speak <hi>Sentences,</hi> is absurd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sentences</hi> generally received, when they
are for our purpose, ought not to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
because they pass for truths. And
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54911:45"/>
yet they may be denyed, when any lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
custom, or humour may thereby be
made appear in the Denyer.</p>
                  <p>The commodities of <hi>Sentences,</hi> are two.</p>
                  <p>One proceeding from the Vanity of the
Hearer, who takes for true universally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that which he has found for true
only in some particular; and therefore a
Man ought to consider in every thing what
opinion the Hearer holds.</p>
                  <p>Another is, that <hi>Sentences</hi> do discover
the manners and disposition of the speaker;
so that if they be esteemed good <hi>Sentences,</hi>
he shall be esteemed a good Man; and if
evil, an evil Man.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of <hi>Sentences,</hi> what they be;
of how many sorts; how to be used;
whom they become; and what is their
profit.</p>

                     <p>Of the Invention of Enthymemes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>SEeing an <hi>Enthymeme</hi> differs from a <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Syllogisme,</hi> in that it neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
out of every thing, nor out of remote
<hi>Principles;</hi> the <hi>Places</hi> of it, from whence a
Man may argue ought to be certain, and
determinate.</p>
                  <p>And because whosoever makes a <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme
Rhetorical,</hi> or other, should know
all, or the most part of that which is in
question; as, whosoever is to advise the
<hi>Athenians</hi> in the question, whether they are
to make War or no, must know what their
Revenues be; what, and what kind of
power they have: and he that will praise
them, must know their acts at <hi>Salamis, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathon,</hi>
&amp;c. It will be necessary for a good
speaker to have in readiness the choicest
particulars of whatsoever he foresees he
may speak of.</p>
                  <p>He that is to speak <hi>ex tempore,</hi> must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
in his speech as much as he can of
what is most proper in the matter in hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proper,</hi> I call those things which are
least common to others; as, he that will
praise <hi>Achilles,</hi> is not to declare such things
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54911:46"/>
as are common both to him, and <hi>Diomedes;</hi>
as that he was a Prince, and Warred against

and <hi>Cygnus;</hi> went to the War young, and
Voluntary.</p>

                  <p>FOrasmuch as <hi>Enthymemes</hi> either infer
truly, or seem only so to do; and they
which do infer indeed, be either <hi>Ostensive;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Ostensive Enthymeme</hi> is, wherein a
Man concludes the question from somewhat
granted.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Enthymeme</hi> which brings a Man to
an <hi>impossibility,</hi> is an <hi>Enthymeme</hi> wherein
from that which the Adversary maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
we conclude that which is manifestly
<hi>impossible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All <hi>Places</hi> have been already set down in

which in the <hi>Concrete</hi> or Particulars
is exemplified thus. <hi>If Intemperance be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Temperance is profitable: and if Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

                  </p>

or affinity of words: as in this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
<hi>If what is</hi> Just <hi>be</hi> Good; <hi>then what is</hi>

                  <p>OF <hi>seeming Enthymemes,</hi> one Place may

a Man has repeated divers Sentences, he
brings in his Conclusion, as if it follow'd

It was justice that I should Revenge my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

justly killed my Mother. <hi>Or from that</hi> which
is true joyned, to that which is false divided;

are hurtful; therefore one cup of Wine is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>A Fourth from <hi>Amplification of the Crime.</hi>
For neither is the <hi>Defendant</hi> likely to have
committed the <hi>Crime</hi> he <hi>amplifies;</hi> nor does
the <hi>Accuser</hi> seem, when he is Passionate, to
want ground for his Accusation.</p>
                  <p>A Fifth from <hi>signs;</hi> as, when a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes

A Sixth from <hi>that which comes by chance,</hi>

conclude, that in a free Commonwealth

the War began; therefore <hi>Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi>
Governed well. With the <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian

                     <hi>A Ninth from</hi> the Omission of some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,

                  <p>AN <hi>Argument</hi> is answered by an opposite
<hi>Syllogisme,</hi> or by an <hi>Objection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Places</hi> of opposite <hi>Syllogismes</hi> are the
same with the <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Syllogismes,</hi> or <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymemes:</hi>
for a <hi>Rhetorical Syllogisme</hi> is an
<hi>Enthymeme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Objections</hi> are four.</p>
                  <p>First, from <hi>the same,</hi> as, To the <hi>Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
that proves Love to be good by an <hi>Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme,</hi>
may be <hi>objected,</hi> that <hi>no want is good,
and yet Love is want;</hi> or particularly thus;
<hi>The Love of Myrrha to her Father was not
good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second from <hi>Contraries:</hi> as, if the
<hi>Adversary</hi> say, <hi>A good Man does good to his
friends,</hi> an <hi>Objection</hi> might be made, that
then <hi>an evil Man will do also evil to his
friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third From <hi>Similitude:</hi> as thus, if
the <hi>Adversary</hi> say, all Men that are injured,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54911:51"/>
do hate those that have injured them, it
may be <hi>Objected,</hi> that then, <hi>all Men that had
received Benefits should love their Benefactors,</hi>
that is to say, be grateful.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth from the <hi>authority of famous
Men;</hi> as when a Man shall say, that drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Men ought to be pardoned those Acts
they do in their drunkenness, because they
know not what they do; the <hi>Objection</hi> may
be, that Pittacus <hi>was of another mind, that
appointed for such Acts a double punishment;
one for the Act, another for the Drunkenness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as all <hi>Enthymemes</hi> are
drawn from <hi>Probability,</hi> or <hi>Example,</hi> or from
a <hi>Sign Fallible,</hi> or from a <hi>Sign infallible:</hi> an
<hi>Enthymeme</hi> from <hi>Probability</hi> may be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Really,</hi> by shewing that for the most
part it falls out otherwise; but <hi>Apparantly,</hi>
or <hi>Sophistically,</hi> by shewing only that it does
not fall out so alwayes; whereupon the
Judge thinks the <hi>Probability</hi> not sufficient
to ground his Sentence upon.</p>
                  <p>[The Reason whereof is this, That
the Judge, while he hears the Fact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Probable,</hi> conceives it as <hi>true.</hi> For
the Understanding has no Object but
<hi>Truth.</hi> And therefore by and by, when
he shall hear an <hi>Instance</hi> to the contrary;
and thereby find that he had no necessity
to think it <hi>true,</hi> presently changes his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and thinks it <hi>false,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54911:52"/>
not so much as <hi>Probable.</hi> For he
cannot at one time think the same thing
both <hi>Probable</hi> and <hi>False:</hi> and he that says
a thing is <hi>Probable,</hi> the meaning is, he
thinks it <hi>True,</hi> but finds not arguments
enough to prove it.]</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Enthymeme</hi> from a <hi>fallible sign,</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,

                  </p>
                  <p>An <hi>Enthymeme</hi> from an <hi>Example,</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
as an <hi>Enthymeme</hi> from <hi>Probability;</hi>
Really, by shewing more <hi>Examples</hi> to the
contrary; <hi>Apparently,</hi> if he bring <hi>Examples</hi>
enough to make it seem <hi>not necessary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Adversary</hi> have more <hi>Examples</hi>
than we, we must make appear, that they
are not applycable to the Case.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Enthymeme</hi> from an <hi>infallible Sign,</hi> if

                  <p>The Second, that <hi>Enthymemes,</hi> by which
Arguments are answered, are of the same
kind with those by which the matter in
question is proved, is manifest by this, that
these infer the opposite of what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  <p>The Third, that an <hi>Objection</hi> is no <hi>Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme,</hi>

                  <p>As for <hi>Action,</hi> or <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> so much

which we have treated of the <hi>Action</hi> of the
<hi>Stage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Tragedians</hi> were the first that invented

consisteth in governing well the <hi>Magnitude,

supposing it had proceeded from
the choice, or connexion of words, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Stile, by imitation of them, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Verse, and made choice of words.</p>
                  <p>But when the <hi>Poets</hi> changed their Stile,
and laid by all words that were not in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

lighted at last upon words, and a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Voice and Measures proper to

                  <p>Seeing therefore <hi>Pronuntiation,</hi> or <hi>Action</hi>

that it be <hi>decent;</hi> that is, neither <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi>
nor <hi>below</hi> the thing signified; or, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too humble, nor too fine.</p>
                  <p>Perspicuous <hi>are all</hi> Words <hi>that be</hi> Proper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fine Words</hi> are those, that are <hi>borrowed,</hi> or
<hi>Translated</hi> from other significations; of
which in the <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason why <hi>borrowed Words</hi> please, is
this. Men are affected with <hi>Words,</hi> as they
are with <hi>Men,</hi> admiring in both that which
is <hi>Forreign</hi> and <hi>New.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make a <hi>Poem</hi> graceful, many things
help; but few an <hi>Oration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For to a <hi>Poet</hi> it sufficieth with what <hi>Words</hi>
he can to set out his <hi>Poem:</hi> but an <hi>Orator</hi>
must not only do that: but also seem not to
do it: for else he will be thought to speak
unnaturally, and not as he thinks; and
thereby be the less believed; whereas <hi>belief</hi>
is the scope of his <hi>Oration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Words</hi> that an <hi>Orator</hi> ought to use
are of three sorts. <hi>Proper;</hi> Such as are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;</hi>
and <hi>Metaphors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:54911:55"/>
                     <hi>Words</hi> taken from Forraign Languages,
Words compounded, and Words new coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
are seldom to be used.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Synonimaes</hi> belong to <hi>Poets,</hi> and <hi>Equivocal</hi>
words to <hi>Sophisters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An <hi>Orator,</hi> if he use <hi>Proper</hi> words, and
<hi>Received,</hi> and <hi>good Metaphors,</hi> shall both
make his <hi>Oration beautiful,</hi> and not seem to
intend it; and shall speak <hi>perspicuously.</hi> For
in a <hi>Metaphor</hi> alone there is <hi>perspicuity, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi>
and <hi>Sweetness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning <hi>Metaphors</hi> the Rules are
these.</p>
                  <p>1. He that will make the best of a thing,
let him draw his <hi>Metaphor</hi> from somewhat
that is better. As for Example, let him
call a <hi>Crime,</hi> an <hi>Error.</hi> On the other side,
when he would make the worst of it, let
him draw his <hi>Metaphor</hi> from somewhat
worse, as, calling <hi>Error, Crime.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. A <hi>Metaphor</hi> ought not to be so far
fetcht, as that the Similitude may not easily
appear.</p>
                  <p>3. A <hi>Metaphor</hi> ought to be drawn from
the noblest things, as the <hi>Poets</hi> do that
choose rather to say, <hi>Rosy-finger'd;</hi> then
<hi>Red finger'd Aurora.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner the Rule of <hi>Epithets</hi>
is,</p>
                  <p>That he that will adorn, should use those
of the better sort; and he that will disgrace
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54911:55"/>
should use those of the worse: as <hi>Simonides</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

they are, when they are far fetcht. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>Similitude</hi> differs from a <hi>Metaphor</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by such <hi>Particles</hi> of <hi>Comparison</hi> as
these, <hi>As; Even as; So; Even so,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Similitude</hi> therefore is a <hi>Metaphor dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>Similitude</hi> does well in an Oration, so

                  </p>

                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:54911:56"/>

                  <p>3. That there be nothing of <hi>double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
unless there be cause to do it of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
As the <hi>Prophets</hi> (of the Heathen)
who speak in general terms, to the end they
may the better maintain the truth of their
<hi>Prophesies;</hi> which is easier maintained in
<hi>generals,</hi> than in <hi>particulars.</hi> For 'tis easier
to divine, whether a number be <hi>even</hi> or <hi>odd,</hi>

<hi>what it will be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Concordance of Gender, Number, and

3. By speaking <hi>proportionably</hi> to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
as of <hi>great affairs</hi> to speak in a <hi>high;</hi>
and of <hi>mean,</hi> in a <hi>low</hi> Stile.</p>
                  <p>4. By abstaining from <hi>Compounded,</hi> and
from <hi>Out-landish Words;</hi> unless a Man speak
<hi>Passionately,</hi> and have already moved, and,
as it were, inebriated his Hearers. Or <hi>Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It confers also to perswasion very much,
to use these ordinary Forms of speaking, <hi>All
Men know; 'Tis confessed by all; No Man will
deny,</hi> and the like. For the Hearer consents,
surprized with the fear to be esteemed the
only Ignorant Man.</p>
                  <p>'Tis good also, having used a word that
signifies more than the matter requires, to
abstain from the <hi>Pronunciation</hi> and <hi>Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
that to such a word belongs; that the
<hi>Disproportion</hi> between it and the matter may
the less appear. And when a Man has said
too much, it will shew well to correct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
For he will get belief by seeming to
consider what he says.</p>
                  <p>[But in this a Man must have a care
not to be too precise in shewing of this
Consideration. For the oftentation of
Carefulness is an argument oftentimes
of lying; as may be observed in such as
tell particularities not easily observed,
when they would be thought to speak
more precise truth than is required.]</p>

as is perfect in it self; and has such length,
as may easily be comprehended by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
                  <p>This later kind is pleasant; the former
unpleasant, because this appears finite, the

somewhat set out, and terminated to him;
in the other he fore-sees no end, and has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
finished to him: this may easily be

                     <p>Of those things that grace an Oration, and make
it delightful.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FOrasmuch as there is nothign more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to a Man, than to find that
he apprehends and learns easily; it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follows, that those <hi>Words</hi> are most <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
to the Ear, that make a Man seem to see
before his Eyes the things signified.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Forraign Words</hi> are unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
because <hi>Obscure;</hi> and <hi>Plain Words,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>too Manifest,</hi> making us learn nothing
new: but <hi>Metaphors</hi> please; for they beget
in us by the <hi>Genus,</hi> or by some <hi>common</hi> thing
to that with another, a kind of <hi>Science:</hi> as
when an <hi>Old Man</hi> is called <hi>Stubble;</hi> a Man
suddainly learns that he grows up, flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and withers like Grass, being put in
mind of it by the qualities common to <hi>Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and to <hi>Old Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which a <hi>Metaphor</hi> does, a <hi>Similitude</hi>
does the same; but with less <hi>grace,</hi> because
with more <hi>prolixity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such <hi>Enthymemes</hi> are the most <hi>graceful,</hi>
which neither are presently very Manifest,
nor yet very hard to be understood; but are
comprehended, while they are uttering,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54911:60"/>
or presently after, though not understood
before.</p>
                  <p>The things that make a speech <hi>graceful,</hi>
are these; <hi>Antitheta, Metaphors,</hi> and <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Anitheta,</hi> and <hi>Antithesis</hi> hath been
spoken in the precedent Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Metaphors</hi> the most <hi>graceful</hi> is that
which is drawn from <hi>Proportion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[<hi>Aristotle</hi> (in the 12 Chapter of his
<hi>Poetry</hi>) defines a <hi>Metaphor</hi> to be the
translation of a name from one signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to another; whereof he makes
four kinds, 1. From the <hi>General</hi> to the
<hi>Particular,</hi> 2. From the <hi>Particular</hi> to
the <hi>General.</hi> 3. From one <hi>Particular</hi> to
another. 4. From <hi>Proportion.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>A Metaphor from Proportion is such as
this, <hi>A State without Youth, is a Year without
a Spring.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Animation</hi> is that expression which makes
us seem to see the thing before our eyes; as
he that said, <hi>The Athenians powred out their
City into Sicily,</hi> meaning, they sent thither
the greatest Army they could make; and
this is the greatest <hi>grace</hi> of an <hi>Oration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If therefore in the same Sentence there
concur both <hi>Metaphor,</hi> and this <hi>Animation,</hi>
and also <hi>Antithesis,</hi> it cannot choose but be
very <hi>graceful.</hi>

That an <hi>Oration</hi> is <hi>graced by Metaphor, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimation</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Such <hi>Metaphors</hi> as these come into a Mans
mind by the observation of things that have
similitude and proportion one to another.
And the more unlike, and unproportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the things be otherwise, the more <hi>grace</hi>
hath the <hi>Metaphor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Metaphor</hi> without <hi>Animation,</hi> adds <hi>grace</hi>
then, when the Hearer finds he learns some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
by such use of the word.</p>
                  <p>Also <hi>Paradoxes</hi> are <hi>graceful,</hi> so Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
do believe them: for they have in
them somewhat like to those jests that are
grounded upon the similitude of words,
which have usually one sense, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
another; and somewhat like to those
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54911:61"/>
jests which are grounded upon the deceiving
of a Mans expectation.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Paragrams;</hi> that is, allusions of
words are graceful, if they be well placed;
and in Periods not too long; and with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis:</hi>
for by these means the Ambiguity
is taken away.</p>
                  <p>And the more of these; namely, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor,
Animation, Antithesis, Equality of

it is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Similitudes grace</hi> an <hi>Oration,</hi> when they
contain also a <hi>Metaphor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Proverbs</hi> are graceful, because they
are <hi>Metaphors,</hi> or Translations of words from
one <hi>species</hi> to another.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> because they also are
<hi>Metaphors:</hi> but they are youthful, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
vehemence; and are used with most
grace by them that be angry; and for that

                     <p>Of the Difference between the Stile to be used

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe <hi>Stile</hi> that should be <hi>Read</hi> ought
to be more exact and accurate.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Stile</hi> of a <hi>Pleader</hi> ought to be
suted to Action and Pronuntiation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Orations</hi> of them that <hi>Plead,</hi> pass away
with the Hearing.</p>
                  <p>But those that are <hi>Written,</hi> Men carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, and are considered at Leasure;
and consequently must endure to be sifted
and examined.</p>
                  <p>Written Orations <hi>appear flat in</hi> Pleading.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Orations</hi> made for the <hi>Barr,</hi> when
the Action is away, appear in <hi>Reading</hi> insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Written Orations</hi> Repetition is justly
condemned.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>Pleadings,</hi> by the help of Action,
and by some change in the <hi>Pleader,</hi> Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
becomes Amplification.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Written Orations</hi> Disjunctives do ill;
as, <hi>I came, I found him, I asked him:</hi> for
they seem superfluous, and but one thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not distinguished by Action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:54911:62"/>
But in <hi>Pleadings</hi> 'tis Amplification; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that which is but one thing, is made
to seem many.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Pleadings,</hi> that which is <hi>Judicial</hi>
ought to be more accurate, than that which
is <hi>before the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And an <hi>Oration to the people</hi> ought to be
more accommodate to Action, than a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of <hi>Judicial Orations,</hi> that ought to
be more accurate, which is uttered to <hi>few</hi>
Judges; and that ought to be more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
to Action, which is uttered to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
As in a <hi>Picture,</hi> the farther he stands
off that beholds it, the less need there is
that the Colours be fine: so in <hi>Orations,</hi> the
farther the Hearer stands off, the less need
there is for his <hi>Oration</hi> to be Elegant.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Demonstrative Orations</hi> are most

                     <p>Of the parts of an Oration, and their Order.</p>

                  <p>THe necessary <hi>Parts</hi> of an <hi>Oration</hi> are
but two; <hi>Propositions,</hi> and <hi>Proof;</hi>
which are as it were the <hi>Probleme,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> is the explication, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of the Matter to be <hi>proved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Proof</hi> is the <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Proem.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe <hi>Proem</hi> is the Beginning of an <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and, as it were, the preparing
of the way before one enter into it.</p>
                  <p>In some kinds of <hi>Orations</hi> it resembles the
<hi>Prelude</hi> of <hi>Musicians,</hi> who first play what
they list, and afterwards the Tune they
intended.</p>
                  <p>In other kinds it resembles the <hi>Prologue</hi>
of a <hi>Play,</hi> that contains the Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proems</hi> of the first sort, are most proper
for <hi>Demonstrative Orations;</hi> in which a
Man is free to fore-tell, or not, what points
he will insist upon; and for the most part
'tis better not: because when a Man has not
obliged himself to a certain matter, <hi>Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
will seem <hi>Variety:</hi> but if he have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
himself, <hi>Variety</hi> will be accounted
<hi>Digression.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Demonstratives</hi> the matter of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em</hi>
consisteth in the <hi>Praise</hi> or <hi>Dispraise</hi> of
some <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Custom,</hi> or in <hi>Exhortation,</hi> or
<hi>Dehortation;</hi> or in something that serves to
incline the Hearer to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proems</hi> of the second kind are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for <hi>Judicial Orations.</hi> For as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:54911:63"/>
in a <hi>Dramatick,</hi> and the <hi>Exordium</hi> in
an <hi>Epique</hi> Poem, setteth first in few words
the Argument of the Poem: so in a <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Oration</hi> the <hi>Orator</hi> ought to exhibit a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of his <hi>Oration,</hi> that the mind of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
may not be suspended, and for want
of fore-sight, err or wander.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever else belongs to a <hi>Proem,</hi> is
drawn from one of these four; From the
<hi>Speaker,</hi> From the <hi>Adversary,</hi> From the <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
or from the <hi>Matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Speaker</hi> and <hi>Adversary</hi> are drawn
into <hi>Proems</hi> such Criminations and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as belong not to the cause.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Defendant</hi> 'tis necessary in the
Proem to answer to the accusations of his
<hi>Adversary;</hi> that those being cleared, he
may have a more favourable entrance to
the rest of his <hi>Oration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to the <hi>Plaintife</hi> 'tis better to cast his
Criminations all into the <hi>Epilogue,</hi> that the
Judge may the more easily remember them.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Hearer</hi> and from the <hi>Matter</hi> are
drawn into the <hi>Proem</hi> such things as serve
to make the <hi>Hearer</hi> favourable, or angry;
attentive, or nor attentive, as need shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Hearers</hi> use to be attentive to <hi>persons</hi>
that are reputed <hi>good;</hi> to things that are of
<hi>great Consequence,</hi> or that <hi>concern thomselves,</hi>
or that are <hi>strange,</hi> or that <hi>delight.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:54911:64"/>
But to make the <hi>Hearer</hi> attentive, is not
the part of the <hi>proeme</hi> only, but of any other
part of the <hi>Oration,</hi> and rather of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part, than of the <hi>proeme.</hi> For the <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
is every where more remiss than in the
beginning. And therefore wheresoever
there is need, the <hi>Orator</hi> must make appear
both the <hi>probity</hi> of his own <hi>person,</hi> and that
the <hi>matter</hi> in hand is of <hi>great Consequence;</hi>
or that it concerns the <hi>Hearer;</hi> or that it is
<hi>new;</hi> or that it is <hi>delightful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that will have the <hi>Hearer</hi> attentive to
him, but not to the <hi>Cause,</hi> must on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side make it seem that the <hi>matter</hi> is a
<hi>trifle,</hi> without relation to the <hi>Hearer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and <hi>tedious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Hearer</hi> may be favourable to the
<hi>Speaker,</hi> one of two things is required; that
he <hi>love</hi> him, or that he <hi>pity</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Demonstrative Orations,</hi> he that <hi>praises</hi>
shall have the <hi>Hearer</hi> favourable if he think
himself, or his own manners, or course of
life, or any thing he loves, comprehended
in the same <hi>praise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the contrary, he that <hi>dispraises,</hi> shall
be heard favourably, if the <hi>Hearer</hi> find his
<hi>Enemies,</hi> or <hi>their courses,</hi> or any thing he
<hi>hates,</hi> involv'd in the same <hi>dispraise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proeme</hi> of a <hi>Deliberative Oration</hi> is

                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:54911:65"/>
6. <hi>A Sixth from the</hi> Comprehension of the
Accuser; <hi>as,</hi> What I have done, the Accuser
has done the same; <hi>or his</hi> Father, Kinsman, <hi>or</hi>
Friend.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>From the</hi> Comprehension of those that
are in Reputation; <hi>as,</hi> What I did, such, and
such have done the same, who nevertheless are
good Men.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>From</hi> Comparison <hi>with such as have
been</hi> falsly accused, <hi>or</hi> wrongfully suspected,
<hi>and nevertheless</hi> found upright.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>From</hi> Recrimination; <hi>as,</hi> The Accuser
is a man of ill life, and therefore not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>From that</hi> the Judgment belongs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

                  <p>12. A Twelfth, which is common both
to <hi>Crimination</hi> and <hi>Purgation,</hi> and is taken
from <hi>some sign;</hi> as Teucer <hi>is not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
because his Mother was</hi> Priam's <hi>Sister.</hi>
On the other side, Teucer <hi>is to be believed,
because his Father was</hi> Priam's <hi>Enemy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. A Thirteenth, proper to <hi>Crimination</hi>
only, from <hi>praise and dispraise mixt;</hi> as, To
praise small things, and blame great ones;
or to praise in many words, and blame with
effectual ones; or to praise many things
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54911:65"/>
that are good, and then add one evil, but a
great one.</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>A Fourteenth, comming both to</hi> Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<hi>and</hi> Purgation, <hi>is taken from the</hi>
interpretation of the fact: <hi>for he that</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<hi>himself</hi> interpreteth the fact <hi>always in
the best sense; and he that</hi> Criminates, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in the worst; as when</hi> Vlysses <hi>said,</hi>
Diomedes chose him for his Companion, as the
most able of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> to aid him in his
exploit: <hi>but his</hi> Adversary <hi>said,</hi> He chose
him for his cowardize, as the most unlikely to
share with him in the Honour.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Narration.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe <hi>Narration</hi> is not always continued
and of one Piece; but sometimes, as
in <hi>Demonstratives,</hi> interrupted, and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
through the whole <hi>Oration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For there being in a <hi>Narration</hi> something
that falls not under Art; as namely, the
Actions themselves, which the <hi>Orator</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth
not; he must therefore bring in the
<hi>Narration</hi> of them where he best may. As
for Example, if being to praise a Man, you
would make a <hi>Narration</hi> of all his Acts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the beginning, and without
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54911:66"/>
interruption, you will find it necessary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to repeat the same Acts again,
while from some of them you praise his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and from others his Wisdom; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
your <hi>Oration</hi> shall have less variety, and
shall less please.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not necessary always that the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
be short. The true <hi>measure</hi> of it must
be taken from the <hi>matter</hi> that is to be laid
open.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Narration,</hi> as oft as may be, 'tis
good to insert somewhat commendable in
ones self, and blameable in ones Adversary:
As, <hi>I advised him, but he would take no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Narrations,</hi> a Man is to leave out what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
breeds compassion, indignation in the
Hearer besides the purpose; as <hi>Vlysses</hi> in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
relating his Travels to <hi>Alcinous,</hi> to
move compassion in him, is so long in it, that
it consists of divers Books: but when he
comes home, tells the same to his Wife in
thirty Verses, leaving out what might make
her sad.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Narration</hi> ought also to be in such
words as argue the <hi>Manners;</hi> that is, some
virtuous or vicious habit in him of whom
we speak, although it be not exprest; <hi>As,
setting his Arms a kenbold, he answered, &amp;c.</hi>
by which is insinuated the Pride of him
that so answered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:54911:66"/>
In an <hi>Oration</hi> a Man does better to shew
his affection than his Judgment: this is,
'Tis better to say, <hi>I like this;</hi> than to say,
<hi>This is</hi> better. For by the one you would
seem <hi>wise,</hi> by the other <hi>good.</hi> But <hi>favour</hi>
follows <hi>Goodness;</hi> whereas <hi>Wisdom</hi> procures
<hi>Envy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if this Affection seem incredible, then
either a reason must be rendered, as did <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigone.</hi>
For when she had said, <hi>She loved
her Brother better than her Husband, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi>
she added, <hi>for Husband and Children
I may have more; but another Brother I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
my Parents being both dead.</hi> Or else a
Man must use this form of speaking; <hi>I know
this affection of mine seems strange to you;
but nevertheless it is such.</hi> For 'tis not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believed, that any Man has a mind to do
any thing that is not for his own good.</p>
                  <p>Besides in a <hi>Narration,</hi> not only the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
themselves; but the Passions, and
signs that accompany them, are to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p>And in his <hi>Narration</hi> a Man should make
himself and his Adversary be considered for
such, and such, as soon, and as covertly as
he can.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Narration</hi> may have need sometimes
not to be in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Deliberative Orations;</hi> that is, where
soever the question is of things to come; a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54911:67"/>
                     <hi>Narration,</hi> which is always of things past,
has no place: and yet things past may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted,
that Men may <hi>Deliberate</hi> better of
the future: But that is not as <hi>Narration,</hi> but
<hi>Proof;</hi> for 'tis <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may also be <hi>Narration</hi> in <hi>Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
in that part where <hi>Crimination</hi> and

                     <p>Of Proof, or Confirmation, and Refutation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PRoofs</hi> are to be applyed to something
Controverted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Controversie in</hi> Judicial Orations is,
Whether it has been done; whether it has been
hurtful; whether the matter be so great, and
whether it be Just, or no.</p>
                  <p>In a question of <hi>Fact,</hi> one of the Parties
of necessity is faulty (for ignorance of the
<hi>Fact</hi> is no excuse) and therefore the <hi>Fact</hi> is
chiefly to be insisted on.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Demonstratives,</hi> the <hi>Fact</hi> for the most
part is supposed: but the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>profit</hi>
of the <hi>Fact</hi> are to be <hi>proved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Deliberatives,</hi> the question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the thing be <hi>like to be, or likely to be so
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54911:67"/>
Great;</hi> or whether it be <hi>Just;</hi> or whether
it be <hi>profitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the application of the <hi>proof</hi> to the
question, a Man ought to observe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Adversary have lyed in any point
without the Cause. For 'tis a sign he does
the same in the Cause.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proofs</hi> themselves are either <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
or <hi>Enthymemes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Deliberative Oration,</hi> because 'tis of
things to come, requireth rather <hi>Examples,</hi>
than <hi>Enthymemes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a <hi>Judicial Oration,</hi> being of things
past, which have a necessity in them, and
may be concluded <hi>Syllogistically,</hi> requireth
rather <hi>Enthymemes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Enthymemes</hi> ought not to come too thick
together: for they hinder one anothers force
by confounding the Hearer.</p>
                  <p>Nor ought a Man endeavour to <hi>prove</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing by <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> least like some <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi>
he collect what is <hi>known,</hi> from
what is <hi>less known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor ought a Man to use <hi>Enthymemes,</hi>
when he would move the Hearer to some
affection: For seeing divers Motions do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
destroy or weaken one another, he
will lose either the <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> or the <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
that he would move.</p>
                  <p>For the same reason, a Man ought not to
use <hi>Enthymemes</hi> when he would express <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:54911:68"/>
But whether he would move <hi>affection,</hi>
or insinuate his <hi>Manners,</hi> he may withal
use <hi>Sentences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Deliberative Oration</hi> is more difficult
than a <hi>Judicial,</hi> because 'tis of the <hi>future,</hi>
whereas a <hi>Judicial</hi> is of that which is <hi>past,</hi>
and that consequently may be known; and
because it has <hi>principles,</hi> namely the <hi>Law;</hi>
and it is easier to <hi>prove</hi> from <hi>principles,</hi> than
without.</p>
                  <p>Besides, a <hi>Deliberative Oration</hi> wants those
helps of <hi>turning to the Adversary,</hi> of <hi>speaking
of himself;</hi> of <hi>raising passion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He therefore that wants matter in a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberative
Oration,</hi> let him bring in some <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
to <hi>praise</hi> or <hi>dispraise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in <hi>Demonstratives</hi> he that has nothing
to say in <hi>commendation</hi> or <hi>discommendation</hi> of
the <hi>principal party,</hi> let him <hi>praise</hi> or <hi>dispraise</hi>
some body else, as his <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Kinsman,</hi>
or the very <hi>vertues</hi> or <hi>vices</hi> themselves.</p>
                  <p>He that wants not <hi>Proofs,</hi> let him not
only <hi>prove</hi> strongly, but also insinuate his
<hi>Manners:</hi> but he that has no <hi>proof,</hi> let him
nevertheless insinuate his <hi>Manners.</hi> For a
<hi>good man</hi> is as acceptable, as an exact <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Proofs,</hi> those that <hi>lead to an absurdity,</hi>
please better than those that are <hi>direct</hi> or
<hi>ostensive;</hi> because from the comparison of
Contraries, namely, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falsity,</hi> the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54911:68"/>
force of the <hi>Syllogisme</hi> does the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Confutation</hi> is also a part of <hi>proof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he that speaks first, puts it after his
own <hi>proofs,</hi> unless the Controversie contain
many and different matters. And he that
speaks last, puts it before.</p>
                  <p>For 'tis necessary to make way for his
own <hi>Oration,</hi> by removing the Objections
of him that spake before. For the mind ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors
both the <hi>Man,</hi> and his <hi>Oration,</hi> that is
damned before hand.</p>
                  <p>If a Man desire his <hi>Manners</hi> should appear
well, (least speaking of himself he become
odious, or troublesome, or obnoxious to
obtrectation; or speaking of another, he
seem contumelious, or scurrilous) let him
introduce another person.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, least he cloy his Hearer with
<hi>Enthymemes,</hi> let him vary them sometimes
with <hi>Sentences;</hi> but such as have the same
force. As here is an <hi>Enthymeme. If it be
then the best time to make peace when the best
conditions of peace may be had, than the time
is now, while our Fortune is entire.</hi> And
this is a <hi>Sentence</hi> of equal force to it. <hi>Wise
Men make peace, while their Fortune is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</hi>

                  <p>THe times wherein 'tis fit to ask ones

                  <p>1. The first is, when of two Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that conclude an Absurdity, he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
uttered one; and we would by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation</hi>
draw him to confess the other.</p>
                  <p>2. The Second, when of two Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that conclude an Absurdity, one is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
of it self, and the other likely to be
fetch'd out by a <hi>question;</hi> then the <hi>Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>

Conclusion is presently to be inferr'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
adding that Proposition which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>
                  <p>3. The third, when a Man would make
appear that his Adversary does contradict
himself.</p>
                  <p>4. The Fourth, when a Man would take
from his Adversary such shifts as these, <hi>In
some sort 'tis so; In some sort 'tis not so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of these Cases 'tis not fit to <hi>Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi>

               <head>THE
ART
OF
RHETORICK.</head>
               <p>RHetorick is an Art of speaking
finely.</p>
               <p>It hath two parts.</p>
               <p>1. Garnishing of speech, called
<hi>Elocution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Garnishing of the manner of utterance
called <hi>Pronunciation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Garnishing of speech is the first part of
Rhetorick, whereby the speech it self is
beautified and made fine.</p>
               <p>It is either,</p>
               <p>1. The fine manner of words, called a
Trope, or,</p>
               <p>2. The fine shape or frame of speech,
called a Figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:54911:72"/>
The fine manner of words is a garnishing
of Speech, whereby one word is drawn
from his first proper signification, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as in this sentence: <hi>Sin lyeth at the
door:</hi> where <hi>Sin</hi> is put for the punishment
of sin adjoyned unto it: <hi>Lyeth at the door</hi>
signifieth at hand; as that which lyeth at
the Door, is ready to be brought in.</p>
               <p>This changing of words was first found
out by necessity, for the want of words;
afterward confirmed by Delight, because
such words are pleasant and gracious to the
ear. Therefore this change of signification
must be shamefac'd, and, as it were, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
that it may seem rather to be led by
the hand to another signification, to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by force unto the same: yet sometimes
this fine manner of <hi>Speech</hi> swerveth from
this perfection, and then it is,</p>
               <p>Either</p>
               <p>1. The abuse of this fine Speech, called
<hi>Katachresis,</hi> or</p>
               <p>2. The excess of this fineness, call'd
<hi>Hyperbole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be not too just, nor too wicked: <hi>which
speech, although it seem very hard, yet
it doth not, without some fineness of Speech,
utter thus much,</hi> That one seek not a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
beyond the Law of God; and that when
none can live without all sin, yet that they
take heed that sin bear not Dominion over
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54911:72"/>
them, <hi>As,</hi> My Tears are my Meat day and
night. Those that hate me are mo in number,
than the Hairs of my Head. <hi>Both which do
utter by an express of Speech, a great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and a great number of Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The abuse of Speech, is, when the change
of Speech is hard, strange, and unwonted,
as in the first example.</p>
               <p>The excess of Speech is, when the change
of signification is very high and lofty, as in
the second Example, and <hi>Ps.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
               <p>But the excellency, or fineness of Words,
or Tropes, is most excellent, when divers
are,</p>
               <p>Shut up in one; or,</p>
               <p>Continued in many.</p>
               <p>An Example of the first sort is in the 2
<hi>Kings: I pray thee, let me have a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thy Spirit:</hi> where by <hi>Spirit,</hi> is meant
the gift of the Spirit; and by <hi>thy Spirit,</hi> the
gift of the Spirit like to thine.</p>
               <p>The continuance of Tropes, called an
Allegorie, is, when one kind of Trope is
so continued; as, look with what kind of
matter it be begun, with the same it be
ended. So in the 23 <hi>Psal. The care of God
towards his Church, is set forth in the words
proper to a Shepherd.</hi> So in the whole Book
of <hi>Canticles, the sweet conference of Christ and
his Church,</hi> is set down by the words proper
to the <hi>Husband and</hi> the Wife. So old Age
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54911:73"/>
is set down by this garnishing <hi>of Speech,</hi>
Eccles. 12. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of the properties of a fine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of words, called a Trope.</p>
               <p>Now the divers sorts do follow.</p>
               <p>They are those which note out,</p>
               <p>1. No Comparison, and are with some
Comparison; or,</p>
               <p>2. No respect of Division, or some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
               <p>The first is double:</p>
               <p>1. The change of name, called a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The mocking speech, called an
<hi>Ironie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The change of name, is where the name
of a thing, is put for the name of a thing
agreeing with it.</p>
               <p>It is double,</p>
               <p>1. When the cause is put for the thing
caused, and contrariwise,</p>
               <p>2. When the thing to which any
thing is adjoyned, is put for the thing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned;
and contrariwise.</p>
               <p>The change of name of the cause, is
when,</p>
               <p>Either the name of the Maker, or the
name of the Matter, is put for the thing
made.</p>
               <p>Of the Maker, when the finder out, or
the Author of the thing, or the instrument
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54911:73"/>
whereby the thing is done, is put for the
thing made. So <hi>Moses</hi> is put for his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
so Love is put for Liberality, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
Benefits, the fruit of Love: so Faith
the Cause, is put for Religious serving of
God, the thing caused. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. So the
tongue, the instrument of speech, is put
for the Speech it self. Rule thy Tongue,
<hi>James</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Matter:</hi> Thou art Dust, and to
Dust shalt thou return; <hi>that is,</hi> one made of
Dust.</p>
               <p>Now on the other side, when the thing
caused, or the effect is put for any of these
causes. <hi>So the Gospel of God is called the
Power of God to Salvation;</hi> That is, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of the power of God. <hi>So Love
is said to be bountiful;</hi> because it causeth one
to be bountiful. S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The Bread
that we break, is it not in the Communion of
the Body and Blood of Christ?</hi> That is, an
instrument of the Communion of the Body
of Christ. <hi>So, the Body is said to be an
earthly Tabernacle:</hi> That is, a Tabernacle
made of Earth.</p>
               <p>The change of Name, or <hi>Metonymie,</hi>
where the Subject, or that which hath any
thing adjoyned, is put for the thing adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or adjoynt. So the place is put for
those, or that in the place: <hi>Set thine House
in an order:</hi> That is, thy Houshold matters.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54911:74"/>
                  <hi>It shall be easier for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorra:
that is, the People in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorra.</hi>
So <hi>Moses Chair</hi> is put for the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> taught
in <hi>Moses Chair.</hi> So, <hi>all</hi> Jericho <hi>and</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
<hi>came out:</hi> That is, all the Men in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo</hi>
and <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> So, before, <hi>Sin</hi> was
put for the punishment of <hi>Sin: Let his Blood
rest upon us and our Children:</hi> That is the
punishment which shall follow his Death.
So Christ said, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> That is, a
sign or Sacrament of my Body. <hi>This Wine
is the New Testament in my Blood;</hi> That is,
a Sign or Seal of the New Testament in my
Blood. So <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>He saw the Spirit
descending in the likeness of a Dove:</hi> That
is, the sign of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>On the other side, the Adjunct is put for
the thing to which it is adjoyned. As Christ
is called <hi>our hope. 1 Tti.</hi> That is, on whom
our hope did depend: So, <hi>we are justified
by Faith,</hi> That is, by Christ, applyed by
Faith: So, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi>
That is, those things to which it is adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>Hope for the things hoped for,</hi> Rom. 8.
28. So in the Epist. to the <hi>Eph. The dayes
are evil:</hi> That is, the Manner, Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Deeds of Men in the dayes.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of the <hi>Metonymie,</hi> or change of
name.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the Mocking speech, or
<hi>Ironie.</hi>
               </p>
               <div n="2" type="chapter">
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:54911:74"/>
                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>THe mocking Trope is, when one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is signified by another, as God
said, <hi>Man is like to one of us.</hi> So Christ
saith, <hi>sleep on;</hi> and yet by and by, <hi>Arise,
let us go:</hi> so <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>you are Wise, and I
am a Fool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Trope is perceived, either by the
contrariety of the Matter, or the Manner of
utterance, or both: so <hi>Elias</hi> said to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of <hi>Baal, Cry a loud,</hi> &amp;c. So the Jews
said unto Christ; <hi>Hail, King of the Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto appertaineth the passing by a
thing, which yet with a certain elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
noteth it: so <hi>Philemon, 19. That I
say not, thou owest thy self unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the fineness of words which
respect no division.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth that which respecteth
division, called <hi>Synechdoche.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Synechdoche</hi> is when the name of the
whole is given to the part; or the name of
the part to the whole.</p>
                  <p>And it is double;</p>
                  <p>1. When the whole is put for the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and contrarily.</p>
                  <p>2. When the General, or whole kind is
put for the Special, or contrarily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:54911:75"/>
So S. <hi>John, Not only for our Sins, but for
the Sins of the whole World.</hi> So Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
a Member of Goodness, is put for all
goodness: so Unrighteousness, is put for all
manner of Sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Examples of the second sort, as these:
So</hi> Israel is put for those of Juda sometimes:
<hi>So</hi> Nations for the Heathen: A Minister of
Christ, for an Apostle of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. A
Minister put for a distributer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, one sort or special is
put for the whole sort, or general, in the
Examples following. In the Lords Prayer,
<hi>Bread,</hi> one help of life, is put for all helps:
<hi>This day,</hi> one time, for all times: so <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
saith. <hi>The thing of the day in his day;</hi>
That is, the thing of the time, in his time.</p>
                  <p>So sometimes less is spoken, and yet more
is understood; which is called Diminution,
or <hi>Meiosis:</hi> As <hi>James</hi> saith, to him <hi>that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
how to do well, and doth not, it is Sin:</hi>
That is, a great sin. So our Saviour Christ
saith, <hi>If they had not known, they had had no
Sin:</hi> That is, no such great Sin as they have
now. Likewise the denial by Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
so <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Receive my Words, and
not Silver:</hi> That is, my words rather than
Silver: so <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I was sent to Preach,
and not to Baptise:</hi> That is, not so much to
Baptise, as to Preach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:54911:75"/>
Hitherto of the fineness of Words, which
note out no Comparison. Now followeth
the fineness of words which noteth out
Comparison, called a <hi>Metaphor.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <p>A <hi>Metaphor</hi> is when the like is signified
by the like: as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> The Apostle
saith, <hi>Doctrine must be tryed by Fire;</hi> That
is, the evidence of the Word, Spirit, <hi>trying
Doctrine,</hi> as Fire doth Metals. So Christ
is said to <hi>Baptize with Fire:</hi> where <hi>Fire</hi> is
put for the power of the Holy Ghost, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
as Fire: so Christ saith, <hi>None shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Kingdom of God, but he that is
Born of the Holy Ghost and Water:</hi> so <hi>Paul</hi>
calleth himself the Father of the <hi>Corinths,</hi>
who said, <hi>That he begat them in Christ:</hi> so
he calleth <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> his Natural
Sons in the Faith.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of a Trope, or Garnishing of
Speech in one word, where the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
is most usual; then the change
of Name; then the <hi>Synechdoche;</hi> and
last of all, the <hi>Ironie.</hi> Now followeth
the fine Frame or shape of speech;
called a <hi>Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Figure is a Garnishing of Speech;
wherein the course of the same is changed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54911:76"/>
from the more simple and plain manner of
speaking, unto that which is more full of
Excellency and Grace. For as in the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Words, or a Trope, Words are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
asunder by themselves: so in the
fine shape or frame of Speech or a Figure,
the apt and pleasant joyning together of
many Words is noted.</p>
                  <p>The Garnishing of the Shape of Speech
or a Figure, is Garnishing of Speech in
Words, or in a Sentence.</p>
                  <p>The Garnishing of Speech in Words, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Figura dictionis,</hi> is wherein the Speech
is Garnished by the pleasant and sweet
sound of Words joyned together.</p>
                  <p>This is either,</p>
                  <p>1. In the measure of sounds; or</p>
                  <p>2. In the repetition of sounds.</p>
                  <p>The measure of sounds is belonging ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to,</p>
                  <p>1. Poets, with us called Rhymers; or,</p>
                  <p>2. Orators, with us called Eloquent Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                  <p>The first is the measure of sounds by
certain and continual spaces: And it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
                  <p>1. Rhyme; or,</p>
                  <p>2. Verse.</p>
                  <p>Rhyme is the first sort, containing a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
measure of Syllables ending alike, and
these in the Mother Tongues are most
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54911:76"/>
fit for Psalms, Songs, or Sonnets.</p>
                  <p>Verses are the second sort, containing
certain Feet fitly placed.</p>
                  <p>A Foot is a measure framed by the length
and shortness of Syllables: For the several
sorts whereof, as also of the verses of them,
because we have no worthy examples in our
English Tongue, we judge the large han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
of them should be more curious than
necessary.</p>
                  <p>The measure of sounds belonging to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
is that which, as it is not uncertain,
so it differeth altogether from rhime and
verse, and is very changeable with it self.
Therefore in that eloquent Speech you must
altogether leave rhime and verse, unless you
alledge it for Authority and Pleasure.</p>
                  <p>In the Beginning of the Sentence little
care is to be had, in the middle least of all,
and in the end chiefest regard is to be had,
because the fall of the Sentence is most
marked, and therefore lest it fall out to be
harsh and unpleasant both to the mind and
ear, there must be most variety and change.</p>
                  <p>Now this change must not be above six
Syllables from the end, and that must be set
down in feet of two Syllables.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of garnishing of speech
by the measure of sounds, rather to give
some taste of the same to the Readers, than
to draw any to the curious and unnecessary
practise of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:54911:77"/>
Now followeth the repeating of sounds.</p>

               <div n="4" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                  <p>REpetition of sounds is either of the
<hi>Like,</hi> or the <hi>Vnlike</hi> sound.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Like,</hi> is either <hi>continued</hi> to the
end of, or <hi>broken</hi> off from the same, or a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>
sentence.</p>
                  <p>Continued to the end of the same sentence
is, when the same sound is repeated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing coming between, except a
Parenthesis; that is, something put in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which, notwithstanding the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

same sound, as Rom. 1. <hi>As Vnrighteousness,
Fornication, Wickedness.</hi> And in the prayer
of Christ, <hi>My God, my God. From Men by
thine hand, O Lord, from Men,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 17.</p>
                  <p>Continued in a diverse Sentence is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Redoubling, called <hi>Anadyplosis;</hi> or a
pleasant climing, called <hi>Clymax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Redoubling is when the same sound is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in the end of the former Sentence,
and the beginning of the Sentence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
As, Psal. 9. 8. <hi>The Lord also will be a

Psal. 81. 14. <hi>For this God is our God.</hi> But

                  <p>In the <hi>Beginning</hi> it is called <hi>Anaphora,</hi> a

                  <p>GArnishing of the frame of speech in a
sentence, is a Garnishing of the shape
of speech, or a figure; which for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
moving of affections, doth after a sort
beautifie the sense and very meaning of a
sentence. Because it hath in it a certain
manly Majesty, which far surpasseth the soft
delicacy or dainties of the former figures.</p>
                  <p>It is either the Garnishing of speech <hi>Alone;</hi>
or <hi>with others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Garnishing of speech alone, is
when as the sentence is Garnished without
speech had to other. And it is either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the <hi>Matter;</hi> or of the <hi>Person.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In regard of the <hi>Matter,</hi> it is either</p>
                  <p>1. A crying out, called <hi>Exclamation;</hi> or</p>
                  <p>2. A pulling or calling back of himself,
called <hi>Revocation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A crying out or <hi>Exclamation</hi> is the first,
which is set forth by a word of calling out:
Sometimes of wonder, As, Rom. 8. <hi>O the
depth of the Judgments of God!</hi> Psal. 8. <hi>O
Lord, how excellent is thy Name!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes of pity; also these words, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
Alas, Oh,</hi> be signs of this figure: As,
<hi>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which stonest the
Prophets.</hi> Sometimes of desperation; As,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54911:79"/>
                     <hi>My Sin is greater than can be forgiven. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
thou drivest me out, &amp;c.</hi> Sometimes of
wishing: As, <hi>O Lord of Hosts, how amiable
are thy Tabernacles?</hi> Sometimes of disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
As, Rom. 7. in the end, <hi>O miserable
wretch that I am, who shall deliver me from
this Body of Sin?</hi> Sometimes of mocking:
as they which said to our Saviour Christ,
<hi>Ah, thou that, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sometimes of</hi> cursing <hi>and</hi> detestation, <hi>as in</hi>
David, Let their Table be made a Snare, and
bow down their Back always.</p>
                  <p>Also when this Figure is used in the end
of a Sentence, it is called a shooting out
of the Voice, or <hi>Epiphonema;</hi> as when the
sins of <hi>Jezabel</hi> were spoken against, this is
added at the end, <hi>Seemed it a little to her
to do thus and thus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So after the high setting forth of the
Name of God, <hi>David</hi> shutteth up his praise
with this: <hi>Blessed be his glorious Name, and
let all the Earth be filled with his Glory.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
here is used a certain liberty of speech,
wherein is a kind of secret crying out: As
<hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 3. saith: <hi>Ye Men of Israel, hear
these words.</hi> And Paul, 1 Cor. 11. <hi>Would to
God you could suffer a little my foolishness,
and indeed ye suffer me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much of crying out.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the Figure of calling
back, or <hi>Revocation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:54911:80"/>
                     <hi>Revocation</hi> is when any thing is called
back, and it is as it were a cooling and
quenching of the heat of the exclamation
that went before.</p>
                  <p>And this is either a <hi>Correction</hi> of ones
self, called <hi>Epanorthrosis;</hi> a <hi>holding</hi> of ones
<hi>peace,</hi> called <hi>Aposiopesis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epanorthrosis</hi> is correction, when some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is called back that went before: as
<hi>Paul</hi> correcteth his doubtfulness of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi>'s
belief, when he saith, <hi>Believest thou
King Agrippa, I know thou believest. So,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. <hi>I laboured more abundantly than
they all, yet not I,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>keeping of silence</hi> or <hi>Aposiopesis</hi> is, when
the course of the sentence bygon is so stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as thereby some part of the sentence
not being uttered, may be understood. So
our Saviour Christ saith, <hi>My Soul is heavy:
what shall I say?</hi> John 12. 27.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of a Figure Garnishing the
speech alone in regard of the matter.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the Garnishing of the
speech alone in regard of the person.</p>

                  <p>GArnishing of the speech alone in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

                  <p>Either in turning to the person, called

                  <p>
                     <hi>Apostrophe</hi> or turning to the person, is
when the speech is turned to another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
than the speech appointed did intend
or require. And this <hi>Apostrophe</hi> or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is diversly seen, according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of persons. Sometimes it turneth to a
Mans person; As <hi>David</hi> in the 6 <hi>Psalm,</hi>
where having gathered arguments of his
safety, turneth hastily to the wicked, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Away from me, all ye workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for the Lord hath heard the Voice of my
petition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes from a Man to God, as <hi>Ps. 3.
David</hi> being dismayed with the number of
his Enemies, turneth himself to God, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>But thou art my Buckler,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes to unreasonable Creatures
without sense. <hi>Esai.</hi> 1. &amp; <hi>Esai.</hi> 20. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prosopopoeia</hi> or a feigning of the person, is
whereby we do feign another person speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our speech; and it is double; <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
and <hi>Perfect.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:54911:81"/>
                     <hi>Imperfect</hi> is when the speech of another
person is set down lightly and indirectly,
As in the <hi>Psal. 10. David,</hi> bringeth in the
wicked, <hi>Who say unto my Soul, Fly as the
Bird unto yonder hill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A perfect <hi>Prosopopoeia</hi> is when the whole
feigning of the person is set down in our
speech, with a fit entring into the same,
and a leaving it off. So <hi>Wisd. Pro.</hi> 8. Where

                  <p>That of <hi>Asking,</hi> is either in <hi>Deliberation;</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Deliberation</hi> is when we do ever now and
then ask, as it were, reasons of our consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
whereby the mind of the hearers
wavering in doubt, doth set down some
great thing.</p>
                  <p>This deliberation is either in <hi>Doubting;</hi>
or in <hi>Communication.</hi>

                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:54911:81"/>
A <hi>Doubting</hi> is a deliberating with our
selves, as <hi>Paul. 1. Phil.</hi> 22. doubting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were better to dye than to live, he
Garnisheth his speech on this manner: <hi>For
I am greatly in doubt on both sides, desiring to
be loosed, and to be with Christ, which is best
of all: nevertheless, to abide in the Flesh is
more needful for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Communication is a deliberation with
others. <hi>Gal. 3. 1, 2. O foolish Galatians, who
hath bewitched you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And hitherto of the Figure of speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two, called Deliberation.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the Figure of speech
between two, called the preventing
of an Objection, or occupation.</p>
                  <p>Occupation is when we do bring an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and yield an answer unto it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this speech between two in the first
part, is called the Setting down of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
or Occupation. In the latter part,
an Answering of the Objection, or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
as Rom. 6. <hi>What shall we say then?
Shall we continue still in sin that grace may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound?</hi>
In which words is set down the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
the Answering in these words, <hi>God
forbid.</hi> And here this must be marked, that
the Objection is many times wanting, which
must be wisely supplyed by considering the
occasion and answer of it: As, 1 <hi>Tim. 5.
They will Marry, having condemnation.</hi> Now
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54911:82"/>
lest any might say, what, for Marrying?
He answereth: No, <hi>For denying their first
Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the Figures of <hi>Asking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now followeth the Figures of Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>They are either in <hi>Suffering</hi> of a deed,
called <hi>Permission;</hi> or, <hi>Granting</hi> of an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
called <hi>Concession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suffering</hi> of a deed or permission is, when
mockingly we give liberty to any deed;
being never so filthy, as Rev. <hi>Let him that

be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concession or granting of an argument is,
when an argument is mockingly yielded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

               <hi>SOphistry</hi> is the feigned art of <hi>Enleches,</hi>
or coloured reasons.</p>
            <p>A colourable reason, or <hi>Elench,</hi> is a
shew of reason to deceive withal.</p>
            <p>It is either when the deceit lyeth in the
<hi>Words;</hi> or in the default of Logick, called
a <hi>Sophism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In words is, either when the deceit lyeth
in <hi>one word;</hi> or in <hi>Words joyned</hi> together. If

            </p>
            <p>In <hi>one word,</hi> is either the <hi>darkness</hi> of a

            <p>The <hi>darkness</hi> of a word, or an insolencie
deceiveth, when by a reason the meaning is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54911:83"/>
not understood, whether the strangeness be
through the oldness, newness, or swelling
vanity of the words; and of the last sort,
is that spoken of in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p>By this fallacie the Papists conclude, the
Fathers to be on their side, for deserving by
good works.</p>
            <p>Whosoever saith Mans merits are Crowned,
they say Mans works do deserve.</p>
            <p>But the Fathers say, Mans merits are
Crowned.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Fathers say, Mans works do
deserve.</p>
            <p>Where <hi>Merits</hi> is an old word, put for
any works done under the hope of reward
whether it come by desart, or freedom of
promise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doubtfulness</hi> of a word, <hi>Likeness</hi> of name,
is either called <hi>Homonymia;</hi> or by a <hi>Trope</hi>
or fineness of speech.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Likeness</hi> of name, or <hi>Homonymia,</hi> is
when one word is given to signifie divers
things: As,</p>
            <p>He that believeth shall be saved.</p>
            <p>The Hypocrites to whom our Saviour Christ
would not commit himself, believed,</p>
            <p>Therefore they shall be saved.</p>
            <p>Where Faith doth note out both a justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Faith, and a dead Faith.</p>
            <p>Doubtfulness by a Trope, is when a word
is taken properly, which is meant figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or contrarily: As,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:54911:83"/>
That which Christ saith is true.</p>
            <p>Christ saith that Bread is his Body.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is true.</p>
            <p>Where by body is meant the Sign or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his body.</p>
            <p>Unto the first, a perfect Logician would
answer, that the Proposition is not an Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome
necessarily true, according to the Rule
of truth, because of the doubtfulness of
the old and new signification of <hi>merit.</hi> And
if the word be far worn out of use, that it
be not understood, then the answer must
be, I understand it not, or put your Axiome
in plain words.</p>
            <p>To the second, he would answer, that
the Proposition or first part, is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rule of Righteousness, because
the proper Subject and Adjunct are not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together: which <hi>hath justifying faith, or
believing sincerely, shall be saved;</hi> and then
the assumption being in the same sense infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
is false.</p>
            <p>Unto the third he would answer, that
the Assumption is not necessarily true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if the word <hi>Body</hi> be taken properly,
it is not then true that is set down: but if
it be taken figuratively, it is true, and
therefore would bid him make the Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
necessarily true, and then say, Christ
saith in proper words, <hi>It is my Body;</hi> and
then it is false.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:54911:84"/>
Hitherto of the fallacies in single words.</p>
            <p>Now of those that are joyned together.</p>
            <p>It is either <hi>Amphibolia,</hi> or the doubtfulness
of speech: or, <hi>Exposition,</hi> or unapt setting
down of the reason.</p>
            <p>The first is, when there is doubtfulness in
the frame of speech; as thus, <hi>If any obey
not our word by a Letter, note him:</hi> where
some refer <hi>by a Letter,</hi> to the first part of
the Sentence, and some to the latter, where
the signification of the word, and right
pointing doth shew, that it must be referred
to the first.</p>
            <p>The answer is, that the right and wise
placing of the Sentence is perverted.</p>
            <p>Unapt setting down of the Reason, is,
when the parts of the Question and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
intreated, is not set down in fit words: as,</p>
            <p>All sin is evil.</p>
            <p>Every Child of God doth sin.</p>
            <p>Therefore every Child of God is evil.</p>
            <p>Here the answer according to Logick, is
that the assumption doth not take the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of the proposition, but putteth in
another thing, and so it is no right Frame of
concluding, as appeareth by the definition
of the assumption.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the deceits of reason which
lye in words.</p>
            <p>Now of the default of Logick, called <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:54911:84"/>
It is either General, or Special.</p>
            <p>The General are those which cannot be
referred to any part of Logick.</p>
            <p>They are either begging of the question,
called the Petition of the principle, or brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of no proof.</p>
            <p>Begging of the Question is when nothing
is brought to prove but the Question, or
that which is doubtful: As,</p>
            <p>That Righteousness which is both by Faith
and works, doth justifie.</p>
            <p>But this Righteousness, is inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Proposition in effect is nothing
but a Question.</p>
            <p>If together with the Blood of Christ we must
make perfect satisfaction for our sins, before
we come to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Then there must be Purgatory for them that
die without perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the first is so: Ergo.</hi> Where the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
they bring is as doubtful, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as much proof as the Question.</p>
            <p>The answer is this out of the definition
of the Syllogisme, that there is no new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
invented, therefore it cannot be a
certain frame of concluding.</p>
            <p>Bragging of no proof, is when that which
is brought is too much, called <hi>Redounding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is either impertinent to another matter
called <hi>Heterogenium;</hi> or a vain repetition,
called <hi>Tautologia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:54911:85"/>
Impertinent, or not to the purpose, is
when any thing is brought for a proof,
which is nothing near to the matter in hand,
whereunto the common Proverb giveth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
<hi>I ask you of Cheese, you answer me of
Chalk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A vain repetition is, when the same thing
in effect, though not in words, is repeated;
as they that after long time of Prayer say,
<hi>Let us pray.</hi> And this fallacie our Saviour
Christ condemneth in prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and
this is a fault in Method.</p>
            <p>Special are those which may be referred
to certain parts of Logick, and they are of
two sorts.</p>
            <p>Such as are referred to the spring of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
called <hi>Invention,</hi> or to Judgment.</p>
            <p>Those referred to Invention are, when
any thing is put for a reason, which is not,
as no cause for a cause, no effect for an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and so of the rest.</p>
            <p>In the Distribution this is a proper Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
when any thing simply or generally
granted, thereby is inferred a certain respect
or special not meant nor intended: as,</p>
            <p>He that saith, there are not seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
saith true.</p>
            <p>He that saith, there are only three, saith,
there are not seven.</p>
            <p>Therefore he that saith, there are three, saith
true.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:54911:85"/>
The right answer is, that the Proposition
is not necessarily true, for there may be a
way to say, there are not seven, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
an untruth.</p>
            <p>Fallacies of judgment are those that are
referred to the judgment of one sentence,
or of more.</p>
            <p>Of one Sentence, either to the Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
of an Axiome; or to the sorts.</p>
            <p>To the Proprieties, as when a true is put
for a false, and contrarily: and Affirmative
for a Negative, and contrarily. So some take
the words of Saint <hi>John, I do not say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, that you shall not pray,</hi> for no deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
when as it doth deny to pray for that sin.</p>
            <p>To the sorts are referred, either to the
Simple, or Compound.</p>
            <p>The first when the General is taken for
the Special, and contrarily. So the Papists
by this fallacy do answer to that general
saying of <hi>Paul; We are justified by Faith
without the works of the Law.</hi> Which they
understand of works done before Faith, when
that was never called in doubt.</p>
            <p>The fallacies which are referred to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Axiome, are those which are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
either to a <hi>disjoyned,</hi> or <hi>knitting</hi> Axiome.</p>
            <p>To a <hi>disjoyned</hi> Axiome when the parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are not <hi>disjoyned:</hi> As, <hi>Solomon was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a King, or did bear Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To a <hi>Knitting</hi> Axiome is, when the parts

are not necessarily knit together, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>General which are referred to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
properties of a Syllogisme.</p>
            <p>It is either when all the parts are <hi>Denyed</hi>
or are <hi>Particular.</hi>

               <hi>All parts denyed: As,</hi>

            <p>All particular: As,</p>

namely that which cannot be taken away.</p>
            <p>The Stews in some unlawful thing.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Stews must be suffered.</p>
            <p>This is answered by the definition of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>
special syllogism, which is that hath one part
general.</p>
            <p>The special are those which are <hi>Simple, or
Compound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Simple</hi> is of two sorts.</p>
            <p>The first is <hi>more Plain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:54911:86"/>
The second <hi>less Plain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More plain is when the assumption is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
or the question is not particular: As,</p>
            <p>Every Apostle may Preach abroad:</p>
            <p>Some Apostle is not a Pope,</p>
            <p>Therefore</p>
            <p>Some Pope may not Preach abroad. <hi>Also,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every Pope is a Lord:</p>
            <p>Some Pope may give an universal licence.</p>
            <p>Therefore every Lord may give an universal
licence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Less plain</hi> hath one fallacy in common,
when the proposition is special. As,</p>
            <p>Some Player is a Rogue:</p>
            <p>Every Vagabond is Rogue,</p>
            <p>Therefore every Player is a Vagabond. <hi>Also,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Player is a Rogue:</p>
            <p>Every Vagabond is a Player.</p>
            <p>Therefore every Player is a Rogue.</p>
            <p>The fallacie of the first kind is when all
the parts be affirmative: As,</p>
            <p>All Pauls Bishops were ordained for unity.</p>
            <p>All Arch-Bishops be ordained for unity.</p>
            <p>Therefore all Arch-Bishops are Pauls Bishops.</p>
            <p>The fallacie of the second kind is when
the assumption is denyed: As,</p>
            <p>Every Puritane is a Christian.</p>
            <p>No Lord Bishop is a Puritane,</p>
            <p>Therefore no Lord Bishop is a Christian.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the fallacies referred to a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Syllogism.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:54911:87"/>
Now follow those which are referred to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
which are those which are referred either to
the <hi>Connexive,</hi> or to the <hi>disjoyned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the first sort one is when the first part or ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
is denyed, that the second or consequent may
be so likewise: As,</p>
            <p>If any Man have two Benefices, he may escape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at the Bishops hands.</p>
            <p>But he may not have two Benefices,</p>
            <p>Therefore</p>
            <p>He may not escape unpunished at the Bishops hands.</p>
            <p>The second part is affirmed, that the first may be
so also. As,</p>
            <p>If every ignorant Minister were put out of the Church,
and a Preacher in his place, we should have good order.</p>
            <p>But we have good order, <hi>Therefore</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every ignorant Minister is put out of the Church;
and a Preacher in his place.</p>
            <p>Of those referred to the disjoyned, the first is, when
all the parts of the Disjunction or Proposition are not
affirmed: As,</p>
            <p>Every ignorant Minister is to be allowed, or not.</p>
            <p>But he is not.</p>
            <p>Therefore he is.</p>
            <p>The second kind is when the second part of the
copulative negative Axiome is denyed, that the first
may be so; As,</p>
            <p>A Non-Resident, is either a faithful, or unfaithful
Minister.</p>
            <p>But he is unfaithful, Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And thus much of the fallacies in a Syllogism.</p>
            <p>The fallacie in Method is when, to deceive withal,
the end is set in the beginning, the special before the
general, good order be gone, confounded: And finally
when darkness, length and hardness is laboured after.</p>

                  <p>In whatsoever Study, I examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my Inference be rational, and have
look't over the Titles of the Statutes from
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> downward to this present
time. I left not one unread, which I
thought might concern my self, which was
enough for me that meant not to plead for
any but my self. But I did not much exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
which of them was more, or less ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional;
because I read them not to dispute,
but to obey them, and saw in all of them
sufficient reason for my obedience, and that
the same reason, though the Statutes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were chang'd, remained constant. I
have also diligently read over <hi>Littleton</hi>'s
Book of <hi>Tenures,</hi> with the Commentaries
thereupon of the Renowned Lawyer Sir <hi>Ed.
Coke,</hi> in which I confess I found great sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility,
not of the Law, but of Inference from
Law, and especially from the Law of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, which is the Law of reason:
and I confess that it is truth which he sayes
in the Epilogue to his Book; that by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Reason in the Law, a Man
shall sooner come to the certainty and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Law: and I agree with Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> who upon that Text farther;
That Reason is the Soul of the Law, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54911:88"/>
upon sect. 138. <hi>Nihil quod est Rationi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarium

Law that is against Reason: and that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is the life of the Law, nay the Common
Law it self is nothing else but Reason. And
upon Sect. 21. <hi>Aequitas est perfecta quaedam
Ratio, quae Jus scriptum interpretatur &amp; emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat,
nulla scriptura comprehensa, sed solus in
vera Ratione consistens. i. e.</hi> Equity is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
perfect Reason that interpreteth and
amendeth the Law written, it self being
unwritten, and consisting in nothing else
but right Reason. When I consider this,
and find it to be true, and so evident as not
to be denyed by any Man of right sense,
I find my own reason at a stand; for it fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
all the Laws in the World: for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that the knowledge of the Law is gotten by

when they are studyed and obtained, it is
still done by Natural, and not by Artificial
Reason. I grant you that the knowledge of
the Law is an Art, but not that any Art of
one Man, or of many how wise soever they
be, or the work of one and more Artificers,
how perfect soever it be, is Law. It is not
Wisdom, but Authority that makes a Law.
Obscure also are the words Legal Reason;
there is no Reason in Earthly Creatures, but
Humane Reason; but I suppose that he
means, that the Reason of a Judge, or of
all the Judges together (without the King)
is that <hi>Summa Ratio,</hi> and the very Law,
which I deny, because none can make a Law
but he that hath the Legislative Power. That
the Law hath been fined by Grave and
Learned Men, meaning the Professors of the
Law is manifestly untrue, for all the Laws
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54911:89"/>
of <hi>England</hi> have been made by the Kings of
<hi>England,</hi> consulting with the Nobility and
Commons in <hi>Parliament,</hi> of which not one of

Law taken away, there would not be
left, either here, or any where, any Law
at all that would conduce to the Peace of
a Nation; yet Equity, and Reason which
Laws Divine and Eternal, which oblige all
Men at all times, and in all places, would
still remain, but be Obeyed by few: and
though the breach of them be not punished
in this World, yet they will be punished suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
in the World to come. Sir <hi>Edw.
Coke</hi> for drawing to the Men of his own
Profession as much Authority as lawfully
he might, is not to be reprehended; but
to the gravity and Learning of the Judges
they ought to have added in the making of
Laws, the Authority of the King, which
hath the Soveraignty: for of these Laws
of Reason, every Subject that is in his Wits,
is bound to take notice at his Peril, because
Reason is part of his Nature, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
carryes about with him, and may
read it, if he will.</p>

                  <p>'Tis very true; and upon this ground,

the Common Law (remember this that I

Reason is the Common Law) and for Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

                  <p>A Pleader commonly thinks he ought

time when it was made, and the Incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities

an irregular Appetite to Riches, to Power,

Slaughter, Fraud, Hypocrisie,
and all manner of evil habits; and that the
Laws of Man, though they can punish the
fruits of them, which are evil Actions, yet
they cannot pluck up the roots that are in
the Heart. How can a Man be Indicted of
Avarice, Envy, Hypocrisie, or other vitious
Habit, till it be declared by some Action,
which a Witness may take notice of; the
root remaining, new fruit will come forth
till you be weary of punishing, and at last

the most visible advantage is then, when

sort every Mans, as he may take, possess,
and enjoy without wrong to any Man, every
thing, Lands, Beasts, Fruits, and even the
bodies of other Men, if his Reason tell him
he cannot otherwise live securely: for the
dictates of Reason are little worth, if they
tended not to the preservation and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Mens Lives, seeing then without
Humane Law all things would be Common,
and this Community a cause of Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Envy, Slaughter, and continual War
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54911:92"/>
of one upon another, the same Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Dictates to Mankind (for their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation)
a distribution of Lands, and

proper to him, so as none other might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

and this properly is the same which
we say is one owns: by which you may see
the great Necessity there was of Statute
Laws, for preservation of all Mankind. It
is also a Dictate of the Law of Reason, that
Statute Laws are a necessary means of the
safety and well being of Man in the present
World, and are to be Obeyed by all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
as the Law of Reason ought to be
Obeyed, both by King and Subjects, because

                  <p>All this is very Rational; but how
can any Laws secure one Man from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
When the greatest part of Men are
so unreasonable, and so partial to themselves
as they are, and the Laws of themselves are
but a dead Letter, which of it self is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to compel a Man to do otherwise than
himself pleaseth, nor punish, or hurt him
when he hath done a mischief.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>By the Laws, I mean, Laws living
and Armed: for you must suppose, that a
Nation that is subdued by War to an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
submission of a Conqueror, it may by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54911:92"/>
the same Arm that compelled it to Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be compelled to Obey his Laws. Also
if a Nation choose a Man, or an Assembly of
Men to Govern them by Laws, it must fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him also with Armed Men and Money,
and all things necessary to his Office, or else
his Laws will be of no force, and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
remains, as before it was, in Confusion.
'Tis not therefore the word of the Law, but
the Power of a Man that has the strength of
a Nation, that makes the Laws effectual.
It was not <hi>Solon</hi> that made <hi>Athenian</hi> Laws
(though he devised them) but the Supream
Court of the People; nor, the Lawyers of
<hi>Rome</hi> that made the Imperial Law in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi>'s

                  <p>We agree then in this, that in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
it is the King that makes the Laws,
whosoever Pens them, and in this, that the
King cannot make his Laws effectual, nor
defend his People against their Enemies,
without a Power to Leavy Souldiers, and
consequently, that he may Lawfully, as
oft as he shall really think it necessary to
raise an Army (which in some occasions be
very great) I say, raise it, and Money to
Maintain it. I doubt not but you will allow
this to be according to the Law (at least)

heard how, in, and before the late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54911:93"/>
the People were of another mind. Shall

                  <p>The People Reason ill; they do not

at the base Offices he was put to by his
<hi>Norman</hi> Masters, received no other Answer
but this, Thou art but an <hi>English-Man,</hi> nor
can the People, nor any Man that humors
them in their Disobedience, produce any
Example of a King that ever rais'd any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Summ's, either by himself, or by
the Consent of his Parliament, but when
they had great need thereof; nor can shew
any reason that might move any of them so
to do. The greatest Complaint by them
made against the unthriftiness of their Kings
was for the inriching now and then a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
which to the Wealth of the Kingdom
was inconsiderable, and the Complaint but
Envy. But in this point of raising Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
what is I pray you the Statute Law?</p>

may Transport his Subjects, or compel them

another Nation: But this I verily believe,
that if a Forraign Enemy should either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
us, or put himself int a readiness to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
either <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi>
(no Parliament then sitting) and the King
send <hi>English</hi> Souldiers thither, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
would give him thanks for it. The
Subjects of those Kings who affect the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and imitate the Actions of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great, have not always the most comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
lives, nor do such Kings usually very

Rebellion at home; how shall the Kingdom
be preserved without a considerable Army

be disabled to perform his Office by virtue

though it be true, that no Man is
born with the use of Reason, yet all Men
may grow up to it as well as Lawyers;
and when they have applyed their Reason
to the Laws (which were Laws before they
Studyed them, or else it was not Law they
Studied) may be as fit for, and capable of
Judicature as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> himself, who
whether he had more, or less use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
was not thereby a Judge, but because
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54911:95"/>
the King made him so: And whereas he says,
that a Man who should have as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as is dispersed in so many several
Heads, could not make such a Law as this
Law of <hi>England</hi> is; if one should ask him
who made the Law of <hi>England?</hi> Would
he say a Succession of <hi>English</hi> Lawyers, or
Judges made it, or rather a Succession of
Kings; and that upon their own Reason,
either solely, or with the Advice of the
Lords and Commons in Parliament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Judges, or other Professors of the
Law? You see therefore that the Kings
Reason, be it more, or less, is that <hi>Anima
Legis,</hi> that <hi>Summa Lex,</hi> whereof Sir <hi>Edw.
Coke</hi> speaketh, and not the Reason, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Wisdom of the Judges; but you
may see, that quite through his Institutes
of Law, he often takes occasion to Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Learning of the Lawyers, whom
he perpetually termeth the Sages of the
Parliament, or of the Kings Council: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unless you say otherwise, I say, that
the Kings Reason, when it is publickly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Advice, and Deliberation declar'd, is
that <hi>Anima Legis,</hi> and that <hi>Summa Ratio,</hi>
and that Equity which all agree to be the
Law of Reason, is all that is, or ever was
Law in <hi>England,</hi> since it became Christian,
besides the Bible.</p>

                  <p>No, I am satisfied that the Kings
that grant such Liberties are bound to make
them good, so far as it may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sin: But if a King find that by such
a Grant he be disabled to protect his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
if he maintain his Grant, he sins; and
therefore may, and ought to take no Notice
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54911:96"/>
of the said Grant: For such Grants as by
Error, or false Suggestion are gotten from
him, are as the Lawyers do Confess, Void
and of no Effect, and ought to be recalled.
Also the King (as is on all hands Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
hath the Charge lying upon him to
Protect his People against Forraign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and to keep the Peace betwixt them
within the Kingdom; if he do not his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
endeavour to discharge himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he Committeth a Sin, which neither

                  <p>No Man I think will deny this: For
if Levying of Money be necessary, it is a
Sin in the Parliament to refuse, if unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
it is a sin both in King and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
to Levy: But for all that it may be,
and I think it is a Sin in any one that hath
the Soveraign Power, be he one Man, or
one Assembly, being intrusted with the
safety of a whole Nation, if rashly, and
relying upon his own Natural sufficiency,
he make War, or Peace without Consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with such, as by their Experience and
Employment abroad, and Intelligence by
Letters, or other means have gotten the
Knowledge in some measure of the strength,
Advantages and Designs of the Enemy, and
the Manner and Degree of the Danger
that may from thence arise. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54911:97"/>
in case of Rebellion at Home, if he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
not with of Military Condition, which
if he do, then I think he may Lawfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to Subdue all such Enemies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
and that the Souldiers ought to go on
without Inquiring whether they be within
the Country, or without: For who shall
suppress Rebellion, but he that hath Right
to Levy, Command, and Dispose of the
Militia? The last long Parliament denied
this. But why? Because by the Major
part of their Votes the Rebellion was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with design to put down Monarchy, and
to that end Maintained.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Nor do I hereby lay any Aspersion
upon such Grants of the King and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors.
Those Statutes are in themselves
very good for the King and People, as cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
some kind of Difficulty, or such
Kings as for the Glory of Conquest might
spend one part of their Subjects Lives and
Estates, in Molesting other Nations, and
leave the rest to Destroy themselves at
Home by Factions. That which I here
find fault with, is the wresting of those, and
other such Statutes to a binding of our
Kings from the use of their Armies in the
necessary defence of themselves and their
People. The late long Parliament that in
1648, Murdered their King (a King that
sought no greater Glory upon Earth, but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54911:97"/>
to be indulgent to his People, and a Pious
defender of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) no
sooner took upon them the Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
then they Levyed Money upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at their own Discretion. Did any of
their Subjects Dispute their Power? Did
they not send Souldiers over the Sea to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and others to Fight against the
Dutch at Sea, or made they any doubt but
to be obeyed in all that they Commanded,
as a Right absolutely due to the Soveraign
Power in whomsoever it resides? I say, not
this as allowing their Actions, but as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
from the Mouths of those very Men
that denyed the same Power to him, whom
they acknowledged to have been their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
immediately before, which is a
sufficient Proof, that the People of <hi>England</hi>
never doubted of the Kings Right to Levy
Money for the Maintenance of his Armies,
till they were abused in it by Seditious Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and other prating Men, on purpose to
turn the State and Church into Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
where the most ignorant and
boldest Talkers do commonly obtain the
best preferments; again, when their New
Republick returned into Monarchy by <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
who durst deny him Money upon any
pretence of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or of these other
Acts of Parliament which you have Cited?
You may therefore think it good Law, for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54911:98"/>
all your Books; that the King of <hi>England</hi>
may at all times, that he thinks in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
it will be necessar for the defence
of his People, Levy as many Souldiers, and
as much Money as he please, and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is Judge of the Necessity.</p>

                  <p>The Common People never take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of what they hear of this Nature, but
when they are set on by such as they think
Wise; that is, by some sorts of Preachers,
or some that seem to be Learned in the
Laws, and withal speak evil of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.
But what if the King upon the
sight, or apprehension of any great danger
to his People; as when their Neighbours
are born down with the Current of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Enemy, should think his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might be involved in the same Misery,
may he not Levy, Pay, and Transport Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to help those weak Neighbours by way
of prevention, to save his own People and
himself from Servitude? Is that a sin?</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>First, If the War upon our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
be Just, it may be question'd whether
it be Equity or no to Assist them against
the Right.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>For my part I make no Question of
that at all, unless the Invader will, and can
put me in security, that neither he, nor
his Successors shall make any Advantage of
the Conquest of my Neighbour, to do the
same to me in time to come; but there is
no Common Power to bind them to the
Peace.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Secondly; when such a thing shall
happen, the Parliament will not refuse to
Contribute freely to the safety of themselves,
and the whole Nation.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>It may be so, and it may be not: For
if a Parliament then sit not, it must be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
that requires 6 Weeks time; Deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and Collecting what is given requires
as much, and in this time the Opportunity
perhaps is lost. Besides, how many wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Souls have we heard to say in the late
Troubles; What matter is it who gets the
Victory? We can pay but what they please
to Demand, and so much we pay now: and
this they will Murmur, as they have ever
done whosoever shall Raign over them, as
long as their Coveteousness and Ignorance
hold together, which will be till Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
if better order be not taken for their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54911:99"/>
struction in their Duty, both from Reason
and Religion.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>For all this I find it somewhat hard,
that a King should have Right to take from
his Subjects, upon the pretence of Necessity
what he pleaseth.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I know what it is that troubles your
Conscience in this Point. All Men are
troubled at the Crossing of their Wishes;
but it is our own fault. First, we wish Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities;
we would have our Security
against all the World, upon Right of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
without Paying for it: This is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
We may as well Expect that
Fish, and Fowl should Boil, Rost, and Dish
themselves, and come to the Table; and
that Grapes should squeeze themselves into
our Mouths, and have all other the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments
and ease which some pleasant
Men have Related of the Land of <hi>Cocquam.</hi>
Secondly, There is no Nation in the World
where he, or they that have the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
do not take what Money they please, for
Defence of those respective Nations, when
they think it necessary for their safety. The
late long Parliament denyed this; but why?
Because there was a Design amongst them
to Depose the King. Thirdly, There is no
Example of any King of <hi>England</hi> that I
have Read of, that ever pretended any such
Necessity for Levying of Money, against
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54911:99"/>
his Conscience. The greatest sounds that
ever were Levyed (Comparing the value of
Money, as it was at that time, with what
now it is) were Levied by King <hi>Edw. 3d.</hi>
and King <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th. Kings of whom we
Glory now, and think their Actions great
Ornaments to the <hi>English</hi> History. Lastly,
As to the enriching of now and then a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
it is neither sensible to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
nor is any Treasure thereby Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the Realm, but so spent as it falls
down again upon the Common People. To
think that our Condition being Humane
should be subject to no Incommodity, were
Injuriously to Quarrel with God Almighty
for our own Faults; for he hath done his
part in annexing our own Industry and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>If you allow this that I have said;
then, say that the People never were, shall
be, or ought to be free from being Taxed at
the will of one or other; being hindred that
if Civil War come, they must Levy all they
have, and that Dearly, from the one, or
from the other, or from both sides. Say,
that adhering to the King, their Victory is
an end of their Trouble; that adhering to
his Enemies there is no end; for the War
will continue by a perpetual Subdivision,
and when it ends, they will be in the same
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54911:100"/>
Estate they were before. That they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Abused by Men who to them seem wise,
when then their Wisdom is nothing else but
Envy to those that are in Grace, and in
profitable Employments, and that those Men
do but abuse the Common People to their
own ends, that set up a private Mans Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
against the publick Safety. But say
withal, that the King is Subject to the Laws
of God, both Written, and Unwritten, and
to no other; and so was <hi>William the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
whose Right it all Descended to our
present King.</p>

Nation, besides the Reason of him that

his Reason be but the Reason of one Man,
yet it is set up to supply the place of that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54911:100"/>
Universal Reason, which is expounded to

our King is to us the Legislator

                  <p>Yes, I know that the Laws Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
which have been Law in this Kingdom
since the Abolishing of Popery, are the
Kings Laws, and those also that were made
before; for the Canons of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> were no Laws, neither here, nor any
where else without the Popes Temporal
Dominions, farther than Kings, and States
in their several Dominions respectively did

                  <p>I grant that. But you must grant
also, that those Spiritual Laws Legislators
of the Spiritual Law; and yet not all Kings,
and States make Laws by Consent of the
Lords and Commons; but our King here
is so far bound to their Assents, as he shall
Judge Conducing to the Good, and safety
of his People; for Example, if the Lords
and Commons should Advise him to restore
those Laws Spiritual, which in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
time were in Force, I think the King
were by the Law of Reason obliged, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of any other Law of God, to

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I think so: For the Statutes were
made by Authority, and not drawn from
any other Principles than the care of the
safety of the People. Statutes are not Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
as is the Common-Law, and other
disputable Arts, but are Commands, or
Prohibitions which ought to be obeyed,
because Assented to by Submission made to
the Conqueror here in <hi>England,</hi> and to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
had the Soveraign Power in other
Common wealths; so that the Positive
Laws of all Places are Statutes. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of Law was therefore unnecessary
for the makers of Statutes, though very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to them, whose work it is to Teach
the sence of the Law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>There is an Accurate Definition of a
Law in <hi>Bracton,</hi> Cited by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke
( ) Lex est sanctio justa, jubens ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesta,
&amp; prohibens contraria.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>That is to say, Law is a just Statute,
Commanding those things which are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and Forbidding the contrary. From
whence it followeth, that in all Cases it
must be the Honesty, or Dishonesty that
makes the Command a Law, whereas you
know that but for the Law we could not
(as saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) have known what is sin;
therefore this Definition is no Ground at
all for any farther Discourse of Law. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
you know the Rule of Honest, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54911:102"/>
Dishonest refers to Honour, and that it is
Justice only, and Injustice that the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth.
But that which I most except
against in this Definition, is, that it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
that a Statute made by the Soveraign
Power of a Nation may be unjust. There
may indeed in a Statute Law, made by Men
be found Iniquity, but not Injustice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>This is somewhat subtil; I pray
deal plainly, what is the difference between
Injustice and Iniquity?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I pray you tell me first, what is the
difference between a Court of Justice, and
a Court of Equity?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>A Court of Justice is that which
hath Cognizance of such Causes as are to
be ended by the Possitive Laws of the
Land; and a Court of Equity in that, to
which belong such Causes as are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by Equity; that is to say, by the
Law of Reason.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>You see then that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Injustice, and Iniquity is this; that
Injustice is the Transgression of a Statute-Law,
and Iniquity the Transgression of the
Law of Reason, was nothing else but the
Law of Reason, and that the Judges of
that Law are Courts of Justice, because
the breach of the Statute-Law is Iniquity,
and Injustice also. But perhaps you mean
by Common-Law, not the Law it self,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54911:103"/>
but the manner of proceeding in the Law
(as to matter of Fact) by 12 Men, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
though those 12 Men are no Court
of Equity, nor of Justice, because they
determine not what is Just or Unjust, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whether it be done, or not done; and
their Judgment is nothing else but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of that which is properly the
Judgment of the Witnesses; for to speak
exactly there cannot possibly be any Judge
of Fact besides the Witnesses.</p>

                  <p>How would you have a Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n'd?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus; A Law is the Command of
him, or them that have the Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
given to those that be his or their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
declaring Publickly, and plainly what
every of them may do, and what they must
forbear to do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Seeing all Judges in all Courts ought
to Judge according to Equity, which is the
Law of Reason, a distinct Court of Equity
seemeth to me to be unnecessary, and but a
Burthen to the People, since Common-Law,
and Equity are the same Law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>It were so indeed; If Judges could
not err, but since they may err, and that
the King is not Bound to any other Law
but that of Equity, it belongs to him alone
to give Remedy to them that by the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
or Corruption of a Judge shall
suffer dammage.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>By your Definition of a Law, the
Kings Proclamation under the Great Seal of
<hi>England</hi> is a Law; for it is a Command, and
Publick, and of the Soveraign to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Why not? If he think it necessary
for the good of his Subjects: For this is a
Maxim at the Common-Law Alledged by
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> himself. 1 <hi>Inst. Sect. 306.
Quando Lex aliquid concedit, concedere vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

you know out of the same Author, that

                        </gap>ngland</hi> have often, to the
Petitions in Parliament which they grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
annexed such exceptions as these, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there be necessity, saving our Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
which I think should be always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
though they be not expressed; and
are understood so by Common Lawyers,
who agree that the King may recall any
Grant wherein he was deceiv'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Again, whereas you make it of the
Essence of a Law to be Publickly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declar'd to the People, I see no necessity
for that. Are not all Subjects Bound to
take notice of all Acts of Parliament, when
no Act can pass without their Consent?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>If you had said that no Act could
pass without their knowledge, then indeed
they had been bound to take notice of them;
but none can have knowledge of them but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54911:104"/>
the Members of the Houses of Parliament,
therefore the rest of the People are excus'd;
or else the Knights of the Shires should be
bound to furnish People with a sufficient
Number of Copies (at the Peoples Charge)
of the Acts of Parliament at their return
into the Country; that every man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to them, and by themselves, or Friends
take notice of what they are obliged to;
for otherwise it were Impossible they should
be obeyed: And that no Man is bound to do
a thing Impossible is one of Sir <hi>Edw. Cokes</hi>
Maxims at the Common-Law. I know
that most of the Statutes are Printed, but
it does not appear that every Man is bound
to Buy the Book of Statutes, nor to search
for them at <hi>Westminster</hi> or at the <hi>Tower,</hi> nor
to understand the Language wherein they
are for the most part Written.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I grant it proceeds from their own
Faults; but no Man can be excused by the
Ignorance of the Law of Reason; that is
to say, by Ignorance of the Common-Law,
except Children, Mad-men, and Idiots: But
you exact such a notice of the Statute-Law,
as is almost Impossible. Is it not enough
that they in all Places have a sufficient
Number of the Poenal Statutes?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; If they have those Poenal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
near them, but what Reason can you
give me why there should not be as many
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54911:104"/>
Copies abroad of the Statutes, as there be of
the Bible?</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I think it were well that every Man
that can Read had a Statute-Book; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
no knowledge of those Laws, by
which Mens Lives and Fortunes can be
brought into danger, can be too much. I
find a great Fault in your Definition of Law;
which is, that every Law either forbiddeth
or Commandeth something. 'Tis true that
the Moral-Law is always a Command or a
Prohibition, or at least Implieth it; but in
the Levitical-Law, where it is said; that
he that Stealeth a Sheep shall Restore four
Fold; what Command, or Prohibition ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in these words?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Such Sentences as that are not in
themselves General, but Judgments, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
there is in those words Implied
a Commandment to the Judge, to cause to
be made a Four-fold Restitution.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>That's Right.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Now Define what Justice is, and
what Actions, and Men are to be called
Just.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Justice is the constant will of giving
to every Man his own; that is to say, of
giving to every Man that which is his Right,
in such manner as to Exclude the Right of
all men else to the same thing. A Just A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is that which is not against the Law.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54911:105"/>
A Just Man is he that hath a constant Will
to live Justly; if you require more, I doubt
there will no Man living be Comprehended
within the Definition.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Seeing then that a Just Action (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your Definition) is that which
is not against the Law; it is Manifest that
before there was a Law, there could be no
Injustice, and therefore Laws are in their
Nature Antecedent to Justice and Injustice,
and you cannot deny but there must be
Law-makers, before there was any Laws,
and Consequently before there was any
Justice, I speak of Humane Justice; and
that Law-makers were before that which
you call Own, or property of Goods, or
Lands distinguished by <hi>Meum, Tuum, Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enum.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>That must be Granted; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Statute-Laws, all Men have Right to
all things; and we have had Experience
when our Laws were silenced by Civil
War, there was not a Man, that of any
Goods could say assuredly they were his
own.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>You see then that no private Man
can claim a Propriety in any Lands, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Goods from any Title, from any Man,
but the King, or them that have the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Power; because it is in virtue of the
Soveraignty, that every Man may not enter
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54911:105"/>
into, and Possess what he pleaseth; and
consequently to deny the Soveraign any
thing necessary to the sustaining of his
Soveraign power, is to destroy the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he pretends to. The next thing I will
ask you is, how you distinguish between
Law and Right, or <hi>Lex</hi> and <hi>Jus.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi> in divers places makes
<hi>Lex</hi> and <hi>Jus</hi> to be the same, and so <hi>Lex
Communis,</hi> and <hi>Jus Communis</hi> to be all one;
nor do I find that he does in any places di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Then will I distinguish them, and
make you judge whether my distinction be
not necessary to be known by every Author
of the Common Law: for Law obligeth me
to do, or forbear the doing of something;
and therefore it lies upon me an Obligation;
but my Right is a Liberty left me by the
Law to do any thing which the Law forbids
me not, and to leave undone any thing which
the Law commands me not. Did Sir <hi>Ed.
Coke</hi> see no difference between being bound
and being free?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I know not what he was, but he has
not mention'd it, though a man may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with his own Liberty, that cannot
do so with the Law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But what are you better for your
Right, if a rebellious Company at home, or
an Enemy from abroad take away the Goods,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54911:106"/>
or dispossess you of the Lands you have a
right to? Can you be defended, or repair'd,
but by the strength and authority of the
King? What reason therefore can be given
by a man that endeavours to preserve his
Propriety, why he should deny, or malign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contribute to the Strength that should
defend him, or repair him? Let us see now
what your Books say to this point, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
points of the Right of Soveraignty.
<hi>Bracton,</hi> the most authentick Author of the
Common Law, <hi>fol.</hi> 55. saith thus: <hi>Ipse Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus
Rex habet omnia Jura in manu su√¢, est
Dei Vicarius; habet ea quae sunt Pacis, habet
etiam coercionem ut Delinquentes puniat; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
in potestate su√¢ Leges; nihil enim prodest
Jura condere, nisi sit qui Jura tueatur.</hi> That
is to say, our Lord the King hath all Right
in his own Hands; is Gods Vicar; he has
all that concerns the Peace; he has the
power to punish Delinquents; all the Laws
are in his power; To make Laws is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
unless there be some-body to make
them obeyed. If <hi>Bracton's</hi> Law be Reason,
as I, and you think it is; what temporal
power is there which the King hath not?
Seeing that at this day all the power Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
which <hi>Bracton</hi> allows the <hi>Pope,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to the Crown; what is there that the
King cannot do, excepting sin against the
Law of God? The same <hi>Bracton Lib. 21.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54911:106"/>
c.</hi> 8. saith thus; <hi>Si autem a Rege petitur
(cum Breve non curret contra ipsum) locus erit
supplicationi, quod factum suum corrigat, &amp;
emendet; quod quidem si non fecerit, satis suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit

nemo quidem de factis ejus praesumat
disputare, multo fortius contra factum ejus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire:</hi>
That is to say, if any thing be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the King (seeing a Writ lyeth not
against him) he is put to his Petition, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to Correct and Amend his own
Fact; which if he will not do, it is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Penalty for him, that he is to expect
a punishment from the Lord: No Man may
presume to dispute of what he does, much
less to resist him. You see by this, that
this Doctrine concerning the Rights of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
so much Cryed down by the long
Parliament, is the Antient Common-Law,
and that the only Bridle of the Kings of
<hi>England,</hi> ought to be the fear of God. And
again <hi>Bracton, c.</hi> 24. of the second Book
sayes, That the Rights of the Crown can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be granted away; <hi>Ea vero quae Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis
&amp; Pacis, &amp; ea quae sunt Justitiae &amp;
Paci annexa, ad nullum pertinent, nisi ad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronam
&amp; Dignitatem Regiam, nec a Corona
separari possunt, nec a privata persona posside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi>
That is to say, those things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Jurisdiction and Peace, and those
things that are annexed to Justice, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54911:107"/>
Peace, appertain to none, but to the
Crown and Dignity of the King, nor
can be separated from the Crown, nor be
possest by a private Person. Again you'l
find in <hi>Fleta</hi> (a Law-Book written in the
time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2.) That Liberties though
granted by the King, if they tend to the
hinderance of Justice, or subversion of the
Regal Power, were not to be used, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed:
For in that Book <hi>c.</hi> 20. concerning
Articles of the Crown, which the Justices
Itinerant are to enquire of, the 54th Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
is this, you shall inquire <hi>De Libertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
concessis quae impediunt Communem J<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,
&amp; Regiam Potestatem subvertunt.</hi> Now
what is a greater hindrance to Common
Justice, or a greater subversion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Power, than a Liberty in Subjects to
hinder the King from raising Money neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to suppress, or prevent Rebellions, which
doth destroy Justice, and subvert the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Soveraignty? Moreover when a
Charter is granted by a King in these words,
<hi>Dedita &amp; coram pro me &amp; Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redibus
meis.</hi> The grantor by the Common-Law
(as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> sayes in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
on <hi>Littleton</hi>) is to warrant his Gift;
and I think it Reason, especially if the Gift
be upon Consideration of a price Paid. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Forraign State should say claim to
this Kingdom ('tis no Matter as to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54911:107"/>
I am putting, whether the Claim be
unjust) how would you have the King to
warrant to every Free-holder in <hi>England</hi> the
Lands they hold of him by such a Charter?
If he cannot Levy Money, their Estates are
lost, and so is the Kings Estate, and if the
Kings Estate be gone, how can he repair
the Value due upon the Warranty? I know
that the Kings Charters are not so meerly
Grants, as that they are not also Laws; but
they are such Laws as speak not to all the
Kings Subjects in general, but only to his
Officers; implicitly forbidding them to
Judge, or Execute any thing contrary to
the said Grants. There be many Men that
are able Judges of what is right Reason,
and what not; when any of these shall
know that a Man has no Superiour, nor
Peer in the Kingdom, he will hardly be
perswaded he can be bound by any Law of
the Kingdom, or that he who is Subject to
none but God, can make a Law upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which he cannot also as easily abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
as he made it. The main Argument,
and that which so much taketh with the
throng of People, proceedeth from a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
fear put into their minds by such Men
as mean to make use of their Hands to their
own ends; for if (say they) the King may
(notwithstanding the Law) do what he
please, and nothing to restrain him but the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54911:108"/>
fear of punishment in the World to come,
then (in case there come a King that fears
no such punishment) he may take away
from us, not only our Lands, Goods, and
Liberties, but our Lives also if he will: And
they say true; but they have no reason to
think he will, unless it be for his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
which cannot be; for he loves his own
Power; and what becomes of his power
when his Subjects are destroyed, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by whose multitude, and strength he
enjoyes his power, and every one of his
Subjects his Fortune? And lastly, whereas
they sometimes say the King is bound, not
only to cause his Laws to be observ'd, but
also to observe them himself; I think the
King causing them to be observ'd is the same
thing as observing them himself: For I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard it taken for good Law, that the
King may be Indicted, or Appealed, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with a Writ, till the long Parliament
practised the contrary upon the good King
<hi>Charles,</hi> for which divers of them were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,
and the rest by this our present
King pardoned.</p>

                  <p>By the King in Parliament if you

you cannot deny, but that the pardoning of
Injury, to the Person that is Injur'd, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54911:108"/>
and other Offences against the Peace,
and against the Right of the Soveraign are
Injuries done to the King; and therefore
whosoever is pardoned any such Offence,
ought to acknowledge he ows his Pardon
to the King alone: But as to such Murders,
Felonies, and other Injuries as are done to
any Subject how mean soever, I think it
great reason that the parties endammaged
ought to have satisfaction before such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
be allow'd. And in the death of a Man,
where restitution of Life is Impossible, what
can any Friend, Heir, or other party that
may appeal, require more than reasonable
satisfaction some other way? Perhaps he
will be content with nothing but Life for
Life; but that is Revenge, and belongs to
God, and under God to the King, and none
else; therefore if there be reasonable satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
tendred, the King, without sin (I
think) may pardon him. I am sure, if
the pardoning him be a sin, that neither King,
nor Parliament, nor any earthly Power can
do it.</p>

                  <p>In the State of <hi>Athens</hi> long ago, for
the Abolishing of the Civil War, there was
an Act agreed on; that from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
no Man should be molested for any
thing (before that Act done) whatsoever
without exception, which Act the makers
of it called an Act of <hi>Oblivion;</hi> not that all
Injuries should be forgotten (for then we
could never have had the story) but that
they should not rise up in Judgment against
any Man. And in imitation of this Act the
like was propounded (though it took no
effect) upon the death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> in
the Senate of <hi>Rome.</hi> By such an Act you
may easily conceive that all Accusations for
offences past were absolutely dead, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and yet we have no great reason to
think, that the objecting one to another of
the Injuries pardoned, was any violation of
those Acts, except the same were so expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                  <p>There be divers sorts of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
some of which are concerning Mens

are Corporeal, and Lands, Money, Cattel,

or seen; and some Incorporeal, as Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
Liberties, Dignities, Offices, and
many other good things, meer Creatures of
the Law, and cannot be handled or seen:
And both of these kinds are concerning <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
and <hi>Tuum.</hi> Others there are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Crimes punishable divers wayes; and
amongst some of these, part of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is some Fine, or Forfeiture to the
King, and then it is called a Plea of the
Crown, in case the King sue the party, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
it is but a private Plea, which
they call an Appeal: And though upon Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54911:110"/>
in an Appeal the King shall have his
Forfeiture; yet it cannot be called a Plea of
the Crown, but when the Crown pleadeth
for it. There be also other Controversies
concerning the Government of the Church,
in order to Religion, and virtuous Life. The
offences both against the Crown, and against
the Laws of the Church are Crimes; but
the offences of one Subject against another,
if they be not against the Crown, the King
pretendeth nothing in those Pleas, but the
Reparation of his Subjects injur'd.</p>

that dammages awarded to the

the nature of a penalty, but is meerly a
Restitution, or satisfaction due to the party
griev'd by the Law of Reason, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is no more a punishment than is the

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>All Crimes are indeed Sins, but not
all Sins Crimes. A Sin may be in the thought
or secret purpose of a Man, of which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Judge, nor a Witness, nor any Man
take notice; but a Crime is such a Sin as
consists in an Action against the Law, of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54911:110"/>
which Action he can be Accused, and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Judge, and be Convinced, or Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Witnesses. Farther; that which is
no Sin in it self, but indifferent, may be
made Sin by a positive Law. As when the
Statute was in force; that no Man should
wear Silk in his Hat, after the Statute, such
wearing of Silk was a Sin, which was not
so before: Nay sometimes an Action that's
good in it self, by the Statute Law may be
made a Sin; as if a Statute should be made
to forbid the giving of Alms to a strong
and sturdy Beggar; such Alms after that
Law would be a Sin, but not before: For
then it was Charity, the Object whereof is
not the strength, or other Quality of the
poor Man, but his Poverty. Again, he that
should have said in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time,
that the <hi>Pope</hi> had no Authority in <hi>England,</hi>
should have been Burnt at a Stake; but for
saying the same in the time of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
should have been Commended. You
see by this, that many things are made
Crimes, and no Crimes, which are not so
in their own Nature, but by Diversity of
Law, made upon Diversity of Opinion, or
of Interest by them which have Authority:
And yet those things, whether good, or
evil, will pass so with the Vulgar (if they
hear them often with odious terms recited)
for hainous Crimes in themselves, as many
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54911:111"/>
of those Opinions, which are in themselves
Pious, and Lawful, were heretofore by the
Popes Interest therein called Detestable
Heresie. Again; some Controversies are of
things done upon the Sea, others of things
done upon the Land. There need by many
Courts to the deciding of so many kinds of
Controversies. What order is there taken
for their Distribution?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>There be an extraordinary great
number of Courts in <hi>England;</hi> First; there
be the Kings Courts both for Law, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in matters Temporal, which are the
Chancery, the Kings-Bench, the Court of
Common-Pleas, and for the Kings Revenue
the Court of the Exchequer, and there be
Subjects Courts by Priviledge, as the Court
in <hi>London,</hi> and other priviledg'd places.
And there be other Courts of Subjects, as
the Courts of Landlords, called the Court
of Barons, and the Courts of Sherifs. Also
the Spiritual Courts are the Kings Courts at
this day, though heretofore they were the
<hi>Popes</hi> Courts. And in the Kings Courts,
some have their Judicature by Office, and
some by Commission, and some Authority
to Hear, and Determine, and some only to
Inquire, and to Certifie into other Courts.
Now for the Distribution of what Pleas eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Court may hold; it is commonly held,
that all the Pleas of the Crown, and of all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54911:111"/>
Offences contrary to the Peace are to be
holden in the Kings Bench, or by Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,
for <hi>Bracton</hi> saith; <hi>Sciendum est, quod
si Actiones sunt Criminales, in Curia Domini
Regis debent determinari; cum sit ibi poena
C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

si tangat personam suam, sicut Crimen Laesae
Majestatis, vel coram Justitiariis ad hoc spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialiter
assignatis.</hi> That is to say; That if
the Plea be Criminal, it ought to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
in the Court of our Lord the King,
because there they have power to inflict
Corporeal punishment, and if the Crime be
against his person, as the Crime of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
it ought to be determin'd before the
King himself, or if it be against a private
person, it ought to be determin'd by Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Assigned; that is to say, before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.
It seems by this, that heretofore
Kings did hear and determine Pleas of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against themselves, by their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
but it has been otherwise a long time,
and is now: For it is now the Office of the
Lord Steward of <hi>England</hi> in the Tryal of a
Peer, to hold that Plea by a Commission e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
for the same. In Causes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Meum,</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> the King may sue,
either in the Kings-Bench, or in the Court
of Common Pleas, as it appears by <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi>
in his <hi>Natura Brevium,</hi> at the Writ
of Escheat.</p>

                  <p>A King perhaps will not sit to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of Causes of Treason against his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
lest he should seem to make himself
Judge in his own Cause; but that it shall
be Judged by Judges of his own making,
can never be avoided, which is also one as

generally all Causes Temporal, both

                  <p>Methinks 'tis very plain by these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents, that all Causes Temporal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Kingdom (except the Pleas that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Exchequer) should be decidable
by this Lord-Chief-Justice. For as for Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Criminal, and that concern the Peace,
it is granted him in these words, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of our self, and peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
wherein are contained all Pleas Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal;
and, in the doing of Justice to all
and singular the Kings Subjects are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
all Pleas Civil. And as to the Court
of Common-Pleas, it is manifest it may hold
all manner of Civil-Pleas (except those of
the Exchequer) by <hi>Magna Charta, Cap.</hi> 11.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54911:113"/>

are returnable into either of the said

                  <p>Before the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
Common-Pleas (as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> granteth,
2 <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 21.) might have been holden in
the Kings-Bench; and that Court being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
at the Kings will, the Returns of
Writs were <hi>Coram Nobis ubicunque fuerimus
in Anglia;</hi> whereby great trouble of Jurors
ensued, and great charges of the parties, and
delay of Justice; and that for these causes
it was Ordain'd, that the Common-Pleas
should not follow the King, but be held in
a place certain.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Here Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> declares his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that no Common-Plea can be holden
in the Kings-Bench, in that he says they
might have been holden then. And yet
this doth not amount to any probable proof,
that there was any Court of Common-Pleas
in <hi>England</hi> before <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> For this
Statute being to ease the Jurors, and lessen
the Charges of Parties, and for the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Justice had been in Vain, if there
had been a Court of Common-Pleas then
standing; for such a Court was not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to follow the King, as was the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
and the Kings-Bench. Besides, unless
the Kings-Bench, wheresoever it was, held
Plea of civil Causes, the Subject had not at
all been eased by this Statute: For supposing
the King at <hi>York,</hi> had not the Kings Subjects
about <hi>London,</hi> Jurors, and parties as much
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54911:114"/>
trouble, and charge to go to <hi>York,</hi> as the
People about <hi>York</hi> had before to go to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</hi>
Therefore I can by no means believe
otherwise, then that the Erection of the
Court of Common-Pleas was the effect of
that Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, Cap.</hi> 11. And
before that time not existent, though I
think that for the multiplicity of Suits in a
great Kingdom there was need of it.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps there was not so much need
of it as you think: For in those times the
Laws, for the most part, were in setling,
rather than setled; and the old Saxon Laws
concerning Inheritances were then practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
by which Laws speedy Justice was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
by the Kings Writs, in the Courts of
Barons, which were Landlords to the rest
of the Freeholders, and Suits of Barons in
County-Courts, and but few Suits in the
Kings Courts, but when Justice could not
be had in those Inferior Courts; but at this
day there be more Suits in the Kings Courts,
than any one Court can dispatch.</p>

                  <p>Why should there be more Suits now,

                  <p>Sir <hi>Edw. Coke, 4 Inst. p.</hi> 76. assigneth
for it six Causes, 1. Peace, 2. Plenty, 3.
The Dissolution of Religious Houses, and
dispersing of their Lands among so many
several persons, 4. The multitude of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54911:115"/>
5. The number of Concealers, 6. The
multitude of Attorneys.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I see Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> has no mind to lay
any fault upon the Men of his own Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and that he Assigns for Causes of the
Mischiefs, such things as would be Mischief,
and Wickedness to amend; for if Peace,
and Plenty, be the cause of this Evil, it
cannot be removed but by War and Begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and the Quarrels arising about the
Lands of Religious Persons cannot arise from
the Lands, but from the doubtfulness of the
Laws. And for Informers they were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised
by Statutes, to the Execution of
which Statutes they are so necessary, as that
their number cannot be too great, and if it
be too great the fault is in the Law it self.
The number of Concealers, are indeed a
number of Couseners, which the Law may
easily Correct. And lastly for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Attorneys, it is the fault of them
that have the power to admit, or refuse
them. For my part I believe that Men at
this day have better learn't the Art of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling
against the words of a Statute, than
heretofore they had, and thereby encourage
themselves, and others, to undertake Suits
upon little reason. Also the variety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
of Judgments of Common-Law
do oftentimes put Men to hope for Victory
in causes, whereof in reason they had no
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54911:115"/>
ground at all. Also the ignorance of what
is Equity in their own causes, which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
not one Man in a thousand ever Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
and the Lawyers themselves seek not
for their Judgments in their own Breasts, but
in the precedents of former Judges, as the
Antient Judges sought the same, not in
their own Reason, but in the Laws of the
Empire. Another, and perhaps the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
cause of multitude of Suits is this, that
for want of Registring of conveyances of
Land, which might easily be done in the
Townships where the Lands ly, a Purchase
cannot easily be had, which will not be liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
Lastly, I believe the Coveteousness
of Lawyers was not so great in Antient
time, which was full of trouble, as they
have been since in time of Peace, wherein
Men have leisure to study fraud, and get
employment from such Men as can encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to Contention. And how ample a
Field they have to exercise this Mystery in
is manifest from this, that they have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to Scan and Construe every word in a
Statute, Charter, Feofment, Lease, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Deed, Evidence, or Testimony. But
to return to the Jurisdiction of this Court of
the Kings-Bench, where, as you say, it hath
power to correct and amend the Errors of
all other Judges, both in Process, and in
Judgments; cannot the Judges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Pleas
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54911:116"/>
correct Error in Process in their
own Courts, without a Writ of Error from
another Court?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; and there be many Statutes
which Command them so to do.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>When a Writ of Error is brought out
of the Kings-Bench, be it either Error in
Process, or in Law, at whose Charge is it
to be done?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I see no reason for that; for the Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
is not in fault, who never begins a Suit
but by the advice of his Council Learned in
the Law, whom he pays for his Council
given. Is not this the fault of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor?
Nor when a Judge in the Common-Pleas
hath given an Erroneous Sentence, it
is always likely that the Judge of the Kings-Bench
will reverse the Judgment (though
there be no Question, but as you may find
in <hi>Bracton,</hi> and other Learned Men, he has
power to do it) because being Professors of
the same Common-Law, they are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
for the most part, to give the same Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
For Example; if Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> in the
last Terme that he sate Lord-Chief-Justice
in the Court of Common-Pleas, had
given an Erroneous Judgment, that when
he was removed, and made Lord-Chief-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the Kings-Bench, would therefore
have reversed the said Judgment, it is possi-
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54911:116"/>
he might, but not very likely. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I do believe there is some other power,
by the King constituted, to reverse Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Judgments, both in the Kings-Bench,
and in the Court of Common-Pleas.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I think not; for there is a Statute to
the contrary, made 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, <hi>Hen. 4. cap.</hi> 23. in
these words; Whereas, as well in Plea Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>al,
as in Plea Personal, after Judgment in
the Court of our Lord the King, the Parties
be made to come upon grievous pain, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
before the King himself, sometimes
before the Kings Council, and sometimes to
the Parliament to answer thereof anew, to
the great Impoverishing of the Parties afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
and to the subversion of the Common-Law
of the Land, it is ordained and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
that after Judgment given in the
Court of our Lord the King, the Parties, and
their Heirs shall be there in Peace, until the
Judgment be undone by Attaint, or by Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
if there be Error, as hath been used by
the Laws in the times of the Kings Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>This Statute is so far from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to that, I say, as it seemeth to me to
have been made expresly to confirm the
same: For the substance of the Statu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>e is,
that there shall be no Suit made by either of
the Parties for any thing adjudged, either
in the Kings-Bench, or Court of Common-Pleas,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54911:117"/>
before the Judgment be undone by
Error, or Corruption prov'd; and that this
was the Common-Law before the making
of this Statute, which could not be, except
there were (before this Statute) some Courts
authorised to examine, and correct such Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
as by the Plaintiff should be assign'd.
The inconvenience which by this Statute
was to be remedied was this, that often
Judgment given in the Kings Courts, by
which are meant in this place the Kings-Bench,
and Court of Common-Pleas, the
Party against whom the Judgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
did begin a new Suit, and cause his
Adversary to come before the King himself;
here by the King himself must be understood
the King in Person; for though in a Writ
by the words <hi>Coram nobis</hi> is understood the
Kings-Bench, yet in a Statute it is never so;
nor is it strange, seeing in those days the
King did usually sit in Court with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
to hear (as sometimes King <hi>James</hi>) and
sometimes the same Parties commenced
their Suit before the Privy-Council, though
the King were absent; and sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Parliament the former Judgment
yet standing. For remedy whereof, it was
ordained by this Statute, that no Man should
renew his Suit, till the former Judgment
was undone by Attaint, or Error; which
Reversing of a Judgment had been impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54911:117"/>
if there had been no Court (besides
the aforesaid two Courts) wherein the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
might be Assigned, Examin'd, and
Judg'd; for no Court can be esteemed in
Law, or Reason, a Competent Judge of its
own Errors. There was therefore before
this Statute some other Court existent for
the hearing of Errors, and Reversing of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Judgments. What Court this was
I enquire not yet, but I am sure it could
not be either the Parliament or the Privy-Council,
or the Court wherein the Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Judgment was given.</p>

of this Statute, <hi>cap.</hi> 18. much otherwise
than you do: For the Author of that Book
saith, that against an Erroneous Judgment
all Remedy is by this Statute taken away.
And though neither Reason, nor the Office

                  <p>Is there any mention of Chancery in
this Act? It cannot be examin'd before the
King and his Council, nor before the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
but you see that before the Statute
it was examin'd somewhere, and that this
Statute will have it examin'd there again.</p>
                  <p>And seeing the Chancery was altogether
the highest Office of Judicature in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for matter of Equity, and that the
Chancery is not here forbidden to examine
the Judgments of all other Courts, at least
it is not taken from it by this Statute. But
what Cases are there in this Chapter of the
Doctor and Student, by which it can be
made probable, that when Law, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or Law and Equity seem to oppugne
one another, the written Law should be

                  <p>Here again the want of Proof is the
want of Remedy; for if he can prove that
the Verdict given was false, the King can
give him remedy such way as himself shall
think best, and ought to do it, in case the

be again affirmed, to satisfie his Adversary

                     <hi>Hen.</hi>
4. 23. is by that of 27 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 8. taken
away, I do not find it so. I find indeed a
Diversity of opinion between the makers of
the former and the latter Statute, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
of the latter and Conclusion of the
former. The Preamble of the latter is;
forasmuch as Erroneous Judgments given in
the Court called the Kings-Bench, are only
to be reformed in the High Court of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
and the Conclusion of the former
is, that the contrary was Law in the times
of the Kings Progenitors. These are no
parts of those Laws, but Opinions only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54911:119"/>
the Antient Custom in that Case,
arising from the different Opinions of the
Lawyers in those different times, neither
Commanding, nor Forbidding any thing;
though of the Statutes themselves, the one
forbids that such Pleas be brought before
the Parliament, the other forbids it not:
But yet if after the Act of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. such a
Plea had been brought before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Parliament might have Heard,
and Determin'd it: For the Statute forbids
not that! nor can any Law have the force
to hinder the Law of any Jurisdiction what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they please to take upon them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is a Court of the King and of all the
People together, both Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Though it be, yet seeing the King
(as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> affirms, 4 <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 71.) hath
committed all his power Judicial, some to
one Court, and some to another, so as if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man would render himself to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the King, in such case where the
King hath committed all his power Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to others, such a render should be to no
effect. And p. 73. he saith farther; That
in this Court the Kings of this Realm have
sitten on the High Bench, and the Judges
of that Court on the Lower Bench, at his
feet; but Judicature belongeth only to the
Judges of that Court, and in his presence
they answer all Motions.</p>

                  <p>I cannot believe that Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi>
how much soever he desir'd to advance the
authority of himself, and other Justices of the
Common-Law, could mean that the King
in the Kings-Bench sate as a Spectator only,
and might not have answered all motions,
which his Judges answer'd, if he had seen
cause for it: For he knew that the King was
Supream Judge then in all causes Temporal,
and is now in all Causes both Temporal, and
Ecclesiastical; and that there is an exceeding
great penalty ordained by the Laws for them
that shall deny it. But Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> as he
had (you see) in many places before, hath put
a Fallacy upon himself, by not distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between Committing, and Transferring.
He that Transferreth his power, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
himself of it, but he that Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it to another to be Exercised in his
name, and under him, is still in the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the same power. And therefore
if a Man render himself; that is to say, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth
to the King from any Judge what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
the King may receive his Appeal;
and it shall be effectual.</p>

                  <p>Besides these 2 Courts, the Kings-Bench
for Pleas of the Crown, and the
Court of Common-Pleas for Causes Civil,
according to the Common-Law of <hi>England,</hi>
there is another Court of Justice, that hath
Jurisdiction in Causes both Civil, and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54911:120"/>
and is as Antient a Court, at least as
the Court of Common Pleas, and this is the
Court of the Lord Admiral, but the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
therein are according to the Laws of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the Causes to be
determin'd there are such as arise upon the
Marine Sea: For so it is ordain'd by divers
Statutes, and confirm'd by many Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>As for the Statutes they are always
Law, and Reason also; for they are made
by the Assent of all the Kingdom, but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
are Judgments one contrary to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
I mean divers Men, in divers Ages,
upon the same case give divers Judgments.
Therefore I will ask your Opinion once more
concerning any Judgments besides those of
the King, as to their validity in Law. But
what is the difference between the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the Court of Admiralty, and the
Court of Common-Law?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>One is, that the Court of Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
proceedeth by two Witnesses, without
any either Grand-Jury, to Indict, or Petty
to Convict, and the Judge giveth Sentence
according to the Laws Imperial, which of
old time were in force in all this part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
and now are Laws, not by the Will
of any other Emperor or Forraign Power,
but by the Will of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> that
have given them force in their own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54911:121"/>
the reason whereof seems to be, that
the causes that arise at Sea are very often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, and People of other Nations, such
as are Governed for the most part by the self
same laws Imperial.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>How can it precisely enough be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
at Sea, especially near the mouth
of a very great River, whether it be upon the
Sea, or within the Land? For the Rivers
also are, as well as their Banks, within, or
a part of one Country or other.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly the Question is difficult, and
there have been many Suits about it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Question has been, whose Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it is in.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Nor do I see how it can be decided,
but by the King himself, in case it be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
in the Lord Admirals Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But though there be in the Letters
Patents a power given to hold Plea in some
certain cases; to any of the Statutes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Admiralty the Justices of the
Common-Law may send a Prohibition to
that Court, to proceed in the Plea, though
it be with a <hi>non-obstante</hi> of any Statute.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Methinks that That should be against
the Right of the Crown, which cannot be
taken from it by any Subject: For that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s, that the King has
given away all his Judicial Power, is worth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54911:121"/>
nothing; because (as I have said before) he
cannot give away the Essential Rights of his
Crown, and because by a <hi>non-obstante</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
he is not deceived in his Grant.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But you may see by the Precedents
alledged by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> the contrary has
been perpetually practised.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I see not that perpetually; for who
can tell, but there may have been given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Judgments in such cases, which have
either been not preserv'd in the Records, or
else by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> (because they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his opinion) not alledged: For this
is possible, though you will not grant it to
be very likely; therefore I insist only upon
this, that no Record of a Judgment is a Law,
save only to the party Pleading, until he can
by Law reverse the former Judgment. And
as to the proceeding without Juries by two
sufficient Witnesses, I do not see what harm
can proceed from it to the Common-wealth,
nor consequently any just Quarrel that the
Justice of the Common-Law can have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their proceedings in the Admiralty:
For the Proof of a Fact in both Courts lyeth
meerly on the Witnesses, and the difference
is no more, but that in the Imperial-Law,
the Judge of the Court Judgeth of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the Witnesses, and the Jury doth
in a Court of Common-Law. Besides, if a
Court of Common-Law should chance to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54911:122"/>
Incroach upon the Jurisdiction of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
may not he send a prohibition to the
Court of Common-Law to forbid their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding?
I pray you tell me what Reason
there is for the one, more than for the other?</p>

                  <p>The Highest ordinary Court in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is the Court of Chancery, wherein the
Lord Chancellour, or otherwise Keeper of
the Great Seal is the only Judge. This
Court is very Antient, as appears by Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke, 4 Inst. p.</hi> 87. where he nameth
the Chancellors of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
King <hi>Edmund,</hi> and King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Confessor. His Office is given to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Letters Patents by the Kings delivery
to him of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and
whosoever hath the keeping of the Great
Seal of <hi>England</hi> hath the same, and the
whole Jurisdiction that the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
ever had by the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz. cap.
18.</hi> wherein it is declar'd, that such is, and
always has been the Common-Law. And
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says, he has his name of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
from the highest point of his Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
<hi>viz. a Cancellando;</hi> that is, from
Cancelling the Kings Letters Patents, by
drawing strokes through it like a Lattice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Very pretty. It is well enough known
that <hi>Cancellarius</hi> was a great Officer under
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54911:122"/>
the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> whereof this Island was
once a Member, and that the Office came
into this Kingdom, either with, or in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government. Also it
was long after the time of the 12 <hi>Caesars,</hi> that
this Officer was created in the State of <hi>Rome.</hi>
For till after <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> his time, the
Emperors did diligently enough take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of Causes and Complaints for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
given in the Courts of the Praetors,
which were in <hi>Rome</hi> the same that the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Common-Law are here; but by
the continual Civil Wars in after-times for
the choosing of Emperors, that diligence by
little and little ceased; and afterwards (as
I have Read in a very good Author of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Civil Law) the number of complaints
being much increased, and being more than
the Emperor could dispatch, he appointed
an Officer as his Clerk, to receive all such
Petitions; and that this Clerk caused a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to be made in a Room convenient, in
which partition-Wall, at the heighth of a
Mans reach, he placed at convenient distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
certain Bars; so that when a Suitor
came to deliver his Petition to the Clerk,
who was sometimes absent, he had no more
to do, but to throw in his Petition between
those Bars, which in <hi>Latin</hi> are called pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>Cancelli;</hi> not that any certain Form
of those Bars, or any Bars at all were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54911:123"/>
for they might have been thrown
over, though the whole space had been left
open; but because they were <hi>Cancelli,</hi> the
Clerk Attendant, and keeping his Office
there, was called <hi>Cancellarius:</hi> And any Court
Bar may properly enough be called <hi>Cancelli,</hi>
which does not signifie a Lattice; for that
is but a meer Conjecture grounded upon no
History nor Grammar, but taken up at first
(as is likely) by some Boy that could find no
other word in the Dictionary for a Lattice
but <hi>Cancelli.</hi> The Office of this Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
was at first but to Breviate the matter
of the Petitions, for the easing of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
but Complaints encreasing daily, they
were too many, considering other Businesses
more necessary for the Emperor to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and this caused the Emperor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Determination of them to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
again; what Reason doth Sir <hi>Edw.
Coke</hi> alledge to prove, that the highest point
of the Chancellors Jurisdiction is to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
his Masters Letters Patents, after they
were Sealed with his Masters Seal; unless
he hold Plea concerning the validity of
them, or of his Masters meaning in them, or
of the surreptitious getting of them, or of
the abusing of them, which are all causes of
Equity? Also, seeing the Chancellor hath
his Office only by the delivery of the Great
Seal, without any Instruction, or Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54911:123"/>
of the Process in his Court to be used;
it is manifest, that in all Causes whereof he
has the hearing, he may proceed by such
manner of hearing, and examining of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
(with Jury, or without Jury) as he
shall think fittest for the Exactness, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Equity of the Decrees. And
therefore, if he think the Custome of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
by Jury, according to the Custome
of <hi>England</hi> in Courts of Common-Law, tend
more to Equity (which is the scope of all
the Judges in the World, or ought to be) he
ought to use that method, or if he think
better of another proceeding, he may use
it, if it be not forbidden by a Statute.</p>

                  <p>As for this Reasoning of yours I think
it well enough; but there ought to be had
also a reverend respect to Customs not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable;
and therefore, I think, Sir <hi>Edw.
Coke</hi> says not amiss; that in such Cases,
where the Chancellor will proceed by the
Rule of the Common-Law, he ought to
deliver the Record in the Kings-Bench; and
also it is necessary for the Lord Chancellor

themselves, when they think there is need
to relieve a Man opprest by ill Witnesses, or
power of great Men prevailing on the Jury,
or by Error of the Jury, though it be in
case of Felony, may stay the Execution, and

deny, or Grant any Petitions in Parliament,
either as he thinks it necessary, as in this
place, or as he thinks it prejudicial, or not
prejudicial to his Royalty, as in the Answer
of the former Petition, which is a sufficient
proof, that no part of his Legislative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or any other Essential part of Royalty
can be taken from him by a Statute. Now
seeing it is granted, that Equity is the same
thing with the Law of Reason, and seeing
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke, 1 Inst. Sect.</hi> 21. Defines Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be a certain Reason comprehended in
no Writing, but consisting only in right
Reason, which interpreteth and amendeth
the Written-Law; I would fain know to
what end there should be any other Court
of Equity at all, either before the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
or any other Person, besides the Judges
of the Civil, or Common-Pleas? Nay I am
sure you can alledge none but this, that there
was a necessity of a Higher Court of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than the Courts of Common-Law, to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54911:125"/>
remedy the Errors in Judgment given by
the Justices of Inferior Courts, and the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
in Chancery were irrevocable, except
by Parliament, or by special Commission
appointed thereunto by the King.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says, that seeing
matters of Fact by the Common-Law are
Tryable by a Jury of 12 Men, this Court
should not draw the matter <hi>ad aliud Examen;
i. e.</hi> to another kind of Examination, <hi>viz.</hi>
by Deposition of Witnesses, which should
be but evidence to a Jury.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>To the Deposition of Witnesses any
more or less, then to evidence to the Lord-Chancellor?
'Tis not therefore another
kind of Examination; nor is a Jury more
capable of duly examining Witnesses than a
Lord-Chancellor. Besides, seeing all Courts
are bound to Judge according to Equity, and
that all Judges in a Case of Equity, may
sometimes be deceiv'd, what harm is there
to any Man, or to the State, if there be a
subordination of Judges in Equity, as well
as of Judges in Common-Law? Seeing it is
provided by an Act of parliament to avoid
Vexation, that <hi>Subpoenas</hi> shall not be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
till surety be found to satisfie the Party
so grieved and vexed for his Dammages and
Expences, if so be the matter may not be
made good which is contained in the Bill.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>There is another Statute of 31 <hi>Hen. 6.
cap.</hi> 2. wherein there is a Proviso cited by Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke</hi> in these words; <q>Provided, that
no matter determinable by the Laws of the
Realm, shall be by the said Act determined
in other Form, then after the course of the
same Law in the Kings Courts having the
Determination of the same Law.</q>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>This Law was made but for Seven
years, and never continued by any other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the motive of this Law was
the great Riots, Extortions, Oppressions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> used during the time of the Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>John Cade,</hi> and the Indictments and
Condemnations wrongfully had by this usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Authority; and thereupon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Ordained, that for 7 years following
no Man should disobey any of the Kings
Writs under the Great Seal, or should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to appear upon Proclamation before the
Kings Council, or in the Chancery, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to Riots, Extortions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the first
time he should lose, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherein there is
nothing at all concerning the Jurisdiction
of the Chancery, or any other Court, but
an extraordinary power given to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
and to the Kings Privy-Council, to
Determine of those Crimes which were not
before that time Tryable, but only by the
Kings-Bench, or special Commission: For
the Act was made expresly for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54911:126"/>
of a great Multitude of Crimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by those that had Acted by the said
<hi>Cade</hi>'s Authority; to which Act the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso
was added, which is here mention'd,
that the Proceeds in those Courts of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
and of the Kings Council should be
such, as should be used in the Courts, to
which the said Courts, before this Act was
made, do belong. That is to say, such cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as were Criminal, should be after the
order of the Kings-Bench, and such Causes
as were not Criminal, but only against E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
should be Tryed after the manner of
the Chancery, or in some cases according to
the Proceedings in the Exchequer. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
why Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> should cite a Statute
(as this is) above two hundred years before
expir'd, and other two Petitions; as if they
were Statutes, when they were not passed
by the King; unless he did it on purpose to
diminish (as he endeavours to do through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Institutes) the Kings Authority, or
to insinuate his own opinions among the
People for the Law of the Land: For that
also he endeavours by Inserting <hi>Latin</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
both in his Text, and in the Margin,
as if they were Principles of the Law of
Reason, without any Authority of Antient
Lawyers, or any certainty of Reason in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to make Men believe they are the
very grounds of the Law of <hi>England.</hi> Now
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54911:127"/>
as to the Authority you ascribe to Custome,
I deny that any Custome of its own Nature,
can amount to the Authority of a Law: For
if the Custom be unreasonable, you must
with all other Lawyers confess that it is no
Law, but ought to be abolished; and if the
Custom be reasonable, it is not the Custom,
but the Equity that makes it Law. For
what need is there to make Reason Law
by any Custom how long soever when the
Law of Reason is Eternal? Besides, you
cannot find in any Statute (though <hi>Lex &amp;
Consuetudo</hi> be often mentioned as things to
be followed by the Judges in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
that <hi>Consuetudines,</hi> that is to say, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
or Usages did imply any Long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of former time; but that it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
such Use, and Custom of proceeding,
as was then immediately in being before
the making of such Statute. Nor shall
you find in any Statute the word Common-Law,
which may not be there well Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
for any of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral;
for it is not the singularity of Process
used in any Court; that can distinguish it
so as to make it a different Law from the
Law of the whole Nation.</p>

                  <p>I think not; unless perhaps you may
say, that seeing the Judges, whether they
have many, or few causes to be heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, have but the same wages from
the King, they may be too much inclin'd
to put off the Causes they use to hear (for

of the Parties suing.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Seeing also all Judges ought to give
their Sentence according to Equity; if it
should chance that a Written Law should
be against the Law of Reason, which is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
I cannot Imagine in that Case how
any Judgment can be Righteous.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>It cannot be that a Written Law
should be against Reason: For nothing is
more reasonable than that every Man should
obey the Law, which he hath himself as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to; but that is not always the Law
which is signified by <hi>Grammatical</hi> Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Letter, but that which the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator
thereby intended should be in Force;
which Intention, I Confess, is a very hard
matter many times to pick out of the words
of the Statute, and requires great Ability
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54911:128"/>
of understanding, and greater Meditations,
and Considerations of such Conjuncture of
occasions, and Incommodities as needed a
new Law for a Remedy; for there is scarce
any thing so clearly written, that when the
Cause thereof is forgotten, may not be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by an ignorant Grammarian, or a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing
Logician, to the Injury, Oppression,
or perhaps Destruction of an honest Man.
And for this Reason, the Judges deserve
that Honour and Profit they enjoy; since
the Determination of what particular Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
every particular Court should have Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance,
is a thing not yet sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
and is in it self so difficult, as that
the Sages of the Law themselves (the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> will leave to Law it self)
are not yet agreed upon it; how is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for a Man that is no professed, or no
profound Lawyer, to take notice in what
Court he may Lawfully begin his Suit, or
give Council in it to his Client?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I confess that no Man can be bound
to take notice of the Jurisdiction of Courts,
till all the Courts be agreed upon it amongst
themselves; but what Rule to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by a Judge can have, so as never to
contradict the Law written, nor displease
his Legislator I understand not.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I think he may avoid both, if he
take care by his Sentence, that he neither

punish an Innocent, nor deprive him of his
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s not, in my Opinion, very difficult. And
though a Judge should (as all Men may do)
Erre in his Judgment, yet there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
such power in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> as
may content the Parties, either in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,

                  <p>In what Cases can the true Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Very many, whereof Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>
nameth 3, Fraud, Accident, and Breach of
Confidence; but there be many more; for
there be a very great many reasonable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
almost to every General Rule, which
the makers of the Rule could not foresee;
and very many words in every Statute, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
long ones, that are, as to <hi>Grammar,</hi>
of Ambiguous signification, and yet to them
that know well, to what end the Statute
was made, perspicuous enough; and many
Connections of doubtful reference, which
by a <hi>Grammarian</hi> may be Cavill'd at, though
the Intention of the Lawmaker be never so
perspicuous. And these are the difficulties
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54911:129"/>
which the Judges ought to Master, and can
do it in respect of their Ability for which
they are chosen, as well as can be hoped
for; and yet there are other Men can do
the same, or else the Judges places could
not be from time to time supplyed. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
commonly are the most able and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Men, and obliged by their profession to
Study Equity, because it is the Law of God,
and are therefore capable of being Judges in
a Court of Equity. They are the Men that
teach the People what is Sin; that is to say,
they are the Doctors in Cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
What reason then can you shew me,
why it is unfit, and hurtful to the Common-wealth,
that a Bishop should be a Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
as they were most often before the time
of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and since that time once in the
Raign of King <hi>James?</hi>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But Sir <hi>Ed.</hi> says, that soon after that
a Chancellor was made, which was no
Professor of the Law, he finds in the Rolls
of the Parliament a grievous Complaint by
the whole Body of the Realm, and a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the most wise and able Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Realm might be chosen Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>That Petition was Reasonable, but
it does not say which are Abler Men, the
Judges of the Common Law, or the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>That is not the great Question as to
the Ability of a Judge; both of one, and
the other there are Able Men in their own
way; but when a Judge of Equity has need,
almost in every Case, to consider as well the
Statute-Law, as the Law of Reason, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perform his Office perfectly, unless he
be also ready in the Statutes.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I see no great need he has to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the Statutes; in the hearing of a
Cause do the Judges of the Common-Law
Inform the Council at the Bar what the
Statute is, or the Council the Judges?</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Why may they not as well Inform
the Chancellor? Unless you will say, that
a Bishop understands not as well as a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
what is sense, when he hears it Read in
<hi>English.</hi> No; no; both the one, and the
other are able enough, but to be able enough
is not enough; when, not the difficulty of
the Case only, but also the Passion of the
Judge is to be Conquer'd. I forgot to tell
you of the Statute of the 36 <hi>Edw. 3. cap.</hi> 9.
That if any Person think himself grieved
contrary to any of the Articles above Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
or others contained in divers Statutes,
will come to the Chancery, or any for him,
and thereof make his Complaint, he shall
presently there have Remedy by force of the
said Articles, and Statutes, without elsewhere
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54911:130"/>
pursuing to have Remedy. By the words of
this Statute it is very apparent, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the Chancery may hold Plea up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Complaint of the Party grieved, in
any Case Tryable at the Common-Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the party shall have present Remedy
in that Court, by force of this Act, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pursuing for Remedy elsewhere.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; but Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> Answers this
Objection, 4 <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 82. in this manner.
These words, says he, <hi>He shall have Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
signifie no more but that he shall have
presently there a remedial Writ grounded
upon those Statutes to give him Remedy at
the Common-Law.</p>

                  <p>Very like Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> thought as
soon as the Party had his Writ, he had his
Remedy, though he kept the Writ in his
Pocket, without pursuing his Complaint
elsewhere; or else he thought, that in the
Common-Bench was not elsewhere than in
the Chancery.</p>

                  <p>Let us stop here; for this which you
have said satisfies me, that seek no more
than to distinguish between Justice, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
and from it I Conclude, that Justice
fulfils the Law, and Equity Interprets the
Law; and amends the Judgments given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same Law: Wherein I depart not
much from the Definition of Equity, cited
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54911:130"/>
in Sir <hi>Edw. Coke, 1 Inst. Sect. 21. viz.</hi> Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is a certain perfect Reason that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth,
and Amendeth the Law Written;
though I Construe it a little otherwise than
he would have done; for no one can mend
a Law but he that can make it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I say not it amends the Law, but the
Judgments only when they are Erroneous.
And now let us Consider of Crimes in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
(the Pleas whereof are commonly
called the Pleas of the Crown) and of the
punishments belonging to them; and first
of the Highest Crime of all which is High
Treason. Tell me what is High Treason.</p>

                     <hi>THe first Statute that declareth what
is High Treason, is the Statute of
the</hi> 25 Edw. 3. <hi>in these words.</hi> Whereas di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Opinions have been before this time, in
what Case Treason shall be said, and in what
not; the King, at the Request of the Lords,
and of the Commons, hath made Declaration
in the manner as hereafter follows; That is
to say, when a Man doth Compass, or Imagine
the Death of our Lord the King, of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the Queen, or of their Eldest Son and Heir;
or if a Man doth violate the Kings Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or the Kings Eldest Daughter unmarried,
or the Wife of the Kings Eldest Son and Heir;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54911:131"/>
or if a Man do Levy War against our Lord
the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the
Kings Enemies in his Realm, giving to them
Aid, and Comfort in the Realm, or elsewhere,
and thereof be provably Attainted by open
Deed, by People of their Condition. And if
a Man Counterfeit the Kings Great, or Privy-Seal,
or his Money. And if a Man bring
false Money into this Realm Counterfeit to the
Money of <hi>England,</hi> as the Money called Lush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
or other like to the said Money of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
knowing the Money to be false, to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
and make payment in deceit of our
said Lord the King, and of his People. And
if a Man slay the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the
Kings Justices of the one Bench, or the other,
Justices in Eyre, or Justices of Assises, and all
other Justices Assigned to Hear, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
being in their Places, and doing their
Offices. And is to be understood in the Cases
above rehearsed, that That ought to be adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Treason, which extends to our Royal Lord
the King, and his Royal Majesty, and of such
Treason the Forfeiture of the Escheats pertains
to our Lord the King, as well the Lands and
Tenements holden of others as himself. And
moreover there is another manner of Treason;
that is to say, when a Servant Slayeth his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or a Wife her Husband; or when a Man
Secular, or Religious slayeth his Prelate, to
whom he oweth Faith, and Obedience; and of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54911:131"/>
such Treason the Escheats ought to pertain to
every Lord of his own Fee. And because many
other like Cases of Treason may happen in time
to come, which a Man cannot think, nor declare
at this present time, it is accorded, that if any
Case supposed Treason, which is not above spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
doth happen before any Justices, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
shall tarry without giving any Judgment
of the Treason till the Cause be shewed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
before the King and his Parliament, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it ought to be adjudged Treason, or other
Felony.</p>

                  <p>I desir'd to understand what Treason
is, wherein no Enumeration of Facts can
give me satisfaction. Treason is a Crime
of it self, <hi>Malum in se,</hi> and therefore a Crime
at the Common-Law, and High Treason the
Highest Crime at the Common-Law that
can be: And therefore not the Statute only,
but Reason without a Statute makes it a
Crime. And this appears by the Preamble,
where it is intimated, that all Men, though
of divers Opinions did Condemn it by the
name of Treason, though they knew not
what Treason meant, but were forced to
request the King to determine it. That
which I desire to know is, how Treason
might have been defined without the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
by a Man that has no other faculty to
make a Definition of it, than by meer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reason.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>When none of the Lawyers have
done it, you are not to expect that I should
undertake it on such a sudden.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>You know that <hi>Salus Populi</hi> is <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prema
Lex;</hi> that is to say, the safety of the
People, is the highest Law; and that the
safety of the People of a Kingdom consisteth
in the safety of the King, and of the strength
necessary to defend his People, both against
Forraign Enemies, and Rebellious Subjects.
And from this I infer, that to Compass (that
is) to design the Death of the then present
King, was High Treason before the making
of this Statute, as being a Designing of a
Civil War, and the Destruction of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
2. That the Design to Kill the Kings
Wife, or to violate her Chastity, as also to
violate the Chastity of the Kings Heir ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
or of his Eldest Daughter unmarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as tending to the Destruction of the
certainty of the Kings Issue, and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
by raising of Contentions about the
Crown, and Destruction of the People in
Succeeding time by Civil War, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
High Treason before this Statute. 3.
That to Levy war against the King within
the Realm, and Aiding the Kings Enemies,
either within, or without the Realm, are
tending to the Kings Destruction, or Dishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
and was High Treason, before this
Statute by the Common-Law. 4. That
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54911:132"/>
Counterfeiting the principal Seals of the
Kingdom, by which the King Governeth
his People, tendeth to the Confusion of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and Consequently to the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the People, and was therefore Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
before the Statute. 5. If a Souldier
design the Killing of his General, or other
Officer in time of Battel, or a Captain Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doubtfully with his Troops, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to gain the Favour of him that shall
chance to get the Victory, it tendeth to the
Destruction both of King, and People, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King be present, or absent, and
was High Treason before the Statute. 6. If
any Man had Imprisoned the Kings Person,
he had made him incapable of Defending
his People, and was therefore High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
before the Statute. 7. If any Man had,
with design to raise Rebellion against the
King, Written, or by words advisedly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
denyed the King Regnant to be their
Lawful King, he that wrought, Preached,
or spoke such words, living then under the
Protection of the Kings Laws, it had been
High Treason before the Statute for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
aforesaid. And perhaps there may be
some other Cases upon this Statute, which
I cannot presently think upon; but the
Killing of a Justice, or other Officer as is
determin'd by the Statute, is not otherwise
High Treason, but by the Statute. And to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54911:133"/>
distinguish that which is Treason by the
Common-Law, from all other Inferior
Crimes; we are to Consider, that if such
High Treason should take effect, it would
destroy all Laws at once; and being done
by a Subject, 'tis a return to Hostility by
Treachery; and consequently, such as are
Traytors may by the Law of Reason be
dealt withal, as Ignoble and Treacherous
Enemies; but the greatest of other Crimes,
for the most part; are breaches of one only,
or at least of very few Laws.</p>

                  <p>Whether this you say be true, or
false, the Law is now unquestionable by a
Statute made in 1 and 2 of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
whereby there is nothing to be esteemed
Treason, besides those few Offences special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned in the Act of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Amongst these great Crimes the
greatest is that which is Committed by one
that has been trusted, and loved by him
whose Death he so designeth: For a Man
cannot well take heed of those, whom he
thinks he hath obliged, whereas an open
Enemy gives a Man warning before he Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
And this it is for which the Statute
hath declared, that it is another kind of
Treason, when a Servant killeth his Master,
or Mistress, or a Wife killeth her Husband,
or a Clerk killeth his Prelate; and I should
think it petty Treason also, though it be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54911:133"/>
not within the words of the Statute; when
a Tenant in Fee, that holdeth by Homage,
and Fealty, shall kill the Lord of his Fee;
for Fealty is an Oath of Allegiance to the
Lord of the Fee; saving he may not keep
his Oath in any thing Sworn to, if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King. For Homage, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in a Statute of 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
submission that is possible to be made to
one Man by another; for the Tenant shall
hold his Hands together between the Hands
of his Landlord, and shall say thus; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
your Man from this day forth for Life,
for Member and for Worldly Honour, and
shall owe that my Faith for the Lands that I
shall hold of you, saving the Faith that I
owe unto our Soveraign Lord the King, and
to many other Lords: Which Homage, if
made to the King, is Equivalent to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of simple obedience, and if made to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Lord, there is nothing excepted but
the Allegiance to the King; and that which
is called Fealty, is but the same Confirmed
by an Oath.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But Sir <hi>Edw. Coke, 4 Inst.</hi> p. 11. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that a Traytor is in Legal understanding
the Kings Enemy; for Enemies (saith he)
be those that be out of the Allegiance of the
King; and his Reason is; because, if a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
joyn with a Forraign Enemy, and come
into <hi>England</hi> with him, and be taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54911:134"/>
here, he shall not be Ransomed, or
proceeded with as an Enemy shall, but he
shall be taken as a Traytor to the King.
Whereas an Enemy coming in open Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and taken, shall either be Executed
by Martial-Law, or Ransomed; for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Indicted of Treason, for that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was in the Protection and Ligeance of
the King, and the Indictment of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
saith, <hi>Contra Ligeantiam suam debitam.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>This is not an Argument worthy of
the meanest Lawyer. Did Sir <hi>Edw. Coke.</hi>
think it is possible for a King Lawfully to
kill a Man, by what Death soever without
an Indictment, when it is manifestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
he was his open Enemy? Indictment is
a form of Accusation peculiar to <hi>England,</hi>
by the Command of some King of <hi>England,</hi>
and retained still, and therefore a Law to
this Country of <hi>England;</hi> but if it were not
Lawful to put a Man to Death otherwise
than by an Indictment no Enemy could be
put to Death at all in other Nations, because
they proceed not, as we do, by Indictment.
Again, when an open Enemy is taken and
put to Death by Judgment of Martial-Law;
it is not the Law of the General or Council
of War, that an Enemy shall be thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with, but the Law of the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in their Commissions; such as from
time to time the Kings have thought fit, in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54911:134"/>
whose Will it always resteth, whether an
open Enemy, when he is taken, shall be put
to Death, or no, and by what Death; and
whether he shall be Ransomed, or no, and
at what price? Then for the Nature of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
by Rebellion; is it not a return to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility?
What else does Rebellion signifie?
<hi>William</hi> the Conqueror Subdued this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
some he Killed; some upon promise
of future obedience he took to Mercy, and
they became his Subjects, and swore Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to him; if therefore they renew the
War against him, are they not again open
Enemies; or if any of them lurking under
his Laws, seek occasion thereby to kill him,
secretly, and come to be known, may he
not be proceeded against as an Enemy, who
though he had not Committed what he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
yet had certainly a Hostile Design?
Did not the long Parliament declare all
those for Enemies to the State that opposed
their Proceedings against the late King? But
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> does seldom well distinguish
when there are two divers Names for one
and the same thing; though one contain
the other, he makes them always different,
as if it could not be that one and the same
Man should be both an Enemy, and a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
But now let us come to his Comment
upon this Statute; The Statute says (as it
is Printed in <hi>English</hi>) when a Man doth
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54911:135"/>
Compass, or Imagine the Death of our Lord
the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What is the meaning of the
word Compassing, or Imagining?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>On this place Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says, that
before the making of this Act, <hi>Voluntas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putabatur
pro facto,</hi> the Will was taken for
the Deed. And so saith <hi>Bracton, Spectatur
Voluntas, &amp; non Exitus; &amp; nihil interest u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum
quis occidat, aut causam praebeat;</hi> That
is to say, the Cause of the killing: Now Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says, this was the Law before the
Statute; and that to be a Cause of the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
is to declare the same by some open
Deed tending to the Execution of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
or which might be Cause of Death.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Is there any <hi>English-man</hi> can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that to Cause the Death of a Man,
and to declare the same is all one thing?
And if this were so, and that such was the
Common-Law before the Statute, by what
words in the Statute is it taken away?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not taken away, but the manner
how it must be prov'd is thus Determin'd,
that it must be prov'd by some open Deed,
as providing of Weapons, Powder, Poyson,
Assaying of Armour, sending of Letters,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But what is the Crime it self which
this Statute maketh Treason? For as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the words, To Compass, or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the Kings Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54911:135"/>
(as it is in the <hi>English</hi>) is the only thing
which is made High Treason; so that not
only the killing, but the Design is made
High Treason; or as it is in the <hi>French</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
<hi>Fait Compasser;</hi> That is to say, the
causing of others to Compass, or Design the
Kings Death is High Treason; and the
words <hi>par overt fait,</hi> are not added as a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification
of any Treason, or other Crime,
but only of the Proof that is requir'd by the
Law. Seeing then the Crime is the Design
and Purpose to kill the King, or cause him
to be killed, and lyeth hidden in the Breast
of him that is Accused; what other Proof
can there be had of it than words Spoken or
Written. And therefore if there be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Witness, that he by words Declared,
that he had such a Design, there can be no
Question, but that he is Comprehended
within this Statute: Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> doth not
deny, but that if he Confess this Design, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Word, or Writing, but that he is
within the Statute. As for that Common
saying, that bare words may make a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
but not a Traytor, which Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>
on this occasion maketh use of, they are to
little purpose; seeing that this Statute ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not the words High Treason, but the
Intention, whereof the words are but a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony:
and that Common-saying is false
as it is generally Pronounced; for there were
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54911:136"/>
divers Statutes made afterwards, though
now expir'd, which made bare words to be
Treason without any other Deed: As, 1 <hi>El.
cap. 6. &amp; 13. El. cap.</hi> 1. If a Man should Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
Preach, that the King were an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or that the Right of the Crown belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to any other than the King that Reigned,
there is no doubt but it were Treason, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
within this Statute of <hi>E.</hi> 3. but also within
the Statute of 1 <hi>Ed. 6. c.</hi> 12. which are both
still in Force.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Not only so; but if a Subject should
counsel any other Man to kill the King,
Queen, or Heir apparent to the Crown, it
would at this day be Judged High Treason;
and yet it is no more than bare words. In
the third year of King <hi>James, Henry Garnet,</hi>
a Jesuit-Priest, to whom some of the Gun-Powder
Traytors had Revealed their design
by way of Confession, gave them Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without any Caution taken for their
desisting from their purpose, or other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
against the danger, was therefore Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and Executed as a Traytor, though
such Absolution were nothing else but bare
words. Also I find in the Reports of Sir
<hi>John Davis,</hi> Attorney-General for <hi>Ireland;</hi>
that in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th, a
Man was Condemned of Treason, for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King was a Natural Fool, and unfit
to Govern; but yet this Clause in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54911:136"/>
of <hi>Edw. 3. viz.</hi> That the Compassing
there mentioned ought to be proved by some
<hi>Overt Act,</hi> was by the Framers of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
not without great Wisdom, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
inserted: For as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> very
well observeth, when Witnesses are Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
concerning words only, they never or
very rarely agree precisely about the words
they Swear to.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I deny not but that it was wisely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
done. But the Question is not here
of the Treason (which is either Fact, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign)
but of the Proof, which, when it is
doubtful, is to be Judged by a Jury of 12
Lawful Men: Now whether think you is it
a better Proof of a Mans Intention to kill,
that he declares that same with his own
Mouth, so as it may be Witnessed, or that
he provide Weapons, Powder, Poyson, or
Assay Arms? If he utter his Design by words,
the Jury has no more to do than to consider
the Legallity of the VVitnesses, the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their Testimonies, or whether the
words were spoken advisedly? For they
might have been uttered in a Disputation
for Exercise only, or when he that spake
them had not the use of Reason, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
any Design, or wish at all towards the
Execution of what he talked of: But how a
Jury from providing, or buying of Armour,
or buying of Gun-Powder, or from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54911:137"/>
overt Act, not Treason in it self, can
infer a Design of Murdering the King, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there appear some words also, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what end he made such Provision, I
cannot easily conceive. Therefore as the
Jury on the whole matter VVords and
Deeds shall ground their Judgment concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Design, or not Design, so, in Reason,
they ought to give Verdict. But to come
to the Treason of Counterfeiting the Great,
or Privy-Seal, seeing there are so many
ways for a Cheating Fellow to make use of
these Seals, to the Cousening of the King,
and his People; why are not all such abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
High-Treason, as well as the making of
a false Seal?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>So they are: For Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
a Record of one that was Drawn, and
Hang'd for taking the Great Seal from an
expir'd Patent, and fastning it to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Commission to gather Money: But
he approveth not the Judgment, because it
is the Judgment for Petty Treason; also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Jury did not find him Guilty of
the Offence laid in the Indictment, which
was the Counterfeiting of the Great-Seal,
but found the special matter, for which the
Offender was Drawn, and Hang'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Seeing this Crime of taking the Great
Seal from one VVriting, and fastning it to
another was not found High Treason by the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54911:137"/>
Jury, nor could be found upon special mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be the other kind of Treason menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the same Statute; what ground had
either the Jury to find it Treason, or the
Judge to pronounce Sentence upon it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot tell. Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> seems to
think it a false Record; for hereupon he
saith by way of Admonition to the Reader,
that hereby it appeareth how dangerous
it is to Report a Case by the Ear.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>True; but he does not make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that this Case was untruly Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but on the contrary confesseth, that
he had perused the same Record; and a
Man may (if it may be done without Proof
of the Falsity) make the same Objection to
any Record whatsoever. For my part, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Crime produced the same mischief
that ariseth from Counterfeiting, I think it
reason to understand it as within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute:
And for the Difference between the
Punishments (which are both of them Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital)
I thing it is not worthy to be stood
upon; seeing Death, which is, <hi>Vltimum
supplicium,</hi> is a satisfaction to the Law; as
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> himself hath in another place
affirm'd. But let us now proceed to other
Crimes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Appendent to this is another Crime
called Misprision of Treason; which is the
Concealing of it by any Man that knows
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54911:138"/>
it; and it is called Misprision from the <hi>French
Mespriser,</hi> which signifies to contemn, or
undervalue; for it is no small Crime in any
Subject, so little to take to Heart a known
danger to the Kings Person, and Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to the whole Kingdom, as not to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
not only what he knows, but also what
he suspecteth of the same, that the Truth
therefore may be Examin'd. But for such
Discovery, tho the thing prove false, the
Discoverer shall not, as I think, be taken
for a false Accuser; if for what he directly
affirms, he produce a reasonable Proof, and
some probability for his Suspition; for else
the Concealment will seem justifiable by the
Interest, which is to every Man allowed in
the preservation of himself from pain and
dammage.</p>

                  <p>What is the meaning of the word
Felony? Does it signifie any thing that is
in its own Nature a Crime, or that only
which is made a Crime by some Statute?
for I remember some Statutes that make it
Felony to Transport Horses, and some other
things out of the Kingdom; which Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
before such Statutes made, and
after the Repealing of the same, was no
greater Crime than any other usual Traffick
of a Merchant.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> derives the word Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from the Latin word <hi>Fel,</hi> the Gall of a
living Creature, and accordingly defines Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
to be an Act done <hi>Animo Felleo;</hi> that

                  <p>Etymologies are no Definitions, and
yet when they are true they give much
light towards the finding out of a Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but this of Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s carries with
it very little of Probability; for there be
many things made Felony by the Statute-Law,
that proceed not from any bitterness

the contrary.</p>

                  <p>All that I, or, I think, any other
can say in this matter will amount to no
more than a reasonable Conjecture, insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to sustain any point of Controversie in
Law. The word is not to be found in any
of the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, set forth by Mr.
<hi>Lambert,</hi> nor in any Statute Printed before
that of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> there it is found.
Now <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was made in the time
of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 3d, Grand-Child to <hi>Hen.</hi> the 2d,
Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> a <hi>French-man</hi> born, and
bred in the Heart of <hi>France,</hi> whose Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
might very well retain many words
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54911:139"/>
of his Ancestors the <hi>German-Franks,</hi> as
ours doth of the <hi>German-Saxons;</hi> as also
many words of the Language of the <hi>Gaules,</hi>
as the <hi>Gaules</hi> did retain many words of the
<hi>Greek</hi> Colonie planted at <hi>Marseilles.</hi> But
certain it is the <hi>French</hi> Lawyers at this day
use the word Felon, just as our Lawyers use
the same; whereas the Common People
of <hi>France</hi> use the word <hi>Filou</hi> in the same
sence; but <hi>Filou</hi> signifieth not the Man that
hath committed such an Act, as they call
Felony; but the Man that maketh it his
Trade to maintain himself by the breaking
and contemning of all Laws generally; and
comprehendeth all those unruly People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Cheaters, Cut-purses, Pick-locks, Catch-Cloaks,
Coyners of false Money, Forgers,
Thieves, Robbers, Murderers, and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
make use of Iniquity on Land, or Sea,
as a Trading, or Living. The <hi>Greeks</hi> upon
the Coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> where <hi>Homer</hi> liv'd, were
they that Planted the Colony of <hi>Marseilles;</hi>
they had a word that signified the same with
Felon, which was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Filetes,</hi> and this
<hi>Filetes</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> signifies properly the same
that a Felon signifies with us: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Homer</hi> makes <hi>Apollo</hi> to call <hi>Mercury</hi>

upon the truth of this Etymologie; but it
is certainly more rational than the <hi>Animus

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54911:139"/>
it self it is manifest enough, that which
we now call Murder, Robbery, Theft, and
other practices of Felons, are the same that
we call Felony, and Crimes in their own
nature without the help of Statute. Nor is
it the manner of punishment that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
the nature of one Crime from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but the mind of the Offender and the
Mischief he intendeth, considered together
with the Circumstances of Person, Time,

                  <p>Murder is the Killing of a Man upon
Malice forethought, as by a Weapon, or by
Poyson, or any way, if it be done, upon

the Killing of a Man in cold Blood.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I think there is a good definition of
Murder set down by Statute, 52 <hi>Hen. 3. cap.
25.</hi> in these words: Murder from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
shall not be Judged before our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where it is found misfortune only, but
it shall take place in such as are slain by Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.
And Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> Interpreting this
Statute, 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 148. saith; That the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
before this Statute was, that he that
Killed a Man by misfortune, as by doing any
Act that was not against Law, and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Intent, if the Death of a Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued,
this was adjudged Murder. But I
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54911:140"/>
find no Proof that he alledgeth, nor find I any
such Law amongst the Laws of the <hi>Saxons,</hi>
set forth by Mr. <hi>Lambert.</hi> For the word,
it is (as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> noteth) old <hi>Saxon,</hi> and
amongst them it signified no more than a
Man slain in the Field, or other place, the
Author of his death not known. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
hereunto, <hi>Bracton,</hi> who lived in the
time of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> defineth it <hi>fol.</hi> 134,
thus; Murder is the secret killing of a Man,
when none besides the killer, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
saw, or knew it; so that it was not
known who did it, nor fresh-suit could be
made after the doer; therefore every such
killing was called Murder before it could be
known whether it could be by Felony, or
not: For a Man may be found dead that
kills himself, or was Lawfully kill'd by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
This name of Murder came to be
the more horrid, when it was secretly done,
for that it made every Man to consider of
their own danger, and him that saw the
dead Body to boggle at it, as a Horse will
do at a dead Horse; and to prevent the
same they had Laws in force to Amerce
the Hundred where it was done, in a sum
defined by Law to be the Price of his Life:
For in those dayes the lives of all sorts of
Men were valued by Money; and the value
set down in their Written Laws. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> was mistaken in that he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54911:140"/>
thought that killing a Man by misfortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge</hi> was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Murder, and those secret Murders were
abominated by the People, for that they
were lyable to so great a Pecuniary Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for suffering the Malefactor to escape.
But this grievance was by <hi>Canutus,</hi> when
he Reign'd, soon eased: For he made a
Law, that the Countrey in this Case, should
not be Charged, unless he were an <hi>English-man</hi>
that was so slain; but if he were a
<hi>French-man</hi> (under which name were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
all Forraigners, and especially
the <hi>Normans</hi>) though the slayer escaped,
the County was not to be Amerced. And
this Law, though it were very hard, and
Chargeable when an <hi>English-man</hi> was so
slain, for his Friend to prove he was an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-man,</hi>
and also unreasonable to deny the
Justice to a stranger; yet was it not Repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
till the 14th of King <hi>Ed.</hi> the 3d. By this
you see that Murder is distinguished from
Homicide by the Statute-Laws, and not by
any Common-Law without the Statute;
and that it is comprehended under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
name of Felony.</p>

                  <p>And so also is Petit Treason, and I
think so is High Treason also; for in the
abovesaid Statute in the 25 <hi>Ed. 3d.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Treasons there is this Clause. And
because that many other like Cases of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54911:141"/>
may happen in time to come, which
a Man cannot think, or declare at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time; it is accorded, that if any other
Case, supposed Treason which is not above
specified, doth happen before any the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices,
the Justices shall tarry without any
going to Judgment of the Treason, till the
Cause be shewed, and declared before the
King and his Parliament whether it be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or other Felony; which thereby shews
that the King and Parliament thought that
Treason was one of the sorts of Felony.</p>

this word Felony was of so large an extent,

it was resolved, that in the Kings
Pardon, or Charter, this word Felony should

                  <p>Have Justices of Assize any Power

Or in the Question in what Case Felony

Determine; as in the Question in what
Case Treason shall be said it is referred by
the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3d. to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
I think not; and yet perhaps they
may be disobliged to disallow a Pardon
of Treason, when mentioning all Felonies
it nameth not Treason, nor specifies it by

                  <p>Another kind of Homicide there is

Quarrel, during the heat of Blood.</p>

his Sword did it of Malice forethought,
though not long forethought; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be Felony or no, it may be doubted.
It is true, that the harm done is the same as
if it had been done by Felony; but the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of the Intention was nothing near so
great. And supposing it had been done by
Felony, then 'tis manifest by the Statute of
<hi>Marlebridge,</hi> that it was very Murder. And
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54911:142"/>
when a Man for a word, or a trifle shall
draw his Sword, and kill another Man, can
any Man imagine that there was not some
Precedent Malice?</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis very likely there was Malice
more or less, and therefore the Law hath
Ordained for it a punishment equal to that
of Murder, saving that the Offender shall
have the Benefit of his Clergy.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>The Benefit of Clergy comes in upon
another account, and importeth not any
extenuation of the Crime; for it is but a
Relick of the old usurped Papal priviledge,
which is now by many Statutes so pared off,
as to spread but to few Offences, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Legal kind of Conveying Mercy, not

                  <p>The work of a Judge you see is very

faculty of well distinguishing of Dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of such Cases as Common Judgments
think to be the same. A small Circumstance
may make a great Alteration, which a Man

                  <p>A Third kind of Homicide is when
a Man kills another, either by misfortune,
or in a necessary defence of himself, or of
the King, or of his Laws; for such killing
is neither Felony, nor Crime, saving (as
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says, 4. <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 56.) that if the
Act that a Man is a doing when he kills an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Man be Unlawful, then it is Murder.
As if <hi>A.</hi> meaneth to steal a Deer in the Park
of <hi>B.</hi> Shooteth at the Deer, and by the glance
of the Arrow killeth a Boy that is hidden
in a Bush; this is Murder, for that the Act
was Unlawful; but if the owner of the
Park had done the like, shooting at his own
Deer, it had been by Misadventure, and no
Felony.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>This is not so distinguished by any
Statute, but is the <hi>Commonly</hi> only of Sir <hi>Ed.
Coke.</hi> I believe not a word of it. If a Boy
be Robbing an Apple-tree, and falling thence
upon a Man that stands under it, and breaks
his Neck, but by the same chance saveth his
own Life, Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> it seems, will have
him Hanged for it, as if he had fallen of
prepensed Malice. All that can be called
Crime in this Business is but a simple Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spass,
to the dammage perhaps of sixpence
or a shilling. I confess the Trespass was an
Offence against the Law, but the falling was
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54911:143"/>
none, nor was it by the Trespass, but by the
falling that the Man was slain; and as he
ought to be quit of the killing, so he ought
to make Restitution for the Trespass. But
I believe the Cause of Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
was his not well understanding of
<hi>Bracton,</hi> whom he cites in the Margin: For
1206 he saith thus: <hi>Sed hic erit distinguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,
utrum quis dederit operam rei licitae, vel
illicitae; si illicitae, ut si bapidem projiciebat
quis versus locum per quem consueverunt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
transitum facere, vel dum insequitur
equum, vel bovem, &amp; aliquis ab equo, vel a
bove percussus fuerit, &amp; hujusmodi, hoc impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur
ei, i. e.</hi> But here we are to distinguish
whether a Man be upon a Lawful, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
business; if an unlawful, as he that
throws a stone into a place, where Men use
to pass; or if he chase a Horse, or an Ox,
and thereby the Man be stricken by the
Horse, or the Ox, this shall be imputed to
him: And it is most reasonable: For the
doing of such an unlawful Act as is here
meant, is a sufficient Argument of a Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
purpose, or at least a hope to kill some
body, or other, and he cared not whom;
which is worse than to design the death of
a certain Adversary, which nevertheless is
Murder. Also on the contrary, though the
business a Man is doing be Lawful, and it
chanceth sometimes that a Man be slain
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54911:143"/>
thereby; yet may such killing be Felony.
For if a Car-man drive his Cart through
<hi>Cheapside</hi> in a throng of People, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he kill a Man; though he bare him no
Malice, yet because he saw there was very
great danger, it may reasonably be inferr'd,
that he meant to adventure the killing of
some body, or other, though not of him
that was kill'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>He is a Felon also that killeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
voluntarily, and is called, not only by
Common Lawyers, but also in divers Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Laws,
<hi>Felo de se.</hi>

by Statutes are equivalent to Definitions;
but I conceive not how any Man can bear
<hi>Animum felleum,</hi> or so much Malice towards
himself, as to hurt himself voluntarily, much
less to kill himself; for naturally, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
the Intention of every Man aimeth
at somewhat, which is good to himself, and
tendeth to his preservation: And therefore,
methinks, if he kill himself, it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
that he is not <hi>compos mentis,</hi> but by
some inward Torment or Apprehension of
somewhat worse than Death, Distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <p>How can that be proved of a Man
dead; especially if it cannot be proved by
any Witness, that a little before his death
he spake as other men used to do. This is a
hard place; and before you take it for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law
it had need to be clear'd.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I'le think on't. There's a Statute
of 3 <hi>Hen. 7. c.</hi> 14. which makes it Felony
in any of the Kings Houshold-Servants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the degree of a Lord, to Compass the
Death of any of the Kings Privy-Council.
The words are these; That from henceforth
the Steward, Treasurer, and Controuler
of the Kings House for that time being, or
one of them, have full Authority and Power,
to inquire by 12 sad Men, and discreet Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Chequer-Roll of the King's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Houshold. If any Servant, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his Servant Sworn, and his name
put into the Chequer-Roll, whatsoever he
be serving in any manner, Office, or Room,
reputed, had, or taken under the State of
a Lord, make any Confederacies, Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
Conspiracies, or Imaginations with
any Person to Destroy, or Murder the King,
or any Lord of this Realm, or any other
Person sworn to the Kings Council, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Treasurer, or Controuler of the Kings
House. And if such Misdoers shall be found
Guilty by Confession, or otherwise, that the
said Offence shall be Judged Felony.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>It appears by this Statute, that not
only the Compassing the Death (as you say)
of a Privy-Councellor, but also of any Lord
of this Realm is Felony; if it be done by
Any of the Kings Houshold Servants that is
not a Lord.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>No; Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> upon these words,
any Lord of this Realm, or other Person
Sworn of the Kings Council infers 4 <hi>Inst.</hi>
p. 38. that is to be understood of such a
Lord only as is a Privy-Councellor.</p>

                  <p>For barring of the Lords of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from this Priviledge, he strains this
Statute a little farther (in my Opinion) than
it reacheth of it self. But how are such
Felonies to be Tryed?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>The Indictment is to be found, before
the Steward, Treasurer, and Controuler of
the Kings House, or one of them, by 12
of the Kings Houshold Servants. The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit
Jury for the Tryal must be 12 other of
the Kings Servants, and the Judges are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the Steward, Treasurer, and Controu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the Kings House, or 2 of them; and
yet I see that these Men are not usually
great Students of the Law.</p>

                  <p>You may hereby be assur'd, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King and Parliament were very
much overseen in choosing such Officers
perpetually for the time being, to be Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in a Tryal at the Common-Law, or else
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54911:145"/>
that Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> presumes too much, to
appropriate all the Judicature, both in Law,
and Equity, to the Common-Lawyers; as
if neither Lay-Persons, Men of Honour,
nor any of the Lords Spiritual, who are the
most versed in the Examination of Equity,
and Cases of Conscience, when they hear
the Statutes Read, and Pleaded, were unfit
to Judge of the intention and meaning of
the same. I know, that neither such great
Persons, nor Bishops have ordinarily so
much spare time from their ordinary Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
as to be so skilful as to Plead Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
at the Bar; but certainly they are, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Bishops, the best able to Judge of
matters of Reason; that is to say (by Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s Confession) of matters (except
of Blood) at the Common-Law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Another sort of Felony, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Man-slaughter, is Robbery; and by Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke, 4 Inst.</hi> p. 68. defined thus, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
by the Common-Law is a Felony com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by a violent Assault upon the Person
of another, by putting him in fear, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away from him his Money, or other
Goods of any value whatsoever.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Robbery is not distinguished from
Theft by any Statute. <hi>Latrocinium</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
them both, and both are Felony,
and both Punished with Death. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to distinguish them aright is the work
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54911:145"/>
of Reason only. And the first difference
which is obvious to all Men, is, that Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
is committed by Force, or Terror, of
which neither is in Theft; for Theft is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Act, and that which is taken by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or Terror, either from his Person, or
in his Presence is still Robbery; but if it be
taken secretly, whether it be by day, or
night from his Person, or from his Fold, or
from his Pasture, then it is called Theft.
'Tis Force and Fraud only that distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
between Theft, and Robbery, both
which are by the Pravity only of the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Felony, in their Nature. But there
be so many Evasions of the Law found out
by evil Men, that I know not in this Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament
of Felony how to place them: For
suppose I go secretly by day, or night, into
another Mans Field of Wheat Ripe, and
standing, and Loading my Cart with it I
carry it away; Is it Theft, or Robbery?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Neither; it is but Trespass: But if
you first lay down the Wheat you have cut,
and then throw it into your Cart, and carry
it away, then it is Felony.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Why so?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> tells you the Reason of
it, 4 <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 107. for he defineth Theft to be
by the Common-Law a Felonious, and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent
taking and carrying away by any
Man, or Woman, of the meer Personal Goods
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54911:146"/>
of another, not from the Person, nor by
night in the House of the owner. From this
Definition he Argues thus, p. 109. Any kind
of Corn, or Grain growing upon the ground
is a Personal Chattel, and the Executors of
the owner shall have them, though they be
not severed; but yet no Larceny can be
Committed of them, because they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Realty: So it is of Grass stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on the Ground, or of Apples, or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Fruit upon the Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it is of a
Box, or Chest of Charters, no Larceny can
be committed of them, because the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
concern the Realty, and the Box, or
Chest, though it be of great value, yet shall
it be of the same nature the Charters are
of. <hi>Omne magis dignum trahit ad se mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Is this Definition drawn out of any
Statute, or is it in <hi>Bracton,</hi> or <hi>Littleton,</hi> or
any other Writer upon the Science of the
Laws?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>No; it is his own; and you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
by the Logick-Sentences dispersed
through his Works, that he was a Logician
sufficient enough to make a Definition.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But if his Definitions must be the
Rule of Law; what is there that he may
not make Felony, or not Felony, at his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?
But seeing it is not Statute-Law that
he says, it must be very perfect Reason, or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54911:146"/>
else no Law at all; and to me it seems so far
from Reason as I think it ridiculous. But
let us Examine it. There can (says he) be
no Larceny of Corn, Grass, or Fruits that
are growing, that is to say, they cannot be
stolen; but why? Because they concern the
Realty; that is, because they concern the
Land. 'Tis true that the Land cannot be
stolen, nor the right of a Mans Tenure; but
Corn, and Trees, and Fruit, though grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
may be cut down, and carryed away
secretly, and Feloniously, in Contempt, and
Despight of the Law. And are they not
then stolen? And is there any Act which is
Feloniously committed, that is not more
than Trespass? Can any Man doubt of it
that understands the <hi>English</hi> Tongue? 'Tis
true, that if a Man pretend a right to the
Land, and on that pretence take the Fruits
thereof by way of taking Possession of his
own, it is no more than a Trespass, unless
he conceal the taking of them; for in that
one Case, he but puts the Man that was in
Possession before to exhibit his complaint,
which purpose is not Felonious, but Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
for nothing makes a distinction between
Felony, and not Felony, but the purpose.
I have heard that if a Man slander another
with stealing of a Tree standing, there
lies no Action for it, and that upon this
ground, To steal a standing Tree is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54911:147"/>
and that the Cause of the Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is, that a Man's Free-hold cannot be
stolen; which is a very obvious Fallacy;
for Free-hold signifieth, not only the Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but also the Tenure; and though it
be true that a Tenure cannot be stolen, yet
every man sees the standing Trees, and Corn,
may easily be stolen; and so far forth as
Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are part of the Freehold, so far
forth also they are Personal Goods; for
whatsoever is Freehold is Inheritance, and
descendeth to the Heir, and nothing can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the Executors, but what is meerly
Personal. And though a Box, or Case of
Evidences are to descend to the Heir, yet
unless you can shew me positive Law to the
contrary, they shall be taken into the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
hands, to be delivered to the Heir.
Besides, how unconscionable a thing is it,
that he that steals a shillings worth of Wood;
which the Wind hath blown down, or
which lyeth Rotten on the ground, should
be Hang'd for it, and he that takes a Tree
worth 20 or 40 shillings, should Answer on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the Dammage?</p>

of them is by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke. 4 Inst.</hi> p.
63. Defined thus: Burglary is by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law,
the Breaking and Entring into
the Mansion-house of another, in the night
with intent to kill some reasonable Creature,
or to commit some other Felony within the
same, whether his intent be executed, or
not; and defineth Night to be then, when
one Man cannot know anothers Face by day-light:
And for the parts of a Mansion-house
he reckoneth all Houses that belong to
Housekeeping, as Barns, Stables, Dary-Houses,
Buttery, Kitchin, Chambers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But breaking of a House by day, though
Felony, and Punished as Burglary, is not

belongs only to a Jury of 12 Men to declare
in their Verdict, whether the Fact laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
before them be Burglary, Robbery,
Theft, or other Felony; for this is to give
a leading Judgment to the Jury, who ought

                  <p>Burning, as he defines it, p. 66. is a
Felony at the Common-Law committed by
any that maliciously and voluntarily in the
night, or day, burneth the House of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And hereupon infers, if a Man sets
Fire to the House, and it takes not, that then
it is not within the Statute.</p>

                  <p>If a Man should secretly, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
lay a quantity of Gun-Powder under
another Mans House, sufficient to Blow it
up, and set a Train of Powder in it, and set
Fire to the Train, and some Accident hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Effect, is not this Burning? or what
is it? What Crime? It is neither Treason,
nor Murder, nor Burglary, nor Robbery,
nor Theft, nor (no dammage being made)
any Trespass, nor contrary to any Statute.
And yet (seeing the Common-Law is the

Law of Reason) it is a sin, and such a sin
as a Man may be Accused of, and Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and consequently a Crime committed
of Malice prepensed; shall he not then be
Punished for the Attempt? I grant you that
a Judge has no Warrant from any Statute-Law,
Common-Law, or Commission to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the Punishment, but surely the King
has power to Punish him (on this side of

                  <p>What, say you, is Heresie?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I say Heresie is a singularity of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or Opinion contrary to the Doctrine
of another Man, or Men, and the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
signifies the Doctrine of a Sect, which
Doctrine is taken upon Trust of some Man
of Reputation for Wisdom, that was the
first Author of the same. If you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the truth hereof, you are to Read
the Histories and other Writings of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Greeks,</hi> whose word it is, which Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
are extant in these days, and easie to
be had. Wherein you will find, that in,
and a little before the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54911:150"/>
Great; there lived in <hi>Greece</hi> many Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Wits, that employed their time in search
of the Truth in all manner of Sciences wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of their Labour, and which to their
great Honour and Applause published their
Writings; some concerning Justice, Laws,
and Government, some concerning Good,
and Evil Manners, some concerning the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of things Natural, and of Events discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by sense; and some of all these Subjects.
And of the Authors of these, the Principal
were <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Zeno, Epicurus</hi> and
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> Men of deep and laborious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and such as did not get their Bread
by their Philosophy, but were able to live
of their own, and were in Honour with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and other great Personages. But these
Men, though above the rest in Wisdom, yet
their Doctrine in many points did disagree;
whereby it came to pass, that such Men as
studied their Writings, inclined, some to <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi>
some to <hi>Plato,</hi> some to <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
some to <hi>Zeno,</hi> and some to <hi>Epicurus.</hi> But
Philosophy it self was then so much in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
as that every Rich Man endeavour'd
to have his Children educated in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of some, or other of these Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
which were for their Wisdom so much
renown'd. Now those that followed <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi>
were called <hi>Pythagoreans;</hi> those
that followed <hi>Plato, Academicks;</hi> those that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54911:150"/>
followed <hi>Zeno, Stoicks;</hi> those that followed
<hi>Epicurus, Epicureans,</hi> and those that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Aristotle, Peripateticks,</hi> which are the
names of Heresie in <hi>Greek,</hi> which signifies
no more but taking of an Opinion; and the
said <hi>Pythagoreans, Academicks, Stoicks, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks,
&amp;c.</hi> were termed by the names of
so many several Heresies. All Men (you
know) are subject to Error, and the ways
of Error very different; and therefore 'tis
no wonder if these Wise, and diligent search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Truth did, notwithstanding their
Excellent parts, differ in many points a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves. But this Laudable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of Great, Wealthy Persons to have
their Children at any price to learn Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
suggested to many idle and needy
Fellows, an easie and compendious way of
Maintenance; which was to Teach the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
some of <hi>Plato,</hi> some of <hi>Aristotle,
&amp;c.</hi> Whose Books to that end they Read
over, but without Capacity, or much En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to examine the Reasons of their
Doctrines, taking only the Conclusions, as
they lay; and setting up with this, they
soon professed themselves Philosophers, and
got to be the School-Masters to the Youth
of <hi>Greece;</hi> but by Competition for such
Employment, they hated and reviled one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
with all the bitter Terms they could
invent; and very often, when upon Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54911:151"/>
they were in Civil Company, fell first
to Disputation, and then to Blows, to the
great trouble of the Company, and their
own shame. Yet amongst all their reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
words the name of Heretick came never
in, because they were all equally Hereticks,
their Doctrine not being theirs, but taken
upon Trust from the aforesaid Authors. So
that though we find Heresie often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in <hi>Lucian,</hi> and other Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
yet we shall not find in any of them
<hi>Haereticus</hi> for a Heretick. And this Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
among the Philosophers continued a
long time in <hi>Greece,</hi> and Infecting also the
<hi>Romans,</hi> was at the greatest in the times of
the Apostles, and in the Primitive Church,
till the time of the Nicene Council, and
somewhat after. But at last the Authority
of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> was not much
Esteemed, only <hi>Plato</hi>'s and <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
were much in Credit; <hi>Plato</hi>'s with
the better sort, that founded their Doctrine
upon the Conceptions and Ideas of things,
and <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s with those that reasoned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the names of Things, according to
the Scale of the <hi>Categories:</hi> Nevertheless
there were always, though not New Sects
of Philosophy, yet New Opinions continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
arising.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But how came the word Heretick to
be a Reproach?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Stay a little. After the Death of our
Saviour his Apostles, and his Disciples, as
you know, dispersed themselves into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of the World to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and converted much People, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Asia</hi> the less, in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where
they Constituted many Churches; and as
they Travelled from place to place, left Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
to Teach and Direct those their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
and to appoint Presbyters under them
to Assist them therein, and to Confirm
them by setting forth the Life, and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our Saviour, as they had receiv'd it
from the Writings of the Apostles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists;
whereby (and not by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or any other
Philosopher) they were to be Instructed.
Now you cannot doubt but that among so
many Heathens converted in the time of
the Apostles, there were Men of all Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and Dispositions, and some that had
never thought of Philosophy at all, but were
intent upon their Fortunes, or their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
and some that had a greater, some a
lesser use of Reason; and some that had
studied Philosophy, but professed it not,
which were commonly the Men of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Rank; and some had Professed it only
for their better Abstinence, and had it not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54911:152"/>
farther, than readily to talk and wrangle;
and some were Christians in good earnest,
and others but Counterfeit, intending to
make use of the Charity of those that were
sincere Christians, which in those times
was very great. Tell me now of these sorts
of Christians which was the most likely to
afford the fittest Men to propagate the Faith
by Preaching, and Writing, or Publick or
private Disputation; that is to say, who
were fittest to be made Presbyters and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly those who (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>)
could make the best use of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
and Logick.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>And who were the most prone to
Innovation?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>They that were most confident of
<hi>Aristotle</hi>'s, and <hi>Plato</hi>'s (their former Masters)
Natural Philosophy: For they would be the
aptest to wrest the Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and all Scriptures to the Doctrine in
which their Reputation was engag'd.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>And from such Bishops and Priests,
and other Sectaries it was, that Heresie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Christians, first came to be a
Reproach: For no sooner had one of them
Preached, or Published any Doctrine that
displeased, either the most, or the most
Leading Men of the rest, but it became such
a Quarrel as not to be decided, but by a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54911:152"/>
Council of the Bishops in the Province
where they Lived; wherein he that would
not submit to the General Decree, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an Heretick, as one that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquish
the Philosophy of his Sect; the
rest of the Council gave themselves the
name of Catholicks, and to their Church,
the name of Catholick Church. And thus
came up the opposite Terms of Catholick
and Heretick.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I understand how it came to be a
Reproach, but not how it follows that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Opinion condemned by a Church that
is, or calls it self Catholick, must needs be
an Error, or a Sin. The Church of <hi>England</hi>
denies that Consequence, and that Doctrine
as they hold cannot be proved to be Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
but by the Scripture, which cannot
Err; but the Church, being but men, may
both Err, and Sin.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>In this Case we must consider also
that Error, in it's own Nature, is no Sin:
For it is Impossible for a Man to Err on
purpose, he cannot have an Intention to Err;
and nothing is Sin, unless there be a sinful
Intention; much less are such Errors Sins,
as neither hurt the Common-wealth, nor
any private Man, nor are against any Law
Positive, or Natural; such Errors as were
those for which Men were burnt in the time
when the Pope had the Government of this
Church.</p>

                  <p>Since you have told me how Herefie

                  <p>Since the Christian Church could
declare, and none else, what Doctrine were
Heresies, but had no power to make Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
for the punishment of Hereticks before
they had a Christian King; it is manifest
that Heresie could not be made a Crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first Christian Emperor, which was
<hi>Constantine</hi> the Great. In his time one <hi>Arius</hi>
a Priest of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in Dispute with his
Bishop, Publickly denyed the Divinity of
Christ, and Maintained it afterwards in the
Pulpit, which was the Cause of a Sedition,
and much Blood shed, both of Citizens, and
Souldiers in that City. For the preventing
of the like for the time to come, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
called a General Council of Bishops to
the City of <hi>Nice,</hi> who being met, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
them to agree upon a Confession of
the Christian Faith, promising whatsoever
they agreed on he would cause to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>In this Council was Established so
much of the Creed we now use, and call the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, as reacheth to the words, <hi>I
believe in the Holy Ghost.</hi> The rest was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54911:153"/>
by the 3 General Councils next
succeeding. By the words of which Creed
almost all the Heresies then in being, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
the Doctrine of <hi>Arius,</hi> were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd:
So that now all Doctrines Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Writing, or by Word, and repugnant
to this Confession of the first four General
Councils, and contained in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed
were, by the Imperial Law forbidding them,
made Crimes; such as are that of <hi>Arius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Divinity of Christ; that of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiches</hi>
denying the 2 Natures of Christ;
that of the <hi>Nestorians</hi> denying the Divinity
of the Holy Ghost; that of the <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphites,</hi>

                  <p>At the first for refusing to Subscribe,
he was deprived and Banished; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
having satisfied the Emperor concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his future Obedience (for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
caused his Confession to be made, not
for the regard of Truth of Doctrine, but
for the preserving of the Peace, especially
among his Christian Souldiers, by whose
valour he had gotten the Empire, and by
the same was to preserve it) he was received
again into Grace, but dyed before he could
repossess his Benefice. But after the time of
those Councils, the Imperial Law made the
Punishment for Heresie to be Capital, though
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54911:154"/>
the manner of the Death was left to the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi>
in their several Jurisdictions; and thus
it continued till somewhat after the time
of the Emperor <hi>Frederick Barbarossa,</hi> and
the Papacy having gotten the upper hand
of the Emperor, brought in the use of
Burning both Hereticks, and Apostates;
and the Popes from time to time made He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
of many other points of Doctrine, (as
they saw it conduce to the setting up of
the Chair above the Throne) besides those
determined in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and
brought in the use of Burning; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this Papal-Law there was an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
Burnt at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the time of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
the Conqueror for turning <hi>Jew.</hi> But of
a Heretick Burnt in <hi>England</hi> there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made till after the Statute of 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.
Whereby some followers of <hi>Wiclif</hi> (called
<hi>Lollards</hi>) were afterwards Burned, and that
for such Doctrines, as by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
ever since the first year of Queen <hi>El.</hi>
have been approved for Godly Doctrines,
and no doubt were Godly then; and so you

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>'Twas not well done; but 'tis no
wonder we read of no Hereticks before the
time of <hi>H.</hi> 4. For in the Preamble to that
Statute it is intimated, that before those
<hi>Lollards</hi> there never was any Heresie in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                  <p>I think so too; for we have been the
tamest Nation to the Pope of all the World.
But what Statutes concerning Heresie have
there been made since?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>The Statute of 2 <hi>H. 5. c.</hi> 7. which
adds to the Burning the Forfeiture of Lands,
and Goods, and then no more till the 25 H.
8. <hi>c.</hi> 14. which confirms the two former and
giveth some new Rules concerning how they
shall be Proceeded with. But by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 1 <hi>Ed. 6. cap.</hi> 12. All Acts of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
formerly made to punish any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Doctrine concerning Religion are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd.
For therein it is ordain'd, after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Acts specified; that all and every other
Act, or Acts of Parliament concerning Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or matters of Religion, and all, and
every Branch, Article, Sentence and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Pains and Forfeitures contained, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
or any wise declared in the same Acts
of Parliament or Statutes shall be from
henceforth Repealed, utterly void, and of
none effect. So that in the time of King
<hi>Ed.</hi> 6. not only all Punishments of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
were taken away, but also the Nature of
it was changed, to what Originally it was,
a Private Opinion. Again in 12 <hi>Phil.</hi> and
<hi>Ma.</hi> those former Statutes of 2 <hi>H. 4. cap. 15.
2 H. 5. Cap. 17. 25. H. 8. cap.</hi> 14. are Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and the Branch of 1 <hi>Ed. 6. cap.</hi> 12.
touching Doctrine (though not specially
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54911:155"/>
named) seemeth to be this, that the same
Statute confirmeth the Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
concerning Treasons. Lastly, in the first
year of Queen <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. the aforesaid
Statutes of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> are taken away, and
thereby the Statute of 1 <hi>Ed. cap.</hi> 12. Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
so as there was no Statute left for the
Punishment of Hereticks. But Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi>
by the Advice of her Parliament gave a
Commission (which was called the High-Commission)
to certain Persons (amongst
whom were very many of the Bishops) to
Declare what should be Heresie for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but with a Restraint, that they should
Judge nothing to be Heresie, but what had
been so declared in the first four General
Councils.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>From this which you have shewed
me, I think we may proceed to the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Learned Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Heresie. In his Chapter of Heresie,
3 <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 40. he himself confesseth, that no
Statute against Heresie stood then in force:
when in the 9th year of King <hi>James, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew
Legat</hi> was Burnt for <hi>Arianism,</hi> and
that from the Authority of the Act of 2
<hi>Hen. 4. cap.</hi> 15. and other Acts cited in the
Margin, it may be gather'd, that the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan
hath the Jurisdiction of Heresie. This
I say is not true: For as to Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is manifest, that from Acts Repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54911:155"/>
that is to say, from things that have
no being, there can be gathered nothing.
And as to the other Authorities in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
<hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> and the Doctor and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
they say no more than what was Law
in the time when they writ; that is, when
the Popes Usurped Authority was here o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed:
But if they had Written this in the
time of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> might as well have cited his
own Authority, as theirs; for their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had no more the force of Laws than his.
Then he cites this Precedent of <hi>Legat,</hi> and
another of <hi>Hammond</hi> in the time of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but Precedents prove only what
was done, and not what was well done.
VVhat Jurisdiction could the Diocesan then
have of Heresie, when by the Statute of
<hi>Ed. 6. cap.</hi> 12. then in force, there was no
Heresie, and all Punishment for Opinions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden:
For Heresie is a Doctrine contrary
to the Determination of the Church, but
then the Church had not Determined any
thing at all concerning Heresie.</p>

                  <p>But seeing the High Commissioners
had Power to Correct, and Amend Heresies,

a Declaration of what Articles they made
Heresie, that when one Man heard another
speak against their Declaration, he might
thereof inform the Commissioners, then
indeed they had had Power to cite, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison
the Person accus'd; but before they
had known what should be Heresie; how
was it possible that one Man should accuse
another? And before he be accused, how
can he be cited?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps it was taken for granted, that
whatsoever was contrary to any of the 4
first General Councils, was to be judged
Heresie.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>That granted, yet I see not how one
Man might accuse another 'ere the better
for those Councils. For not one Man of
ten thousand had ever read them, nor were
they ever Published in <hi>English,</hi> that a Man
might avoid Offending against them, nor
perhaps are they extant; nor if those that
we have Printed in <hi>Latin</hi> are the very Acts
of the Councils (which is yet much dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
amongst Divines) do I think it fit they
were put in the Vulgar Tongues. But it is
not likely that the makers of the Statutes
had any purpose to make Heresie of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
was repugnant to those 4 General
Councils: For if they had, I believe the
Anabaptists, of which there was great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54911:156"/>
in those times, would one time or other
have been question'd upon this Article of
the Nicene Creed, <hi>I believe one Baptism for
the Remission of sins;</hi> nor was the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
it self for a long time after Registred,
that Men might in such uncertainty take
heed and abstain (for their better safety)
from speaking of Religion any thing at all.
But by what Law was this Heretick <hi>Legat</hi>
burnt? I grant he was an <hi>Arian,</hi> and his
Heresie contrary to the Determination of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Highest Points
of Christianity; but seeing there was no
Statute-Law to burn him, and no Penalty
forbidden, by what Law, by what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was he burn't?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>That this <hi>Legat</hi> was accused of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
was no fault of the High Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
but when he was accused, it had
been a fault in them not to have examin'd
him, or having examin'd him, and found
him an <hi>Arian,</hi> not to have judged him so,
or not to have certified him so. All this
they did, and this was all that belonged
unto them; they medled not with his
Burning, but left him to the Secular Power
to do with him what they pleased.</p>

                  <p>Your Justification of the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
is nothing to the Question; the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is by what Law he was burn't, the
Spiritual-Law gives no Sentence of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54911:157"/>
Punishment, and Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that, he could not be burned, and
Burning forbidden by Statute-Law. By what
Law then was he burned?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>By the Common-Law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>What's that? It is not Custom; for
before the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, there was
no such Custom in <hi>England;</hi> for if there had,
yet those Laws that came after were but
Confirmations of the Customs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Repealing of those Laws was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
of the Custom. For when King <hi>Ed.</hi>
the 6th, and Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> abolished those
Statutes, they abolished all Pains, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
Burning, or else they had aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
nothing. And if you will say he was
burn't by the Law of Reason, you must tell
me how there can be Proportion between
Doctrine and Burning; there can be no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,
nor Majority, nor Minority Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
between them. The Proportion that is
between them, is the Proportion of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
which the Doctrine maketh, to the
Mischief to be Inflicted on the Doctor; and
this is to be measur'd only by him that hath
the charge of Governing the People, and
consequently, the Punishing of Offences can
be determined by none but by the King,
and that, if it extend to life or member,
with the Assent of Parliament.</p>

                  <p>He does not draw any Argument

Judgment executed upon <hi>Legat,</hi> and a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
out of <hi>Hollingshed,</hi> and <hi>Stow:</hi> But I know
that neither History, nor Precedent will
pass with you for Law. And though there
be a Writ <hi>de haeretico comburendo</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister
(as you may Read in <hi>Fitzherbert</hi>)
grounded upon the Statutes of 2 <hi>H. 4. cap.
15.</hi> and 2 <hi>H. 5. cap.</hi> 7. yet seeing those Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
are void, you will say the VVrit is also
void.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes indeed will I. Besides this, I
understand not how that is true that he
saith; that the Diocesan hath Jurisdiction
of Heresie, and that so it was put in ure in
all Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign; whereas by
the Statute it is manifest, that all Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
spiritual, was given under the Queen,
to the High Commissioners, how then could
any one Diocesan have any part thereof
without deputation from them, which by
their Letters Patents they could not grant,
nor was it reasonable they should: For the
Trust was not committed to the Bishops on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but also to divers Lay-Persons, who might
have an Eye upon their Proceedings, lest
they should Incroach upon the power Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.
But at this day there is neither Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
nor any Law to Punish Doctrine, but
the ordinary Power Ecclesiastical, and that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54911:158"/>
according to the Canons of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> only Authorized by the King, the
High Commission being long since abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Therefore let us come now to such Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Criminal, as are not Capital.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>This Crime is not unlike to that for
which a Man is outlawed, when he will
not come in and submit himself to the Law;
saving that in Outlawries there is a long
Process to precede it; and he that is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed,
is put out of the Protection of the
Law. But for the Offence against the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Provisors (which is called <hi>Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire
facias</hi> from the words in the Original
VVrit) if the Offender submit not himself
to the Law within the space of 2 Months
after notice, he is presently an Outlaw: And
this Punishment (if not Capital) is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to Capital: For he lives secretly at
the Mercy of those that know where he is,
and cannot without the like Peril to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but discover him. And it has been
much disputed before the time of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whether he might not be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54911:158"/>
killed by any Man that would, as one
might kill a VVolf: It is like the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongst the old <hi>Romans</hi> of being bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the use of Fire and VVater, and like the
great Excommunication in the Papacy,
when a Man might not eat, or drink with
the Offender without incurring the like Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly the Offence for which this
Punishment was first Ordained, was some
abominable Crime, or of extraordinary Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>So it was: For the Pope, you know,
from long before the Conquest, incroached
every day upon the Power Temporal. VVhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
could be made to seem to be <hi>in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
ad Spiritualia</hi> was in every Common-wealth
claimed, and haled to the Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Pope:</hi> And for that end in every
Country he had his Court Ecclesiastical, and
there was scarce any cause Temporal, which
he could not, by one shift or other, hook
into his Jurisdiction, in such sort as to have
it tryed in his own Courts at <hi>Rome,</hi> or in
<hi>France,</hi> or in <hi>England</hi> it self. By which
means the Kings Laws were not regarded,
Judgments given in the Kings Courts were
avoided, and presentations to Bishopricks,
Abbies, and other Benefices (founded, and
endowed by the Kings, and Nobility of
<hi>England</hi>) were bestowed by the <hi>Pope</hi> upon
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54911:159"/>
Strangers, or such (as with Money in their
Purses) could travel to <hi>Rome,</hi> to provide
themselves of such Benefices. And suitably
hereunto, when there was a Question about
a Tythe, or a VVill, though the point were
meerly Temporal, yet the Popes Court here
would fetch them in, or else one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
would appeal to <hi>Rome.</hi> Against these
Injuries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Right and Dignity of the Crown
of <hi>England, Ed.</hi> 1. made a Statute concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Provisors (that is, such as provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with Benefices here from <hi>Rome</hi>) for
in the 25th year of his Reign he ordained
in a full Parliament that the Right of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Bishops, and Right of Advowsans,
and Presentations belonged to himself, and
to the Nobility that were the founders of
such Bishopricks, Abbies, and other Benefices.
And he enacted farther, that if any Clerk,
which he, or any of his Subjects should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
should be disturbed by any such Provisor
that such Provisor, or Disturber should be
attached by his Body, and if Convicted, lye
in Prison till he were Ransomed at the Kings
Will, and had satisfied the Party griev'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouced
his Title, and sound sureties not to
sue for it any farther; and that if they could
not be found, then Exigents should go forth
to Outlawrie, and the Profits of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in the mean time be taken into the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54911:159"/>
Kings hands. And the same Statute is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the 27th year of King <hi>Ed.</hi> the 3d,
which Statute alloweth to these Provisors
six weeks Day to appear, but if they appear
before they be outlaw'd, they shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to make Answer, but if they render
not themselves, they shall forfeit all their
Lands, Goods, and Chattels, besides that
they stand outlaw'd. The same Law is
confirmed again by 16 <hi>Rich. 2d. cap.</hi> 5. in
which is added (because these Provisors
obtained sometimes from the <hi>Pope,</hi> that
such <hi>English</hi> Bishops as according to the
Law were instituted, and inducted by the
Kings Presentees should be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
that for this also both they, and the
Receivers and Publishers of such Papal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and the Procurers should have the
same Punishment.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>It lies there before you set down <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim</hi>
by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> himself, both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
and <hi>French.</hi>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis well, we are now to consider
what it means, and whether it be well, or
ill interpreted by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke.</hi> And first
it appeareth by the Preamble (which Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke</hi> acknowledgeth to be the best In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of the Statute) that this Statute
was made against the Incroachments only
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54911:160"/>
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Right of
the King, and other Patrons to collate Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
and other Benefices within the
Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and against the power
of the Courts Spiritual, to hold Plea of
Controversies determinable in any of the
Courts of the King, or to reverse any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there given, as being things that tend
to the Disherison of the King, and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Common-Law of the Realm
always used. Put the case now that a Man
had procur'd the <hi>Pope</hi> to reverse a Decree in
Chancery, had he been within the danger
of Premunire?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes certainly; or if the Judgment
had been given in the Court of the Lord
Admiral, or in any other Kings Court
whatsoever, either of Law, or Equity; for
Courts of Equity are most properly Courts
of the Common-Law of <hi>England,</hi> because
Equity, and Common-Law (as Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi>
says) are all one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Then the word Common-Law is
not in this Preamble restrained to such
Courts only where the Tryal is by Juries,
but comprehends all the Kings Temporal
Courts, if not also the Courts of those Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that are Lords of great Mannors.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis very likely, yet I think it will
not by every Man be granted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:54911:160"/>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>The Statute also says; That they
who draw Men out of the Realm in Plea,
whereof the Cognizance pertaineth to the
Kings Court, or of things whereof Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is given in the Kings Court, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Cases of Premunire. But what if one
Man draw another to <hi>Lambeth</hi> in Plea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Judgment is already given at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
Is he by this Clause involv'd in a
Premunire?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes: For though it be not out of the
Realm, yet it is within the meaning of the
Statute, because the <hi>Popes</hi> Court, not the
Kings Court, was then perhaps at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But in Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s time the Kings
Court was at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and not the Popes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>You know well enough, that the
Spiritual-Court has no power to hold Pleas
of Common-Law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I do so; but I know not for what
cause any simple Man that mistakes his
right Court, should be out of the Kings
Protection, lose his Inheritance, and all his
Goods Personal, and Real; and if taken, be
kept in Prison all his Life. This Statute can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be by Sir <hi>Edw. Cokes</hi> Torture made to
say it. Besides, such Men are ignorant in
what Courts they are to seek their Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
And it is a Custom confirmed by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
usage, that such ignorant Men should
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54911:161"/>
be guided by their Council at Law. It is
manifest therefore, that the makers of the
Statute intended not to prohibit Men from
their suing for their Right, neither in the
Chancery, nor in the Admiralty, nor in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Court, except the Ecclesiastical
Courts, which had their Jurisdiction from
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Again, where the
Statute says, <q>which do sue in any other
Court, or defeat a Judgment in the Kings
Court</q>, what is the meaning of another
Court? Another Court than what? Is it
here meant the Kings-Bench, or Court of
Common-Pleas? Does a Premunire lye for
every Man that sues in Chancery, for that
which might be remedied in the Court of
Common-Pleas? Or can a Premunire lye by
this Statute against the Lord Chancellor?
The Statute lays it only on the Party that
sueth, not upon the Judge which holdeth
the Plea. Nor could it be laid neither by
this Statute, nor by the Statute of 16 <hi>Rich.
2.</hi> upon the Judges, which were then pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable
only by the Popes Authority. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then the Party Suing has a just excuse
upon the Council of his Lawyer; and the
Temporal Judge, and the Lawyer both are
out of the Statute, the punishment of the
Premunire can light upon no body.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> in this same Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
bringeth two Precedents to prove, that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54911:161"/>
though the Spiritual-Courts in <hi>England</hi> be
now the Kings Courts, yet whosoever su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in them for any thing tryable by the
Common-Law, shall fall into a Premunire.
One is, that whereas in the 22d of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.
all the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> in a Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by publick Instrument acknowledged the
King to be Supream Head of the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> yet after this, <hi>viz.</hi> 24 of <hi>H.</hi> 8.
this Statute was in force.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Why not? A Convocation of the
Clergy could not alter the Right of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie;
their Courts were still the <hi>Popes</hi>
Courts. The other Precedent in the 25th
of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. of the Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> may
have the same Answer, for the King was
not declared Head of the Church by Act of
Parliament, till the 26th year of his Reign.
If he had not mistrusted his own Law, he
would not have laid hold on so weak a
Proof as these Precedents. And as to the
Sentence of Premunire upon the Bishop of
<hi>Norwich,</hi> neither doth this Statute, nor that
other of <hi>R.</hi> 2. warrant it; he was senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for threatning to excommunicate a Man
which had sued another before the Mayor:
But this Statute forbids not that, but forbids
the bringing in, or publishing of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
or other Process from <hi>Rome,</hi> or
any other Place. Before the 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. there
is no Question, but that for a Suit in the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54911:162"/>
Spiritual Court here in a Temporal Cause,
there lay a Premunire; and if perhaps some
Judge. or other hath since that time judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
otherwise, his Judgment was errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Nay but by the Statute of 16. <hi>Rich. 2.
cap.</hi> 5. it appeareth to the contrary, as Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke</hi> here will shew you. The effect
(saith he) of the Statute of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. is;
That if any Pursue, or cause to be Pursued
in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elsewhere any
thing which toucheth the King, against
him, his Crown, or Regality, or his Realm,
they, their Notaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be out of
the Kings Protection.</p>

                  <p>I pray you let me know the very
words of the Statutes as they ly.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Presently. The words are,</hi> if any
Man Purchase, or Pursue, or cause to be Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased,
or Pursued in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or
elsewhere, any such Translations, Processes and
Sentences of Excommunication, Bulls, Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or any other things whatsoever, which
touch the King, against him, his Crown, and
his Regality, or his Realm, as is aforesaid,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>If a Man bring a Plea of Common-Law
into the Spiritual Court, which is
now the Kings Court, and the Judge of this
Spiritual Court hold Plea thereof: By what
Construction can you draw it within the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54911:162"/>
compass of the words you have now read.
To sue for my Right in the Kings Court, is
no pursuing of Translations of Bishopricks
made, or procur'd in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
or any place else, but only in the Court of
the King, nor is this the suit against the
King, nor his Crown, nor his Regality, nor
his Realm, but the contrary. Why then is
it a Premunire? No. He that brings in, or
setteth out a Writing in any place whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
wherein is contained, that the King
hath so given away his Jurisdiction, as that
if a Subject be condemned falsly, his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the Kings Judgment is of none
effect; or that the King upon no necessity
whatsoever can, out of Parliament time
raise Money for the defence of the Kingdom,
is, in my opinion, much more within the
Statute of Provisors, than they which begin
suit for a Temporal Matter in a Court Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.
But what Argument has he for this
Law of his (since the Statute Law fails him)
from the Law of Reason.</p>

                  <p>He says they are called Courts, either
because they proceed by the Rules of other
Laws, as by the Canon, or Civil Law, or
by other Tryals than the Common Law
doth Warrant: For the Tryals Warranted
by the Law of <hi>England</hi> for matter of Fact,
is by verdict of 12 Men before the Judges
of the Common Law, in matters pertaining
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54911:163"/>
to the Common Law, and not upon Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Witnesses, as in the Court of
Equity; so that <hi>Alia Curia</hi> is either that
which is govern'd <hi>per aliam Legem,</hi> or which
draweth the Party <hi>ad aliud Examen.</hi> For
if‚Äî</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Stop there. Let us consider of this
you have read, for the Tryal warranted by
the Law of <hi>England,</hi> is by Verdict of 12 Men.
What means he here by the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
Does it not warrant the Tryals in
Chancery, and in the Court of Admiralty
by Witnesses?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>By the Law of <hi>England</hi> he means the
Law used in the Kings Bench; that is to
say, the Common-Law.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>This is just as if he had said, that
these two Courts did warrant their own
way of Tryal; but other Courts not so, but
were warranted by the King only, the
Courts of Common Law were VVarrants
to themselves: You see that <hi>alia Curia</hi> is this
way ill expounded. In the Courts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law all Tryals are by 12 Men, who are
Judges of the Fact; and the Fact known
and prov'd, the Judges are to pronounce the
Law; but in the Spiritual Court, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,
and in all the Courts of Equity
there is but one Judge, both of Fact, and
of Law; this is all the difference. If this
difference be intended by the Statute by <hi>alia
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54911:163"/>
Curia,</hi> there would be a Premunire for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Court, being not the Kings Court:
The Kings Bench, and Court of Common
Pleas may also be different kinds of Courts,
because the Process is different; but 'tis
plain that this Statute doth not distinguish
Courts otherwise than into the Courts of
the King, and into the Courts of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
States, and Princes. And seeing you
stand upon the name of a Jury for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
of Courts, what difference do
you find between the Tryals at the Common-Law,
and the Tryals in other Courts? You
know that in Tryals of Fact naturally, and
through all the World the Witnesses are
Judges, and it is impossible to be otherwise.
What then in <hi>England</hi> can a Jury judge of,
except it be of the sufficiency of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
The Justices have nothing to judge
of, nor do, but after the Fact is proved, to
declare the Law, which is not Judgment,
but Jurisdiction. Again, though the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
be in Chancery, or in the Court of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law, 1. The Witnesses are still Judges
of the Fact, and he that hath the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to hear the Cause hath both the parts;
that is to say, of a Jury to judge of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
and of a Justice to declare the
Law. In this, I say, lyes all the difference,
which is indeed enough to make a Dispute
(as the World goes) about Jurisdiction:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54911:164"/>
But seeing it tends neither to the Disherison
of the King, nor of the People, nor to the
subversion of the Law of Reason, <hi>i. e.</hi> of
Common-Law, nor to the subversion of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
nor to any harm of the Realm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some of which these Statutes are not
broken, it cannot be a Premunire.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me read on. For if the Freehold
Inheritances, Goods and Chattels, Debts
and Duties, wherein the King and Subject
have Right and Property by the Common-Law,
should be judged <hi>per aliam Legem,</hi> or
be drawn <hi>ad aliud Examen,</hi> the 3 Mischiefs
afore exprest, would follow; <hi>viz.</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the King, and his Crown, the
Disherison of his People, and the undoing
and destruction of the Common-Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
used.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>That is to say, of the Law of Reason.
From hence it follows, that where there are
no Juries, and where there are different
Laws from ours; that is to say, in all the
World besides, neither King, nor People
have any Inheritance, nor Goods, nor any
Law of Reason. I will examine his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
concerning Cases Criminal no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He no where defineth a Crime, that
we may know what it is: An odious name
sufficeth him to make a Crime of any thing.
He hath put Heresie among the most odious
Crimes, not knowing what it signifies; and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54911:164"/>
upon no other Cause, but because the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> (to make their usurped Power
the more terrible) had made it by long
Preaching against it, and Cruelty shown
towards many Godly, and learned Men of
this, and other Reformed Churches, appear
to common People a thing detestable. He
puts it in as a Plea of the Crown in the time
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whereas in her time
there was no Doctrine Heresie; but Justice
<hi>Stamford</hi> leaves it out, because when Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
was a Crime, it was a Plea of the <hi>Mitre.</hi>
I see also in this Catalogue of Causes Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
he inserteth costly Feeding, costly
Apparel, and costly Building, though they
were contrary to no Statute. 'Tis true, that
by evil Circumstances they become sins;
but these sins belong to the Judgment of
the Pastors Spiritual. A Justice of the
Temporal Law (seeing the Intention only
makes them sins) cannot judge whether
they be sins or no, unless he have power to
take Confessions. Also he makes flattery
of the King to be a Crime. How could he
know when one Man had flattered another?
He meant therefore that it was a Crime to
please the King: And accordingly he citeth
divers Calamities of such as had been in
times past in great favour of the Kings they
serv'd; as the Favourites of <hi>Hen. 3. Ed. 2.
Rich. 2. Hen.</hi> 6. which Favourites were some
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54911:165"/>
imprisoned, some banished, and some put
to death by the same Rebels that impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
banished, and put to death the same
King, upon no better ground than the Earl
of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
and King <hi>Charles</hi> the first by the Rebels of
that time. <hi>Empson,</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> were no
Favourites of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 7th, but Spunges,
which King <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8th did well Squeeze.
Cardinal <hi>Woolsey</hi> was indeed for divers
years a favourite of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8th, but fell
into disgrace, not for flattering the King, but
for not flattering him in the business of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
from Queen <hi>Katharine.</hi> You see his
Reasoning here, see also his Passion in the
words following. We will for some Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
descend no lower, <hi>Qui eorum vestigiis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistunt,
eorum exitus perhorrescant,</hi> this is put
in for the Favourite (that then was) of King
<hi>James.</hi> But let us give over this, and speak
of the legal Punishments to these Crimes
belonging.</p>

               <head>Of Punishments.</head>
               <p>ANd in the first place I desire to know
who it is that hath the power, for an
Offence committed to define, and appoint
the special manner of Punishment; for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you are not of the Opinion of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi>
in old time, that all faults are equal, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54911:165"/>
that there ought to be the same Punishment
for killing a Man, and for killing a Hen.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>The manner of Punishment in all
Crimes whatsoever is to be determined by
the Common-Law. That is to say, if it be
a Statute that determins it, then the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must be according to the Statute; if it
be not specified by the Statute, then the
Custome in such Cases is to be followed:
But if the Case be new, I know not why
the Judge may not determine it according
to Reason.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But according to whose reason? If
you mean the natural Reason of this, or that
Judge authorized by the King to have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnisance
of the Cause, there being as many
several Reasons, as there are several Men,
the punishment of all Crimes will be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and none of them ever grow up to
make a Custome. Therefore a Punishment
certain can never be assigned, if it have its
beginning from the natural Reasons of depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Judges, no, nor from the natural of the
Supream Judge: For if the Law of Reason
did determine Punishments, then for the
same Offences there should be through all
the World, and in all times the same Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments;
because the Law of Reason is
Immutable and Eternal.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>If the natural Reason neither of the
King, nor of any else be able to prescribe a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54911:166"/>
Punishment, how can there be any lawful
Punishment at all?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Why not? For I think that in this
very difference between the rational Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of particular Men, lyeth the true and
perfect reason that maketh every Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
certain. For, but give the authority
of defining punishments to any Man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
and let that Man define them, and
right Reason has defin'd them. Suppose
the Definition be both made, and made
known before the Offence committed: For
such authority is to trump in Card-playing,
save that in matter of Government, when
nothing else is turn'd up, Clubs are Trump.
Therefore seeing every Man knoweth by
his own Reason what Actions are against
the Law of Reason, and knoweth what Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
are by this authority for every
evil action ordained; it is manifest Reason,
that for breaking the known Laws, he
should suffer the known Punishments. Now
the person to whom this authority of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
Punishments is given, can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in any place of the World, but the
same Person that hath the Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
be it one Man, or one assembly of Men:
For it were in vain to give it to any Person
that had not the power of the Militia to
cause it to be executed; for no less power
can do it, when many Offenders be united
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54911:166"/>
and combin'd to defend one another. There
was a Case put to King <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Nathan,</hi>
of a rich Man that had many Sheep, and of
a poor Man that had but one, which was a
tame Lamb: The rich Man had a stranger
in his House, for whose entertainment (to
spare his own Sheep) he took away the poor
Mans Lamb. Upon this Case the King gave
Judgment, surely the Man that hath done
this shall die. What think you of this?
Was it a Royal, or Tyrannical Judgment?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I will not contradict the Canons of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the King of <hi>England,</hi> within his own
Dominions hath the same Rights, which
the good Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> had in theirs, nor
deny King <hi>David</hi> to have been one of those
good Kings: But to punish with death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a precedent Law, will seem but a harsh
proceeding with us, who unwillingly hear
of Arbitrary Laws, much less of Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Punishments, unless we were sure that
all our Kings would be as good as <hi>David.</hi>
I will only ask you by what Authority the
Clergy may take upon them to determine,
or make a Canon concerning the power of
their own King, or to distinguish between
the Right of a good, and an evil King.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not the Clergy that maketh their
Canons to be Law, but it is the King that
doth it by the Great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54911:167"/>
it is the King that giveth them power to
teach their Doctrines, in that, that he au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriseth
them publickly to teach and
preach the Doctrine of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
according to the Scriptures, wherein
this Doctrine is perspicuously contained.
But if they had derogated from the Royal
Power in any of their Doctrines published,
then certainly they had been too blame;
nay, I believe that had been more within
the Statute of premunire of 16 <hi>Rich. 2. c.</hi> 5.
than any Judge of a Court of Equity for
holding Pleas of Common Law. I cite not
this Precedent of King <hi>David,</hi> as approving
the breach of the great Charter, or justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Punishment with loss of Life, or
Member of every Man that shall offend the
King; but to shew you that before the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was granted, in all Cases where the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
were not prescribed, it was the
King only that could prescribe them; and
that no deputed Judge could punish an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
but by force of some Statute, or by
the words of some Commission, and not <hi>ex
officio.</hi> They might for a contempt of their
Courts, because it is a contempt of the King,
imprison a Man, during the Kings pleasure,
or fine him to the King, according to the
greatness of the Offence: But all this amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to no more, than to leave him to the
Kings Judgment. As for cutting off of Ears,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54911:167"/>
and for the Pillory, and the like corporal
Punishments usually inflicted heretofore in
the Star-Chamber, they were warranted
by the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. that giveth them
power to punish sometimes by discretion.
And generally it is a rule of Reason, that
every Judge of Crimes, in case the positive
Law appoint no Punishment, and he have
no other Command from the King; then to
consult the King before he pronounce Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of any irreparable dammage on the
Offender: For otherwise he doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Law, which is his Office to do,
but makes the Law, which is the Office of
the King. And from this you may collect,
that the Custome of punishing such and
such a Crime, in such and such a manner,
hath not the force of Law in it self, but from
an assured presumption, that the Original
of the Custome was the Judgment of some
former King. And for this Cause the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
ought not to run up for the Customs by
which they are warranted to the time of
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, nor to the time of the
Conquest: For the most immediate, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
precedents are the fairest warrants of
their Judgments, as the most recent Laws
have commonly the greatest vigor, as being
fresh in the memory of all Men, and tacitly
confirmed (because not disapprov'd) by the
Soveraign Legislator. What can be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this?</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edw. Coke 3 Inst.</hi> p. 210. in the
Chapter of Judgments and Executions saith,
that of Judgments some are by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law,
some by Statute-Law, and some
by Custome; wherein he distinguisheth
Common-Law, both from Statute-Law and
from Custome.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But you know, that in other places
he makes the Common-Law, and the Law
of Reason to be all one, as indeed they are,
when by it is meant the Kings Reason; and
then his meaning in this distinction must be,
that there be Judgments by Reason without
Statute-Law, and Judgments neither by Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Law,
nor by Reason, but by Custome
without Reason; for if a Custome be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
then, both he, and other Learned
Lawyers say, it is Common-Law; and if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
no Law at all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I believe Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s meaning was
no other than yours in this point, but that
he inserted the word Custom, because there
be not many that can distinguish between
Customs reasonable and unreasonable.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But Custom, so far forth as it hath
the force of a Law, hath more of the nature
of a Statute, than of the Law of Reason,
especially where the question is not of
Lands, and Goods, but of Punishments,
which are to be defined only by authority.
Now to come to particulars: What Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment

Majesty of the King. But does not this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
make as much for punishing a Traytor
as <hi>Metius Suffetius,</hi> in old time, was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Tullus Hostilius</hi> King of <hi>Rome,</hi> or as
<hi>Ravillac,</hi> not many years ago in <hi>France,</hi> who

no argument from natural Reason; that is

to say, from the Common Law; and that it
is manifest that it is not the general Custom
of the Land, the same being rarely, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
executed upon any Peer of the Realm,
and that the King may remit the whole Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
if he will; it follows, that the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
of the Punishment depends meerly
upon the authority of the King. But this is
certain, that no Judge ought to give other
Judgment, than has been usually given, and
approv'd either by a Statute, or by Consent
express or implyed, of the Soveraign Power;
for otherwise it is not the Judgment of the
Law, but of a Man subject to the Law.</p>

                  <p>He has omitted the Judgment against
a Heretick, because (I think) no Jury con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
Heresie, nor no Judge Temporal did
ever pronounce Judgment upon it: For the
Statute of 2 <hi>H. 5. c.</hi> 7. was, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
having convicted any Man of Heresie,
should deliver him to the Sheriff, and that
the Sheriff should believe the Bishop. The
Sheriff therefore was bound by the Statute
of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. after he was delivered to him,
to burn him; but that Statute being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd,
the Sheriff could not burn him,
without a Writ <hi>de Heretico comburendo,</hi> and
therefore the Sheriff burnt <hi>Legat</hi> 9. king
<hi>James</hi> by that Writ, which was granted by
the Judges of the Common-Law at that
time, and in that Writ the Judgment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>This is strange reasoning; when Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke</hi> knew, and confessed, that the
Statutes upon which the Writ <hi>de Heretico
comburendo</hi> was grounded, were all repeal'd,
how could he think the Writ it self could
be in force? Or that the Statute which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth
the Statutes for burning Hereticks
was not made with an intent to forbid such
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54911:170"/>
burning? It is manifest he understood not
his Books of Common-Law: For in the
time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. the word of the
Bishop was the Sheriff's warrant, and there
was need of no such Writ; nor could he
till the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. when those Statutes were
repeal'd, and a Writ made for that purpose,
and put into the Register, which Writ <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi>
cites in the end of his <hi>natura brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
Again, in the later end of the Reign
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was published a correct
Register of Original and Judicial Writs, and
the Writ <hi>de Haeretico comburendo</hi> left out,
because that Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
against Hereticks were repeal'd, and
burning forbidden. And whereas he citeth
for the granting of this Writ, 9. <hi>Jac.</hi> the
Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Chief Baron,
and two Justices of the Common-pleas, it
is, as to all, but the Lord Chief against
the Law; for neither the Judges of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Pleas,
nor of the Exchequer can hold
Pleas of the Crown (without special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission)
and if they cannot hold Plea, they
cannot condemn.</p>

                  <p>The Punishment for Felony is, that
the Felon be hang'd by the Neck till he be

                  <p>The King may do so, if he please:
And Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> tells you how he altered
particular Judgments in case of Felony, and
sheweth, that Judgment being given upon
a Lord in Parliament, that he should be
hang'd, he was nevertheless beheaded; and
that another Lord had the like Judgment
for another Felony, and was not hang'd,
but beheaded; and withal he shews you
the inconveniency of such proceeding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(saith he) if hanging might be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to beheading, by the same reason it might
be altered to burning, stoning to Death,

                  <p>Perhaps there might be inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in it; but 'tis more than I see, or he
shews, nor did there happen any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
from the execution he citeth: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
he granteth, that death being <hi>ultimum

what is all this to the purpose, when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
not to consider such inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54911:171"/>
of Government but to the King and
Parliament? Or who from the authority of
a deputed Judge can derive a power to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the actions of a King that hath deputed

                  <p>For the death of a Man by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
there is (he saith) no express Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor for killing a Man in ones own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;

                  <p>If we consider what Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>
saith, 1 <hi>Inst. Sect.</hi> 745. at the word <hi>Felony,</hi>
these Judgments are very favourable: For
there he saith, that killing of a Man by
<hi>Chance-medley,</hi> or <hi>se defendendo</hi> is <hi>Felony.</hi> His
words are; wherefore by the Law at this
day, under the word <hi>Felony</hi> in Commissions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is included Petit Treason, Murder, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide,
burning of Houses, Burglary, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
Rape, <hi>&amp;c. Chance-medley,</hi> and <hi>se de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendendo.</hi>
But if we consider only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of him that killeth a Man by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
or in his own defence, the same judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will be thought both cruel, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Judgments. And how they can be <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony</hi>
at this day cannot be understood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there be a Statute to make them so. For
the Statute of 25 <hi>H. 3. cap.</hi> 25. The words
whereof, Murder from henceforth shall not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54911:172"/>
be judged before our Justices, where it is
found Misfortune only; but it shall take
place in such as are slain by <hi>Felony,</hi> and not
otherwise, make it manifest, if they be <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,</hi>
they must also be Murders, unless
they have been made <hi>Felonies</hi> by some latter
Statute.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>There is no such latter Statute, nor
is it to say in Commission; nor can a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
or any thing but another Statute
make a thing <hi>Felony,</hi> that was not so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>See what it is for a Man to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<hi>Felony</hi> into several sorts, before he
understands the general name of <hi>Felony</hi>
what it meaneth; but that a Man, for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
another Man by misfortune only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any evil purpose, should forfeit all his
Goods and Chartels, Debts and Duties, is
a very hard Judgment, unless perhaps they
were to be given to the Kindred of the Man
slain, by way of amends for dammage. But
the Law is not that. Is it the Common-Law
(which is the Law of Reason) that
justifies this Judgment, or the Statute-Law?
It cannot be the Law of Reason, if the
Case be meer misfortune. If a Man be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Apple-tree, to gather his Apples, and
by ill fortune fall down, and lighting on
the Head of another Man kill him, and by
good fortune saves himself; shall he for this
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54911:172"/>
mischance be punished with the forfeiture
of his Goods to the King? Does the Law
of Reason warrant this? He should (you'l
say) have look'd to his Feet; that's true,
but so should he that was under have look'd
up to the Tree. Therefore in this Case the
Law of Reason (as I think) dictates, that
they ought each of them to bear his own
misfortune.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>In this Case I agree with you.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But this Case is the true Case of
meer misfortune, and a sufficient reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Opinion of Sir <hi>Edw. Coke.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But what if this had hapned to be
done by one that had been stealing Apples
upon the Tree of another Man? Then (as Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says, 3 <hi>Inst.</hi> p, 56.) it had been
Murder.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>There is indeed great need of good
distinction in a Case of killing by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
but in this Case the unlawfulness of
stealing Apples cannot make it Murder, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the falling it self be unlawful. It must
be a voluntary unlawful Act that causeth
the death, or else it is no Murder by the
Law of Reason: Now the death of the Man
that was under the Tree proceeded not from
that, that the Apples were not his that fell,
but from the fall. But if a Man shoot with
a Bow or a Gun at another Man's Deer, and
by misfortune kill a Man, such shooting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54911:173"/>
both voluntary, and unlawful, and also
the immediate Cause of the Mans death, may
be drawn perhaps well enough sometimes
to Murder by a Judge of the Common-Law.
So likewise if a Man shoot an Arrow over
a House, and by chance kill a Man in the
Street, there is no doubt but by the Law of
Reason it is Murder, for though he meant
no malice to the Man slain, yet it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that he cared not whom he slew. In
this difficulty of finding out what it is that
the Law of Reason dictates, who is it that
must decide the Question?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>In the Case of misfortune, I think it
belongs to the Jury; for it is matter of Fact
only: But when it is doubtful whether the
action from which the misfortune came,
were Lawful, or Unlawful, it is to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Judge.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But if the unlawfulness of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as the stealing of the Apples) did not
cause the death of the Man, then the stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
be it, Trespass, or <hi>Felony,</hi> ought to
be punished alone, as the Law requireth.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But for killing of a Man <hi>se defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi>
the Jury (as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> here says)
shall not in their Verdict say it was <hi>se de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendendo,</hi>
but shall declare the manner of the
Fact in special, and clear it to the Judge, to
consider how it is to be called, whether <hi>se de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendendo,</hi>
Manslaughter, or Murder.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>One would think so; for it is not
often within the capacity of a Jury to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
the signification of the different
and hard names which are given by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
to the killing of a Man; as Murder and
Felony, which neither the Laws, nor the
makers of the Laws have yet defined. The
Witnesses say, that thus and thus the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
did, but not that it was Murder or <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony;</hi>
no more can the Jury say, who ought
to say nothing but what they hear from the
Witnesses, or from the Prisoner. Nor ought
the Judge to ground his Sentence upon any
thing else, besides the special matter found,
which according as it is contrary, or not
contrary to the Statute, ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But I have told you, that when the
Jury has found misfortune, or <hi>se defenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
there is no judgment at all to be given,
and the Party is to be pardoned of course,
saving that he shall forfeit his Goods and
Chattells, Debts and Duties to the King.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But I understand not how there can
be a Crime for which there is no Judgment,
nor how any Punishment can be inflicted
without a precedent Judgment, nor upon
what ground the Sheriff can seize the Goods
of any Man, till it be judged that they be

that in the Judgment of hanging, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

not; though I understand well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that the Sheriff by his Office may
seize the Goods of a <hi>Felon</hi> convicted; much
less do I conceive how the forfeiture of
Goods can be implyed in a no-judgment, nor
do I conceive, that when the Jury has found
the special manner of the Fact to be such,
as is really no other than <hi>se defendendo,</hi> and
consequently, no fault at all, why he should
have any Punishment at all. Can you shew

                  <p>I find here, that at the making of
this Statute there was a Question amongst
the Lawyers, in case one Man should kill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
that attempted feloniously to Rob,
or Murder him in, or near any Common
High-way, Court-way, Horse-way, or Foot-way,
or in his Mansion, Messuage, or Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place;
whether for the death of such
a Man one shall forfeit his Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells,
as a Man should do for killing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Chance-medley, or in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54911:174"/>
This is the Preamble, and penned
as well as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> could have wished;
but this Statute does not determine that a
Man should forfeit his Goods for killing a
Man <hi>se defendendo,</hi> or for killing him by
misfortune; but supposeth it only upon the
opinion of the Lawyers that then were. The
body of the Statute is, that if a Man be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
or appealed for the death of such
Person so attempting as aforesaid, and the
same by verdict be so found and tryed, he
shall not forfeit any thing, but shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
as if he had been found <hi>not Guilty.</hi>
You see the Statute, now consider thereby
in the case of killing <hi>se defendendo.</hi> Frst, if a
Man kill another in his own defence, it is
manifest, that the Man slain did either at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to Rob, or to Kill, or to Wound him;
for else it was not done in his own defence.
If then it were done in the Street, or near
the Street as in a Tavern, he forfeits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
because the Street is a High-way. So
likewise it is to be said of all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-ways.
In what place therefore can a
Man kill another in his own defence, but
that this Statute will discharge him of the
forfeiture?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But the Statute says the attempt must
be felonious.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>When a Man assaults me with a
Knife, Sword, Club, or other mortal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54911:175"/>
does any Law forbid me to defend my
self, or command me to stay so long as to
know whether he have a felonious intent,
or no? Therefore by this Statute, in case
it be found <hi>se defendendo,</hi> the forfeiture is
discharged, if it be found otherwise, it is
Capital. If we read the Statute of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
cap.</hi> 9. I think it will take away the
difficulty: For by that Statute, in case it be
found by the Countrey, that he did it in
his own defence, or by misfortune, then by
the report of the Justices to the King, the
King shall take him to his Grace, if it please
him. From whence it followeth; first, that
it was then thought Law, that the Jury
may give the general verdict of <hi>se defenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
which Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> denies. Secondly,
that the Judge ought to report especial
matter to the King. Thirdly, that the King
may take him to his Grace, if he please,
and consequently, that his Goods are not to
be seiz'd, till the King (after the report of
the Judge heard) give the Sheriff command
to do it. Fourthly, that the general ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
of the King hinders not the King, but
that he may Judge of it upon the special
matter, for it often happens that an ill-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Person provokes a Man with words,
or otherwise on purpose to make him draw
his Sword, that he may kill him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it done in his own defence; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54911:175"/>
the King may, without any offence
to God, punish him as the cause shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
Lastly (contrary to the Doctrine of
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>) he may in his own Person
be Judge in the case, and annul the Verdict
of the Jury, which a deputed Judge cannot
do.</p>

                  <p>There be some cases wherein a Man,
though by the Jury he be found <hi>not Guilty,</hi>
shall nevertheless forfeit his Goods and
Chattells to the King. For example; a
Man is slain, and one <hi>A.</hi> hating <hi>B.</hi> giveth
out that it was <hi>B.</hi> that slew him: <hi>B.</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof, fearing if he be tryed for it,
that through the great power of <hi>A.</hi> and
others that seek his hurt, he should be
condemned, flieth, and afterwards is taken,
and tryed; and upon sufficient evidence is
by the Jury found <hi>Not Guilty;</hi> yet because
he fled he shall forfeit his Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
notwithstanding there be no such Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given by the Judge, nor appointed by
any Statute, but the Law it self authoriseth
the Sheriff to seize them to the use of the
King.</p>

                  <p>If a Man that is Innocent be accus'd
of <hi>Felony,</hi> and for fear flieth for the same;
albeit that he be judicially acquitted of the
<hi>Felony,</hi> yet if it be found that he fled for
the same, he shall (notwithstanding his
Innocence) forfeit all his Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells,
Debts and Duties. O unchristian, and
abominable Doctrine! which also he in his
own words following contradicteth: For
(saith he) as to the forfeiture of them, the
Law will admit no proof against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of the Law grounded upon his
flight, and so it is in many other cases: But
that the general Rule is, <hi>Quod stabitur prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptioni,
donec probetur in contrarium,</hi> but
you see it hath many exceptions. This ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule contradicts what he said before;
for there can be no exceptions to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rule in Law, that is not expresly made
an exception by some Statute, and to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule of equity there can be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
at all. From the power of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
let us proceed to the power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning.</p>

                  <p>Touching the power of Pardoning,
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says, 3 <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 236. That no
Man shall obtain Charter of pardon out of
Parliament, and cites for it the Statute of
2 <hi>Ed. 3. cap.</hi> 2. and says farther, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
in a Parliament Roll it is said, that
for the peace of the Land it would help,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54911:176"/>
that no pardon were granted but by Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>What lawful power would he have
left to the King, that thus disableth him to
practice Mercy? In the Statute which he
citeth, to prove that the King ought not
to grant Charters of Pardon, but in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
there are no such words, as any Man
may see; for that Statute is in Print; and
that which he says is in the Parliament
Roll, is but a wish of he tells not whom,
and not a Law; and 'tis strange that a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
wish should be inroll'd amongst Acts
of Parliament. If a Man do you an injury,
to whom (think you) belongeth the Right
of pardoning it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Doubtless to me alone, if to me alone
be done that injury; and to the King alone,
if to him alone be done the injury; and to
both together, if the injury be done to
both.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>What part then has any Man in the
granting of a pardon, but the King and
the party wrong'd. if you offend no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of either House, why should you ask
their pardon. It is possible that a Man may
deserve a pardon; or he may be such a one
sometimes as the defence of the Kingdom
hath need of; may not the King pardon him,
though there be no Parliament then sitting?
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s Law is too general in this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54911:177"/>
point, and I believe, if he had thought on't,
he would have excepted some Persons, if
not all the Kings Children, and his Heir
apparent; and yet they are all his Subjects,
and subject to the Law as other Men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>But if the King shall grant pardons
of Murder and Felony, of his own head,
there would be very little safety for any
Man, either out of his House, or in it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Night, or by Day: And for that
very cause there have been many good Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
provided, which forbid the Justices to
allow of such pardons as do not specially
name the Crime.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Those Statutes, I confess, are reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and very profitable, which forbid the
Judge to pardon Murders, but what Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
is there that forbids the King to do it?
There is a Statute of 13 <hi>Rich. 2. c.</hi> 1. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the King promiseth not to pardon Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but there is in it a clause for the sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Kings Regality. From which
may be inferr'd, that the King did not grant
away that power, when he thought good
to use it for the Common-wealth. Such
Statutes are not Laws to the King, but to
his Judges, and though the Judges be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the King not to allow pardons
in many cases, yet if the King by writing
command the Judges to allow them, they
ought to do it. I think, if the King think
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54911:177"/>
in his conscience it be for the good of the
Common-wealth, he sinneth not in it; but
I hold not that the King may pardon him
without sin, if any other Man be damnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Crime committed, unless he cause
reparation to be made, as far as the party
offending can do it: And howsoever be it
sin, or not sin, there is no power in <hi>England</hi>
that may resist him, or speak evil of him
lawfully.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> denies not that; and
upon that ground it is that the King, he
says, may pardon high Treason; for there
can be no high Treason, but against the
King.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>That's well; therefore he confesseth,
that whatsoever the offence be, the King
may pardon so much of it as is an injury to
himself, and that by his own right, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
breach of any Law positive, or natural,
or of any grant, if his Conscience tell him
that it be not to the dammage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
and you know that to judge
of what is good or evil to the Common-wealth,
belongeth to the King only. Now
tell me what it is which is said to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned?</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>What can it be but only the offence?

for the same, is it not the Murder
that is pardoned?</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, by your favour, if a Man be
pardoned for Murder or any other offence,
it is the Man that is pardoned, the Murder
still remains Murder. But what is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Pardon (as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says, 3 <hi>Inst.</hi>
p. 233) is deriv'd of <hi>per</hi> and <hi>dono,</hi> and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
throughly to remit.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>If the King remit the Murder and not
pardon the Man that did it, what does the
remission serve for?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>You know well enough that when
we say a Murder, or any thing else is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
all <hi>English-men</hi> understand thereby,
that the punishment due to the offence is
the thing remitted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But for our understanding of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
you ought to have said so at first.
I understand now, that to pardon Murder
or Felony is throughly to save the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from all the punishment due unto him
by the Law for his offence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Not so; for Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> in the
same Chapter, p. 238. saith thus: A Man
commits Felony, and is attainted thereof,
or is abjur'd; the King pardoneth the Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
without any mention of the attainder or
abjuration, the pardon is void.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>What is it to be attainted?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>To be attainted is, that his Blood be
held in Law as stained and corrupted; so
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54911:178"/>
that no inheritance can descend from him to
his Children, or to any that make claim by
him.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Is this attaint a part of the Crime, or
of the Punishment?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>It cannot be a part of the Crime, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is none of his own Act; 'tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a part of the Punishment, <hi>viz.</hi> a dishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the offender.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>If it be a part of the Punishment due,
and yet not pardoned together with the rest;
then a pardon is not a through remitting of
the Punishment as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says it is.
And what is Abjuration?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>When a Clerk heretofore was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of Felony, he might have saved his
life by abjuring the Realm; that is, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
the Realm within a certain time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and taking an Oath never to return.
But at this day all Statutes for Abjuration
are repeal'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>That also is a Punishment, and by a
pardon of the Felony pardoned, unless a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
be in force to the contrary. There is
also somewhat in the Statute of 13 <hi>Rich. 2.
c.</hi> 1. concerning the allowance of Charters
of pardons, which I understand not well.
The words are these; No Charter of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for henceforth shall be allowed before
our Justices for Murder, or for the death
of a Man by awayt, or malice prepens'd,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54911:179"/>
Treason, or Rape of a Woman, unless the
same be specified in the same Charter, for I
think it follows thence, that if the King say
in his Charter, that he pardoneth the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then he breaketh not the Statute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he specifies the offence; or if he saith,
he pardoneth the killing by awayt, or of
malice prepensed, he breaketh not the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
he specifies the offence. Also if he
say so much as that the Judge cannot doubt
of the Kings meaning to pardon him, I
think the Judge ought to allow it, because
the Statute saveth the Kings liberty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
in that point; that is to say, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to pardon him, such as are these words,
notwithstanding any Statute to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
are sufficient to cause the Charter to be
allowed: For these words make it manifest,
that the Charter was not granted upon sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
but to maintain and claim the Kings
liberty and power to shew mercy, when he
seeth cause. The like meaning have these
words <hi>Perdonavimus omnimodam interfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem;</hi>
that is to say, we have pardoned the
killing in what manner soever it was done.
But here we must remember that the King
cannot pardon, without sin, any dammage
thereby done to another Man, unless he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
satisfaction to be made, as far as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the offender can, but is not bound to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
Mens thirst of revenge; for all revenge
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54911:179"/>
ought to proceed from God, and under God
from the King. Now (besides in Charters)
how are these offences specified?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>They are specified by their names, as

and the like.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Petit Treason is Felony, Murder is
Felony, so is Rape, Robbery and Theft, and
(as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says) Petit Larceny is Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony;
now if in a Parliament-pardon, or
in a Coronation-pardon all Felonies be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned;
whether is Petit Larceny pardoned,
or not?</p>

and yet it is a Crime that hath less in it of
the nature of Felony, than there is in Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.
Do not therefore Rape, Robbery,
Theft, pass under the pardon of all Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies?</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I think they are all pardoned by the
words of the Statute, but those that are by
the same Statute excepted; so that specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is needful only in Charters of pardon,
but in general pardons not so. For the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
13 <hi>Rich. 2. cap.</hi> 1. forbids not the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Parliament-pardons, or Coronation-pardons,
and therefore the offences pardoned
need not be specified, but may pass under
the general word of all Felonies. Nor is it
likely that the members of the Parliament
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54911:180"/>
who drew up their own pardons, did not
mean to make them as comprehensive as
they could: And yet Sir <hi>Edw. Coke, 2 Inst.
Sect.</hi> 745. at the word <hi>Felony,</hi> seemeth to
be of another mind; for <hi>Piracy</hi> is one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>Felony,</hi> and yet when certain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-men</hi>
had committed <hi>Piracy</hi> in the last
year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and came home
into <hi>England,</hi> in the beginning of the Reign
of King <hi>James,</hi> trusting to his Coronation-pardon
of all <hi>Felonies;</hi> they were indicted
(Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> was then Attorney General)
of the <hi>Piracy</hi> before Commissioners accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Statute of 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and being
found <hi>Guilty</hi> were hang'd. The reason he
alledgeth for it is, that it ought to have been
specified by the name of <hi>Piracy</hi> in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and therefore the pardon was not to be
allowed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Why ought it to have been specified
more than any other <hi>Felony?</hi> He should
therefore have drawn his argument from
the Law of reason.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Also he does that; for the Tryal (he
says) was by the Common-Law, and before
Commissioners not in the Court of the Lord
Admiral, by the Civil-Law, therefore he
says it was an offence whereof the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law
could not take notice because
it could not be Tryed by twelve Men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>If the Common-Law could not, or
ought not to take notice of such offences,
how could the offenders be Tryed by twelve
Men, and found <hi>Guilty,</hi> and hang'd, as they
were? If the Common-Law take no notice
of <hi>Piracy,</hi> what other offence was it for
which they were hang'd? Is <hi>Piracy</hi> two
<hi>Felonies,</hi> for one of which a Man shall be
hang'd by the Civil-Law, and for the other
by the Common-Law? Truly I never read
weaker reasoning in any Author of the Law
of <hi>England,</hi> than in Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
how well soever he could plead.</p>

read to Gown-men, do, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but weaken his Authority, for any
Man may do it by a Servant; but seeing
the whole scene of that time is gone and
past, let us proceed to somewhat else. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
doth an Act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> differ from a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-pardon?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>This word <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in our Law-Books before the 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54911:181"/>
                     <hi>c.</hi> 11. and I wish it may never come again;
but from whence it came you may better
know perhaps than I.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>The first, and only <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi>
that ever passed into a Law, in any State
that I have read of, was that <hi>Amnestia,</hi> or
<hi>Oblivion</hi> of all Quarrels between any of the
Citizens of <hi>Athens,</hi> at any time before that
Act, without all exception of Crime, or
Person. The occasion whereof was this.
The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having totally subdued
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> entred into the City of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
and ordained that the People should
choose thirty Men of their own City to have
the Soveraign Power over them. These
being chosen behav'd themselves so outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
as caused a Sedition, in which the
Citizens on both sides were daily slain.
There was then a discreet Person that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to each of the parties this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that every Man should return to his
own, and forget all that was past; which
proposition was made, by consent on both
sides, into a publick Act, which for that
cause was called an <hi>Oblivion.</hi> Upon the
like disorder hapning in <hi>Rome</hi> by the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> the like Act was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by <hi>Cicero,</hi> and indeed passed, but
was within few days after broken again by
<hi>Marcus Antonius.</hi> In imitation of this Act
was made the Act of 12 <hi>Car. 2. c.</hi> 11.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:54911:181"/>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>By this it seems, that the Act of <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion</hi>
made by King <hi>Charles,</hi> was no other
than a Parliament-pardon, because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
a great number of exceptions, as the
other Parliament-pardons do, and the Act
of <hi>Athens</hi> did not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>But yet there is a difference between
the late Act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> made here, and an
ordinary Parliament-pardon: For concerning
a fault pardoned in Parliament by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
word, a suit in Law may arise about
this, whether the offender be signified by
the word, or not, as whether the pardon of
all <hi>Felonies,</hi> be a pardon of <hi>Piracy,</hi> or not:
For you see by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s reports, that
notwithstanding a pardon of <hi>Felony,</hi> a Sea-<hi>Felony</hi>
(when he was Attourney General)
was not pardoned. But by the late Act of
<hi>Oblivion,</hi> which pardoned all manner of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
committed in the late Civil War, no
question could arise concerning Crimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
First, because no Man can by Law
accuse another Man of a Fact, which by
Law is to be forgotten. Secondly, because
all Crimes may be alledged, as proceeding
from the Licentiousness of the time, and
from the silence of the Law occasion'd by
the Civil War, and consequently (unless
the offenders Person also were excepted, or
unless the Crime were committed before the
War began) are within the Pardon.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly I think you say right: For if
nothing had been pardoned, but what was
done by occasion of the War, the raising of
the War it self had not been pardoned.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I have done with Crimes and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
let us come now to the Laws of
<hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>We must then examine the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>We must so, what they command
and forbid, but not dispute of their Justice:
For the Law of Reason commands that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one observe the Law which he hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to, and obey the Person to whom he
hath promised obedience and fidelity. Then
let us consider next the Commentaries of Sir
<hi>Edw. Coke</hi> upon <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other
Statutes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>For the understanding of <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
it will be very necessary to run up into
Antient times, as far as History will give us
leave, and consider not only the Customs
of our Ancestors the <hi>Saxons,</hi> but also the
Law of nature (the most Antient of all Laws)
concerning the original of Government, and
acquisition of Property, and concerning
Courts of Judicature. And first, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that Dominion, Government, and
Laws, are far more Antient than History,
or any other writing, and that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of all Dominion amongst Men was in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54911:182"/>
Families; in which, first, the Father of the
Family by the Law of nature was absolute
Lord of his Wife and Children. Secondly,
made what Laws amongst them he pleased.
Thirdly, was Judge of all their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies.
Fourthly, was not obliged by any
Law of Man to follow any Counsel, but his
own. Fifthly, What Land soever the Lord
sat down upon, and made use of for his
own, and his Families benefit, was his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
by the Law of First-Possession, in
case it was void of Inhabitants before, or by
the Law of War, in case they conquer'd it.
In this Conquest what Enemies they took
and saved were their Servants: Also such
Men as wanting Possessions of Lands, but
furnished with Arts necessary for Mans life,
came to dwell in the Family for Protection,
became their Subjects, and submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Laws of the Family: And all
this is consonant, not only to the Law of
nature, but also to the practice of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
set forth in History Sacred, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you think it lawful for a Lord
that is the Soveraign Ruler of his Family,
to make War upon another like Soveraign
Lord, and dispossess him of his Lands?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>It is Lawful, or not Lawful accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the intention of him that does it.
For, First, being a Soveraign Ruler, he is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54911:183"/>
not subject to any Law of Man; and as to
the Law of God, where the intention is
justifiable, the action is so also. The inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be Lawful in divers Cases by the
right of nature; one of those Cases is, when
he is constrained to it by the necessity of
subsisting. So the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that their leaders, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> had
an immediate command from God to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess
the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> had also a just pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to do what they did from the right of
nature, which they had to preserve their
lives, being unable otherwise to subsist. And
as their preservation, so also is their securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a just pretence of invading those whom
they have just cause to fear, unless suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
caution be given to take away their fear,
which Caution (for any thing I can yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
is utterly impossible. Necessity, and
Security are the principal justifications, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, of beginning War. Injuries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
justifie a War defensive; but for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
injuries, if Reparation be tendred,
all invasion upon that Title is Iniquity. If
you need examples, either from Scripture,
or other History concerning this right of
nature in making War, you are able enough
from your own reading, to find them out at
your leisure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Whereas you say, that the Lands so
won by the Soveraign Lord of a Family, are
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54911:183"/>
his in propriety, you deny (methinks) all
property to the Subjects, how much soever
any of them hath contributed to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I do so, nor do I see any reason to
the contrary: For the Subjects, whether
they come into the Family, have no title
at all to demand any part of the Land, or
any thing else but security, to which also
they are bound to contribute their whole
strength, and, if need be, their whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes:
For it cannot be supposed that any
one Man can protect all the rest with his
own single strength: And for the Practice,
it is manifest in all Conquests, the Land of
the vanquished is in the sole power of the
Victor, and at his disposal. Did not <hi>Joshua</hi>
and the high-Priest divide the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
in such sort among the Tribes of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
as they pleased? Did not the <hi>Roman</hi>
and <hi>Graecian</hi> Princes and States according to
their own discretion, send out the Colonies
to inhabit such Provinces as they had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered?
Is there at this day among the
<hi>Turks</hi> any inheritor of Land, besides the
<hi>Sultan?</hi> And was not all the Land in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
once in the hands of <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror?
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> himself confesses it;
therefore it is an universal truth, that all
Conquer'd Lands, presently after Victory,
are the Lands of him that Conquer'd them.</p>

                  <p>But you know that all Soveraigns
are said to have a double Capacity; <hi>viz.</hi>
a natural Capacity, as he is a Man, and a
a politick Capacity, as a King. In his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Capacity I grant you, that King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
the Conqueror was the proper, and
only owner once of all the Land in <hi>England,</hi>
but not in his natural Capacity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>If he had them in his politick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
then they were so his own as not to
dispose of any part thereof, but only to the
benefit of his People, and that must be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his own, or by the Peoples discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that is, by Act of Parliament. But
where do you find that the Conqueror dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of his Lands (as he did some to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-men,</hi>
some to <hi>French-men,</hi> and some to
<hi>Normans</hi>) to be holden by divers Tenures,
as Knight-service, Soccage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Act of
Parliament? Or that he ever called a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
to have the assent of the Lords and
Commons of <hi>England</hi> in disposing of those
Lands he had taken from them? Or for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of such and such Lands in his own
hands by the name of Forrests for his own
Recreation, or Magnificence? You have
heard perhaps that some Lawyers, or other
Men reputed wise and good Patriots have
given out, that all the Lands which the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> have possessed, have been
given them by the People, to the end that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54911:184"/>
they should therewith defray the Charges
of their Wars, and pay the wages of their
Ministers, and that those Lands were gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Peoples Money; for that was
pretended in the late Civil War, when they
took from the King his Town of <hi>Kingston</hi>
upon <hi>Hull;</hi> but I know you do not think
that the pretence was just. It cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be denyed but that Land which King
<hi>William</hi> the Conqueror gave away to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-men</hi>
and others, and which they now
hold by his Letters Patents, and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances,
were properly, and really his
own, or else the Titles of them that now
hold them must be invalid.</p>

                  <p>I assent. As you have shewed me
the beginning of Monarchies, so let me hear
your opinion concerning their growth.</p>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Great Monarchies have proceeded
from small Families. First, by War, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Victor not only enlarged his Territory,
but also the number and riches of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
As for other forms of Common-wealths,
they have been enlarged otherways.
First, by a voluntary conjunction of many
Lords of Families into one great Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Secondly, by Rebellion proceeded first,
<hi>Anarchy,</hi> and from <hi>Anarchy</hi> proceeded any
form that the Calamities of them that lived
therein did prompt them to; whether it
were that they chose an Hereditary King, or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54911:185"/>
an elective King for life, or that they agreed
upon a Council of certain Persons (which
is <hi>Aristocracy</hi>) or a Council of the whole
People to have the Soveraign Power, which
is <hi>Democracy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the first manner which is by War,
grew up all the greatest Kingdoms in the
World, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian, Assyrian, Persian</hi>
and the <hi>Macedonian Monarchy;</hi> and so did
the great Kingdoms of <hi>England, France,</hi> and
<hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second manner was the original of
the <hi>Venetian Aristocracy,</hi> by the third way
which is Rebellion, grew up in divers great
Monarchies, perpetually changing from one
form to another; as in <hi>Rome</hi> rebellion against
Kings produced <hi>Democracy,</hi> upon which the
Senate usurped under <hi>Sylla,</hi> and the People
again upon the Senate under <hi>Marius,</hi> and
the Emperor usurped upon the People under
<hi>Caesar</hi> and his Successors.</p>

                  <p>Do you think the distinction between
natural and politick Capacity is insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>No; If the Soveraign power be in
an assembly of Men, that Assembly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be <hi>Aristocratical,</hi> or <hi>Democratical,</hi> may
possess Lands, but it is in their politick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
because no natural Man has any
right to those Lands, or any part of them,
in the same manner they can command an
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54911:185"/>
Act by plurality of Commands, but the
Command of any one of them is of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
But when the Soveraign power is in
one Man, the Natural and Politick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
are in the same Person, and as to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of Lands undistinguishable: But as to
the Acts and Commands, they may be well
distinguished in this manner. Whatsoever
a Monarch does Command, or do by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the People of his Kingdom, may
properly be said to be done in his politick
Capacity; and whatsoever he Commands
by word of Mouth only, or by Letters Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

private Seals is done in his natural Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Nevertheless, his publick Commands,
though they be made in his politick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
have their original from his natural
Capacity. For in the making of Laws (which
necessarily requires his assent) his assent is
natural: Also those Acts which are done by
the King previously to the passing of them
under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> either by
word of Mouth, or warrant under his Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
or privy Seal, are done in his natural
Capacity; but when they have past the
Seal of <hi>England,</hi> they are to be taken as
done in his politick Capacity.</p>

publick right. Therefore leaving this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

the Laws and Customs of our Ancestors.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Saxons,</hi> as also all the rest of
<hi>Germany</hi> not Conquer'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
nor compelled to use the imperial
Laws, were a Savage and Heathen People,
living only by War and Rapine; and as
some learned Men in the <hi>Roman</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
affirm, had their name of <hi>Germans</hi> from
that their ancient trade of life, as if <hi>Germans</hi>
and <hi>Hommes de guerre</hi> were all one. Their
rule over their Family, Servants and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
was absolute, their Laws no other than
natural Equity; written Law they had little,
or none, and very few there were in the time
of the <hi>Caesars</hi> that could write, or read. The
right to the Government was either Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
or by Conquest, or by Marriages. Their
succession to Lands was determined by the
pleasure of the Master of the Family, by
Gift, or Deed in his life time; and what
Land they disposed not of in their life time,
descended after their death to their Heirs.
The Heir was the Eldest Son; The issue of
the Eldest Son failing, they descended to the
younger Sons in their order, and for want of
Sons, to the Daughters joyntly, as to one
Heir, or to be divided amongst them, and so
to descend to their Heirs in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54911:186"/>
And Children failing, the Uncle by the
Fathers, or Mothers side (according as the
Lands had been the Fathers or the Mothers)
succeeded to the inheritance, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to the next of blood. And this was
a natural descent, because naturally the
nearer in Blood, the nearer in kindness, and
was held for the Law of nature, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Germans,</hi> but also in most Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
before they had a written Law.</p>
                  <p>The right of Government, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Jus Regni</hi> descended in the same manner,
except only that after the Sons, it came to
the eldest Daughter first, and her Heirs;
the reason whereof was, that Government
is indivisible. And this Law continues still
in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>Seeing all the Land which any Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign

                  <p>There be two sorts of Propriety. One
is, when a Man holds his Land from the
gift of God only, which Lands <hi>Civilians</hi> call
<hi>Allodial</hi> which in a Kingdom no Man can
have but the King. The other is when a
Man holds his Land from another Man as
given him, in respect of service and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to that Man, as a Fee. The first kind
of propriety is absolute, the other is in a
manner conditional, because given for some
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54911:187"/>
service to be done unto the giver. The first
kind of propriety excludes the right of all
others; the second excludes the right of all
other Subjects to the same Land, but not
the right of the Soveraign, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good of the People shall require the
use thereof.</p>

                  <p>When those Kings had thus parted
with their Lands, what was left them for
the maintenance of their Wars, either of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive,
or defensive; or for the maintenance
of the Royal Family in such manner as not
only becomes the dignity of a Soveraign
King, but is also necessary to keep his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

                  <p>They have means enough; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what they gave their Subjects, had
much Land remaining in their own hands af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forrested
for their recreation: For you know
very well that a great part of the Land of
<hi>England</hi> was given for Military service to the
great Men of the Realm, who were for the
most part of the Kings kindred, or great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
much more Land than they had
need of for their own Maintenance; but so
charged with one, or many Souldiers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the quantity of Land given, as
there could be no want of Souldiers, at all
times, ready to resist an invading Enemy:
Which Souldiers those Lords were bound
to furnish, for a time certain, at their own
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54911:187"/>
Charges. You know also, that the whole
Land was divided into Hundreds, and those
again into Decennaries; in which Decenna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
all Men even to Children of 12 years of
age, were bound to take the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance:
And you are to believe, that those
Men that hold their Land by the service of
Husbandry, were all bound with their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and Fortunes to defend the Kingdom
against invaders by the Law of nature: And
so also such as they called Villains, and held
their Land by baser drudgery, were obliged
to defend the Kingdom to the utmost of their
power. Nay, Women, and Children in
such a necessity are bound to do such service
as they can, that is to say, to bring Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
and Victuals to them that fight, and
to Dig: But those that hold their Land by
service Military, have lying upon them a
greater obligation: For read and observe the
form of doing homage, according as it is
set down in the Statute of 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. which
you doubt not, was in use before that time,
and before the Conquest.</p>

to perform with the hazard of my Life,
Limbs and all my Fortune, as I have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
my self to the reception of the Lands
you have given me, and to be ever faithful
to you. This is the form of Homage done
to the King immediately; but when one
Subject holdeth Land of another by the like
Military service, then there is an exception
added; <hi>viz.</hi> saving the faith I owe to the
King.</p>

I shall be to you both faithful, and
lawfully shall do such customs and services,
as my duty is to you at the terms assigned;
so help me God, and all his Saints. But
both these services, and the services of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
were quickly after turned into Rents,
payable either in Money, as in <hi>England;</hi> or
in Corn, or other Victuals, as in <hi>Scotland</hi>
and <hi>France.</hi> When the service was Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the Tenant was for the most part bound
to serve the King in his Wars with one,
or more Persons, according to the yearly
value of the Land he held.</p>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not find any Law that requires

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>I think he was so in the beginning:
For when Lands were given for service Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary,
and the Tenant dying left his Son and
Heir, the Lord had the custody both of Body
and Lands till the Heir was twenty one
years old; and the reason thereof was, that
the Heir till that Age of twenty one years,
was presum'd to be unable to serve the King
in his Wars, which reason had been insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
if the Heir had been bound to go to
the Wars in Person. Which (methinks)
should ever hold for Law, unless by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Law it come to be altered. These ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
together with other Rights, as Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
first, possession of his Tenants inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Licenses for Alienation, Felons Goods,
Felons Lands, if they were holden of the
King, and the first years profit of the Lands,
of whomsoever they were holden, Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Amercements, and many other aids
could not but amount to a very great yearly
Revenue. Add to this all that which the
King might reasonably have imposed upon
Artificers and Tradesmen (for all Men, whom
the King protecteth, ought to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their own protection) and consider
then whether the Kings of those times had
not means enough, and to spare (if God
were not their Enemy) to defend their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
against Forreign Enemies, and also to
compell them to keep the Peace amongst
themselves.</p>

               <sp>

                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>And so had had the succeeding Kings
if they had never given their rights away,
and their Subjects always kept their Oaths,
and promises. In what manner proceeded
those Ancient <hi>Saxons,</hi> and other Nations of
<hi>Germany,</hi> especially the Northern parts, to
the making of their Laws?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> out of divers <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws,
gathered and published in <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>
by Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> inferreth, that the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Kings, for the making of their Laws, called
together the Lords and Commons, in such
manner as is used at this day in <hi>England.</hi> But
by those Laws of the <hi>Saxons</hi> published by
Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> it appeareth, that the Kings
called together the Bishops, and a great part
of the wisest and discreetest Men of the
Realm, and made Laws by their advice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I think so; for there is no King in
the World, being of ripe years and sound
mind, that made any Law otherwise; for
it concerns them in their own interest to
make such Laws as the people can endure,
and may keep them without impatience,
and live in strength and courage to defend
their King and Countrey, against their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
neighbours. But how was it discerned,
and by whom was it determined, who were
those wisest and discreetest Men? It is a
hard matter to know who is wisest in our
times. We know well enough who choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54911:189"/>
a Knight of the Shire, and what Towns
are to send Burgesses to the Parliament,
therefore if it were determined also in those
dayes, who those wise Men should be, then,
I confess, that the Parliaments of the old
<hi>Saxons,</hi> and the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> since
are the same thing, and Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> is in
the right. Tell me therefore, if you can,
when those Towns which now send Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to the Parliament, began to do so, and
upon what cause one Town had this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and another Town, though much
more populous, had not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>At what time began this custom I
cannot tell; but I am sure it is more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
than the City of <hi>Salisbury;</hi> because
there come two Burgesses to Parliament for a
place near to it, called <hi>Old Sarum,</hi> which (as
I Rid in sight of it) if I should tell a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that knew not what the word <hi>Burgess</hi>
meant, he would think were a couple of
Rabbets, the place looketh so like a long
Cony-Borough. And yet a good Argument
may be drawn from thence, that the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of every Town were the Electors of
their own Burgesses, and Judges of their
discretion; and that the Law, whether they
be discreet or not, will suppose them to be
discreet till the contrary be apparent. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where it is said, that the King called
together the more discreet Men of his Realm;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54911:190"/>
it must be understood of such Elections as
are now in use: By which it is manifest, that
those great and general Moots assembled by
the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, were of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the Parliaments assembled since
the Conquest.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>I think your reason is good: For I
cannot conceive, how the King, or any other
but the inhabitants of the Boroughs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
can take notice of the discretion, or
sufficiency of those they were to send to the
Parliament. And for the Antiquity of the
Burgess-Towns, since it is not mentioned in
any History, or certain Record now extant,
it is free for any Man to propound his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.
You know, that this Land was
invaded by the <hi>Saxons</hi> at several times, and
conquered by pieces in several Wars; so that
there were in <hi>England</hi> many Kings at once,
and every of them had his Parliament, and
therefore according as there were more, or
fewer walled Towns within each Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
his Parliament had the more, or
fewer Burgesses: But when all these lesser
Kingdoms were joyned into one, then to
that one Parliament came Burgesses from
all the Burroughs of <hi>England.</hi> And this
perhaps may be the reason, why there be so
many more such Burroughs in the West,
than in any other part of the Kingdom; the
West being more populous, and also more
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54911:190"/>
obnoxious to invaders, and for that cause ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
greater store of Towns Fortified. This
I think may be the original of that priviledge
which some Towns have to send Burgesses
to the Parliament, and others have not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>The Conjecture is not improbable, and
for want of greater certainty, may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But seeing it is commonly receiv'd, that
for the making of a Law, there ought to be
had the assent of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal; whom do you account in the
Parliaments of the old <hi>Saxons</hi> for Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
and whom for Lords Spiritual? For
the Book called <hi>The mode of holding Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,</hi>
agreeth punctually with the manner
of holding them at this day, and was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
(as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> says) in the time of
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and before the Conquest.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (a greater Antiquary than
Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>) in the last Edition of his Book
of Titles of <hi>Honour</hi> says, that that Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Mode, &amp;c.</hi> was not written till about
the time of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and seems to me to prove
it. But howsoever that be, it is apparent
by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws set forth by Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi>
that there were always called to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
certain great Persons called Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>alias</hi> Earls; and so you have a House
of Lords, and a House of Commons. Also
you will find in the same place, that after
the <hi>Saxons</hi> had received the Faith of Christ,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54911:191"/>
those Bishops that were amongst them, were
always at the great Mootes, in which they
made their Laws.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have a perfect <hi>English</hi> Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
saving that the name of Barons was
