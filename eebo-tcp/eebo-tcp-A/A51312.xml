            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER, upon the first Book of PSYCHOZOIA.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His first book, as you may judge by the names therein, was intended for a mere Platonicall description of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall life, or life that is omnipresent, though not alike omnipresent. As in Noahs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, the water that overflowed the earth was present in every part thereof, but every part of the water was not in every part of the earth, or all in every part; so the low Spirit of the Universe, though it go quite through the world, yet it is not totally in every part of the world; Else we should heare our Antipodes, if they did but whisper: Because our lower man is a part of the inferiour Spirit of the Universe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ahad, Aeon,</hi> and <hi>Psyche</hi> are all omnipresent in the World, after the most perfect way that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reason can conceive of. For they are in the world all totally and at once every where.</p>
                  <p>This is the famous Platonicall Triad: which though they that slight the Christian Trinity do take for a figment; yet I think it is no contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible argument, that the Platonists, the best and divinest of Philosophers, and the Christians, the best of all that do professe religion, do both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur that there is a Trinity. In what they differ,
<pb facs="tcp:53830:4"/>
I leave to be found out, according to the safe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of that infallible Rule of Faith, the holy Word.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I shall not be blamed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but ignorance and malignity, for being invited to sing of the second Unity of the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Triad, in a Christian strain and Poeticall scheme, that which the holy Scripture witnesseth of the second Person of the Christian Trinity. As that his patrimony is the possession of the whole earth. For if it be not all one with Christ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Divinity (although their attributes sute exceeding well: For that second Unity in the Platonicall Triad, is called <hi>Filius Boni,</hi> The Son of the Good; The Christian second Person, <hi>The Sonne of God;</hi> He, <gap reason="foreign">

Yet the Platonists placing him in the same order, and giving him the like attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, with the Person of the Sonne in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, it is nothing harsh for me to take occasion from hence to sing a while the true Christian Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocalon, whose beauty shall adorn the whole Earth in good time; if we believe the Prophets.
<pb facs="tcp:53830:4"/>
For that hath not as yet happened. For Christ is not where ever his name is: <note n="*" place="margin">This opinion, though it have its moments of reason, yet every mans judgement is left free, and will ever be, where there is no demonstration to bind it to assent.</note> but as he is the Truth, so will he be truly displayed upon the face of the whole Earth. For God doth not fill the world with his glory by words and sounds, but by spirit, and life, and realtie.</p>
                  <p>Now this Eternall life I sing of, even in the midst of my Platonisme: for I cannot conceal from whence I am, <hi>viz.</hi> of Christ; but yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, that God hath not left the Heathen, Plato especially, without witnesse of himself. Whose doctrine might strike our adulterate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian professours with shame and astonishment; their lives falling so exceeding short of the better Heathen. How far short are they then of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and transcendent high mystery of true Christianisme? To which Plato is a very good subservient Minister; whose Philosophy I singing here in a full heat, why may it not be free for me to break out into an higher strain, and under it to touch upon some points of Christianitie; as well as all-approved Spencer sings of Christs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Pan? Saint Paul also transfers those things that be spoken of Jupiter, to God himself, Arat. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He very nerves and sinews of Religion is hope of immortality. What greater incitement to virtue and justice then eternall happinesse? what greater ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculament from wickednesse, then a full perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of after-judgement and continuall torture of spirit? But my labour is superfluous. Men from their very childhood are perswaded of these things. Verily, I fear how they are perswaded of them when they become men. Else would not they, vvhom the fear of hell doth not affright, die so unvvillingly, nor vvicked men so securely; nor vvould so many be vvicked. For even natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall-providence vvould bid them look forvvard.</p>
                  <p>Beside, some men of a melancholick temper (vvhich commonly distrust and suspicion do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company) though othervvise pious, yet out of an exceeding desire of eternall being, think they can never have security enough for this so pleasing hope and expectation, and so even vvith anxiety of mind busie themselves to prove the truth of that strongly, vvhich they desire vehemently to be true. And this body, vvhich dissolution vvaits upon, helpeth our infidelity exceedingly. For the soul not seeing it self, judgeth it self of such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:53830:35"/>
as those things are to which she is nearest united: Falsly saith, but yet ordinarily, I am sick, I am weak, I faint, I die; when it is nough: but the perishing life of the body that is in such plight, to which she is so close tied in most inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate love and sympathy. So a tender mother, if she see a knife struck to her childs heart, would shreek and swound as if her self had been smit; whenas if her eye had not beheld that spectacle, she had not been moved though the thing were surely done. So I do verily think that the mind being taken up in some higher contemplation, if it should please God to keep it in that ecstasie, the body might be destroyed without any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to the soul. For how can there be or sense or pain without animadversion?</p>
                  <p>But while we have such continuall commerce with this frail body, it is not to be expected but that we shall be assaulted with the fear of death and darknesse. For alas! how few are there that do not make this visible world, their Adonai, their stay and sustentation of life, the prop of their soul, their God? How many Christians are not prone to whisper that of the Heathen Poet,

But I would not be so injurious, as to make men worse then they are, that my little work may seem of greater use and worth then it is.</p>
                  <p>Admit then that men are most what perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the souls immortality, yet here they may reade reasons to confirm that perswasion, and be put in mind, as they reade, of their end, and future condition, which cannot be but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable at least.</p>
                  <p>For the pleasure they'll reap from this Poem, it will be according as their Genius is fitted for it. For as Plato speaks in his Io, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the more usuall phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. The spirit of every Poet is not alike, nor his writings alike suteable to all dispositions. As Io, the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Homers verses, professeth himself to be snatcht away with an extraordinary fury or ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie at the repeating of Homers Poesie, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers so little to move him that he could even fall asleep. So that no man is rashly to condemn ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans labour in this kind, because he is not taken with it. As wise or wiser then himself may.</p>
                  <p>But this is a main piece of idolatry and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in the world, that every man would make his private Genius an universall God; and would devour all mens apprehensions by his own fire, that glowes so hot in him, and (as he thinks) shines so clear.</p>
                  <p>As for this present song of the immortality of the soul, it is not unlikely but that it will prove

sung <hi>Montibus &amp; Sylvis</hi> to the waste Woods and solitary Mountains. For all men are so full of their own phansies and idiopathyes, that they scarce have the civility to interchange any words with a stranger. If they do chance to heare his exotick tone, they entertain it with laughter, a passion very incident upon that occasion to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and clowns. But it were much better nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to embosome nor reject any thing, though strange, till we were well acquainted with it.</p>
                  <p>Exquisite disquisition begets diffidence; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in knowledge, humility; humility, good manners and meek conversation. For mine own part, I desire no man to take any thing. I write upon trust, vvithout canvasing; and vvould be thought rather to propound then to assert vvhat I have here or elsevvhere vvritten. But continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to have exprest my diffidence in the very tractates themselves, had been languid and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
                  <p>It vvere a piece of injustice to expect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that vvhich I could never indure to stoup to my self. That knovvledge vvhich is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humane authority is no better then a Castle in the Aire. For vvhat man is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or at least can be prov'd to us to be so? Wherefore the foundation of that argument will but prove pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, that is so built. And we have rather a sound of words signifiing the thing is so, then any true understanding that the thing is so indeed.</p>
                  <p>What ever may seem strange in this Poem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne

it not, till thou findest it dissonant to Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's school, or not deducible from it. But there be many arguments, that have no strangenesse at all to prove the soules immortality; so that no man that is not utterly illiterate shall lose his labour in reading this short treatise.</p>
                  <p>I must confesse I intended to spin it out to a greater length; but things of greater importance then curious theory, take me off; beside the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of speaking hard things to a multitude.</p>
                  <p>I make no question, but those that are rightly acquainted with Platonisme, will accept of that small pains, and make a good construction of my poetry. For I will assure thee (Reader) that it will be nothing but igorance of my scope, that shall make any do othervvise I fly too high to take notice of lesser flaws. If thou seest them, I give thee free liberty to mend them. But if thou regardest not lesser trifles, we be well met.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O preface much concerning these lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after-pieces of Poetry, I hold need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, having spoke my mind so fully before. The motives that drevv me to adde them to the former are exprest in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems themselves. My drift is one in them all: vvhich is to raise a certain number of vvell orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Phantasms, fitly shaped out and vvarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, vvhich I set to skirmish and conflict vvith all the furious phansies of Epicurisine and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme. But here's my disadvantage, that victory vvill be no victory, unlesse the adversary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge himself overcome. None can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge himself overcome, unlesse he perceive the strength, and feel the stroke of the more povv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull arguments. But the exility and subtletie of many, and that not of the meanest, is such (nor can they be othervvise) that they vvill (as that kind of thunder vvhich the Poets do commonly call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from its over quick and penetrating energie) go through their more <hi>porous</hi> and spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie minds vvithout any sensible impression.</p>
                  <p>Sure I am that sensuality is alvvayes an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to subtilty of reason, vvhich hath its rise from subtilty of phansie: so that the life of the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:53830:94"/>
vigorous and radiant in the soul, hinders us of the sight of more attenuate phantasms. But that being supprest or very much castigate and kept under, our inward apprehension grows clearer and larger. Few men can imagine any thing so clearly awake, as they did when they were asleep. And what's the reason, but that the sense of the body is then bound up or dead in a manner?</p>
                  <p>The dark glasse-windows will afford us a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illustration for this purpose. Why is it that we see our ovvn faces there by night? What can reflect the species (as they phrase it) when the glasse is pervious and transparent? Surely refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the ordinary apprehension is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. The darknesse behind the glasse is enough to exhibit visibly the forms of things within, by hiding stronger objects from the eye, which would burie these weak idola in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ore ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lustre.</p>
                  <p>The starres shine and fill the aire with their species by day, but are to be seen onely in a deep pit, which may fence the Sunnes light from stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our sight so strongly. Every contemptible candle conquers the beams of the Moon, by the same advantage that the Sunnes doth the Starres, viz. propinquitie. But put out the candle, and you will presently find the moon-light in the room; exclude the moon, and then the feeblest of all species will step out into energie, we shall behold the night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:53830:94"/>
All this is but to shew, how the stronger or nearer <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth obscure the weaker or further off; and how that one being removed, the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie' of the other will easily appear.</p>
                  <p>Now that our comparison may be the fitter, let us consider what Aristotle saith of phansie, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Thus much I will take of him, that Phansie is sense; and adde to it that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is also <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and what I have intimated in some passages of these Poems, That the soul doth alwayes feel it self, its own actuall Idea, by its omniform centrall self. So that the immediate sense of the soul is nothing else but to perceive its own energie.</p>
                  <p>Now sith that, that which we call outward sense, is indeed the very energie of the soul, and inward sense which is phansie can be but the very energie of the soul, there seems to be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and intrinsecall difference betwixt the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of any form; no more then there is betwixt a frog born by the Sunne and mere slime, and one born by copulation: For these are but extrinsecall relations. Wherefore <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the soul it self is all one.</p>
                  <p>But now sith it is the same nature, why is there not the same degree of energie in both? I say there is, as appears plainly in sleep, where we find all as clear and energeticall as when we wake.</p>
                  <p>But here these <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (for I have prov'd them all one) do as greater and
<pb facs="tcp:53830:95"/>
lesser lights dim one another; or that which is nearest worketh strongliest. Hence it is that the light or life of this low spirit or body of ours, stirring the soul into a perpetuall sensuall ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, if we foster this and unite our minds, will, and animadversion with it, will by its close nearnesse with the soul dim and obscure those more subtil and exile phantasms or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> risen from the soul it self, or occasioned by other mens writings. For they will be in the flaring light or life of the body as the stars in the beams of the Sunne, scarce to be seen, unlesse we withdraw our selves out of the flush vigour of that light, into the profunditie of our own souls, as into some deep pit.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore men of the most tam'd and casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate spirits are of the best and most profound judgement, because they can so easily withdraw themselves from the life and impulse of the lower spirit of this body.</p>
                  <p>Thus being quit of passion, they have upon any occasion a clear though still and quiet repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of every thing in their minds, upon which pure bright sydereall phantasms unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced reason may safely work, and clearly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what is true or probable.</p>
                  <p>If my vvritings fall into the hands of men othervvise qualified, I shall gain the lesse appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. But if they vvill endeavour to compose themselves as near as they can to this temper; though they vvere of another opinion then vvhat
<pb facs="tcp:53830:95"/>
my writings intend to prove, I doubt not but they vvill have the happinesse to be overcome, and to prove gainers by my victorie.</p>
                  <p>To say any thing more particularly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these last I hold it needlesse. Onely let me excuse my self, if any chance to blame me for my <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as confuting that which no man will assert. For it hath been asserted by some; as those Mauri whom Ficinus speaks of; and the question is also discussed by Plotinus in his fourth Ennead, where he distinguisheth of, <hi>all souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one,</hi> after this manner, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The latter member is that, vvhich my arguments conclude against. Though they vvere <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> yet vvere vve safe enough; as safe as the beams of the Sunne the Sunne existing. But the similitude of Praxiteles broken glasse is brought in, according to the apprehension of such, as make the image to vanish into nothing, the glasse being taken away: and that as there is but one face, though there be the appearances of many; so though there be the appearances of many souls, by reason of that ones vvorking in divers bodies, yet there is but one soul; and understanding sense and motion to be the acts of this one soul infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming severall bodies.</p>

As for the Oracles ansvver to Amelius, if any vulgar conceited man think it came from a devil with bats vvings and a long tail, the Seventies translation of the eighth verse of 32 chapter of Deuteronomie may make it at least doubtfull. <hi>When the most high divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sonnes of Adam he set the bounds of the people,</hi>

                  <p>But if Apollo who gave so good a testimony of Socrates vvhile he vvas living, and of Plotinus after his death, vvas some foul fiend, yet tis no prejudice to their esteem, since our Saviour Christ vvas acknovvledged by the devil.</p>

            <p>IF any man conceive I have done amisse in using such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure words in my writings, I answer, That it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time fit for Poeticall pomp sake, as in my Psychozoia: Othersome time necessitie requires it,

as Lucretius pleads for himself in like case.

Now there is no self-deniall where there is no corrupt or evil life to be supprest and unsatisfied; nor any Patience or Hypomone, where there is no agonie from the vexation of self-deniall.

            <p>THus have I briefly run through the more obscure terms in my Poems, which I shall God willing hereafter, if mens acceptance of these my first endeavours invite me to it, and mine own occasions permit, expound more sully, and speak more determinately of those speculations, which I now have but propos'd to mens more serious considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to weigh freely and warily, not so little a moment as the inconsiderable assent of the authour cast in, to prejudice their judgements.</p>
            <p>The drift of the whole book is this, to stirre men up to take into their thoughts, these two main points; The hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie good will of God to mankind, even in the life of this world, made of the commixture of light and darknesse,
<pb facs="tcp:53830:125"/>
that he will through his power rescue those souls, that are faithfull in this their triall, and preferre the light before the dark; that he will, I say, deliver them from the power of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Death, and Hell, by that strong arm of their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Jesus Christ, the living God enthron'd in the heart of man, to whom all the Geni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They and all their curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous devices and inventions shall be a spoil, prey, and a possession to Him that is most just, and shall govern the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in righteousnesse and equitie. And that, beside this happinesse on earth, every holy soul hereafter shall enjoy a never-fading felicitie in the invisible and eternall Heaven, the Intellectuall world. Which if it be not true, I must needs confesse, it seems almost indifferent whether any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be or no. For what is it to have lived suppose 70 years, wherein we have been dead or worse above two third parts of them? Sleep, youth, age and diseases, with a number of poore and contemptible employments, swallow up at least so great a portion: That as good, if not better, is he that never was, then he is, that hath but such a glance or glimps of passing life to mock him.</p>
            <p>And although the succession of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ighteousnesse upon earth may rightly seem a goodly great and full spread thing, and a matter that may bear an ample correspondencie even to the larger thoughts of a good and upright man; yet, to say the truth, no man is capable of any large inheritance, whose life and existence is so scant that he shall not be able so much as to dream of the least happinesse once seised on by death.</p>
            <p>But there are continually on earth such numbers of men alive, that if they liv'd well it would be an heaven or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise. But still a scant one to every particular man, whose dayes are even as nothing. So that the work of God seems not considerable, in the making of this world, if humane souls be extinguished when they go out of it. You will say that those small particles of time that is thus scattered and lost among men in their successions, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e comprehended and collected in God who is a continuall witnesse of all things.</p>
            <p>But, alas! what doth the perpetuall repetition of the
<pb facs="tcp:53830:125"/>
same life or deiform image throughout all ages adde to Him, that is at once infinitely himself, viz. good, and happy?</p>
            <p>So that there is nothing considerable in the creation if the rationall creature be mortall. For neither is God at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by it, nor man considerably. And were not the Angels a great deal better employed in the beholding the worth of their Creatour, then to diminish their own happinesse, by attending those, whom nothing can make happie? looking on this troubled passing stream of the perishing generations of men, to as little purpose almost, as idle boyes do on dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing blebs and bubbles in the water.</p>
            <p>What designe therefore can there be in God in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this world that will prove <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, worthy of so excellent a goodnesse and wisdome; but the triall of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall spirit of man? It seems the deepest reach of his counsel in the creation; and the life of this world but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to one of longer durance and larger circumference hereafter. And surely it is nothing else but the heavy load of this bodie, that keeps down our mind from the reaching to those so high hopes, that I may not say from a certain sense and feeling of that clear and undisturbd state of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie. I will close all with the praise of those two main indowments of the mind, viz. Charitie and Humilitie, which certainly will make us meet eternall mansions for the ever-living Deitie. But without these, mans soul after this life becomes but a den of devils, a dungeon of dark and restlesse phantasms, being incorporate into the ever-gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and corroding spirit of Hell.</p>
