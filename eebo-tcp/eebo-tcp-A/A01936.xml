            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Refuge of a Snner. It is obſerved in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that for all weake creatures God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſeverall Refuges to runne unto to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in times of feare and danger: thus the child runnes to the Parent for Refuge, the Chickens to the Henne, the Conies to the Burrowes; the Foxe to the Earth, and the Sinner to heaven: <hi>The eternall God is thy Refuge</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 33. 27.) <hi>and his everlaſting armes are underneath thee,</hi> (as it were) to embrace thee, to hold thee, to keepe thee up from the ſinke of ſinne, from the pit of perdition, from deſpaire of Grace, and from a downefall into hell. <hi>The Lord will be a refuge for the poore,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 9. 9.) <hi>even a Refuge in due time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> marke that hee ſaith, <hi>A refuge for the poore;</hi> that is, for ſuch as are poore in Spirit, though they be not poore in purſe, they that are truely ſenſible of their owne ſpirituall povertie, of their want of Faith, and want of Grace, and want of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Vertue: They that are alwayes ſpeaking ſupplications to God (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, it is the proper language, the naturall Dialect of a poore man to ſpeake ſupplications, to make his moane, and make knowne his wants to every one that will give him the hearing) they that are alwayes ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of heaven with petitions, God will be a double refuge for ſuch (for ſo <hi>David</hi> ingeminates and doubleth the word) A refuge for their bodies, and a refuge for their ſoules, a refuge for themſelves, and a refuge for their children, a refuge while they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3481:4"/>
live, and a refuge when they die, a refuge in the time of wealth, but a preſent refuge in due time of trouble, for then he never failes. In the Singing <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> it runnes thus, <hi>God is protectour of the poore;</hi> God is the poore mans protectour, as <hi>David</hi> was the poore mans Captaine, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>Every one that was in diſtreſſe, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was diſcontented, gathered themſelves unto him and hee became a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine over them.</hi> In like manner whatſoever your diſtreſſe be, whatſoever your debts, whatſoever your diſcontents, gather your ſelves to heaven, addreſſe your ſuits to God, and apply your ſelves to Chriſt, and hee hath promiſed in his holy Goſpell. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 37. Whoſoever commeth to mee, be hee poore or rich, <hi>non eijciam for as,</hi> I will in no wiſe caſt him out.</p>
            <p>Oh what an encouragement ſhould this be unto us at all times, eſpecially in the time of neede, when the bucket is broken to goe to the fountaine, when any thing is loſt or amiſle, ſeeke to mend it, and make it up in God. As the man of God anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 9. when he tooke care what he ſhould doe for his hundred talents which hee had given away, (ſaith he) <hi>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this;</hi> ſo beleeve it, there is no man ſo poore, but God is able to make him rich; no man ſo ſicke, but God is able to make him whole; no man ſo loſt and caſt downe in the world, but God is able to reſtore and raiſe him up: and whoſoever hee be that referres himſelfe to God, that caſts and rolleth himſelfe upon his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3481:5"/>
hee ſhall one day finde that there is a God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that will doe every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man right, and in the end give every man ſatisfaction. I ſay (in the end) for our life in this world is but juſt like a Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, where the matter is not great what part the Player acteth, whether the part of a King, or the part of a clowne, the part of a Prince, or the part of a begger; the maine of all is, what ſhare he ſhall receive when the play is ended.</p>
            <p>In like ſort, God hath appointed every ſeverall man his ſeverall part to act in this world; ſome have a longer part, ſome a ſhorter, ſome act a poore part, ſome a rich one: now God ſend us but a ſhare in heaven when wee come to die; and let us act in this life what part ſoever ſhall pleaſe God to impoſe upon us: knowing this, that if the worſt come that can come, God will be our Lord to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us, Chriſt will be our ſurety to baile us, and heaven ſhall be our refuge to relieve us.</p>

               <hi>[Whom have I in heaven but thee?]</hi> So much in generall, I come now to particulars, to ſhew you the myſterie, and the hidden meaning of the Text.</p>

            <p n="1">1 If wee take it as an expreſſion of Faith, and Affiance in God, then the meaning is this, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee to rely upon.</hi>

            <p>Give me leave to ſtrike theſe ſeverall flints, to give you a touch or two upon theſe ſeverall accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and I hope in Chriſt, that each of them will affoord you a ſparke to enlighten the Text, and to kindle the zeale of God in the ſoules of all that heare it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In the firſt place, wee will take it as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Faith and Affiance in God, according to this meaning, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee to relie upon;</hi> I meane in <hi>Auguſtiâ,</hi> in a ſtraight, for while a man proſpers in ſinne, and wants no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſuſtentacula,</hi> no friends nor meanes to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proppe and ſhore him up, ſo long hee doth not know what it is to ſtand in neede of God; but let theſe proppes and ſhores be taken from him, theſe friends and meanes beginne to faile him, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſorrow come to ſeaze upon him, the one upon his body, the other upon his ſoule, hee ſhall then know (as <hi>Naaman</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eliſha) There is no God in all the world, but onely the God of Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 5. 15. if hee had not a God to rely upon, hee were undone for ever. <hi>His name</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) is a ſtrong tower, the righteous flie unto it and are ſafe, Prov.</hi> 18. 10.

walls are ſcaled, the houſes left, and all fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions forſaken and fled from, then the Tower holds out laſt, and is a Refuge to flie unto in their laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie. Such uſe maiſt thou make of God in thy greateſt ſtraits: if it ſo fall out that thy out-workes be taken, I meane, thy goods conſumed by fire, or loſt by ſea, or ſuretiſhip; or thy walls be ſcaled, I meane, thy bodies health endangered by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or a lingring ſickneſſe; and thy houſe within, I meane thy heart, left deſolate and deſtitute of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpirituall comfort, then flie to the Tower, gather upward to heaven, in-ſoule thy ſelfe into God, and trie what God will doe for thy ſoule.

               <hi>Plutarke</hi> reports of the men of <hi>Athens,</hi> that when their citie was viſited and long puniſhed, as our citie of <hi>London</hi> (God helpe us) is and hath beene, with a dangerous and contagious ſickneſſe, they had recourſe to the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> to know what they ſhould doe to be rid of their mortalitie; the Oracle anſwered (as Oracles uſually did) in a doubtfull way, If they would be freed of the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they muſt <hi>Duplare Aram,</hi> double the Altar: This they underſtood to be meant in a literall ſence, and thereupon went about to compaſſe the Altar, and to take the juſt proportion of it, to make it twice as bigge as it was before: but the meaning of the Oracle was myſticall; they ſhould double the Altar, that is, double their ſacrifices and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Altar. In like manner, the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that I can preſcribe from God unto you, to be eaſed of this affliction, and to be rid of this mortalitie, is to double the Altar, I meane, to double your devotions, and your ſpirituall ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

            <p n="3">3 An expreſſion of Love and Affection to God, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee to ſet my heart upon?</hi> The Lord &amp; giver of life, who loadeth us daily with benefits, even the God of our ſalvation, who giveth all things richly to enjoy; deſireth no other Boone, nor other Recompence for all his mercies, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that wee love him with our hearts. <hi>My Sonne give me thy heart.</hi> Alas Lord, (may ſome poore Chriſtian ſay) Oh that I had ſuch an heart as were fit to be given to thee, that were but a fit token to be given and preſented to ſo holy, ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly a God, that it were but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, worthy in any meaſure of thy gracious acceptation, but I feare I have it not. The Scripture ſpeakes of three ſorts of hearts. Firſt, the beſt ſort. Secondly, the worſt ſort. Thirdly, the middle ſort. 1. The beſt ſort are cleane hearts, pure hearts, hearts that be without any guile, according to the Heart of God (as <hi>Davids</hi> was ſaid to be,) theſe be fitting hearts to be given to the Lord, but alas, wee have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3481:9"/>
them not to give. 2. The worſt ſort, are hard and ſtony hearts, proud and malicious hearts, hearts that burne like an Oven (as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeaks) with the fire of luſt and hell, too many ſuch hearts there be in the world, but it is a venture whether God will owne them if wee ſhould offer to give them. 3. Then there are a middle ſort of hearts which are, <hi>A broken and a contrite heart,</hi> a dutifull and a thankefull heart, an honeſt and a true heart, a tender and a loving heart (though full of imperfections otherwiſe;) God ſend us but ſuch hearts as theſe, and no doubt hee will accept them. It was an humble requeſt of good S. <hi>Auguſtine, Ecce cor meum, Deus meus, ecce cor meum, Behold my heart, O my God, behold my heart, what an evill, what a naughty one it is; and thou that madeſt it, in thy good time mend it, and make it ſuch a one as thou wouldeſt have it. Bone Domine</hi> (ſaith devout Saint <hi>Bernard) amo te quantum poſſum, non quantum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo; da plus amoris, &amp; plus amabo. O my good Lord, I love thee as much as I am able, though not halfe ſo much as I ought, give mee but more love, and I will love thee more. Oh knit my heart unto thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 86. 11.) <hi>that I may love and dread thy Name: Vni cor meum,</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Hebrew) Vnite it and make it one with thee:</hi> As if hee had prayed, and ſaid; Lord, breake and diſſolve the vnlawfull contract that is betwixt my ſoule and my ſinnes, or betwixt my heart and the world, and tie it to thy ſelfe in an undiſſolvably union, that it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with thy heavenly grace, and cantinue thine for ever. There is no one thing that doth ſo alienate
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3481:9"/>
a mans heart from God, as to ſet it upon the world: therefore the holy Ghoſt gives a ſpeciall injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>If riches increaſe ſet not your heart upon them, Pſal.</hi> 62. 10. The increaſe of riches is no wayes culpable, nor worthy of blame (for it is the bleſſing of God upon our good endeavours,) but it is <hi>Poſitio cordis,</hi> the ſetting on of the heart upon them, (as the Bee ſets on her ſting) with the greateſt ſtrength of our affections: the rockes that are in the ſea, of themſelves doe the ſhippes no harme, but it is the ruſhing of the ſhippes againſt the rocke that ſplits them: when it fares with a man, as did with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 6. when their hearts went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Abſalom,</hi> they fell from <hi>David</hi> their true King; ſo when a mans heart ſhall goe after the world that he falls from God; this is diſloyalty to the King of Kings. In a word, let it be our conſtant reſolution, and the truth of our Religion, that though we muſt of neceſſity ſomtimes ſet our minds upon the world for the diſpatch of our preſent buſineſſe, yet let us doe it evermore with ſuch an abſtraction, ſuch a mentall reſervation, that our hearts be not taken off from God. For thats the third intention &amp; meaning of the words, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee to ſet my heart upon?</hi> I come now to the laſt, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the moſt needfull, and moſt agreeable to this preſent time, and that is;</p>

I remember it is recorded of <hi>Ionahs</hi> Mariners, that when the danger was paſt, the ſea was calme and all was quiet, <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>the men feared the Lord exceedingly, Ionah</hi> 1. 16.

tell whether God would not ſend ſuch another ſtorme, ſuch another Tempeſt, ſuch another Iudgement upon them; therefore they thought it their beſt and ſafeſt way to feare him then, yea to feare him exceedingly.</p>
            <p>Oh, that wee Chriſtians had the grace to learne this leſſon of theſe Heathens, namely, To feare God for his goodneſſe: ſo that if God ſhould be pleaſed (as I truſt hee will) to ſtay his hand, to ceaſe the ſickneſſe, to cauſe his revenging Angell to paſſe over us, and to ſend a gracious raine upon his Inheritance, now that tis weary and even ſpent with Drought; ſhall wee feare God the leſſe for this, and care the leſſe for his favour? God forbid: for why? Wee doe not know, but God may ſend ſuch another Plague, ſuch another Drought, ſuch another Iudgement upon us, and doe us more harme than ever hee did us good: And therefore, while wee are well, and enjoy our peace, and live under mercy, let us with feare and reverence looke up to God, and ſay, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee to fixe mine eyes upon.</hi>

Now when God ſhall ſay unto a ſoule, <hi>Thou art mine,</hi> and the ſoule ſhall anſwer to God and ſay, <hi>I am thine;</hi> This mutuall Stipulation, this mutuall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouchment betwixt God and a good ſoule; this makes up the match (as it were) and confirmes the covenant, and gives a man boldneſſe towards God, that hee is not afraid to claime an intereſt in God, and ſay, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>[Whom have I in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee?]</hi> For marke it, one that is an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, that beares no true faith to God, dares not make any application of God to himſelfe, but ſpeakes of him, as of one that concernes others and not himſelfe. <hi>Pray to your God for me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pharoah</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Exod.</hi> 10. 17.) and ſo <hi>Darius, Dan.</hi> 6. 26. calleth him <hi>Daniels</hi> God, not his God: Their conſciences told them that they were not the Lords, and therefore they durſt not ſeeme to ſpeake as if the Lord were theirs, nor claime any intereſt or propriety in him; <hi>Quid nobis &amp; tibi</hi> (ſaid the divells to Chriſt) <hi>What have we to doe with thee Ieſus thou Sonne of God?</hi> They that will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3481:13"/>
to doë with God as his ſervants, can have but ſmall hope that God will have any thing to doe with them as their Saviour, or that God will ever owne them as his children, that would never ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him as a Father. The firſt time that ever wee read that God was called the God of one man more than of another, was <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 26. when <hi>Shem</hi> had acted that dutifull part towards his deſpiſed Father in covering his nakedneſſe: then <hi>Noah</hi> breakes out into this Divine Benediction, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Shem.</hi> This (I ſay) was the firſt time that ever God was appropriated to one man more than to another: And it may ſerve for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting encouragement to all that have Parents living, to ſhew their utmoſt reſpect and duty to them, becauſe the firſt that ever God owned was a dutifull child. Afterward, God enlarged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to more (as you may read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.) where he proclaimes himſelfe to be, <hi>The God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, &amp; the God of Iacob:</hi> Now <hi>Abraham</hi> was a faithfull man, <hi>The father of the faithfull: Iſaac</hi> was a quiet man, that walked with God in private and made no noiſe in the world: <hi>Iacob</hi> was a prayerfull, a powerfull man with God, one that wreſtled with him for a bleſſing; put theſe three together, and they intimate unto us, that there are three ſorts of men that have the <hi>Lord for their God.</hi> 1. Hee is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, the God of all Faithfull men. 2. Hee is the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that is, the God of all quiet men. 3. He is the God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that is, The God of all devout men. So that, if thou beeſt either a faithfull man,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3481:13"/>
as <hi>Abraham;</hi> or a quiet man, as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or a devoute man as <hi>Iacob,</hi> Thou maiſt be bold without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to make application of God to thy ſelfe, to challenge him as thy owne, and to ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly, Though God be in heaven, yet his faithfull ſervants may be truely ſaid to have him here on earth, in foure reſpects. 1. To have him in Poſſeſſion. 2. To have him in Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe. 3. To have him in Remembrance. 4. To have him in Regard.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To have God in Poſſeſſion two ſeverall wayes: firſt, Inwardly in their hearts, <hi>God is in you of a truth</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 25. <hi>Salvum ſit verbum Domini</hi> (as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeakes), God ſave that good word, and ſend us to know the truth aud to finde the comfort of it: but how ſhould wee be ſure that God is in us? Anſwer, As by the ſparkes that ariſe out of an heape of Aſhes, wee know for certaine that there is fire within; ſo by the good motions, good prayers, and good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that ariſe, as ſo many heavenly ſparkes out of the heart and ſoule, wee may know for certaine there is God within us. Hee is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The God in the boſome, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſaid to be in the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> in the boſome of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and <hi>Ieſus</hi> in the boſome of his <hi>Father;</hi> ſo is God the father in the boſome of every child of his upon earth; there hee dwells, and there he makes his abode. Doe but obſerve two phraſes of thoſe two great Apoſtles, Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> in the one, we are ſaid <hi>to dwell in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 16.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3481:14"/>
               <hi>He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God;</hi> Hee is (as it were) Gods Inmate, Gods Inhabitant, and in that ſence, God may be ſaid, to <hi>have us in poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> In the other God is ſaid to dwell in us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Ye are the temples of the living God,</hi> as God hath ſaid, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walke in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people;</hi> and in this ſence God is our Inmate, our Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and wee may be truely ſaid to have him in poſſeſſion: now where there is this mutuall coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, this mutuall dwelling one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that wee dwell in God, and God dwells in us; that we have poſſeſſion of God in one kind, and God hath poſſeſſion of us in another kinde; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely this Tenure can never be broken, this Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion can never be loſt, wee and our God ſhall never part, but after we have lived and loved, and dwelt together on earth, wee ſhall live, and love, and dwell together in heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, as they have an inward poſſeſſion of God in their hearts, ſo they poſſeſſe him alſo outwardly in their Eſtates, in their Rents, and in all their Revenues; for they have God in all theſe, &amp; the influence of his bleſſing gives them good of all that they enjoy. This is the difference that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve betwixt the bleſſings of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 27. The one had God with his bleſſing, the other had his bleſſing without God. When <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed <hi>Iacob, ver.</hi> 28. Thus hee ſaid, <hi>God give thee of the dew of heaven, &amp; the fatneſſe of the earth,</hi> &amp;c. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when <hi>Eſau</hi> came and begged a bleſſing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, He gives him in a manner the very ſame bleſſing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3481:14"/>
that hee gave to <hi>Iacob,</hi> but that hee makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in it; but onely ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 39. <hi>Thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be the fatneſſe of the earth, and the dew of heaven from above:</hi> The very ſame bleſſing, onely with this difference: That God was in at the one, but out at the other. Now looke what an eye is without ſight, or a well without water, or a body without a ſoule; the very ſame is a portion without God. There is a Tradition of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> that the Lord ſhould call unto him from heaven, and ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Quid tibi dabo Thoma? Thomas, what ſhall I give thee for all the good ſervice thou haſt done me?</hi> His anſwer was, <hi>Teipſum Domine, Give me thy ſelfe, O Lord, and I deſire no other gift, let mee have but thee, I aske no more.</hi> This is not much different, that divine ejaculation of a pious ſoule: Lord, let mee live out of the world with thee, but let me not live in the world without thee. In a word, this is the happineſſe and the bleſſed priviledge of a good and faithfull ſervant to God, though his eſtate and poſſeſſions be but meane and ſmall, he poſſeſſeth his God which makes amends for all. And this is the firſt way whereby they may be ſaid to have God, though hee be in heaven, that is, <hi>Habere in poſſeſsione,</hi> to have him in poſſeſſion; As if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Whom have I in poſſeſsion but thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 The next is, To have him in Partnerſhippe; and that two wayes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To take our part againſt our adverſaries, as you ſee, <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 8. How God tooke <hi>Moſes</hi> part againſt <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Myriam,</hi> when they murmured and rebelled againſt him; <hi>How were you not afraid</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:3481:15"/>
(ſaith God) <hi>to ſpeake againſt my ſervant, againſt Moſes:</hi> that is, to ſpeake againſt any ſervant of mine, though never ſo deſpicable and poore; but to ſpeake againſt my chiefeſt and choiſeſt ſervant, againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> who is faithfull in all my houſe; <hi>Quomodo non timuiſtis?</hi> How durſt you be ſo bold: how were you not afraid to doe it? knowing that it concernes the honour of my truth to take their part. And as it followeth after, when God had taken his part in word, hee tooke h s part in deede, and did him more right, and wrought him more revenge than <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe was willing he ſhould have done. Thus if thou be on Gods ſide, God will ſurely be on thy ſide: if thou take Gods part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that diſhonour him, and abuſe his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Name, God will undoubtedly take thy part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that diſhonour thee, and ſeeke to doe thee evill; yea, paradventure God will worke thee a further revenge than thou art aware of; that is, if any diſeaſe or any ſickneſſe be upon thee, God will take it off, and lay it upon them that hate thee: Tis his Promiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 15. So that thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſhall goe from thee to thy enemy, as the leproſie of <hi>Naaman</hi> went from him to <hi>Gehazi.</hi> And this is one benefit thou ſhalt reape by having God in partnerſhippe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God will beare a part in all thy adverſities, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 9. In all our afflictions, he is afflicted: Iuſt as a Tutour that maintaines a Scholler in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie at his owne charge, if hee puniſh that Scholler in his purſe, hee puniſheth himſelfe; ſo dealeth the Lord with us; it is an affliction to God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3481:15"/>
to afflictus; and there is no affliction that falls upon us, but God himſelfe beares a part of it. As in all his commands, <hi>Quod jubet, juvat,</hi> what he bids us to doe, he helpes us to doe; ſo in all his chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what hee makes us to beare, he helpes us to beare; as <hi>Simon</hi> helped our Saviour to beare his Croſſe. Hence it is, <hi>That his yoake is eaſie, and his burthen light, Mat.</hi> 11. Whether it be meant of <hi>Iugum praecepti,</hi> the yoake of his Commandment, or <hi>Iugum crucis,</hi> the yoake of his Chaſtiſement; both may be ſaid to be <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> becauſe wee beare but with one ſhoulder, and God beares with the other; for it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 26. God helped the Levites to beare the Arke: The Arke of it ſelfe was no great burthen to beare, and yet as light as it was, God was faine to helpe them to beare it; without the helpe of God, the lighteſt burthen is unſupportable; for it is ſaid of <hi>Iudah, Deut.</hi> 33. 7. <hi>His own hands ſhall be ſufficient for him, Si tu Dominus, If thou Lord do helpe him againſt his enemies.</hi> no mans owne hands, no mans owne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours can be ſufficient for him, either for his defence, or for his maintenance, unleſſe the God of heaven put to his helping hand. We read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 12. That <hi>Samuel</hi> pitched a ſtone, and called it <hi>Eben-ezer, The ſtone of helpe,</hi> and his reaſon was, <hi>Hitherto God hath helped us:</hi> Now marke the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and ſituation of this ſtone; <hi>He pitched it</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>betweene Mizpeh and Shen: Mizpeh</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth ſight or wiſedome; <hi>Shen</hi> ſignifieth a Tooth, or ſtrength: So the meaning is, that neither a mans wiſedome can helpe him on the one ſide, nor his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3481:16"/>
ſtrength helpe him on the other ſide, unleſſe <hi>Eben-ezer,</hi> The helpe of God come in betweene them. It was only God in the Buſh that kept the fire from burning; ſo it is God in affliction that keepes the heart from deſpairing. Hence it is, that the moſt precious bleſſing that <hi>Iacob</hi> could invent for his deare ſonne <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was this, <hi>That the good will of him that dwelt in the Buſh might be upon him, Deut.</hi> 33. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for then hee knew, though he ſhould meete with many Thornes, and many piercing cares and croſſes in the world, yet <hi>the good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will of him that dwelt in the Buſh,</hi> would be a ſhelter and a ſhield againſt them all. Let no man therefore miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret Gods corrections, nor miſtake the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his chaſtiſements, for there may be <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placitum in Rubo,</hi> as well as in <hi>Regno:</hi> Though a man be (as it were) in a buſh of thornes, that is, perplexed on every ſide with cares and croſſes; yet the good-will of God may be no leſſe upon him in this Buſh, than if he were in a pleaſant Arbour, in the moſt delightfull condition that the earth can afford. I will ſay it once againe, If God beare a man good-will, though hee ſhould dwell in a very Buſh <hi>(i.)</hi> in the very midſt among his enemies, yet may he lay him downe in peace, and take his reſt; for why? There is one with him that will take his part againſt all his adverſaries, and beare a part in all his adverſities; And this is the ſecond privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all faithfull ſoules, that they have <hi>Deum in participationem,</hi> God in partnerſhippe. As if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Whom have I in partnerſhippe but thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:3481:16"/>
3 The third way of having God, is to have him in Remembrance, and not to deale with Gods Mercies, as <hi>Iehu</hi> dealt with <hi>Iehorams</hi> Meſſengers, to turne them behind our backes when our owne turne is ſerved, to thinke no more of him, nor looke no more after him. God Almighty made an Order concerning the peoples ingreſſe, and egreſſe at his Temple, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 46. 9. That he that came in at the North<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>gate, muſt goe out againe at the South-gate; and hee that came in at the South-gate, muſt goe out at the North gate; they might in no wiſe returne by the way of the ſame gate which they came in at, but goe forth over againſt it: One gives the Reaſon of it (and it is a ſingular good one) <hi>Nè propitiatorio terga verterent, cum a templo exirent,</hi> leaſt they ſhould turne their backes to the Propitiatory, or Mercy-ſeat, when they went out of the Temple; for that was a thing that God could not endure, that when they had entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and obtained mercy, they ſhould goe unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly away, and turne their backes to his Mercy-ſeat. Intimating unto us, That when God hath ſhewed himſelfe propitious and mercifull unto us, and hath granted us the deſires of our hearts, and hath not denied us the requeſts of our lippes; wee muſt take heede we doe not turne or backes upon God when our turne is ſerved, as beaſts turne their backes to the pond when their thirſt is quenched. But as wee doe deſire that God ſhould have us in Remembrance in our weakeneſſe and poverty, ſo let us have God in remembrance in our wealth and plenty, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt remember the</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:3481:17"/>
               <hi>Lord thy God, for it is hee that giveth thee power to to get wealth.</hi> Marke this you welthy men, and take it as an <hi>Item</hi> from God to thee in particular, if thou beeſt a man of wealth, aſſure thy ſelfe (as our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Pilat</hi> in another caſe) Thou couldſt have no power at all to get an eſtate, to gather wealth, or to make thy ſelfe a fortune in the world, unleſſe it were given thee from above; Thou mighteſt have beene as poore as hee that begges at thy doore, had not God given thee a power to get wealth under him. This may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Memorandum to us all (as <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Butler ſaid) <hi>To call to minde our fault this day,</hi> I meane, our unmindfulneſſe and forgetfulneſſe of God; it is not ones mans fault, but all mens fault; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt uſuall name that is given to a man in the Hebrew tongue, is <hi>Enoſh,</hi> which properly ſignifieth Oblivion, or forgetfulneſſe, as in that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>Lord, what is man that thou art ſo mindfull of him:</hi> in the Originall, it is, <hi>Lord, what is forgetfulneſſe, that thou ſhouldeſt Remember him.</hi> Hence it is that God hath appointed Miniſters to be his Remembrancers, (ſo we are called <hi>Eſay</hi> 62. 6.) <hi>Rememorantes Dominum, Ye that be the Lords Remembrancers, keepe not ſilence</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>give God no reſt,</hi> &amp;c. Our Office is double: 1. To put God in remembrance of his people by our prayers. 2. To put the people in remembrance of God, by our preaching; or thus. 1. To put God in remembrance of his Mercy. 2. To put the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in remembrance of their duty. God ſend us well to diſcharge both theſe Offices to God, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3481:17"/>
to his people, for in theſe is contained the whole ſumme and ſubſtance of our Miniſteriall function: And for your parts and duties, let mee tell you, that you have a double taske as well as wee, and you ſhall doe well to give heede unto it, for the comfort and diſcharge of your owne ſoules in the ſight of God. 1. Put your ſelves in minde of God, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>Have I not remembred thee, in my bed, and thought upon thee when I was waking?</hi> as if hee had ſaid, if I have not done ſo, I am the more to blame, I have the more to anſwer for, for I am ſure it was my part and duty ſo to doe. 2. And then in the ſecond place, put God in minde of your ſelves, as the ſame <hi>David,</hi> after hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred God, hee deſires God to remember him and all his troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 1. In a word, Let this be thy Method in all thy private devotions. 1. To put thy ſelfe in remembrance of God. 2. To put God in remembrance of thy ſelfe: and let it be thy conſtant practiſe before thou goeſt to ſleepe, to looke backe into the day thats paſt, Remember Gods Mercies, and thine owne ſins, be thankefull for the one be humbled for the other; and then lie downe in the peace of Ieſus Chriſt. And this is the third way of having God, <hi>Habere in memoriâ,</hi> To have him in Remembrance; As if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Whom have I in Remembrance, but thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth, and laſt way of Having God, is <hi>Habere in Reverentiâ,</hi> To have him in Regard, and that three wayes. 1. Have Regard to his Power. 2. To his Precepts. 3. To his Preſence. A word of each.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Have his Power in Regard, <hi>Who Regardeth</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:3481:18"/>
               <hi>the power of thy wrath</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 90. 11.) <hi>for ever thereafter, as a man feareth, ſo is thy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> The meaning is, The more a man feares, the leſſe is God diſpleaſed with him; and the leſſe a man feares the more is God diſpleaſed with him; ſo in both reſpects, it holds true, Thereafter as a man feareth, ſo is Gods diſpleaſure: <hi>And yet Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David (who regardeth the power of thy wrath?</hi> Or who dealeth any otherwiſe with God, then the Frogges in the Fable did with the blocke, which was throwne in to be their King; when hee fell heavie upon them, and made a dreadfull noiſe in the waters, they were much afraid, and ſhrunke into their corners; afterwards when they ſaw him lie ſtill, and let the ſtreame be calme about them, they regarded him no longer, but ſecurely leaped upon him. Even thus doe carnall men deale with God, Regard him no longer, but while hee falls heavie and ſore upon them with his judgements; let him but be ſtill, and let them be quiet; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him no more than the Frogges regarded the blocke. <hi>Shall I praiſe you in this</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I praiſe you not.</hi> Gods power muſt be had in Regard. (Thats the firſt Point.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Precepts are to be had in Regard; <hi>Then ſhall I not be confounded</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.) <hi>When I have Regard or Reſpect to all thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> As the Centurions ſervant in the Goſpell, if a ſtranger or another man had bidden him goe and doe ſuch a thing, he might peradventure have gone and done it himſelfe; but when his Lord and Maſter did but ſpeake the word, it was done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had a Reſpect and a Regard unto him. In
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3481:18"/>
like ſort; As we doe deſire that God ſhould have Regard to our Prayers, let us have Regard to his Precepts. See and obſerve that place, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 11. Where God doth ſo Regard the prayer of his humble ſervants, that a Requeſt from us is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to him, <hi>Praecipite mihi,</hi> (they be Gods owne words) <hi>Command ye mee.</hi> Oh, what a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God have we, that will abaſe himſelfe to be commanded by his owne Vaſſalls: ſo true is that ſaying of an Ancient; <hi>Nulla creatura humilior Deo, There is no creature more humbler than God,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10. <hi>The Sunne ſtood ſtill at Ioſhuahs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Deo obediente voce hominis, God yeelding and obeying the voyce of man.</hi> Now ſhall God obey the voyce of man, and ſhall not man obey the voyce of God? Shall God be willing to be at our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſhall not wee be as willing to be at his command? Shall God have Regard to our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſhall not we have Regard to his Precepts? <hi>Ne fiat,</hi> This muſt not be done, for this will not be taken well at our hands. Gods Precepts muſt be had in Regard. (Thats the ſecond Point.)</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the laſt place, have regard to Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and all is finiſhed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Generall, Conſider with thy ſelfe that God is Omni-preſent, preſent in every place, and that thou canſt goe no where from his preſence; He is about thy bed, and about thy path, and eſpieth out all thy wayes.

For if men knew what it were to live in the diſpleaſure of an angry God, they would have him in more Regard. For judge your ſelves, durſt men be ſo bold with God, yea, ſo impudent, and audacious, as to ſinne, God in the very face, if they did regard him? As the Scripture ſaith of <hi>Nimrod, Gen.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>He was a mighty hunter before the Lord:</hi> not a Hunter of beaſts, but a Hunter of men <hi>(i.)</hi> a cruell oppreſſour, that made poore men weary of their lives, and perſecuted them to the very death; Such a Hunter he was (and I would to God there were no more of his breede,) and where? <hi>Before the Lord,</hi> (ſaith the Text) <gap reason="foreign">

To this height of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are ſome men growne; that as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaid of <hi>Lots</hi> daughters, <hi>Vereor ne harum caſtior inceſtus ſiat; quam aliquaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pudicitia: I am afraid that their Inceſt was more modeſt than ſomes Innocency.</hi> This would

never be, if men had God in any Regard; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very thought of his unavoidable preſence would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and deterre them from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But to conclude; If men have little or no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the generall preſence of God abroad in the world; yet I truſt, when they come into Gods ſpeciall Preſence, into his Preſence-Chamber, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sanctuary, and Houſe of Prayer, they will ſhew it there or no where. Wee ſee by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; The King may looke out of a window, and ſee his ſubjects goe by him too and fro upon their owne occaſions, and ſhew him no reſpect, nor no regard; and why? Becauſe though hee ſees them, yet they ſee not him, nor imagine that hee is ſo nigh them; but let theſe men come into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Preſence, or have any Petition to preſent unto him; then they doe their Homage, then they bow their knees, and glad if they can be ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thus doth God looke downe from Heaven, and from his Throne, beholdes all the dwellers upon earth; we goe on our wayes and minde him not, becauſe though hee ſees us, we ſee not him: but when wee come into his <hi>Baſilica,</hi> his owne Houſe, his owne Palace (for ſo are Churches cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſpecially the greater &amp; Mother-Churches, are the Palaces of the King of Heaven) and come to preferre our Prayers and Petitions to him; if wee doe not then ſerve him, and obſerve him with the greateſt Reverence, the greateſt Regard that our ſoules and bodies can expreſſe, How can wee hope to be accepted of him. <hi>When we come into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) into the Preſence of the Lord of the whole earth;</hi> what then? <hi>Why</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:3481:20"/>
               <hi>then worſhip him, In decore ſanctitatis, in the beauty of holineſſe</hi> (as the phraſe is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. Oh that ſame holineſſe is a beautifull thing, if a man had it; a thing that makes a man comely and lovely, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and acceptable to God and his holy Angells; but if a man have it not, but comes to God in his ſinnes, as the Prodigall came to his Father in his ragges, will the Lord accept him? Nay, will hee endure him in his preſence? Yes certainely, if hee come in a penitent and an humble way; for though the ſonne have no clothing to cover his ſhame, yet the Father hath enough in his Ward-Robe to beſtead him, and to beautifie him too: <hi>Proferte ſtolam</hi> (ſaith he to his Miniſters, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 22.) <hi>Bring forth the beſt Robe, and put it on him, &amp; put a Ring on his hand, and ſhooes on his feete, and ſo make him comely and cleane againe.</hi> This will our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father deale with his repenting children; Hee will take away from them the rotten rags of their old ſinnes, and cloth them a new with his heavenly Grace, <hi>and</hi> (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>will give them beauty for aſhes, and the garment of gladneſſe for the ſpirit of heavineſſe, Eſay</hi> 61. 3. Wee read in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> of two women; one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the falſe Church, the Whore of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> the other repreſenting the true Church, which is the Mother of us all. Now marke the difference of their cloathing. She that repreſented the whore of <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>Was arraied</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>in purple, and ſcarlet, and decked with Gold, and Pearles, and precious ſtones.</hi> Here was a goodly and a beautifull aray, but they were all <hi>terrena,</hi> all tranſitorie, all earthly ornaments; there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

at all of heaven in them: now marke the cloathing of the true Church, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 1. the text ſaith, <hi>There appeared a wonder in heaven, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cloathed with the Sunne, and the moone under her feete, and upon her head a crowne of twelve Starres:</hi> here was nothing at all of earth in this cloathing, but all heavenly. And this, oh this is the beauty of holineſſe, a celeſtiall, a heavenly habite. Now (as they prayed in the Goſpell, when our Saviour ſpake of the Manna that came downe from heaven) <hi>Lord evermore give us this bread;</hi> ſo let us pray to God in this behalfe, <hi>Lord evermore give us this cloathing; Lord cloath us with thy grace from heaven while we live, and cloath us upon with thy glory in heaven when we dye. And that for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, to whom with thee O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the bleſſed Spirit, be given and aſcribed all honour, prayſe, and glory; be done and performed all ſervice, obedience, and from this time forth for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
