            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>ALthough I dare not preſume to reach ſo high as his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; yet I can come very near <hi>under your ſhadow;</hi> which to me, is very ſubſtantial. And I may ſpeak ſo loud, that if you pleaſe, he may hear. Awhile agoe there came to this City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> certain Morice-dancers from the <hi>North.</hi> By two and two, two and two, with an intent here to exerciſe ſome <hi>ſpiritual cheats;</hi> or (as may well be ſuſpected) to carry on ſome levelling deſign. And our ſouldiers here, having nothing elſe to do (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe work of their own making, that they might ſeem to be neceſſary) ſtruck in with them in their quaking. And my ſelfe, with ſome other of my brethren in the Miniſtry here, being (by the Magiſtrates call'd to conference with them) ingaged to inquire into their opinions. I found it a harder matter to <hi>diſcover</hi> then to <hi>confute</hi> them. They being the moſt egregious prevaricators that ever men met with. Upon this account, my Geni is led me on that way, to <hi>pull off their vizor,</hi> which is the principal intent of theſe following papers: wherein is diſcovered their
<pb facs="tcp:54713:3"/>
                     <hi>Myſtery of ungodlineſſe</hi> (as to ſpiritual matters. And my thoughts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a little before upon the <hi>Great Myſtery of Godlineſse.</hi> In a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick diſcourſe, I ſpake ſomething to both, which gave ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was perſwaded, might be uſeful, if made publick. Both which is here done, under the Title of the <hi>Myſtery of Godlineſſe, and of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse.</hi> And when I had done, I needed no long time to deliberate to whoſe name to inſcribe it. My heart readily told me, whom I honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And I had a deſire, the world ſhould know it. For, beſides our old and familiar acquaintance: The obſervation of your ingenuity (when I was laſt with you) whereby I perceived that your <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>high imployments</hi> have not tranſported you, hath laid ſtrong ingagments upon me. And I gladly took the <hi>very</hi> firſt opportunity, to bear teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to it. <hi>Sir,</hi> I was coming to you with a <hi>ſupplicatory</hi> Epiſtle. But his Highneſſe (by breath from his mouth) hath driven away theſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern locuſts from us. And given a command for the remove of their abetters &amp; favorites. And now my <hi>ſupplicatory</hi> is (by this good hand of providence) turned into a <hi>gratulatory</hi> Epiſtle; And I beſeech you, let the thanks be beſtowed where you know 'tis due; for I am ſure you know. And ſurely <hi>Sir,</hi> his Highneſſe hath gained much upon the hearts of our Citizens, by this act of grace and duty. We were made believe, theſe men had countenance from <hi>him:</hi> which (upon my knowledge) made our Magiſtrates here ſo backward to be quick with them, and to deal ſo ſeverely (and juſtly) with them, as they have been dealt with in other places. And therefore <hi>I rejoyce that you breath ſo good an ayre at Court.</hi> And oh that the ſame ſalutiferous ayre might blow, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to blow) through all the quarters of our Engliſh Elements. But <hi>Sir,</hi> will you give me leave to ſpeak my mind this once? (and we were wont to ſpeak freely one to another.) And i'le ſpeak for his Highneſſe, 'tis not for his <hi>honour</hi> nor <hi>ſaftety,</hi> that every petty Captain ſhould dally with his Commands, and ride away from their obedience to them. Some men know not how to bear an even ſail to that condition which theſe late troublous times have <hi>rais'd</hi> them. They could live in warre; but now know not how to live in peace, if it make not for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Hence many places and perſons are rendered <hi>malignant,</hi> by thoſe, who in themſelves are not better, no (and I am ſure of it) nor ſo well affected. And I beſeech you, let not ſelfiſh inſinuates finde too much countenance <hi>to the publick grievance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Sir,</hi> I write not this to looſen the reigns of Government, either in it ſelf, or its neceſſary ſupports (my ſoul abhorrs ſuch thoughts.) But it pains me to the very heart, that a people that may eaſily be <hi>manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> ſhould be over-ridden, by ſuch, who ſeek not (what ever they pretend by their ſuggeſtions of ſome friends) the publick weale; ſo much as <hi>their own advantage.</hi> If people be refractory or ſtubborn, 'tis fit they ſhould know their Rider. But if they goe readily, <hi>why ſhould they be ſpur-gald?</hi> I know not where ever I ſhall have the like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe I love and honour you, and would have you be truly (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly) honourable: I'le beg one thing of you. <hi>Improve you the high advantage of ground you have gotten for God, his truth, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welfare.</hi> (I need not mention his Highneſſe, 'tis eminently inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.) And to this end, let order and eſtabliſht Government have a high place in your <hi>thoughts.</hi> And that in Church as well as State. But why do I divide them? are they not <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins? <hi>do they not live and die together?</hi> how true did that ſaying prove? <hi>No Biſhop, no King.</hi> And will it not hold? <hi>No Miniſter, no Magiſtrate.</hi> And <hi>every one a Miniſter, every one a Magiſtrate.</hi> I hate perſecution. 'Tis a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is not want of Government ſo too? <hi>When there was no King in Iſrael, every man did what ſeemed good in his own eyes.</hi> And then they made Prieſts (but yet they made them) of the baſeſt of the people. Let Miniſters be baſely accounted of, and the people (with a little help) will quickly learn to deſpiſe <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi> Beſides the judgement from the Lord, there is a natural tendency in the one to the other. It will be <hi>Honourable Sir,</hi> and becoming reforming times, that men learned, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and godly, (ſuch as are ſo, and can be content to approve themſelves ſo; to thoſe who are able and authorized to judge) that they find <hi>more</hi> countenance, then thoſe, who are not ſo qualified. Men ignorant are impetuouſly zealous to cry down <hi>learning,</hi> that their ſnuffs might ſeeme to give ſome light, which if countenanc'd, (and that ſuch and find equall favour) will bring the next age to <hi>a dark Miniſtry.</hi> &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our children as a prey to the wolves of <hi>Rome.</hi> And as for theſe levelling Quakers, I muſt need ſay; The revilings and reproachings of <hi>our gifted brethren</hi> (who of late years, have made it much of their buſineſs, to render the Miniſters of this nation, Antichriſtian) have made way for them. And they (of all men) have leaſt cauſe to be offended with them (though they prevaile moſt with their Congregations.) For <hi>the call of the one is as good as the others,</hi> though there be ſome difference in their doctrines.</p>

Whither won't love carry a man? It made me overbold and tedious. Pardon I beſeech you my boldneſſe, and accept of my love. I conſecrate this firſt fruit of my labours (in this kind) to your name, that it may live in you; and that you might live in God, according to the <hi>Great Myſtery of Godlineſſe,</hi> through the grace and power of that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>which died at Jeruſalem, whom the Quakers vilifie.</hi> To him I heartily commend you, and all your great and high affairs: craving this farther favour, that I may ſtill continue to <hi>be,</hi> and have leave to <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> my ſelf, as I am</p>

This was done, and is done by the reſt of my brethren here in their pulpit-labour with good ſucceſſe. And I (as well as they) might there have reſted. For I conceive not that we ſtand bound to be in print upon every occaſion. That which brought my <hi>backward</hi> ſpirit to this work was: The Lord was pleaſed (by the help of ſome friends) to bring to my hands a piece of the Anabaptiſts, which to me, made <hi>a cleare diſcovery of the myſterie of theſe ſeducers:</hi> And gave me more light of their deſignes, then others of my brethren (who have not ſeen that paper) had. In which perſwaſion I publikely made ſome diſcovery. And being convin'd, that it might be more uſefull (if more publike) I beggd of God to fix my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what might be moſt conducent to his glory. Being perſwaded never to have appeared to the world in this way, But by his overruling hand, I have
<pb facs="tcp:54713:5"/>
here preſented to thee this diſcovery under the title <hi>of the myſterie of Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi> And becauſe thou ſhouldſt not onely know the evill, to avoid it, but the good alſo to follow it. I have therefore laid before thee <hi>good and evill. The myſterie of Godlineſſe, and Ungodlineſſe</hi> both together. And its now thy duty (and yet it will be thy wiſdome) to improve advantages for thy eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment. And to that end, Take a little adviſe: In reading the myſtery of Godlineſſe, take but paines to turne to the <hi>quotations</hi> of Scripture in the margin, and ſee how they prove the thing intended. Eſpecially doe ſo in ſuch truths as thou findeſt thy ſelf moſt <hi>affected</hi> with, or ſeeme moſt <hi>ſtrange</hi> unto thee (if any ſhould ſo ſeeme, which me-thinks ſhould not.) Chiefly, Any truth thou <hi>moſt takeſt notice of</hi> (under what conſideration ſo ever) tax and examine the proofes. This double benefit will ariſe. Firſt, The thing it ſelf will be more <hi>cleare.</hi> And Secondly, what thou receiveſt as a truth, will be received on a <hi>divine</hi> authority. And ſo thy faith ſhall not ſtand, or be built on <hi>man,</hi> who may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.) But on the un-erring word of God. The not obſerving this rule in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>mens</hi> writtings, is the maine ground of peoples inſtability: For this is ſure, <hi>What ever is imbrac't upon meere humane conſiderations: Upon the like conſiderations may be ſhaken off:</hi> He that believes a thing, barely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a man (of whom he hath a good opinion, and that he will not lie) told him ſo, when another ſhall come (of whom he hath an higher and better perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſhall tell him the contrary, to what he had been perſwaded; his perſwaſion is ſtaggered if not altered. But now what is entertained and believed, upon his word, <hi>then whom, none is more true, more faithfull,</hi> theres a ſure foundation, a rock vnmoveable: And then know further. <hi>No truthe's thine own till thou art got up into the power of it.</hi> And that thou ſquare thy beliefe and life accordingly: The onely way to be eſtabliſht againſt error and hereſie. As for the Myſterie of <hi>Ungodlineſſe,</hi> concerning it, I ſhall give thee directions, when thon commeſt unto it. It is meet the myſtery of Godlineſſe ſhould have the firſt place: that it might take the firſt poſſeſſion of thee; as a <hi>ſeaſon againſt the poyſons of hereſie and ungodlineſſe.</hi> And then the more full the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, the more thou wilt abhor and avoid it.

In all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires after truth, when a matter or queſtion is propoſed or demanded; he that is to anſwer (if he be willing to have the truths diſcovered) doth either <hi>affirm</hi> and grant the queſtion or <hi>deny</hi> it, or in the third place (if there be need) <hi>diſtinguiſh and explain</hi> ſome words that may be doubtfull, or have a double meaning: And accordingly make his anſwer. There is no fourth way. But to be wholy <hi>ſilent,</hi> or to <hi>ſhuffle and avoid</hi> the queſtion, by impertinent matter, that is not to the thing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. And ſuch men that ſhall take this and their uſuall way and courſe, are to be accounted as <hi>prevaricators,</hi> impoſtors <hi>and deceivers.</hi> But is there no fourth way did I cry, but ſilence and ſhuffling. There are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54713:17"/>
a generation of <hi>men</hi> have found out that way of <hi>equivocating and jugling</hi> even now mentioned, <hi>ſc.</hi> To ſpeak one thing and mean not the ſame thing, which the words uſually and in moſt mens ſenſe and conſtruction ſignifie. Now obſerve, in all their anſwers, theſe quakers neither <hi>grant</hi> nor <hi>deny</hi> nor <hi>diſtinguiſh;</hi> But conſtantly betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for one of theſe two refuges of liers.</p>
                        <p>Either to <hi>avoid anſwering,</hi> by talking nothing to the purpoſe. Or if they do affirm or deny, (which is very ſeldome) their words have <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> meaning then is intended thou in the queſtion. By the help of this obſervation thou maiſt trace and perceive? Then in all their wrightings and arguings, where any ſuch <hi>is controverted or debated</hi> by or with them: And much in all their ſpeakings. And if thou be now deceived by them, the fault is much nay, moſt, if not altogether thine own, who will ſo eaſily be led blindfold by ſuch <hi>palpable deceivers, impoſtors, juglers.</hi> This firſt onſet of theirs is but to unſettle thee, from off thy old.

                  <p>HAving theſe many years through the grace and free-mercy of our God, been kept in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Name of Chriſt, contained in the holy Scriptures of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the exceeding benefit and comfort of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, in ſome meaſure ſuitable to what he hath made known unto us, and well knowing that we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to live in the laſt ages of the world, wherein iniquity abounds, and the love of many waxeth cold; as likewiſe conſidering thoſe peculiar times ſpoken of in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. &amp;c. are come upon us, wherein men who ſometimes have made a large profeſſion of God and godlineſs, are turned aſide to commit all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs with greedines, having turned the grace of our Lord Jeſus into laſciviouſneſs, calling darkneſs light, and light darkneſs, by meanes of whom the way of truth is evill ſpoken of, and many poor ſouls through temptations, ready to quit their profeſſions, and to be taken with their ſnares: We thought it our duty to declare our utter diſlike, abhorring and deteſtation of all ſuch evill perſons and wayes, who ſhall under pretence whatſoever plead for, or practiſe any way of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
                  <p>And having been through the goodneſs of our God, inabled to diſcern the ſecret and ſubtill deſigns and ſnares of Satan, which he hath laid to entrap poor ſouls in, by carrying them from ſtep to ſtep, untill they have bin wholly captivated in his ſnares, and fitted by him to do him ſervice.</p>

We could doe no leſſe, then according to that meaſure of light we have received from the Lord, to diſcover his wiles and ſtratagems, and to caution all that profeſſe the feare of the Lord, to watch over their own hearts and ways, and to take heed leſt they fall into the ſame condemnation.</p>
                  <p>For this we have found, that that way which God in his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſedome taketh to bring ſouls unto himſelf by, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſenting unto men his great love, in giving Jeſus Chriſt to ſuffer death, and his great ſalvation to all that believe in his name; Satan that old ſerpent, through his inſtruments, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecious pretences of beating men off from all falſe reſts, endeavours with all his ſtrength to oppoſe and make void, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the ſonnes and daughters of men, that what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared concerning the death of Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and his bearing our iniquities in his own body upon the Croſſe, is but a meer Hiſtory and ſhadow, the Scriptures are but a letter, and the Ordinances of God but fleſhly forms, thereby labouring to beget in the peoples mindes a contempt and ſleight eſteem of Chriſt, his Word and Ordinances; and that he might cheat them to purpoſe, tells them of a God within, and a Chriſt within, and a Word within, and that God and Chriſt, and they are one, without any true diſtinct knowledge of the true meaning of that which is expreſſed, whereby poor ſouls with great and ſwelling words of vanity, triumph in a great myſterie of meer nothing but emptineſs and confuſion, ſpeaking things whereof they know not, and many poor ſouls knowing ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be Scripture phraſes, do greedily embrace them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a true, diſtinct, and clear underſtanding the ſenſe of what is ſpoken, having the perſons of thoſe who ſpeak ſuch language in great admiration, as the chief, tender, charitable, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, high and ſpiritual Chriſtians: Whereas indeed although the words ſpoken by them, are many of them true in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (without which Satan could not ſo effectually deceive) as that God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit dwell in us, and that God, and Chriſt, and the Saints are one: Yet are we to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this union to be onely in a way of relation, through participation of the ſame Spirit, and this dwelling to be onely in reſpect of grace, and powerful operation and influence, working in the hearts of believers, according to the tenor of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54713:19"/>
the New Covenant, in making men holy and humble, purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts, cauſing them to walk in all good conſcience towards God and man; all which by them is trampled under foot, and another kind of union, and indwelling, driving at in their diſcourſes, which although covertly expreſſed, until by craft and ſubtilty, they have prepared the hearts of ſimple and unſtable ſouls, to receive whatſoever they ſhall ſuggeſt unto them, yet then is openly diſcovered, being indeed the root of all bitterneſſe and deſperate prophaneneſſe and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that can be imagined in the world; for from thence they conclude, that themſelves are God, and Chriſt, and what God is, they are; and what they are, God is; for ſay they, there is no ſpirit but one, and ſo deny any created Angel or Spirit, holding upon the ſame account the living ſoul in man to be uncreated, and ſo conſequently to be God himſelf, and not created by God. Now this being the ground-work of their deluſion, the building is anſwerable.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, concluding the reaſonable ſoul to be God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they affirm that this ſoul being cloathed with their humane bodies, or fleſh, is Chriſt, or God in fleſh; hereupon they imagine that Jeſus Chriſt ſpoken of in the Goſpel, as being born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> accuſed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Pilate</hi> to be crucified, dying at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> upon the Croſſe, riſing the third day, and aſcending into Heaven, is only to be underſtood Parabolically or Figuratively, ſpeaking of one thing and intending another, pointing at and prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a work only within us, conceiving the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Iewes, Pilate, Ieruſalem,</hi> the Croſſe, Chriſt riſing and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſpoken of in the Scriptures, to be all within them, and no ſuch thing ſubſtantially or in truth without.</p>
                  <p>As they conclude all things ſpoken of Chriſt, to be but in a Typical or Figurative manner, intending and typifying out this God within, or God incarnate in their fleſh, ſtill meaning their reaſonable ſouls, conceiving this to be the ſubſtance of all thoſe ſhadows; ſo alſo upon this ground, they are forced to conclude the whole New Teſtament, with all the Doctrines, Laws, Rules, and Adminiſtrations of the ſame, to be but a ſhadow or figure, holding forth a ſubſtance within. As for inſtance, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> being but figures of the ſubſtantial Saviour, and Prieſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54713:20"/>
to come; ſo the adminiſtrations of <hi>Moſes</hi> as Moſaical, were but fleſhly and carnal adminiſtrations to be aboliſhed when the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was come, they being only ſhadows of good things to come; in like manner do they underſtand Chriſt in his Perſon, to be but a ſhadow of Chriſt within, and all his heavenly and ſpiritual Goſpel to be but a letter and carnal Hiſtory, put to an end and aboliſhed, when they once come to apprehend that the ſubſtance of all is within, they coming alſo to believe that the ſoul is God, do thence infer that they are perfect, and that they are in an happy eſtate as can be; for this they urge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. to the 28 <hi>verſe,</hi> to ſhew when the Kingdome is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to the Father, and then Chriſt ceaſeth his Mediatorſhip, and conſequently all his New Teſtament ceaſeth: Now they conclude, that all this is accompliſhed, when they come to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern there is but one Spirit, and their ſoul, that Spirit which is God, and then they are in the poſſeſſion of all things.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing that the Scripture declares, that before our full poſſeſſion of God and glory, there muſt be a temporal death, and reſurrection of the body, and eternal judgment, they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the former grounds judging themſelves already glorified, do underſtand this death of the body in all ſuch Scriptures myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and that the reſurrection and eternal judgement are paſſed already in the ſoul, as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> did, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18. compared with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. Thence alſo they conclude, that faith and juſtification by Chriſt, together with all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, are aboliſhed as fleſhly forms, like unto Chriſt that appointed them; above and without all which, they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly (in their own fancies) live when they once have attained this ſupereminent life (as they ſp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ak) as being in the full fruition of God, comprehending that infinite being, (which they blaſphemouſly affirm themſelves to do) intruding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into things they are altogether ignorant of. Hereupon it is, that they, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, ſcoffe at any ſecond coming of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4. and mock at the holy Scriptures, thoſe heavenly Oracles of God, denying them to be the Word of God, or that Law by which they ought to confirm their lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conceiving and uttering that there is no Law nor Rule, but what is in man, his light being his only Law, that is to ſay, whatever that ſpirit that dwelleth within (which they call
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54713:20"/>
God within) dictates to them, that ought to be done by them, ſtrengthning themſelves with this opinion, that there is no ſin, but what contradicts a mans own light (which is a mans only Law) and ſinne is onely ſin to him that thinks it ſo, and that there is no Hell, but that torment that men ſuſtain through croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their own light, which God knows is nothing but thick darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>And then they proceed to diſcover the wretched effect of this damnable doctrine, in the unclean lives and converſations of the followers of them, which (by the practiſes ſpoken againſt) I apprehend to be intended againſt the Ranters (that abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crew of <hi>Religious Villains)</hi> pardon the expreſſion. And I confeſſe theſe practiſes are the moſt natural iſſue of thoſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and doe moſt freely flow from them, eſpecially from the tail or hinder part on't. But when I had read ſome of the Quakers papers, I found them building upon the ſame founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and making uſe of the ſame principles and materials. And I could not but obſerve the artifice and skill of Satan, like a cunning workman, employing the ſame ſtuffe to ſeveral (out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſeeming) ends, and purpoſes, but in the effect and iſſue the ſame, <hi>viz. deſtruction,</hi> which is his proper work and buſines (for the Ranters make uſe of them) to boulſter up themſelves in all manner of <hi>luſts and ſenſuality,</hi> without ſcruple of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And the Quakers improve them, to ſeeming holineſſe and mortification, to ſecure themſelves in <hi>a proud humility,</hi> (which not repented of) caſts down to Hell as readily as the former.</p>
                  <p>And here, Reader, let's make a ſtand awhile, and conſider; what ſaiſt thou, Is not here <hi>a myſterie of iniquity?</hi> Is not here the head of the Serpent, that old Serpent, that deceived our firſt Parents in Paradiſe, to the fall, and (what in him lay) ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine of all mankind? And is not this the tail of that <hi>great red Dragon, that draws and caſts down a third part of the ſtarres of Heaven to the Earth?</hi> Nay, is not this both head and tail, and body, and all, of that arch-enemy of Gods glory, and mans everlaſting ſalvation? Is not here a deadly blow gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the whole new Creation, head and members, Chriſt and his whole body? Nay, is not here proud <hi>Luciferian</hi> violence, and attempt made againſt the moſt high and glorious Majeſty of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54713:21"/>
God himſelf? The truth is, Reader, <hi>Here is an Axe laid to the root of all Religion, Chriſtian and other,</hi> but eſpecially Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Here's God, and Chriſt, and all his Ordinances, and holy Inſtitutions, laid level and over-turned. Conſider it a little, I ſhall obſerve it to thee, under theſe three heads. They offer violence to God himſelf, as God. Secondly, to Jeſus Chriſt. And thirdly, to all his Ordinances and Inſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, They offer violence to God himſelf, as he is God.</hi> For whereas the Scriptures affirm, that <hi>God is not man,</hi> nor does or acts as man; which even the witch <hi>Balaam</hi> did acknowledge, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 19. And the Lord himſelf asks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 18. <hi>To whom will ye liken God? or what likeneſſe will you compare him to?</hi> having in the former verſe ſaid, that <hi>all Nations before him</hi> (or compared to him) <hi>are as nothing; and that they are counted to him leſſe then nothing and vanity:</hi> And whereas he ſays, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 8. <hi>that he will not give his glory to any other,</hi> much leſſe his Eſſence (which indeed to be impoſſible, may be evinced by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arguments:) And to thoſe that know (or rather being no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> able to know fully) do admire and adore that incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Majeſty, it is not needful: Now theſe bold wretches, worms of Earth, Nay, in this Devils, and fiends of Hell, (for this was Satans ſin, to be like God) they affirm, <hi>themſelves are God, and what they are, God is, and what God is, they are, and that they are equall with God, and one with him in nature.</hi> And this they ſpeak in reſpect of their ſouls and ſpirits, upon this ground, <hi>ſc.</hi> That there is but one ſpirit. If this be not Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and Sataniſme, what is? Nay, is it not worſe and more horrid pride then that of <hi>Lucifer?</hi> for he did but ſay in his heart, <hi>I will aſcend into Heaven, I will exalt my ſelf above the ſtarres of God, I will aſcend above the heights of the Clouds, I will be like the moſt high.</hi> But this will not be onely <hi>like,</hi> but <hi>the ſame</hi> with the moſt high God. I undertake not the confutation, and I ſuppoſe I need not, and I hope you look upon it with abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and deteſtation of ſpirit; Thus they offer violence to the Majeſty of God himſelf, of whom we are not to think, <hi>but with reverence and holy fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they offer violence to <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, God over all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever,</hi> they make him, who was and is the great deſign of the Fathers glory, by whom he made the world, and through
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54713:21"/>
whom he redeemed mankind (as is ſet forth in the myſterie of Godlineſs) but a meere fancy, <hi>but a manifestation for a time, a Chriſt without us, and but a type of them who are Chriſt.</hi> For Chriſt is God and Man, and their ſouls (or ſpirits) are God, and their bodies are fleſh, and theſe two together is Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, Chriſt in them, who are the ſubſtance, or chief thing typified and intended. And therefore when the ſubſtance comes and is, and appears in them, then the ſhadow, the <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Chriſt (as if both cannot ſtand together) vaniſhes and ceaſes. Do n't ye tremble Chriſtians at this horrid blaſphemie, and are not theſe accurſed?</p>
                  <p>And then thirdly and laſtly, they offer violence (and this muſt neceſſarily follow) to all the Ordinances and holy Inſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Goſpel. For it is fit, that as Jeſus Chriſt in his own perſon, is but a ſhadow of Chriſt within, and when <hi>this</hi> Chriſt appears, <hi>that</hi> muſt give place: So all the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ways of worſhip outwardly are but types and ſhadows of the true and ſpiritual worſhip within, (as if they neither could ſtand together) muſt ceaſe when <hi>that</hi> outward Chriſt ceaſeth.</p>
                  <p>For as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and all their ſacrifices, were but types of that Chriſt, and ceas'd (Prieſts, and Miniſters, and Services, and all their Ceremonial Ordinances) when <hi>that</hi> Chriſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and died at <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> So that Chriſt, and all his Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are types of <hi>this</hi> ſpiritual Chriſt; and when <hi>this Chriſt</hi> appears, <hi>that Ieruſalem Chriſt,</hi> and all his Miniſters, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations ceaſe, and are no longer uſeful to <hi>theſe Chriſts and Gods incarnate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now beloved Reader, if thou be a Chriſtian, what ſaiſt thou, Is not here a Myſterie of ungodlineſſe to the purpoſe? where was it hatcht think'ſt thou? could any leſſe then all the Devils in Hell, keep a Conventicle to contrive and plot this black and Helliſh treaſon againſt the Majeſty of God, and Chriſt, and the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Oh ye Chriſtian Magiſtrates, who rule for Chriſt, (or ſhould do) and to whom you ſhall one day give account of your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, how ye have ruled for him, and how tender ye are of his honour. Where is your zeal become for Chriſt and his glory, and his Goſpel? Had you but ſo much zeal and honeſty as a Jewiſh Magiſtrate, you would tear your cloaths off at theſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54713:22"/>
blaſphemies of theſe wretched ſouls, that make themſelves <hi>equal with the almighty God,</hi> and make level with themſelves, (nay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themſelves) Jeſus Chriſt and the Goſpel, He and his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances being but Types and Shadows, and they the ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Sir, honoured Sirs, though God and Chriſt looks not that you ſhould tear off your clothes (and who can ſcarce forbear to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt this indignation againſt theſe blaſphemies; certainly they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that you manifeſt it, <hi>by ſuppreſſing and ſtopping the mouthes and pens of the blaſphemers.</hi> Good Sirs, if theſe wretched ſouls have ſuch helliſh liberty of conſcience, to <hi>think</hi> thus; let them not (upon pretence of liberty of conſcience) be ſo audaciouſly blaſphemous to <hi>write and ſpeak</hi> thus.</p>
                  <p>And O ye Servants of the Lord, my Fathers and Brethren in the Miniſtry of our dear and ever-bleſſed Jeſus; you that are the Paſtors of the Lords flock, and the Watchmen for the ſheep of his paſture, lift up your voyce and ſpare not (neither your ſelves nor others) cry aloud to all your Congregations, and fore-warn them that they be not a prey to Satans devices; let the Wolves know, that you are not <hi>dumb dogs, &amp; cannot bark, &amp; idol-ſhepheards</hi> that can neither hear nor ſee, nor underſtand any thing, and that at a time of need can ſay nothing. Certainly, certainly, ſuch as theſe may ill look for their gain from their quarters, they deſerve it not: who, ſo they may be fed, care not (nor care to diſcover) what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring beaſts come to deſtroy the flock of Chriſt. But you my dear ones, who are ſet over the Lords folds, and who watch for their ſouls, as thoſe that muſt give an account, and that have a deſire to do it with joy, and for the profit of your people; read and practiſe what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives in charge to the Paſtors of the Church at <hi>Epheſus:</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 20. 28, 29, 30, 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and let me give thee it here, in his owne words what hee gave forth to his Sonne <hi>Timothy,</hi> and then I ſhall proceed to out buſineſſe intended. <hi>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and dead at his appearing and his Kingdome, preach the Word</hi> (not immediate revelations) <hi>be inſtant, in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Doctrine: for the time will come</hi> (and it is now) <hi>when they ſhall not endure ſound Doctrine,</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54713:22"/>
                     <hi>but after their own luſts, ſhall they heap to themſelves teachers, having itching ears, and they ſhall turn away their ears from the truth, and ſhall be turned unto fables</hi> (immediate revelations, contrary to, and divers from the Word, which he was to Preach) <hi>but watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an Evangeliſt,</hi> (or a Goſpel-Preacher) <hi>make full proof of thy Miniſtry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now having thus diſcovered to thee the head, body, and tail of this myſterie of ungodlineſſe, I ſhall lay the ſame part by part, member by member, and limb by limb, upon the Quakers; and make them (as the image of the firſt Beaſt) appear acting in and by the ſame power; I <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>peak in their own Dialect.</p>
                  <p>And to this purpoſe, I ſhall give you in two papers of the <hi>Quakers own publiſhing,</hi> which I cauſed herewith to be Printed; which I rather do, becauſe their Books do moſtly come to the hands of their own parties, and are not therefore ſo common to all, eſpecially theſe two, which I have taken moſt notice of, and would have well conſidered, that you may know theſe men and their ſpirit, when it ſhall be tried; For we will try their ſpirits, whether they will or no; <hi>And by the written word, even in the letter,</hi> which (for all their ſleightings of it) hath light enough to diſcover their darkneſſe and hypocriſie, and by it we will judge them, and <hi>they ſhall be judged;</hi> and if they repent not, (for all their pretenſions to perfection) they ſhall be condemned; for <hi>God and his Word, (his written Word) ſhall be true, when all oppoſers ſhall be found liars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Poſſibly other of their Books are as baſe as theſe, for the truth is, I have not read many of them (as not thinking it worth the while) but one of theſe the largeſt, I took more notice of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe penn'd or publiſhed in the name of two of thoſe that were here in this City, and did ſeduce the people. Theſe two which my ſelf with others of my brethren in the Miniſtry, had conference with, before the Maior and Aldermen, of which conference I hear they bray highly to their diſciples. But I find it obſerved by others, that have had to doe with theſe kind of men, that 'tis their uſual practiſe; and as holy and perfect as they ſeem to be, <hi>they can brag and lie abominably;</hi> ſay and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, affirm and deny, even preſently, as ſome of good credit can witneſſe. And as for that Conference, I leave it to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54713:23"/>
and cenſured by moſt that were preſent, and ſhall proceed to the thing intended.</p>
                  <p>But before I preſent theſe papers to thee, let me intreat thee take ſome directions, for thy more profitable reading of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider whether the Queries oppoſed to theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, be not of higheſt concernment in Religion; and ſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they deſerve not a ſober and ſerious anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve whether they be anſwered to at all, any of them, yea or no.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, do but take notice, how in ſtead of anſwering, they doe evade and avoid anſwering; not ſo much as in ſhew do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, do but take notice of the ſpirit of the men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſpeak from the Spirit of the holy God; when in ſtead of giving a ſober and ſolid anſwer, they rail upon and revile the Queriſt with helliſh and opprobrious ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, do but obſerve their Heretical opinions; which for thy better and more ready obſervation, I have directed to be Printed in a differing character.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Second Principle:</hi> That there is a God who is the Creator and Judge, and Governor of the world, and is to be known by Faith.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. <hi>The Saints God ye are ignorant of</hi> (who put light for darkneſs, and darkneſs for light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and before him ye cannot ſtand in judgement, who are found working wickedneſs, making people believe, that believing in a thing without them, will bring them to the knowledge of God, which none can know or underſtand but through death; and if ever ye come to know this God whom the Saints worſhip in Spirit and Truth, ye muſt witneſs a day of vengeance to paſs through: therefore ſtop your mouths <hi>ye proud and luſtful ones,</hi> the day of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence

                  <p>
                     <hi>Third Principle,</hi> That this God who is Creator, is eternally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from all other Creatures in his being and bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ</hi> God ye know not, neither can ye ſee him, but are found perſecutors of him, who would divide him from what he is, by <hi>heatheniſh inventions,</hi> which ariſeth out of the corrupt ſenſual part, which never ſhall inherit the Kingdom. <hi>The being of God is not diſtinct from them that are begotten by him:</hi> For as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son <hi>are one without diſtinction, ſo are they</hi> that are begotten by him; and here <hi>you perverters of the truth are ſhut forth from God,</hi> with all your diſtinctions and imaginations, which ariſeth out of the dark mind, by which ye have all this while deceived the people. <hi>Woe unto you, ye enemies of God,</hi> your foundation, your compaſs, and your end is made manifeſt unto the children of light, who would divide God from his children, whom he hath begotten unto himſelf through the word of faith, in which we live and abide for ever: And here I challenge you before the Lord, to produce one Scripture which ſpeaks of God being diſtinct from them that are begotten by him; and if you cannot prove your words by plain Scripture, let ſhame cover your faces, and ſtop your mouthes for ever.</p>
                  <p>And for your fourth thing, <hi>That God is three perſons or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, this is alſo another of your lies,</hi> never ſuch a word is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of in Scripture: and thus have you made your folly manifeſt to all men, and have cleared your ſelves from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.

                     <hi>Woe unto ye, you perverters of the truth,</hi> who blinds the eyes of the ſimple, making them believe your imaginations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings in ſtead of truth; and this you run to the powers of the earth to propagate. <hi>Ye men of ſin,</hi> did ever the Prophets declare of ſuch Goſpel as this, or did ever the Apoſtles preach any ſuch doctrine as this, which ye would compel people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would have the powers of the earth to propagate? Here I challenge you again to prove your example by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and where ever the holy men of God did divide him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three ſubſtances?

                  <p>Fifth Principle. <hi>The fifth is,</hi> That Chriſt is the Mediator between God and man, without the knowledge of whom there is no ſalvation.</p>

That deceiver of the Nations

being now almoſt caſt out of the prophane Ranters (who made ſuch foul work, that I ſuppoſe the devil himſelf was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them. And now he will appear in his white garments, as an angel of light (under the diſguiſe of humility, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification) to carry on his dark deſign of diveliſm to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all Religion.</p>
                  <p>And firſt let me tell the Reader, I have very good ground to conclude as I ſuppoſe, the myſtery of the Quakers to be the ſame with the Ranters, for this reaſon (beſides that it will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appear afterwards, when I come to lay part to part (as I promiſed) becauſe I finde the Quakers in a book of theirs, called, <hi>A word from the Lord, unto all the faithleſs generation of the world,</hi> &amp;c. Printed 1654 By <hi>George Fox,</hi> and <hi>James Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> wherein they have a word (among others) to the Ranters; I finde theſe Quakers giving this Teſtimony (13 page of the book) to the Ranters in theſe words, The word of the Lord God (ſay they) to you which are called Ranters, <hi>You had a pure convincement, I witneſs, which did convince you,</hi> but having fled the Croſs, and now to it are become enemies, which turns the Grace of God into wantonneſs, &amp;c. and then they blame them (as juſtly they may) for their abominable prophane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
                  <p>But however it ſeems they had <hi>a pure convincement, that he witneſſes.</hi> So that their light (their Doctrine) was good, however they abuſed it, They had a convincement under the Law (as they ſay) <hi>and ſtarted up to be as Gods</hi> (by that pure convincement it ſeems that God and they were one, and not diſtinct; <hi>but</hi> (as they ſtill ſay there) <hi>they never came through the Prophets, nor Moſes houſe, nor Chriſt.</hi> Mark their language, They never came through the Prophets, nor Chriſt. Here the Prophets, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Chriſt are all propoſed, <hi>not to be reſted in, but to be gone thorow;</hi> They muſt go thorow Chriſt as they go thorow the Prophets and <hi>Moſes.</hi> Chriſt as well as <hi>Moſes,</hi> muſt ceaſe and be gone thorow; <hi>not reſted in.</hi> And the Ranters it ſeems abuſed their good Principles (their pure convincement) whereby they ſtarted up as gods: but falling into prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did not rightly improve their <hi>Godſhip.</hi> And ſo came ſhort of their <hi>Chriſt ſhip</hi> (which theſe Quakers) by hearkening to the light of their own Godhead within them attain unto.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54713:35"/>
Thus for the Ranters, but now as for the Anabaptiſts, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and Presbyterians, they fall upon them, and quarrel <hi>their very light and doctrine,</hi> as living and teaching in the letter, and <hi>taking up outward commands,</hi> are witches, &amp;c. As may be ſeen in that book of theirs. So that the light and principles of the Ranters is more pure in theſe mens eys: Its true, the Levellers (to whom they there ſpake alſo) they have ſome indifferent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem with theſe men (if they had gone on) for they tell them, that <hi>they had a fleſh in their minds</hi> (I ſuppoſe ſome of this pure light, for they add) <hi>a ſimplicity, but their minds run into the earth</hi> (they ſay) <hi>and ſmothered it,</hi> and much of it, they ſay is withered, not all, it ſeems. So that Reader, thou maiſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by plainly ſee, what Principles and Lights theſe Quakers moſt approve of, and ſo conſequently follow, <hi>ſc.</hi> the Ranters in the myſtery of ungodlineſs before diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>And you will not think it ſtrange that one and the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are made uſe of, to ſuch ſeemingly differing ends as theſe are, <hi>by the Ranters and theſe Quakers:</hi> if you conſider, that even the ſacred truths of God, by the ſubtilty of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent working in mans heart, are abuſed, and the <hi>Grace of God turned into wantonneſs,</hi> by laſcivious and fleſhly ſpirits: For ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Reader, one of the ſame perſwaſion or opinion (yea or truth) works diverſly, as it is diverſly received, as they are that entertain it. A Truth meeting with <hi>a ſober and temperate</hi> ſpirit, will ſtrengthen and encreaſe his temperance. For men naturall improve every thing that agrees with their temper, and conſtitution, and the ſame Truth meeting with an <hi>unſober and intemperate ſpirit</hi> ſhall finde the ſame entertainment, <hi>ſc.</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his actings according to his temper, either to excuſe him and uphold him in his intemperancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by irritation to provoke him to more intemperance. So that <hi>let truth be what it will, moſt men are what they were.</hi> Only they know and can ſay more then they did before. And in truth this is the Religion (if I may give it that name) of all men in the world, except of thoſe whoſe hearts the Lord changes &amp; makes ſuitable to ſpiritual truths, &amp; they made new men, as hath been opened in the myſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which onely makes a man a Chriſtian, whatever the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Arminians, and Papiſts ſay (of general Light, univerſal Grace and Free-Will) to the contrary. And which one truth is able
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54713:36"/>
and ſufficient to overturn all their rotten and ungodly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſpel-like opinions.</p>
                  <p>But now Reader, that theſe Quakers are acted by the ſame curſed, ungodly, ungoſpel-like principles of the Rantors before opened, I ſhall prove from their own writings and expreſſions. And firſt (as the Rantors offer violence to the Majeſtie of God himſelf) as you have ſeen, by making themſelves equal with, and not diſtinct from the Majeſtie and glory of God himſelf (which I ſuppoſe thou wilt grant is high blaſphemy, and the ſin, the principal and capital ſin of the devil;) ſo do theſe Quakers: For it is their down-right and plain expreſſion, <hi>That they are equal with God,</hi> as <hi>Fox</hi> ſaid the words expreſly, <hi>I am equal with God.</hi> And <hi>Naylor</hi> being ſpeaking upon the point of perfection, being asked, whether he did believe that any could be as holy, juſt, and good, as God himſelf, anſwered, <hi>That he did witneſs that he himſelf was as holy, juſt, and good as God.</hi> All which you may find in a Book called the <hi>Perfect Phariſee,</hi> written by ſome Miniſters of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> And they alſo affirm, that the nature and glory of the elect (mark, <hi>the nature as well as the glory) dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not from the nature and glory of the Creator.</hi> Theſe are the words of <hi>Howgill</hi> and <hi>Burrough,</hi> in anſwer to certain queries put by one <hi>Reeve</hi> and which are printed together with their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to <hi>Bennets</hi> Queries, here before inſerted; and which I had a purpoſe to print alſo, but that I was unwilling to make my book ſwell too much in bulk, and ſo diſcourage the Reader in regard of the price; and the rather I omitted it, becauſe in it the anſwers are longer by much then thoſe to Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and full of impertinences, which I feared would tire and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Reader in that regard alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Reeve, <hi>having propoſed this Query, which is his ſecond,</hi> Whether is not this an infallible demonſtration to all men, that a man is ſent forth by the eternal Spirit, if he have received a gift from the holy Ghoſt to demonſtrate what the true Creator was in his own diſtinct eſſence, nature and glory, from all eternity, in time, and to all eternity and wherein elect men and Angels differ in their natures and glory, diſtinct from their Creator in their perſons?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They (after ſome revilings, and judging the Queriſt) ſay (as before) That</hi> the nature and glory of the Elect, differs not from the nature and glory of the Creator. <hi>And add thus;</hi> For the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

are one with the Creator, in his nature enjoying his glory, which was from eternity unto eternity: He that reads, (ſay they) let him underſtand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And then further add, Thy word, Diſtinct eſſence, I deny: For,</hi> the Elect is not diſtinct from the Creator, but lives by the dwelling of the Son in him and with the Son the Father dwels alſo; if thou haſt an ear thou maiſt hear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in their Anſwer to the firſt Query (which I had omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) where the Queſtion was thus,</hi> Whether theſe men <hi>(mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Quakers)</hi> were ſent forth by the eternal Spirit to Preach, <note place="margin">I muſt take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ſet them down, for that they doe belye men in miſreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their words, I ſhall prove af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards</note> which in the leaſt cannot demonſtrate, what the only true God is in himſelf, and how he is a diſtinct being from all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and how he reigns in the elect, by a created word, voice, or ſpiritual motion only?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They give this Anſwer,</hi> God is a Spirit, and he is not diſtinct from living creatures, for in him living creatures lives, moves, and hath their beings, and he is not far from them, nor diſtinct from them. <hi>Which minds me of one</hi> Sebaſtian Frank <hi>(a man of this gang in</hi> Germany) <hi>who hath this blaſphemous expreſſion:</hi> In trunco Deum eſſe truncum, in porco porcum, in diabolo diabolum. <hi>In Engliſh thus (which I do with abhorrency and trembling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

That God who is the Creator, is eternally diſtinct from all other creatures: <hi>So the ſe Quakers languages it, as if God were a creature too; whereas thoſe worthy men ſay in their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals thus,</hi> That he is eternally diſtinct from all the creatures; <hi>not</hi>

                  <p>Reader, I took not upon me to confute or anſwer them in this, or any of that which follows (for <hi>recitaſſe, eſt confutaſſe)</hi> but to let thee ſee what bold, impudent audacious, blaſphemous wretches theſe Quakers are, and that they build upon that rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten foundation, that myſtery of ungodlineſs formerly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee: and that they offer violence to the Majeſtie of God himſelf, as God, levelling him with the creatures, which is the head, and the firſt principle of this man of ſin, and the firſt thing propounded.</p>
                  <p>And unto this we may add their denial (direct denial) of God, as he hath revealed himſelf in the Scriptures; and that is, that he is three in one (which for brevities ſake, ſuppoſing our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be underſtood by our people, who are inſtructed in this principle) we expreſs by the word (Trinity.) And for the better apprehenſion (as the creature now is able to apprehend of God) we expreſs by three ſubſiſtances or perſons: Whereas I ſay we are taught in the word, <hi>That God is three in one.</hi>

                     <hi>through Moſes and the Prophets and Chriſt,</hi> read but a paſſage in that book of <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Hubberthorne,</hi> the title whereof I have formerly given thee, <hi>(ſc.

to that, and free from that, as not to be bound to obſerve it. And that this is his meaning, the next page ſhews; (there in the beginning) he ſays, <hi>the Law and the Prophets were until</hi> John, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>until Chriſt:</hi> and <hi>bids thoſe that can receive it</hi> (that is, underſtand him) <hi>receive it; and if they can, they may:</hi> So he ſays, implying a myſterie, ſomething more then ordinary to be intended by him in that expreſſion. And then tels them, <hi>that when they come to go through</hi> Moſes <hi>and through the Prophets and through</hi> John <hi>to come to Chriſt, then they ſhall ſee the light is but one, ſc.</hi> the light of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the light of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for that was the queſtion propounded, <hi>Whether there were any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between them?</hi> as thou mayſt ſee in that book, <hi>Quer.</hi> 4.

In the firſt page of that book, they give good words of the Law, viz. <hi>that it is holy, juſt and good, and perfect and pure.</hi> But for theſe good words, they preſently in the next line ſay, <hi>that it is but a Schoolmaſter till faith; and when faith is come, we are no longer under a ſchoolmaſter.</hi> And this (ſay they) <hi>is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed amongſt us.</hi> And in the 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> page of that book (ſpeaking of the Moral Law) they ſay, <hi>that's without, and there it ſhall ſtand as you are</hi> (the Prieſts) <hi>in the firſt nature;</hi> and that (in their tongue) is the periſhing nature.

                  <p>And indeed, what need is there? For if we be once come to be equal with God (as they ſay) <hi>perfectly righteous in our own perſons,</hi> ſo that we can perfectly keep the Law, and not ſin in any thing; what need Chriſt, as a Mediator or an Interceſſor? and ſo no need of him for any thing.

                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, beloved Reader, do they not make Chriſt altogether uſeleſs to the Saints, whenas they ſay, <hi>the Elect were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed?</hi> as they do in their anſwer to the 4.

                  <p>Thus doe they offer violence to Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, making him a meer ſhadow, a type, a temporary manifeſtation, <hi>to be gone through, not to be reſted in;</hi> and making void the chief end of his coming in the fleſh, and nulling his death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

                  <p>And they may well be thus bold with him that is a meer nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a nothing (if their opinion of him were true) for they que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion (if not deny and deſtroy) his natures, both divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; for which I will appeal to their expreſſions: For as for his divine nature, his abſolute Godhead, when as the eight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle propoſed (as before) by Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> &amp;c. ſaies, <hi>That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is God and man in one perſon</hi> (which as before) <hi>most blaſphemouſly they anſwer, was a lie.</hi> What doth he mean to alter their words, and to call him only <hi>the man of God,</hi> not God and man, as they expreſs it? <hi>Whereas you ſay in the eight</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that this Chriſt, the man of God, is God and man in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is a lye.</hi> If he did believe him to be God and man, would he have altered their words, and given him ſuch a diminiſhing appellation, as <hi>the man of God?</hi> a title given to meer creatures. And as for the humane nature of Chriſt (his diſtinct, particular, and proper body) do they not deny it? For a query being put to <hi>George Fox, Whether Jeſus Chriſt have a body in heaven, and whether it be the ſame that appeared among men in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:54713:40"/>
Thou ſhalt find him anſwering, <hi>That Chriſt hath but one body, which is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Church:</hi> and he ſaies, <hi>he remains in the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Truths defence, pag. 78.</note> 
                     <hi>heavens;</hi> but he will not ſay <hi>he hath a humane body there.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And being asked (as before)</hi> Whether it be the ſame that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared amongſt men? <hi>He anſwers,</hi> It is the ſame that did deſcend, the ſame did aſcend; <hi>not acknowledging</hi> any other body, than what did deſcend. <hi>And in the eighty page, being asked,</hi> with what bodies the Saints ſhall ariſe, and dwell, and live in for ever? <hi>And</hi> whether every particular Saint ſhall have a particular body? <hi>He anſwers,</hi> The Saints ſhall ariſe in that body which Chriſt doth live in; for <hi>(ſaith he</hi> he is the Saviour of the body, he is the head of the body, and the reſurrection, and the life of the body, and his body is but one.</p>
                  <p>So that here thou ſeeſt that Chriſt and the Saints have no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct bodies of their own, and but one common body, all blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together.</p>
                  <p>And as they thus offer violence to Jeſus Chriſt in his nature and perſon, ſo do they alſo to him, in his death, bloudſhed, and merits. This in part appears by what hath been ſhewed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in their <hi>ſcoffing at our hopes of being ſaved by that Jeſus Chriſt that died at</hi> Jeruſalem, and in ſaying that they are redeemed by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>but not at Jeruſalem onely;</hi> but (ſay they) <hi>made manifeſt in us.</hi> So that there is ſomething in themſelves whereby they are redeemed. <hi>Truths Defence, pag.</hi> 95. and in the 86. <hi>page</hi> of the ſame Book, they ſay, <hi>There is that light and power in every man, which if he take heed to it, and wait within, there he ſhall find his Saviour.</hi> Mark there <hi>(within)</hi> he ſhall find his Saviour.</p>

                     <hi>And affirming</hi> the elect were never defiled, &amp;c. <hi>But it appears further, in that they hold,</hi> the ſufferings of Chriſt, now in the Saints, to be ſatisfactory for ſins paſt, preſent, and to come. <hi>For</hi> Howgill <hi>and</hi> Borr. <hi>as thou maiſt ſee in their Anſwer, herewith printed before, to the ſeven Queries, ſay thus,</hi> Thou blaſphemer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> askes thou knows not what, is not Chriſt the ſame now as ever? and is not the ſufferings of Chriſt ſatisfactory wherever? <hi>Nay (which is more horrid) if we take the queſtion and anſwer together, do they not in effeſt ſay (for they will not yet ſpeak out all their mind)</hi> that the ſufferings of Chriſt now in the Saints, is all the ſatisfaction to, or which the Juſtice of God looks for, for ſins paſt,

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54713:41"/>
which theſe Quakers deny, as thou haſt ſeen. Nay further, in expreſs Engliſh they deny it. In their anſwer to the 15 <hi>Query, I own no righteouſneſs but what is of Chriſt, and wrought by thee.</hi> Oh fearful blaſphemy againſt the Goſpel! Thus they offer violence to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly (which naturally, and muſt neceſſarily follow) they offer violence <hi>to all the ordinances of the Goſpel.</hi> As they deny an outward Chriſt, or a Chriſt without (as they call him) ſo do they deny all outward ordinances. So <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Nailor</hi> in their book, <hi>[A word from the Lord] We deny them whoſe law is without, their law without, their Church without, their baptiſm prayers and ſinging without, their Chriſt without, their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without,</hi> &amp;c. If they had denied that which is <hi>only</hi> without, they had ſaid ſomthing; but thou ſeeſt it is otherwiſe, here's <hi>all outward ordinances, worſhip, and Chriſt, and righteouſneſs without,</hi> ſtruck off at one blow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thoſe Quakers before mentioned in their Anſwer to the ſeven Prieſts ſay, that</hi> who are of the Lord are freed from the ordinances of men <hi>(ſo they call Goſpel-ordinances)</hi> and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means; <hi>and for it moſt wratchedly abuſe theſe words,</hi> For where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. <hi>And</hi> Truths Defence <hi>ſays,</hi> p. <hi>68. That</hi> when the life of Jeſus is made manifeſt, the ſubſtance of all figures is come, there is no more obſerving them. <hi>And two lines after they ſay, Who are here in their ſtate</hi> denies all the carnal outward obſervances and traditions. <hi>And in the 32 page of that book they ſay, (ſpeaking of the Miniſtry) that</hi> they bewitch men, in telling them of carnal meanes; <hi>and call Ordinances</hi> a graven image and an Idol: <hi>and as for Baptiſm in particular, they ſay,</hi> Chriſt did not ſend forth his Diſciples to ſprinkle a little dirty water upon childrens faces, as your filthy dreamers do: <hi>and they ſay</hi> Chriſt did not mention any water to his Diſciples when he ſent them forth. <hi>So that here is no baptiſm with water at all, neither for one nor other; and thereupon call it</hi> a beaſtical tradition, which was never commanded. <hi>Truths Defence,</hi> p. <hi>98.

                  </p>
                  <p>Reader, I have done with this; and I ſuppoſe in theſe few lines it appears that they offer violence alſo to all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpel. And now what ſayſt thou to the whole matter? Are not theſe, thinkeſt thou, <hi>theſe Locuſts that are come forth upon the opening of the bottomles pit,</hi> mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. <hi>with whom comes forth a ſmoak by which the ſun and the air are darkned?</hi> Read there their deſcription: Certainly the King that rules in them and over them, is no other then that <hi>Abaddon, Apollyon,</hi> mentioned there <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Vaſtator,</hi> that deſtroyer, <hi>that diſſolver</hi> (as the word ſignifies) of all religion and duty. And ſurely were I perſwaded that the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were written for the Meridian of <hi>England,</hi> I ſhould be alſo perſwaded that theſe were the Beaſt mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>to whom was given a mouth ſpeaking great things and blaſphemies, who opened his mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his name and his taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and all that dwell therein.</hi> Never men ſpake higher bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemies with more (or ſo much) confidence and impudence againſt God, and Chriſt, and Goſpel, then theſe wretches do, except thoſe that are profeſt enemies to Chriſt and Chriſtianity. And therefore ſo much the more abominable, in that <hi>under the name and vizor and diſguiſe of Chriſtian religion,</hi> they diſſolve and deſtroy all. Which is that which makes it a myſterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and is indeed the very name and title of that great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, <hi>The Antichriſt,</hi> Rev. 17. 5. Upon her forehead was writen a name, <hi>Myſterie, Babylon the great, The mother of harlots and abomination of the earth.</hi> And though he hath <hi>horns like the lamb,</hi> yet <hi>he ſpeaks as a dragon,</hi> Rev. 13. 11. And he doth great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the ſight of men, <hi>and deceives them that dwell on the earth, by the means of thoſe miracles,</hi> v. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>But, Reader, there is one mark of the Beaſt upon theſe wretches, which I muſt needs mind thee of before I leave them,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54713:42"/>
which I find in the firſt of <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. beginning, which becauſe it ſo fully ſets them forth, I'le give thee in the words, <hi>Now the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſpeaks expreſly</hi> (and therfore you may expect it) <hi>that in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times ſome ſhall depart from the Faith, giving heed to ſeducing spirits, and doctrins of Devils ſpeaking lyes in hypocriſie, having their Conſciences ſeared with a hot iron, forbiding to marry, and to abſtain from meats,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>They ſpeak lies in hypocriſie, and whats this? But to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to deceive, to jugle and play the cheater, ſpeaking one thing, and meaning another, to ſpeak plain words, <hi>that other men uſe;</hi> But with a reſerved ſenſe to themſelves of their own coyning: So that no man knows how (in an ordinary way) to underſtand them, they pretend to ſpeak and approve of the truth, but they lie and play the deceivers, <hi>not uſing words in that ſenſe they are uſually taken, and commonly underſtood.</hi> And if ever men were guilty of this kinde of hypocriſie, theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are. It would be endleſs to trace them all along. I'le in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one or two, by which thou maiſt judge of them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things they ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Its uſual with them to ſay <hi>they own the Scriptures, yea we confirm, we eſtabliſh the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. Yea that they do, <hi>And they witneſs the Scripture.</hi> Now an honeſt man (that means plainly) would think, that they held forth nothing but what is in, and agreeable to the Scriptures: and that they did believe the Scriptures (which we call our Bible) to be the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God. And the rule of a Chriſtian to walk by in things to be believed and practiſed: And that whoſo walks accordingly ſhall be ſaved. And that whoſo doth not, cannot be ſaved. Thus I dare ſay honeſt plain hearted men, would think by thoſe words, to be their meaning. But theſe wretches ſpeak lies in hypocriſie: they mean otherwiſe, they ſay in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words elſewhere, <hi>The Scriptures are not the Saints rule of knowing God and living unto him.</hi> Anſwer to the firſt Principle, in their ſword drawn, here before Printed, I will not quarrel them as I might, for mangling the Principle, and ſo altering the ſenſe: But what ſayſt thou Reader to their own words, do theſe men eſtabliſh the Scripture in thy ſenſe, and the uſual ſenſe of that word, do not they preſently ſay <hi>that to affirm the Scriptures to be the Rule, is to put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs.</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:54713:43"/>
What mean they then by the Scripture? Not the written word without, <hi>But that word (that light) that is within;</hi> and which every man hath that comes into the world; but that ſome ſtiflle it. This is the Rule. This is the Scripture. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <note place="margin">Short Anſwer to the Prieſts, p. 15.</note> in its right place, <hi>The Scriptures are not laid aſide</hi> (ſay they) <hi>but witneſſed every Scripture in its place, i. e.</hi> within. So they pag. 13, 14. <hi>Let all ſee,</hi> ſay they, <hi>you to be lyars, whether we do no ſet the Scriptures in the heart of every one.</hi> How, they tell you in the next words, <hi>For,</hi> ſay they, <hi>every one having the light within, which ſhews his evil deeds, which light is his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that hates it:</hi> (And brings up to ſalvation, where follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as elſewhere often) And <hi>this ſay they is Scripture within.</hi> The Scripture without is not their Scripture: <hi>We believe his</hi>

                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> (ſay they) <hi>not an outward teſtimony;</hi> And pag 43. by way of reproach. <hi>Thou ſaiſt it, becauſe the Scripture ſaith it.</hi> Nay do they not in page 90 of the ſame book, anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond querie, <hi>call the letter of the Scripture duſt:</hi> And calls him Serpent for aſſerting the word preacht, as the means of Faith, <hi>Serpent like</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou feedeſt upon duſt.</hi> And in the next page, Anſwer to the fourth query; <hi>All thy hearing, and all thy pratling of that which thou calleſt the word, by it thou ſhalt never get Faith (which is the gift of God) but it is all the Serpents meat which feeds thee, thou ſerpent, which art curſt above all the beaſts of the field.</hi> And do not they ſay page 104 of that book Anſwer to querie the thirtieth, That <hi>their giving forth of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or printed books, it is from the immediate eternal Spirit of God.</hi> And then what difference between their ſtinking rotten blaſphemous papers, and the ſacred Scriptures: Yea (to make up the meaſure of their blaſphemie) do they not ſay, <hi>the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Short Anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Prieſts, p. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>ſame ſpirit which gave forth the Scriptures, which gives forth now, is as true as the Scriptures, and not contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> The charge being againſt them for magnifying papers equal to the holy Scriptures, what damnable hypocrites are theſe, to ſay they eſtabliſh the Scriptures; If we take their words in every honeſt mans ſenſe. But what mean theſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites then, in ſaying <hi>they eſtabliſh, and they confirm, and they witneſs the Scriptures;</hi> Why forſooth it pleaſeth their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Chriſtſhip (or rather devilſhip) to ſpeak from their eternal ſpirit, in the Scripture language, and ſo add their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54713:43"/>
to it, as the Papiſts; <hi>The Scriptures are but as Aeſops Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with them, if not allowed of and confirmed by the authority of their Church,</hi> Or elſe they eſtabliſh it by aſſerting it to be within them in the power of it. (For I would allow them all fair interpretation.) But I pray, are not the Scriptures truth, and the written and ſacred Word of God in themſelves, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man doth believe or entertain them, yea or no?</hi> Doth mans believing them, make them the Word of God, more then they were before? Its true, as to his comfort or advantage that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them not; to him they are not, as the Word of God. But in themſelves they are, and will be, though all men in the world reject them. <hi>They ſpeak lies therefore in hypocriſie, in ſaying they eſtabliſh the word.</hi> But further (to diſcover their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hypocriſie) they ſpeak not forſooth from the letter of the Scripture, i. not as taught by or from the letter, i. what they get by reading of the Scripture in the letter. No: though the Scripture had never been written, they could have ſpoken as they do, <hi>from and by the eternal and immediate and infallible ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> But oh ye hypocrites: I'le ask you a queſtion, did our Engliſh Tranſlators of the Scriptures, teach the eternal Spirit to ſpeak Engliſh? Or (if you would ſpeak without lying) <hi>Did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read the Scripture in our Engliſh tranſlation;</hi> that you ſpeak the very words for the moſt part: except your canting lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, from <hi>Jacob Behmen</hi> (as <hi>the ſtraying of Eves minde and luſt into the viſibles:</hi> and <hi>being redeemed out of the periſhing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and ſuch like ſtuffe) will any man believe that the ſpirit (which gives the gift of utterance and expreſſion) could not have ſpoken the ſame truths, in other Engliſh; As every one knows, may be done, and yet keep the ſame ſenſe and truth? But it muſt pedantically teach you (like ſchool-boys) to ſpeak ſo by rote? Fye for ſhame, It ſmels, leave your hypocritical lying, and do not ſo poorly and baſely belye the ſpirit, and ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that light which is within you.</p>
                  <p>But once more (and a little further to this) what leads your Holineſs forth to ſpeak in Scripture language? Is it not hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite-like, that thereby you might catch poor ſimple, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted people in your ſnares, who <hi>having a due and reverent eſteem of the Scriptures,</hi> you allure by pretences of eſtabliſhing the Scripture to inſinuate thoſe poiſonous doctrines, which I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54713:44"/>
have before diſcovered you to be guilty of? As for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts other two Doctrines of forbidding to marry, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from meats, I ſhall not now proſecute, I may ſpeak of that when I ſhall a little open the effects of their teachings!</p>
                  <p>But before I ſpeak to that, I ſhall but ſuggeſt my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the end theſe men may have in their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and on whoſe errand they are come: I will preſent them, and leave them to thy judgement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They may come in</hi> their own, Anti-chriſts, or the Devils errand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, they may come in their own, to cheat the people of the money, and this hypocritical lying too: For though they raile upon Miniſters, as Preaching for hire (which who ſo doth, let him anſwer for himſelf) yet they themſelves do teach, <hi>That where they have planted and ſown, there they may reap:</hi> Which in plain Engliſh is this, Thoſe whom they have ſeduced, they may take money of: and whether they do or no, time will diſcover: Sure I am they have neceſſary ſupplies for nature, which ſome able Miniſters have not: and no doubt a large Dioceſs which theſe ramble over, will yield more then any particular Pariſh. And they plead hard for Community; for in their Anſwer to the ſeven Prieſts, page 22. whereas it ſeems they had charged them with reading for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Quakers there anſwer and ſay,</hi> Here you are againſt the Spirit of life: For <hi>(ſay they)</hi> they that did believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were of one heart; and they that do believe, are born of God; and amongſt ſuch there was no oppreſſor, no taskmaſter; and its ſaid all things were common, and no man ſaid, this is my own: <hi>And conclude thus,</hi> You who are not come to Chriſts Doctrine, who is not come to give your coat, yet who hath two, you we deny.</p>
                  <p>So that though they come not for money before-hand, they can take it afterwards; and though (with the Fryars) they may not touch money, they have a poak in their ſleeve, into which if you put it, ſome can take it out, and know what to doe with it. So that this may be one end of their coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:54713:44"/>
Secondly, they may come upon Anti-Chriſts errand; and not much improbable; for <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and thoſe parts, is as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for <hi>Papiſts</hi> as <hi>Witches;</hi> and on good grounds we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to be Anti-Chriſts factors, if we conſider their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins: For any intelligent Reader may eaſily diſcover the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal grace, Free-will, Satisfaction by our own ſufferings, Juſtification by inherent holineſs, Ability to keep the Law, Perfection:</hi> Nulling the Doctrine of Original ſin, and the <hi>Popiſh real preſence.</hi> All which, with ſome other things, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended particularly to evidence from their writings; but I fear, being too large. There are many other wretched opinions of theirs, worſe then the Papiſts, which others have diſcovered from other of their writings, which I have not ſeen; and I leave it to others who have more ſtrength and leiſure, if they ſee cauſe, to diſcover to the world. And truely it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſome of theſe fellows themſelves may be of the <hi>Popiſh tribe,</hi> and Schollers, though profeſſing themſelves <hi>mechanick;</hi> for is it not uſual?</p>
                  <p>And there is a notable ſtory to this purpoſe lately printed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The falſe Jew,</hi> wherein is expreſſed his deſigne, and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, from his own acknowledgment, how that he was ſent over from <hi>Rome</hi> by a ſpecial order from the Jeſuits, and <hi>with perſonal unction, and benediction from the Pope;</hi> and how one while he was to have come over under the notion of a <hi>Tailor,</hi> with direction to joyn with the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and to preach <hi>Notions.</hi> But now he came over under the pretext of being a <hi>Converted Jew</hi> being an excellent Hebritian) and circumciſed at <hi>Rome</hi> for this purpoſe. To what, and whither will not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded ſpirit lead a man!

Another deſign of this deceiver, was to bring the authority of our <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the Scripture into queſtion.

For <hi>Fox,</hi> and <hi>Hubberthorn,</hi> in their book bring in theſe words, <hi>Take heed to the light of God within you.</hi> And not onely produce them in another character (the ſame with their Scripture quotations) But alſo urge them as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles words thus: ſc. <hi>As the Apoſtle ſaid, Take heed to the light of God within you.</hi> Neither citing what Apoſtle, or where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As indeed, 'tis no where in all the Scripture And <hi>Farnworth</hi> in his late piece of <hi>womens ſpeaking in the Church;</hi> Printed by <hi>Calvert</hi> 1654. In the head of his diſcourſe, where uſually in printed books the Text is placed: He hath theſe words in a diſtinct character, as his Authority for his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe. <hi>But the ſpirit of truth may declare through the Temple, and dwell in it, which the world cannot receive.</hi> And then quotes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16, 17.

                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed Reader 'tis manifeſt, theſe mens intents are to fetch people off from the Scripture altogether: That ſo the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof being rejected; they may be the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared upon a <hi>new aſſault</hi> (in <hi>another diſguiſe)</hi> to entertain the infallible Authority of the Romiſh Chair. For the ſame courſe the Papiſts take to render them of ſmall eſteem: do theſe men run. For the learnedſt of them, pick out all ſuch places as ſeem <hi>contrary</hi> one unto another: and urge them to the people: denying <hi>to any</hi> a power of reconciliation; refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that to their own un-erring ſpirit And from thence aſſume a power to make the whole Authentical; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And do not theſe men the ſame? It may therefore be very probable, (all forewritten conſidered) they come of Antichriſts errand.</p>

And thirdly and laſtly, They may come of <hi>the devils errand.</hi> He hath many meſſengers and ſervants, and ſome ſerve him more <hi>eminently</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> then others. And they are <hi>Hereticks, Falſe Teachers, and Seducers.</hi> I ſhall take this for the preſent granted. And that theſe men are ſent by him in a more eſpecial manner is extremely probable.</p>
                  <p>If you conſider the <hi>manner</hi> of their coming, and their <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Their <hi>matter</hi> you have ſeen, ſc. <hi>reviling, railing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, lying, falſifying blaſpheming,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>ANno Chriſti</hi> 1653. about the month of <hi>October,</hi> came ſome Quakers out of the North into <hi>Wales,</hi> about <hi>Wrex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> endeavouring to win ſome profeſſors to their party. Their principal deſign was to <hi>diſgrace the Miniſtry and all publike Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:54713:46"/>
They held Univerſal redemption, Free-will, and falling from grace: They publiſhed that all men have the pure ſeed of God in them, boaſting that themſelves were perfect, and without ſin; that they knew at the firſt ſight, ſincere Chriſtians from hypocrites. At meetings after long ſilence, ſometimes one, ſometimes more, fell into a great and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhaking and trembling in their whole bodies, and all their joynts, with ſuch riſings and ſwellings in their bellies and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, ſending forth ſuch ſhreekings, yellings, howlings and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as not only affrighted the ſpectaters, but cauſed the dogs to bark, the ſwine to cry, and the cattel to run about, to the aſtoniſhment of all that heard them. By theſe artifices, one <hi>William Spencer</hi> was drawn to leave the Church, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; whereupon at ſeveral times he fell into the ſame quaking fits; and <hi>lying with one of them</hi> three ſeveral nights, the laſt night being much troubled, and not able to ſleep, upon a ſudden he heard ſomething buzzing, and humming about the Quakers head like an humble-bee, which did ſore affright him, whereupon he ſought to riſe; but the Quaker perſwaded him to lie ſtill, and immediately there aroſe <hi>a great wind &amp; ſtorm, which ſhook the houſe</hi> wherein they lay; which adding much to his former fear, he again attempted to ariſe; but the Quaker ſtill preſſed him to lie ſtill, perſwading him to expect the <hi>Power</hi> to come (which they often promiſe to their Proſelytes) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he again heard the former humming noiſe, which more and more terrified him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that he ſtrove vehemently to riſe; but the Quaker laid his head upon <hi>Spencers</hi> ſhoulder, and did <hi>blow</hi> hard like the hizzing of a Gooſe ſeveral times towards his face, or mouth, which made him leap out of his bed in a great aſtoniſhment, crying for a light, and guide to conduct him to a neighbours houſe: and upon this occaſion left them all together; teſtifying the truth hereof to the Quakers face, before many witneſſes, the Quaker not denying it, atteſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeveral hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:54713:46"/>
The ſecond, which is a ſtory publiſhed by one that was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and poſſeſſed, and is ſet forth by himſelf by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation and admonition.</p>
                  <p>IN <hi>May</hi> laſt, 1653. in <hi>Kendal</hi> in <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> there was one <hi>John Gilpin,</hi> who was very deſirous to aſſociate himſelf with the Quakers at their meeting; and ſpeaking with one of them about it, he much encouraged him to hold on his purpoſe, and accordingly he went to them, when one <hi>Ch. Atkinſon</hi> was ſpeaker, whoſe drift was to deny all Miniſterial Teaching and Ordinances, together with all Notional knowledge gained by the uſe of ſuch means, and to become as if they had never learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any ſuch thing; <hi>and now to be taught of God within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by waiting upon an inward light,</hi> which (as he ſaid) lies low hidden under the earth, <hi>viz.</hi> The old man which is of the earth, earthly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gilpin</hi> was immediately ſo taken with this <hi>new doctrine,</hi> that he reſolved to cloſe with them, was afraid to read any good books, or hear any preaching Miniſter, or to call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance any thing which he had formerly learned concerning God, Chriſt, his own eſtate, or any other ſubject contained in the Scriptures; for <hi>they told him</hi> that all ſuch knowledge was but Notional, carnal, and hanging upon the tree of knowledge, adding, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on this tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of them told him, that Chriſt was as man, had his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, diſtruſted God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>At his next meeting, the Speaker urged him to take up the Croſs daily, ſaying, <hi>Carry the Croſs all day, and it will keep thee at night.</hi> He urged him to hearken to <hi>a voice within him,</hi> ſpake much of a light within them, which <hi>Gilpin</hi> not yet finding, was much troubled, deſiring that he might fall into <hi>quaking,</hi> thinking that <hi>thereby</hi> he ſhould attain to the immediate diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of God to him. And accordingly ſhortly after as he was walking in his chamber, he began to quake ſo extremely that he could not ſtand, but fell upon his bed, where he howled and cryed in a terrible and hideous manner (as others of them uſed to do,) yet <hi>was he not afraid,</hi> but looked upon it as the pangs of the new birth. After half an hour by degrees he ceaſed from houling, and rejoiced <hi>that now he could witneſs againſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:54713:47"/>
                     <hi>of England</hi> as falſe Prophets and Prieſts of <hi>Baal.</hi> All the night after he was much troubled with dreams about his ſins; and when he awaked, he thought thereon; he perceived <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lighting on his neck,</hi> and giving him a great ſtroke, which cauſed much pain; and ſo a ſecond, third, and fourth, each leſs then other, deſcending till it came to the middle of his back, and then he diſcerned <hi>ſomething to enter into his body,</hi> which Satan ſuggeſted to be the Spirit of God like a Dove, and he thought he heard a voice within him ſaying, <hi>It is day;</hi> adding twice, As ſure as it's light, ſo ſure ſhall Chriſt give thee light.</p>
                  <p>Two or three days after he waited for more light, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his garden, he lay down with his face to the earth, at which time his <hi>right hand began extremely to ſhake,</hi> and he was <hi>in a great rapture of joy,</hi> apprehending it to be a figure of his ſpiritual marriage and union with Chriſt: Then did the power within raiſe him, and ſet him on his feet, and afterwards laid him on his back, brought his ſins into his remembrance, cauſing his hand at every ſin to ſtrike the ground; and he heard a voice ſaying, <hi>Now is ſuch a ſin mortified:</hi> then was he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that all his ſins were mortified <hi>at once.</hi> Then roſe he up, and it was ſaid to him, Ask what thou wilt of the Father in my name, and he will give it thee. Then ſaid <hi>Gilpin, What ſhall I ask?</hi> It was anſwered, <hi>Ask wiſdom in the firſt place.</hi> Then he deſired that ſuch things might be given him as made for Gods glory, and the good of others. It was anſwered, that his requeſt was granted, and <hi>that he ſhould be endowed with the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,</hi> and ſinging praiſes to God.</p>
                  <p>Preſently after he went to another of their meetings, where <hi>Atkinſon</hi> was again the ſpeaker: with which he was more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected then formerly, for that <hi>(as he conceited) he could inwardly witneſs to what he ſpake. Atkinſon</hi> having done, one <hi>John Aud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſpake; in the time of whoſe ſpeaking <hi>Gilpin</hi> was <hi>by the Devil within him,</hi> drawn out of his chair, and thrown upon the ground, where he lay all night; all which time his body and members were all in motion, being turned from his back on his belly, &amp; ſo back again ſeveral times, making croſſes with his legs, and his hands moving on the ground as if he had been writing, and he heard (as he thought) a voice ſaying, that that writing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54713:47"/>
with his hand on the ground, ſignified the <hi>writing of the law in his heart.</hi> Then were his hands moved to his head, and he heard a voice ſaying, <hi>Chriſt in God; and God in Chriſt, and Chriſt in thee.</hi> Which words he was <hi>compelled</hi> to ſing forth in a ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with ſuch a voice as was <hi>not</hi> his own; he ſung alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>phraſes of Scripture,</hi> which were given into him. Then the Devil raiſed him up, and bade him <hi>be humble:</hi> then brought him on his knees again, and he heard the voice ſaying, <hi>Stoop, low, low!</hi> and when his face was almoſt at the ground, it ſaid to him, <hi>Take up thy croſs and follow me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then riſing, he was led out of the houſe by the Devil at a back-door to the River, and back again, and then into the Town, where he was drawn down the ſtreet, to adore that he knew not. Whereupon two of them that followed him, ſaid, Whither will you go? this is the Fidlers houſe. <hi>Gilpin</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Be it whoſe houſe it will, Chriſt leads me hither,</hi> and hither I muſt go. Then was his hand forced to knock at the door, and a voice bade him ſay, Behold, <hi>Chriſt ſtands at the door and knocks.</hi> The Fidler opening the door, he went in, and taking down a Baſe-Viol, he was forced to play on it and to dance. Whereupon he queſtioned what power led him to ſuch actions? and the voice preſently anſwered him, <hi>This is not becauſe I love Muſick, for I hate it;</hi> but to ſignifie to thee what joy there is in heaven at thy converſion, as alſo what <hi>ſpiritual melody thou ſhalt have hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then was he led out of the houſe, and carried through the Town, being forced, as he went, to proclaim, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> Then went he to his own houſe, and there by the Devil was thrown down, and forced to make cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with his hands; the voice telling him, that <hi>he was now putting off the old man.</hi> His hand alſo was forced to take up a ſtone which lay on the floor, which he thought to be like a mans heart; and the Voice told him, that Chriſt had taken that ſtone out of his heart, and given him an heart of fleſh. Then holding it forth to the ſpectators, he was forced to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Except you ſee ſigns and wonders, you will not believe.</hi> And throwing the ſtone amongſt them, he ſaid, Lo here is my heart of ſtone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:54713:48"/>
Then was he caſt upon his back on the ground, and the voice ſaid, Thou ſhalt have two Angels to keep thee, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>two Swallows</hi> came down the Chimney, and ſat on a Shelf near him; whereupon he cryed, <hi>My Angels, my Angels,</hi> and withal he held out his hand to them, expecting they ſhould have come to him, but they flew up the Chimney again, though the Doors and Windows were open. Then was he carried <hi>upon his hands and knees out of the doors into the street;</hi> and when his wife would have ſtopped him, he ſaid, he muſt not be ſtopped, he muſt forſake wife, children, and all to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus went he up the Street, thinking that he bore a Croſs upon his neck, till ſome <hi>pulled him out of the mire and dirt,</hi> and by force carried him into his houſe; whereupon, pointing at one of them, he ſaid, <hi>Chriſt points at thee, Thou art a wicked woman,</hi> and haſt hindred the work of the Lord. Then the voice asked him, Where is thy Croſs? upon which he thought he ſaw a viſible Croſs hanging in a thred, which with his hand he put behinde his neck. Thus he continued till the Evening, when many of the Quakers coming to him, ſaid, <hi>Be lowly minded, and hearken to the voice within thee;</hi> and ſo they left him, his ſtrength being almoſt quite ſpent with his reſtleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>His wife and family going to bed, he remained alone, when he began to queſtion whether theſe ſtrange actions were divine or diabolical: whereupon he trembled, and his hand was forced to take up a knife which lay by, and to point it to his throat; and the voice ſaid to him, <hi>Open a hole there, and I will give thee eternal life.</hi> But he threw away the knife, and his wife com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, at her perſwaſion, he went to bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the night after he aſſured himſelf, That he was poſſeſſed of the Devil; and in the Morning he roared and cried out: Now the Devil is gone out of me; at which inſtant, he and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily <hi>heard it thunder,</hi> though no others heard it.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after the Devil came to him again, and told him, That it was Satan that had poſſeſſed and ſeduced him hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but <hi>now Chriſt was come,</hi> and had caſt out Satan; and told him alſo, That what he had done the day before, was in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54713:48"/>
unto Satan; and that as he had ſerved Satan the day before in his cloaths, ſo now this day, he muſt undo all that he had done <hi>in his ſhirt, in obedience to Chriſt;</hi> whereupon he roſe out of his bed, went into the Street in his ſhirt, but ſome ſtopped him; whereupon the Devil within, told him, That he muſt be carried into the houſe by four women, or elſe, That he ſhould for ever ſtand there like a Pillar of Salt, as <hi>Lots</hi> wife did. <hi>Then four women carried him into his bed;</hi> whereupon he told them, That the day before he had been doing the Devils work, but now he muſt do Chriſts work, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Then he fell to acting in his ſhirt upon the bed, as he had done the day before upon the floor, <hi>Playing topſie-turvey from one bed to another,</hi> the Devil biding him not to fear; for, ſaith he, I will give thee ſtrength. Then it told him, That the day before the Devil bad him bare his Croſs, but now <hi>Chriſt</hi> bad him lay it aſide, <hi>for Chriſt takes no pleaſure in Croſſes;</hi> nor will be worſhipped, as yeſterday he had done. It ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Yeſterday the Devil made thee lie all day long on the ground, but now I have provided a bed for thee; for my yoak is eaſie. He promiſed alſo to give him <hi>Bread of Life to eat, and Water of Life to drink;</hi> and that out of his Belly ſhould flow Rivers of Living waters. Then were his Teeth moved, as if he was eating, and <hi>he thought that he felt</hi> in his Belly a flowing up and down of waters. He was told alſo, That yeſterday the Devils Angels waited on him; but now Chriſts Angels ſhould guard him: Hereupon he ſaw <hi>two Butterflies</hi> in the Windows, and his hand was forced to take one of them, and to put it into his mouth, which he ſwallowed down; then he was moved to take the other, and put it to his Throat; and he was told, That it ſhould enter in there; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith the voice) <hi>nothing is impoſſible to him that believeth.</hi> Then he was forced to make circles on the bed; whereupon he began to ſuſpect, that he was acted by Satan; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in great fear cried out, Lord what wilt thou have me do? But the Devil anſwered, <hi>It is too late to cry unto God;</hi> for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is already paſſed againſt thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hereupon he lay down in deſpair; but preſently the Devil told him the third time, That it was a <hi>white Devil</hi> that deluded him this ſecond time; but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54713:49"/>
that <hi>now Chriſt was come indeed,</hi> and would caſt him out; and accordingly he thought the Devil was ejected: But then all his members fell on working, as if the pangs of death had been upon him, the voice telling him, That they were the <hi>pangs of the New birth;</hi> and that now Chriſt was new born in him. Thus he continued a whole day, and the Devil told him, That now <hi>he ſhould work wonders, and caſt out devils</hi> in Chriſts name. Then came in two of the Quakers, to whom he ſaid, I have two Devils caſt out of me; but now Chriſt is in me of a truth. Then ſaid the Devil to him, I was crowned with a crown of thorns, but I will crown thee with a crown of glory; and bad him ſet his fiſt upon his head, Which (ſaith he) to the ſtanders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſhall appear as a glorious crown When he did this, he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, what they ſaw; they anſwered, nothing: Whereupon the Devil told him, <hi>That they ſaw the Crown on his head, but were ſo ſtriken with admiration, that they could not expreſs what they ſaw.</hi> Then the Divell bad him tell one of the Quakers, That he had a Devil in him, but he ſhould caſt it out; and, that he ſhould quake and tremble, which accordingly he did: Then the Devil bad him to ſpeak to him to fall flat on the ground, which he did, and preſently roſe again; whereupon <hi>Gilpin</hi> asked him, Whether now the Devil was gone out of him? to which he anſwered, not; but the Devil told him, That he was now ejected, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A while after he began again to queſtion, Whether in all this he were not deluded by Satan, which made him fall into a great fear; and then the Devil told him, That all this while he had been ſerving him, and blaſpheming God; and that now it was too late to repent. Hereupon he fell into diſpair for a time, <hi>Thinking that every thing, which he either ſaw or heard, was the Devil,</hi> that came to fetch him away: Sometimes he thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he ſhould be taken away in a flame of fire; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, That the Earth would open, and ſwallow him. Yet at laſt it pleaſed God (as it ſeems) to give him repentance and peace in his Conſcience; whereupon he publiſhed a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of theſe things, <hi>to diſcover the danger of theſe ways;</hi> and to be for Caution to others, to take heed how they go out of Gods ways, and <hi>forſake his Ordinances;</hi> leaſt falling into the error of the wicked, they decline from their former ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54713:49"/>
and leaſt not receiving the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved, God gave them over to ſtrong deluſions to believe a lie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is atteſted under</hi> the hand of the Major of <hi>Kendal,</hi> the Miniſter, School-maſter, and ſome others.</p>
                  <p>And now Reader are not theſe Arguments of Diabolical Poſſeſſions; and in the laſt ſtory, was not the Devil many times devout, as it were, <hi>and ſeemingly-humble and religious:</hi> I wont enlarge. But remember, the Devil will adviſe to ſome good things, with a purpoſe to deceive. And there thou maiſt read our Quakers Mortification, and the end on't, <hi>ſc.</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow Religion.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee on whoſe errand theſe men come, and whoſe work they do; either <hi>their own, the Popes,</hi> or the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> or all three. But ſure not from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being his, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for matter, nor manner; and they having no call, either <hi>ordinary,</hi> or <hi>extraordinary:</hi> For beſides the no-ſatisfaction given to us by them, before the Magiſtrates in this particular (which they all atteſt) a Merchant of this City upon the Road diſcourſing with one of them, and demanding of him what miracles they wrought to juſtifie their extraordinary call; he anſwered, <hi>We do work miracles, but thou haſt no eyes to ſee them</hi> Much after the conceit of a dame of this Town (now of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the gang) who ſome few years ſince, having ſome conference with one, once a Miniſter in this City, from whom I received it. She affirmed ſhe was God. Why then, ſaid he, you can do all that God can do: I can ſaid ſhe. And there lying upon his Table a Greek Teſtament; why then, ſaid he, make me ſuch another Book as this is. To which ſhe replied, <hi>It is done.</hi> Let me ſee it then ſaid he, where is it? <hi>In my fancy,</hi> ſaid ſhe. And indeed this is a ſhort Summary of all their Religion; it is all in their <hi>fancy,</hi> and <hi>no where elſe.</hi> I thought to have ſet forth the effects of their doctrines (for their fruits diſcover them, and will do more and more) As breaking the bonds of duty in all relations, which we evidently finde here already, Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Subjects, Miniſters and People. I need not inſtance, it is ſo evident; though I bleſs the Lord, I finde it not in my
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54713:50"/>
                     <hi>Family,</hi> nor <hi>Congregation:</hi> And I look upon it as a ſingular mercy.</p>
                  <p>There are one or two things which ſeem to take much with people, <hi>ſc.</hi> The <hi>multitude</hi> of followers; and the effect of their teaching; in prevailing with people to lay aſide pride, and worldly contentments. I will ſay little to the firſt; not much to either.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt: <hi>Novelliſm</hi> is the reigning ſin of this age; the multitude are as unſtable as water; they are led by opinion; <hi>run for company;</hi> and are ſufficiently ignorant. And for thoſe few, who ſeem to know more then others, and pretended to Religion: They are for the moſt part (if not all) very <hi>fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and withal proud of their knowledge, and <hi>ſelf-conceited.</hi> And ſtepping beyond their line and call, to teach others; by degrees have come to ſcorn to be taught <hi>by others:</hi> And at length (as error is fertile) they have come to ſlight all outward Ordinances, as too groſs and carnal for their more refined ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Which hath been nurſt and cheriſhed by ſome <hi>flattering Teachers,</hi> which they heap up unto themſelves, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; All others being an abomination to them.</p>
                  <p>And now if ſuch as theſe be given up of God to deluſions to believe lies, Is it a wonder? I conclude this, <hi>Multitude of followers is no Argument of truth.</hi> If ſo, Antichriſt were the beſt Chriſtian; and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Epiſt, 2 Chapter at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, tells us, We muſt look for many Seducers, and many followers.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſecond, <hi>Laying aſide pride, and worldly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Laying aſide Apparel, is not always laying aſide pride; nay, may not the putting off Apparel, be the putting on of pride? What elſe prompted the Phariſees to disfigure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to look ugly? But that they might appear to men to be religious; that they might ſee, they faſted and exerciſed acts of Mortification. Was not this pride?</p>
                  <p>I could enlarge here; but I will not; becauſe I fear too large already. <hi>But may not an unknown Devil go forth to make way for more?</hi> What may the meaning be of that, <hi>Luke</hi> 11: 24, 25, 26. Of an unclean ſpirit going out of a man, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again, findes his houſe ſwept and garniſhed; and then goes and takes ſeven Devils worſe then himſelf, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54713:50"/>
in and dwell there; <hi>And ſo the mans end is worſe then the beginning.</hi> Worſe then when that unclean Devil was in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cannot the Devil change ſides and ſhapes, and gain by it? What think you of the mortifications, pennances, whippings, faſtings, pilgrimages, &amp;c. of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is not (think you) the Devil well pleaſed with it? Doth not he farther it all he can, to confirm <hi>them</hi> in their Superſtitions and Idolatries: and to <hi>draw</hi> others to their perſwaſions? It is but one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil giving way to another (or more) to advance their maſters ſervice; and if there be not ſeven Devils in theſe mens hearts worſe then that one Devil upon their backs, Let all men judge, by what I have diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If ever men were poſſeſſed with</hi> ſpirits of lying, railing, proud cenſuring, blaſpheming, diſſembling, equivocating, preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricating, forging, and falſifying the writings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both of God and men; <hi>Theſe men are.</hi>

They make no Conſcience of raiſing falſe reports, againſt thoſe eſpecially who do any way oppoſe them: Witneſs that lying Pamphlet of <hi>Sauls</hi> errand to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> wherein there <hi>are a hundred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, as may be proved by a hundred witneſſes.</hi> It is, ſaith he, the Teſtimony of a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt concerning them.

When ſome that have been in ſome meaſure able, from the Word of Truth, to manifeſt their errors, have diſcourſed with thoſe Wells without Water: Though themſelves have ſtood like men inwardly convicted and aſhamed, utterly unable to gainſay, and ſometimes totally ſilenced, and as mute as fiſhes. Yet when theſe Champions of Errors have gone away, they have boaſted of their conqueſts, and how gloriouſly they had foiled, and ſtopt the mouthes of their adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>Thus, ſaith he, wholly by lies, lying Doctrines, lying Revelations, lying Wonders, lying Reports, they do endeavor to build up the Kingdom of the <hi>father of lies</hi> amongſt us. And for a cloſe of all (and for a further manifeſtation of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, juglings, and prevarications of theſe men) I propoſe to be conſidered by any rational man or woman in the world; and let them ſatisfie me, or themſelves, in their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, What may the meaning of that expreſſion of theirs, ſo often uttered among their Proſelytes, and ſometimes in the hearing of others, be, <hi>That they have ſomething to deliver to the world, which it is not yet fit to receive?</hi> I do not remember whether I have propoſed this already: But if I have, it is worthy again to be remembred and conſidered.

WHether have you that light, that lighteth every one that comes into the world, which is the light of Chriſt, yea or no? And if ſo, then why do you deny and ſay, he hath not enlightened every one, which light doth teach and guide all that love it, to God; and condemns them that diſobey it, as Chriſt ſaith who is the light?</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Whether they be not Antichriſts that acts thoſe things now which Chriſt Jeſus forbad? then ſeeing Chriſt forbad ſuch things then as you uphold now, did he deny them then, and juſtifie them now, or did he cry wo againſt them then, and juſtifies now? As have the chiefeſt places in the Aſſemblies, as you have inward and outward, who ſits high in your imaginations and thoughts, and are called of men Maſters?</p>
