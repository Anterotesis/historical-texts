            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Peece, before it peep'd into the world, it
being to appear in a Country, where the
cold air of mens affections nips such

what his own Country produces, do extort a larger Preface
then was really intended. Although then, it is not ordinar
to apologize for Playes in general, at the publishing of
any particular one; Yet, because this now appears as a City-swaggarer

been extant; and that the peevish prejudice of some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and plague all the youth accordingly, is such, that they
cannot have patience to hear of a Comedy, because they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see one acted: For these reasons, you may consider
Playes in their antiquity, use and dignity, and then, <hi>inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuè

among the Grecians since the first Olymp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

two thousand years ago; from whom they were transferred
to the Romans, by them had in such high veneration, that
the greatest Emperors and Princes amongst them, as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Cesar</hi> and others, upon the festival dayes, have made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
of their gallantry by acting: and it is esteemed yet so
little derogatory from the quality of a Prince, (far lesse of
a Gentleman) to appear at sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mnities upon the Stage, that
it is laudably practised amongst our Christian Monarchs
to this day.</p>
            <p>The use which may be reaped of playes is so evident,
that unless a man mistrust his very senses, he cannot but
confesse, that to see, in a well acted Tragedy, the fatal
ends of such as commit notorious murders, rapins, and
other licentious vices represented, would terrifie any man
whatsoever from attempting the like. In a Comedy, where or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly
the paltry vices of the age, such as the Court va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and prodigality, the City covetousness, or the Country-simplicity,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are extraordinarly taxed, many are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from what formerly they hugg'd, seeing their darling
crimes exposed upon a publick Stage to the mockerie of the
world: and hence, he who is even but the least conversant
with the hatefull humours of both Sexes of our times, after
perusal, may guesse why this carries the Title of <hi>The Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi>
Besides, Playes incite the youth to imitate the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
actions of their Predecessors, as <hi>Alexander</hi> was
stirr'd up by representation of <hi>Achilles</hi> actions, <hi>Achilles</hi>
by those of <hi>Theseus,</hi> &amp;c. with several other examples,
whereof pregnant History can give an ample account. Nor
is the perfection in acting less beneficial to the Common-wealth:
For, we read how all the young Nobility of <hi>Greece</hi>
were train'd up in this no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Embassies, or such like imployments: and we see even in our

dayes, how all such as are educat in the Jesuit Schools, where no
less then amongst publick Actors the stage is dayly trod gain an
unspotted reputation of compleat Orators throughout all the
Christian world. And the defficiency (or rather wilfull
contempt of this education) is the reason why many of our
pretenders to wit, now a dayes forsooth, either whistle of a
tedious harrangue with no more motion then a sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue, or else
use such a canting constrained tone, with such ridiculous
grimassees, as they seem rather to imitate a Mountebanks
Zany, in his apish gestures, then to aspire to the title of
accomplished Orators. Wheras to deliver a speech natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the action may sute the words, and the words the
action; although dissonant to the pedantry of this age, who
vote down the use of Stage-playes (as they call them) for no
other reason, but because in them, such pilsring stinkards as
themselves, are often discovered in their own colours; so
ridiculous in their imperious behaviour, that none save them
selves (whose innate stupidity doth much excuse their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
cannot but see it and abhor it; although dissonant,
I say, to their humours, yet is, by the approbation of all the
intelligent world, the chiefest ingredient of an ingenuous
Orator.</p>
            <p>The dignity of Playes is such, as it hath been the study
of the greatest Monarchs who ever flourished, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the wit of their respective ages in such active per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
not only by their open countenance, but likewise
private favours bestowed on the managers of such exercises,
as many fair monumental Theaters built by the most eminent
persons of the world, in their very ruins, do yet eloquently
testifie.</p>
            <p>Nor doth there any thing appear in holy Writings to
impugn these assertions. For (which is remarkable) Playes
of all sorts, did never so much flourish throughout all the
<pb facs="tcp:52228:4"/>
Territories of the Roman Empire, as in the dayes of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour and his Apostles; yet we never read that He,
or any of them (otherwayes impartial reprovers of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
enormities, did ever, either directly, or indirectly
tax this innocent and usefull recreation: But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
inveighed against such hypocrits, as deluded the world
with a vain show of piety, such as are now our sneaking
detractors of the Stage, who, its probable) only hate Playes,
because such pleasant spectacles divert the current of our,
otherwayes melancholly imaginations, and hinder people from
dreaming on rebellion, which our late proceedings may at
large instruct: For no sooner had those hell-hounds, assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats
of our liberties, snatch'd the very reins of Government
into their hands, but as soon they thought it expedient to
vote down all Scenick Playes, so that they should suffer in
that same sentence with Monarchy; upon whom they have
such a dependance, that at the thrice auspicious restauration
of our Royal Soveraign, they were not only by him re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
but also more gloriously adorned with priviledges,
then formerly.</p>
            <p>The main intent of this ensuing Tragi-comedy, was to
smatter at a complement, for that noble <hi>Hero,</hi> whose merits
claim more at the hands of all <hi>Appollo's</hi> subjects, then the
stock of their inventions will ever be able to refound; who,
as he hath proved himself (since first he was entrusted) a
zealous propogator of the Royal Interest, so hath appear'd a
very noble Patron to all true wit and gallantry whatsoever.
But least it should seem too serious for the pallats of those,
who expected nothing from the Stage but mirth: It was
thought fit to interlude it with a comick transaction. So that
being tyed to two different plots, without the speciall concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of a certain ingenuous Gentleman, to whose industry
this Play owes much of its perfection, it had been a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult

and he himself <hi>Chrysolina:</hi> for which <hi>Becabunga</hi> does sollicite
