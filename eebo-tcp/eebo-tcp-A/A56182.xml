            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Contra-Replicant, HIS COMPLAINT To His Maieſtie.</head>
            <p>A Petition for Peace is preſented to the Parliament by ſome thouſands of Citizens; the Petition findes a peaceable anſwer; and that Anſwer (as I ſhall now ſet forth) is oppoſed by an unpeaceable Reply, but that time may be the better husbanded, and indifferent Readers the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfied, before I undertake the Replication it ſelfe, I deſire all men to be preadvertiſed of ſome few things.</p>
            <p>Schollars have been very active in this unnaturall warre, both in rayſing and fomenting it; the tongue hath made ſome wounds as well as the hand; and the ſword had never been ſo keene, had it not been whetted by the Pen: but Schollars are not active on both ſides alike, (to ſhew their partiality, and intereſt in this cauſe) 'tis only on the Kings ſide, where the Pen and the Launce are both brandiſht in the ſame hand. And it is wiſely ordered, for the Kings Intereſt will be the more hopefully purſu'd when Schollars ſecond it with their Arts, and the Schollars Intereſts will be the eaſier gained, when the King ſeconds them with his Armes. But of all kindes of Learning Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is moſt relyed on: and of all kindes of Oratory, that is moſt made uſe of, which is moſt wantonly painted and dreſſed, and borrowes moſt from oſtentatious Art, and is therefore moſt unfit for buſineſſe, either of Law or State, becauſe it is moſt fit to inveagle, and deceive with its falſe graces and flouriſhes. The tongue of <hi>Cyneas</hi> was very advantageous to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing Townes and Cities, but 'tis likely more of manly Logick then of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54537:2"/>
Rhetorick flow'd from that tongue of his, or elſe Townes and Cities in thoſe dayes were governed by very illitera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e men. None but the duller ſort of people are to be catcht by pure Oratory, the wiſer ſort are well enough inſtructed, that when the Fowlers pipe playes moſt melodiouſly, the ſnare is coucht moſt pernitiouſly. That man is very unworthy to judge of Papers that cannot diſtinguiſh betweene foundations and ſuperſtructions, reaſons and Aſſumptions; that cannot diſcerne betweene prooving of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and purſuing of concluſions: and yet the chiefeſt fraud of the Orator is to paſſe over that part of the buſineſſe which requires moſt proofe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofe at all, and that which is moſt darke without light at all, and that which is moſt important without mention at all. 'Tis enough for the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to blazon the bloudy ſhield of warre in generall, when 'tis his ſole charge to diſpute who are the guilty cauſers and promoters of this particular warre: 'Tis enough for him to take it for granted, or at moſt upon his owne credit to affirme it, <hi>That the Kings party of Papiſts and Arminian Clergy men and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents were firſt aſſayled by this Parliament, without cauſe or danger;</hi> and ſo <hi>per ſaltum</hi> to proceed to venemous invectives, and curſed cenſures againſt the Parliament: when his maine taske is to proove either that a Parliament may in no caſe whatſoever defend it ſelfe, or that this warre in the Parliament is not defenſive. If wee peruſe all the papers which have come out in the Kings behalfe, under his name, or otherwiſe; we ſhall find nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be inſiſted on, but theſe two points, <hi>That defenſive warre is unlawfull in Parliaments, or that this warre in the Parliament is not defenſive;</hi> and yet nothing leſſe hath been inſiſted on; nay though the Fabricke bee vaſt that is built and raiſed thereupon, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that which ought to ſupport all the fabrick is utterly neglected; ſo in this reply (now to be examined) if much be affirmed, yet little is prooved, and if any proofe be made 'tis of ſequels, not of premiſſes; 'tis of aſſumptions deduced, not of <hi>Theſes</hi> deducing: and 'tis plaine and obvious to all that the <hi>Replicant</hi> here pleads not as if he ſtood at the barre, but pronounces ſentence, as if he ſate on the Bench: We may juſtly therefore ſuſpect that he aymes not at the ſatisfying of wiſe men, but the dazelling of ſimple men, and that he would not daube with his ſucuſſes every line, and embelliſh with his Careſſing Phraſes every ſentence, if he did not affect the pompe of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Rhombus</hi> the Pedant, rather then the graviti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of a Statiſt. The next Art of our <hi>Replicant</hi> is to impoſe thoſe his nude averments, which are moſt falſe and improbable, with moſt boldneſſe and aſſurance, aſſailing as it were thereby the beliefe of other men with armed violence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it may paſſe for currant that <hi>Farnham Caſtle was ſurprized contrary to the faith, and Treaty of Sir William Waller</hi> (with whom no Treaty was ever entertained, nor ſpoken of,) it muſt be further averred, <hi>That our ſide was falſe at Winchester, falſe in Yorkſhire, falſe every where;</hi> but theſe things

                  </gap>adem facilitate negantur, quâ affirmantur.</hi> Another advantage of the Kings party is by multitude of writings, invective and Satyricall: both the Univerſities are become mints of defamatory diſgracefull papers, the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Kings Pen-and-Inkhorne men, are more and fuller then of his ſword-men; and though too many papers are ſcattered of both ſides, yet thoſe of the Kings are moſt of them ſerious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and done by able men, whereas thoſe of the Parliaments ſide for the moſt part are ridiculous done by Sots, or prevaricators to the diſadvantage of the partie. After theſe premonitions I come to the Replication it ſelfe. The ſubſtance of the Petition was <hi>That the Parliament would tender ſuch Propoſitions for Accommodation, as might be accepted with honour to his Maiesty, and ſafety to the Kingdome.</hi> The ſubſtance of the Anſwer was that the Parliament was truly and heartily deſirous of a ſafe and honourable Accommodation, and for an inſtance of that their deſire would ſeeke nothing from the King, but to enjoy the due eſſentiall Priviledges of his higheſt Court of Law and policie, which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge muſt needs qualifie and fit them rather to judge, then to be judged by any other inferiour partie. That a totall ſubmiſſion to the King, he being ſo farre addicted to a faction of <hi>Papists</hi> and haters of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> could neither be ſafe nor honourable. That to ſubmit to the Kings party were to ſubmit to the foes of Religion and Libertie: foes irreconcileable, and ſuch as ever had been dangerous, and were now made more furious by bloud againſt the Parliament. That if the Petitioners being but a part of <hi>London,</hi> and that but a part of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould in ſtead of an honourable ſafe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation preſſe the Parliament to a diſhonourable unſafe ſubmiſſion to the Kings party, it were a breach of publike truſt in the Parliament to yeeld therein, the Parliament being truſted by the whole Kingdome, that if a juſt fit Accommodation be intended the King ought to truſt the Parliament in part, as well as the Parliament ought in part to truſt the King. That both parties being equally diſarmed, the Proteſtants being leſſe countenanced by the King, and more obliged in Conſcience by oathes and agreements, would be more obnoxious to diſadvantages, then that party wherein ſo many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are predominant. That though the Parliament might ſubmit, yet a faire Accommodation it could not obtaine, except the King would equally condeſcend thereunto. That if the Petitioners had found out a more ſafe and honourable Accommodation then the Parliament had yet diſcovered; (for that was poſſible) the Parliament would embrace it; That if none ſuch could be found out, the affections and Judgements of the Parliament ought not to becenſur'd or diſtruſted. That it behooved the Petitioners to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe themſelves by the like petition to the King, if no want of affection to peace were apparent in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as certainly none was.</p>
            <p>In contradiction and oppoſition to all the ſeverall poynts in this A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

what the <hi>Replicant</hi> hath ſet forth, wee ſhall now ſee in the ſame order.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>great contrivers of our ſad diviſions, which abuſe the weake rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the people, to keepe up an unfortunate miſunderstanding between King and Subject</hi> are not named by the <hi>Replicant;</hi> but they are clearely pointed out <hi>to be the Chiefe Lords and Commons in Parliament:</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>Every new Vote of late hath been a new affliction:</hi> and <hi>he makes Pennington and the Citty Lecturers to be but Iourney-men Rebels under them:</hi> and even this Helliſh ſlander he venteth <hi>under the name of the Petitioners, whom he ſtiles the moſt conſiderable perſons of the Citty:</hi> and at the ſame time affirmeth, <hi>that the people generally are of honeſt affections. And the Anſwer to the Petition in which, the words</hi> (he ſaies) <hi>are ſofter then oyle, though the matter of it be poiſon of Aspes, he attributes only to ſome Chiefe Engineers of miſchiefe in the Houſe, though it carry in it the Authority of the whole Houſe.</hi> Here is a wonder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all wonders. A few factious perſons in Parliament over-awe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, better and wiſer part in Parliament; and by a few factious Inſtruments in Citty and Countrey abuſe the major, better and wiſer part there alſo into the moſt miſerable diſtempers and calamities that ever were; and though the honeſt generality begin to grow wiſer and are inſtructed by the ſence of their miſeries, and by other advertiſements from loyall Papiſts and Prelates, and other pious Courtiers and ſouldiers to ſhake off their few Tormentors: Nay, and though the King himſelf has not onely publiſht the moſt eloquent and ſubtill Declarations to diſabuſe the people, that ever were (himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt beloved and honoured Prince that ever was for his indulgence to Liberty and Religion) but ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

'Twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beleev'd before that any but God could work contrary to nature, but now it muſt be beleeved. But is it ſo apparent that the Parliament is averſe from peace? yet ſaies the <hi>Replicant, For withdraw the fuell, and the fire is ſoon extinguiſht: Let the Parliament not foment the ill humour (by ſupplyes of men, Armes and Ammunition) and the wound will heale of it ſelfe.</hi> In the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, nothing but an Accommodation, ſafe and honourable was pretended, but now we ſee a meere ſubmiſſion is intended in this replication.</p>
            <p>Tis not prooved: That the Armes of the Parliament are unjuſt; 'tis not prooved, that it may be ſafe for the Kingdome to proſtrate, and ſubject Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Can the Parliament expreſſe zeale to peace better then by contracting all its rights and priviledges into one compendious propoſition, for the ſetling of union? To purchaſe true peace, the Parliament deſires nothing but to retain the meere being of a Parliament; that is, to be the ſupreme Court of King and Kingdome.

But what ſpeake we of Common Lawes, when even at this inſtant ſuch a free ſubjects houſe is burnt and plundered by the Kings party, in deriſion and deſpight of the Kings owne Proclamation and particular <hi>Placard</hi> granted for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of himſelfe and his family? As our Judges preyed upon us heretofore in matters of State, and Divines oppreſſed us in matters of Religion: ſo our Martialiſts now have a power of ſpoyling above the generall Law, or any particular protection. If the King thinke fit to grant ſafety to ſuch a perſon, or ſuch a Towne, it muſt be provided alwayes that ſuch a Dutch or Scotch Commander, who conceives himſelfe more skilfull in war then the King give his approbation withall; for my part I conceive it more honourable for the King to ſay that he cannot, then that he would not ſave his people from all thoſe curſed indignities and cruelties which have been multiplyed upon us during this warre, and before, by his adherents. As for Lawes therefore we muſt take notice that they may be imployed either to the benefit or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice

The ſecond is in declaring and interpreting Lawes. And the third is in executing and preſerving Lawes in force. Where the King is ſole Law-maker all things are ſubject to his meer diſcretion, and a greater bondage then this never was nor can be; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lie not under ſuch baſe ſervitude, their King claimes but a part in the Leg<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power: and yet nevertheleſſe of late by diſcontinuing of Writs for the ſummoning of Parliaments, and by the right of a Negative voyce in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and an untimely diſſolving of Parliaments, the peoples intereſt in this Legiſlative power has been much abridged and ſuſpended. In the like manner alſo if the ſole power of declaring Lawes were ſo in the King as that he might himſelfe give Judgement, or create Judges at his pleaſure without impoſing Oathes of truſt on them in behalfe of the people, or ſhould deny redreſſes upon Appeales from them, our Legiſlative power would be vaine and uneffectuall to us. For my part I hold it an equall thing, whither juſt men make Lawes and unjuſt interpret them, or unjuſt men make Lawes and juſt interpret them. When it was juſt in the King of late to impoſe what taxes hee pleaſed, and as often as he pleaſed upon us for the preparing of <hi>Armadoes</hi> all over <hi>England.</hi> Our Nation was fallen into a moſt deſperate thraldome, yet the fault was not then in the Lawes, but in the Judges, and ſuch as had a power over the Judges, Lawes as they are deafe, and by a ſtrict inflexibility more righteous then living Judges, ſo they are dumb alſo, and by their want of Language more imperfect then the breſts of men. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſince the Lawes of God and Nature, though knowne to all, yet do not utter to all the ſame ſenſe, but remaine in many plaine points ſtrangely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, as to their intent and meaning; how can we hope that any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes ſhould ſatisfie all mens underſtanding in abſtruſe points, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome living Key to open them? the vaſt Pandects and digeſts of the Law ſufficiently teſtifie, that in the cleareſt Law, which mankind could ever yet diſcover there are dark and endleſſe Labyrinths, wherein the weaker ſort of lay men are preſently loſt, &amp; the learnedſt advocates are tediouſly perplext.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place alſo if the ſole power of inforcing and executing Lawes were ſo veſted in the King, as that he might uſe it to the ceſſation or perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all juſtice, and the people were in ſuch caſe remedileſſe, the intereſt in making and declaring of Law were invalid, and fruſtrate in the people, and the King might ſtill inſlave or deſtroy them at his pleaſure. The <hi>Replicant</hi> ſayes, <hi>That under a Monarchy much muſt be truſted to the King, or elſe it will be debaſed into Democracie.</hi> Tis confeſſed much muſt, but all muſt not be truſted: the queſtion then is, how farre this <hi>much</hi> extends in a Monarchy of ſuch a mixt nature as ours is, in ſuch times as ours now are?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54537:4"/>In abſolute Monarchies all is truſted to the King: in abſolute Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies all is veſted in the people: in a mixt Monarchy more is truſted to the King, then is reſerved to the people; and in a mixt Democracie more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the people, then is derived to the Prince. In all formes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the people paſſes by way of truſt, all that power which it retaines not, and the difference of formes is only in degree, and the degrees are almoſt as various as the ſeverall ſtates of the world are, nay the ſame ſtate admits of often changes many times, ſometimes the people gaines, and ſometimes looſes, ſometimes to its prejudice, ſometimes not; and ſometimes injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſometimes not; but the degrees of ordinary power conſiſt in the making, declaring and inforcing Law, except when forraigne warre is, and then it is expedient that a greater and more extraordinary truſt be repoſed in one, and this we ſee in <hi>Holland,</hi> the moſt exact Republicke, and in <hi>England</hi> the moſt exact Monarchy in the world. But it is a leud conceit of our Royaliſts now<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>adayes to attribute to our King an abſolute power over the <hi>Militia</hi> of this Land at all times alike, not diſtinguiſhing between Civill warres, wherein he may be a party, and ſuſpected; and between a forraigne warre, where he is neither a party nor ſuſpected: for if our Kings will plead ſuch a truſt to our diſadvantage, 'tis juſt that they produce ſome proofe for it, and relye not upon meere Common uſe, 'tis true in caſe of Forraigne invaſion, 'tis expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that the King be farre truſted, and yet even ſo, if the King ſhould conſpire with forraigne forces, or neglect to protect us againſt them, contrary to the intent of his truſt, we might reſume the common native <hi>Poſſe,</hi> or <hi>Militia</hi> of the Land, for our owne defence without his conſent. And much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable is it in time of Peace, or Civill warre, if the King will deny his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, or withdraw his preſence, to obſtruct Law, or will by his Negative voyce, or by force ſeeke to diſable his higheſt Courts and Councels, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all to arbitrary government: more reaſonable is it, that the people ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to themſelves the Law, their chiefeſt portion and beſt patrimony. For as the King cannot by Law deny to the people their undoubted intereſt in paſſing of Lawes; ſo neither can he defeat the ſame intereſt, or deſtroy the benefit thereof by miſinterpretations, or by miſ-executions of the ſame Lawes. No Nation can injoy any freedome but by the right and ſhare which it has in the Lawes, and if that right and ſhare doe not extend to the preſervation of Lawes in their true vigour and meaning, as well as to the Creation of them, 'tis emptie and defeaſible at the Kings meere pleaſure, <hi>Much is to be truſted to the King:</hi> true, but all is not (we ſee) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>3. As for the diametricall oppoſition in Religion and State betwixt us and our irreconciliable enemies of the Kings party. The Replicant maintaines divers things: and of the Papiſts and Delinquents he ſayes, <hi>That we have nothing againſt them, but State Calumnies: That the ſame juſtice may governe both, if wee will ſubmit to Law. He beſeeches us to tell what Religion we would have: if that which the Martyrs ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with their blood, our Adverſaries practiſe it, and deſire ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon all ſuch as tranſgreſſe it: he imputes to us a new Creed: he ſayes the King is to look upon friends or enemies in a Law notion only, that Subjects muſt not give Lawes to Princes courteſies: That our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if they be Traytors, are to be tried at the Kings Bench, the houſe of Commons having no right of Judicature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The major part of our enemies are certainly either Papiſts, or elſe ſuch as are either over-awed or outwitted by Papiſts. Tis true, ſome part of our enemies knowes the truth of the Proteſtant Religion, and the deſperate antipathy of Papiſtry; yet having in them the true pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of no Religion, but ſerving Mammon only, for their worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts ſake, (with which ſeverity of Parliaments will not ſquare) they adhere to Papiſts, little regarding what Religion ſtands, or what falls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Another part out of meere ignorance is carried away with the name King, and the Profeſſions of the King, not at all looking into reaſon of State, nor being able to judge of the ſame: but the laſt ſort of men are not ſo conſiderable, either for their number, or power, or malice; and therefore I ſhall not inſiſt upon them.</p>
            <p>The maine Engineers in this Civill Warre are Papiſts, the moſt poyſonous, ſerpentine, Ieſuited Papiſts of the world. All the Papiſts in <hi>Europe</hi> either pray for the proſperity of this deſigne, or have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſome other influence and aſſiſtance to it. This warre was not the production of theſe two laſt yeares, nor was <hi>England</hi> alone the field wherein the Dragons teeth were ſowd. <hi>Scotland</hi> was firſt attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the Proteſtant party there was too ſtrong for the Papiſts, and ſuch of the Engliſh as joyned with them. The conſpiracies next broke out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Popiſh party being too ſtrong for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, the Tragedy has been beſeeming Papiſts, it has proved beyond all paralell bloody; and if ſhipping were not wanting, they might ſpare ſome aids for their fellow Conſpirators here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> is now in its agony, bleeding and ſweating under the ſad conflict of two parties, equally almoſt poized in force and courage.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54537:6"/>
The Papiſts themſelves in <hi>England</hi> amount not to the twentieth arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall part of Proteſtants, and yet one papiſt in geometricall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may ſtand againſt twenty Proteſtants, conſidering the papiſts with together with their adherents, and conſidering alſo what they are that act over them, and who they are that act under them. What power the Romiſh Vice-god has in the Queen is known, &amp; what power the Queen has in the King, and what power the King and Queen have in the prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Clergy, and the Clergy in them reciprocally, and what power the King, Queen and Clergy have on a great number of irreligious or luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm proteſtants (now made Delinquents and ſo further engaged) as alſo upon all papiſts, &amp; how all theſe have intereſts divided &amp; intwined &amp; how reſtleſly active they al are in purſuing their intereſts is not unkown.</p>
            <p>Beſides <hi>Ireland</hi> is a weakneſs, &amp; <hi>Scotland</hi> is no ſtrength to us: all popiſh countries <hi>France, &amp; Spain</hi> &amp;c. are likely to annoy us, and the proteſtants in <hi>Denmark, Holland</hi> &amp;c. have not power to reſtrain their Princes from combining further againſt us. In this deplorable condition we have no friends to complain to, and yet this Replicant tels us, <hi>we have no enemies to complain of;</hi> our very condoling againſt papiſts and delinquents, he tearms <hi>State calumnies, and ſlanders that have loſt their credit by time, and are confuted by experience.</hi> O thou black mouth, more black then thy coat, haſt thou no more remorſe for all that preteſtant blood, which delinquents have enabled papiſts to ſhed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant blood which armies of papiſts and delinquents are now ready to ſhed in <hi>England?</hi> if all this blood finde no pity in thee, yet is it an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to thee, that it extorts teares and lamentations from us? O thou unbowelled ſanguinary wretch, if God be the God of proteſtants, he will judge theſe cruelties of papiſts, and their abettors: and if he be the God of papiſts, we know our ſlanders and calumnies cannot deceive him; wee ſubmit our ſelves and our cauſe to his revenging hand. But thou wilt ſay, <hi>the Kings party in this warre are good Proteſtants, and we are Anabaptiſts, &amp;c.</hi> The tyranny and ſuperſtition of Biſhops has driven ſome of our tender and ſtricter proteſtants into utter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of Ceremonies, and that pompous, or rather ſuperſtitious forme of Church diſcipline which has beene hitherto uſed in <hi>England.</hi> Some of us deſire an alteration of ſome things in our Lyturgy, by advice of a learned and uncorrupt Synod: others perhaps ſcruple Church muſick, and any ſet forme of divine ſervice, to be impoſed of neceſſity, liking better the ſingle order of <hi>Scotland.</hi> What new Creed is there in all this, or what change of Religion were this, if there were any great numbers of men ſo opinionated? But it is well enough knowne to

our Adverſaries, that there is not one man of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that is violent againſt all publick ſet formes of prayer, or that forme which is now in uſe, or that deſires any alteration of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in Eſſentialls, nay, nor of Diſcipline, except in things very few and inconſiderable. And it is well knowne that the Parliament, as it would looſen the rigour of Law in ſome ſcruples for the eaſe of tender conſciences, ſo it abhors utterly all licentious government in the Church, and all by-wayes of confuſion. In the City the King has inſtanced in <hi>Pennington, Ven, Foulk,</hi> and <hi>Mannering,</hi> as notoriouſly guilty of Schiſme, and doubtleſſe they were named for want of worſe: try theſe men now by the old Creed, or by the nine and thirty Articles; nay, examine them concerning the Common prayer Book, and it will ſoon appeare how farre they are ſtrayed into Browniſme, or any other Schiſme: it will appeare how they are wounded in ſchiſmatick, and all proteſtants in them, and the true Religion in us all: it may be they have not put pluralities, or the Parliamentary Votes of Biſhops into their Creed; it may be they have reſerved no implicite faith for Convocation acts, and Canons, which the Replicant may perhaps judge very irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; but they hope this never had any anathema pronounced againſt it in the old Church by any Councell before Antichriſts dayes. Let not railing paſſe for impleading and condemning, and we will all be tried in the ſame manner, and if any new Creed be found amongſt us, differing in ſubſtance from the old, let our adverſaries themſelves give and execute ſentence upon us. If Browniſts could be as well diſtinguiſht and nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in our Army, as papiſts are in the Kings, or were really as many and as far countenanced, we would diſtruſt our cauſe; whereas we now beg no otherwiſe the bleſſing of God upon our Armies, then as we are enemies both to Popery and Browniſm. Dares our Replicant make ſuch a prayer? no, ſomtimes <hi>he owns Papiſts,</hi> and ſomtimes he ſeemingly <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owne them:</hi> ſpeaking of the Kings party, once he ſaies, <hi>As for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht religion we will become ſuiters to you, that you will ſeverely puniſh all perſons whatſoever that tranſgreſs againſt it.</hi> Papiſts certainly have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt againſt our religion; if the rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> be a tranſgreſſion, or if the inſtant taking up of arms here againſt the parliament be a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; yet ſee at the ſame time, when they call us to puniſh the papiſts, they themſelves arm &amp; enable papiſts to puniſh, nay to deſtroy us, is this all the ingenuity we ſhall expect? well, to our law notion: it is argued in the next place, <hi>that a Papiſt fighting for the King, though in a notion of Theology, he may be accounted an enemy</hi> quatenus <hi>a Papiſt, yet in underſtanding of Law, hee was accounted the Kings friend, as to his fighting:</hi> Prieſt ſquires Doctrine juſt, <hi>hee that fights for the King,

For who can better expound what Kings and lawes are, and for what end they were both created, then that unqueſtionable power, which for its own advantage meerly gave crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them both?

            <p>The enemies of Parliaments ſeeing this not to be gain-ſaid, and ſeeing that it muſt needs follow, that that cauſe which firſt gave the being, and preſcribed the end of that being, muſt needs have moſt right and skill to limit, and direct the manner of that being: they ſeek to divide the coactive from the repreſentative body of the people: they ſeek to divide between the two houſes of Parliament: and theſe ſeek to divide between the head and the body of the Parliament.

            <p>Many men, eſpecially Lawyers, would fain have Law alone take place in all times, but for my part I think it equally deſtructive to renounce reaſon of State, and adhere to Law in times of great extremity, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Law, &amp; adhere to Policy in times of tranquillity.

               <hi>As for acts of grace and pardon.</hi> I ſhall not much quarrel thereabout, the Parliament can beſt adviſe the King how far it is fit to paſſe a Law of oblivion in theſe generall times of confuſion: And the Anſwerer of the <hi>London</hi> Petition affirmed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>othing, but that their adviſe therein was likely to be moſt wholſome, which can hardly be contradicted.</p>
            <p>And the Law is cleare enough that though the execution of Law be farre intruſted to the King, and there is a diſpenſing power in Him, ſo farre as he is ſuppoſed to be damn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

'Tis againſt his Oath, 'tis againſt publike Liberty to deny ſatisfaction by ſtopping execution.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>But London is the moſt conſiderable part of the Kingdome and the Petitioners the beſt part of London; and the moſt to bee valued in other parts, are inclined to the ſame requeſt for peace, therefore the Parliament ought to yeeld.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When our Adverſaries pleaſe, they can alledge numbers for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as if the Major part of the people were cordially on the Kings ſide: when they pleaſe they can give you reaſons why the major part of the people are inchanted, and therfore cannot be on the Kings ſide; yet we all know the major part cannot be both for and againſt the King at the ſame time in the ſame caſe. Beſides divide <hi>England</hi> into 3. parts, and we doe not allow <hi>London</hi> to be the major of thoſe three, and divide <hi>London</hi> into 3. parts, and the Petitioners cannot make it appear, that they are full one third part; this muſt be attributed to our Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants boldneſſe meerly. That which is manifeſt, is, that moſt of the faulty, and decayed Nobility, and Gentry, are of the Kings party, and ſo are the Lees of the people; but almoſt all of the Yeomenry (which is the moſt conſiderable ranke of any Nation) and a very choyſe part both of Nobility and Gentry at this time ſide againſt the King and the Papiſts: And it is impoſſible for any rationall man to imagine, that the King has not infinite advantages againſt the Parliament, if his cauſe be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally apprehended, as the more juſt: But ſenſe teaches us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that no King in the unjuſteſt cauſe that ever was, had a weaker party then this King, conſidering what cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

all places where they lye, with ſwords drawne over the Peſants: but curſed be that man for my part, that next after God, would not referre the arbitration of this difference to the publike vote of the people. And yet we know that there is a great deal of ſervilty in the people, and that for the moſt part, they looke no further then to preſent grievances; like <hi>Eſau</hi> in his Pottage bargain, chuſing rather to dy for ever of a Lethargy then to ſweat for a time under a Feaver.</p>
            <p>5. All Controverſies are determined either by the Dye of Force, and chance of War (for ſo Nations have ever cenſur'd that kind of tryall) or elſe they are concluded by Lawes juſtly interpreted, or elſe there is a middle way (which we call Accommodation) and that is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when to avoid the miſchiefe of the Sword, and the uncertaine intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of Judgement, both parties by mutuall agreement cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherſoever then the word <hi>Accommodation</hi> is preſſed, (as it is now with us in the <hi>London</hi> Petition, for the word Submiſſion is not at all uſed) 'tis moſt abſurd and contradictory to exclude a yeelding and compliance of both ſides.

            <p>6. The King requires to have preſerved to him for the future that compaſſe of Royall power which his Progenitors have been inveſted with, and without which he cannot give protection to his Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Parliament deſires to have preſerved to the Subject, peace, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and all thoſe priviledges which their Anceſtors have enjoyed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they cannot be a Nation, much leſſe a free Nation.

Charles <hi>will treat you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>did her Subjects: doe you right firſt to the King and the King will not faile to doe right to you.</hi> Here is now the maine Queſtion indeed, which rightly ſolved, would ſolve all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe deplorable miſeries, which have of late vexed and grieved our three Nations, have rather hapned from the Change of the People, or from the Change of the Prince.</p>
            <p>And moſt certaine it is future Ages will conceive no great doubt, or difficulty to be in this Queſtion: but now it is mortall to diſpute it: it is ſcarce lawfull to ſuppoſe any thing herein, Though <hi>ſupponere</hi> be not <hi>ponere</hi> but by way of ſuppoſition, I will only plead thus: if the three Nations have by I know not what fatall poſture, and Congreſſe of ſtars, or ſuperior Cauſes, declined from their allegiance, and degenerated into unnaturall obſtinacy, and turned recreant, and contrary to the ſweet <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> which was ever in their Anceſtors, they are bound to ſubmit to the King &amp; to put in him as full and abſolute a Truſt, as our Parents did in Queen <hi>Elizabeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but on the contrary, if miſcarriages in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the pernicious Counſells whereby our Princes have been guided, have overwhelmed us in theſe inundations of blood, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes; the Alteration, and Reformation, ought to begin firſt in the King, and He cannot expect that we ſhould truſt him ſo farre as we did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> untill we are aſſured as fully of his protection as we were of Queen <hi>Elizabeths;</hi> but ſuppoſe there have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aults on both ſides, can nothing but the ſword rectifie our faults? I never yet heard that any Prince was forced to a warre with any conſiderable part of his own Subjects, but that he had an unjuſt cauſe, or might have determined the ſtrife without bloud by ſome Politick Comply<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is not ſo common or probable in nature, for Nations cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly to rebell, as for Princes wickedly to oppreſſe: and when armes are taken up on both ſides, it is not ſo ſafe for Subjects to yeeld, as for Kings; nor can Subjects ſo eaſily reduce Kings to a peaceable agreement, and ceſſation of Armes, as Kings may Subjects for the ſparing of blood.

            <p>It will be replyed, not fancy, but ſenſe teaches this, that he that obeyes the Kings commands, and fights under the Kings Standart is more a friend than he that diſobeyes, and fight againſt the King: this is demonſtration, no error can be in it.</p>

Nay if any parts of the Kingdom have repined at the abuſe of this arbitrary power, and refuſed to pay ſubſidys aſſeſſed by the houſe of Commons, what Kings would ſuffer it? when was it not held a good ground of War? ſo both Houſes have an arbitrary power to abridge the freedom of the Subject, and to inlarge the Kings prerogative, beyond a meaſure; they may repeale our great Charter, the Charter of Forreſts, and the petition of right if they pleaſe, they may if they pleaſe ſubject the whole Kingdom for ever to the ſame arbitrary rule as <hi>France</hi> grones under, nay, &amp; they have often been with force and all manner of ſollicitations almoſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lented into it: and yet notwithſtanding all this, we are neither ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed nor indangered at all by this arbitrary power in both houſes.</p>
            <p>To have then an arbitrary power placed in the Peers and Comm. is naturall and expedient at all times, but the very uſe of this arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, according to reaſon of State, and warlick policy in times of generall dangers and diſtreſſe is abſolutely neceſſary and inevitable: but 'tis a great offence, <hi>that both Houſes ſhould make ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances generally binding.</hi>
