            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When this, I say, was our forlorn and desperate case, then almighty God out of his infinite goodness was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to look upon us (as he sometime did upon <hi>Jerusalem, lying polluted in her blood</hi>) with an eye of pity and mercy,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezik.</hi> 16.6.</note> so as graciously to design a redemption for us out of all that woful distress: And no sooner by his incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible wisdom did he fore-see we should lose our selves,<note place="margin">

            <p>But how could this happy design well be compassed? how, in consistence with the glory, with the justice, with the truth of God, could such enemies be reconciled, such offenders be pardoned, such wretches be saved? Would the omnipotent Majesty so affronted, design to treat with his rebels immediately, without an intercessour or advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate? Would the sovereign governour of the world suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thus notoriously his right to be violated, his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be slighted, his honour to be trampled on, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some notable vindication or satisfaction?

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.</note> that it should not in a sort eminently be accomplished? Would the most righteous and most holy God let slip an opportunity so advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for demonstrating his perfect love of innocence, and abhorrence of iniquity? Could we therefore well be cleared from our guilt without an expiation, or re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stated in freedom without a ransome, or exempted from condemnation without some punishment?</p>
            <p>No; God was so pleased to prosecute his designs of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and mercy; as thereby no wise to impair or obscure, but rather to advance and illustrate the glories of his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign dignity, of his severe justice, of his immaculate

holiness, of his unchangeable steddiness in word and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: He accordingly would be sued to for peace and mercy; nor would he grant them absolutely, without due compensations for the wrongs he had sustained; yet so, that his goodness did find us a mediatour, and furnish us with means to satisfie him: He would not condescend to a simple remission of our debts; yet so, that, saving his right and honour, he did stoop lower for an effectual abolition of them: He would make good his word not to let our trespasses go unpunished; yet so, that by our punishment we might receive advantage: He would manifest his detestation of wickedness in a way more ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ustrious, than if he had persecuted it down to Hell, and irreversibly doomed it to endless torment.</p>
            <p>But how might these things be effected? where was there a mediatour proper and worthy to intercede for us? Who could presume to sollicit and plead in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half? Who should dare to put himself between God and us, or offer to skreen mankind from the Divine wrath and vengeance? Who had so great an interest in the Court of Heaven, as to ingratiate such a brood of apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state enemies thereto? Who could assume the confidence to propose terms of reconciliation, or to agitate a new covenant, wherewith God might be satisfied, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might be saved? Where, in heaven or earth, could there be found a Priest sit to atone for sins so vastly nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, so extremely hoinous?

            <p>These are Questions which would puzzle all the wit of man, yea, would gravel all the wisdom of Angels to resolve; for plain it is, that no creature on earth;

            <p>It is well said by a Pagan Philosopher,<note place="margin">Nemo mihi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur pluris ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimare virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, nemo illi magis esse devotus, quàm qui boni viri famam perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, nè consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret. <hi>Sen.

Thus would our B.

            <p>And no wonder, that such a burthen, even the weight of all the sins (the numberless most heinous sins and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations) that ever were committed by mankind, by appropriation of them to himself, lying on his shoulders, he should feel it heavy, or seem to crouch and groan under it; that in the mystical Psalm,<note place="margin">

               <hi>they are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart faileth me.</hi> The sight of Gods indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation so dreadfully flaming out against sin, might well astonish and terrifie him: To stand, as it were, before the mouth of hell belching fire and brimstone in his face; to lye down in the hottest furnace of divine vengeance; to quench with his own heart-blood the wrath of heaven, and the infernal fire (as he did in regard to those who will not re-kindle them to themselves) might well in the heart of a man beget unconceivable and unexpressible pressures of affliction. When such a Father (so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good and kind to him, whom he so dearly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly loved) did hide his face from him, did frown on him, how could he otherwise than be mightily troubled? Is it strange that so hearty a love, so tender a pity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating our sinfulness, and experimenting our wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, should be deeply touched? To see, I say, so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to feel so thoroughly the horrible blindness, the folly, the infidelity, the imbecillity, the ingratitude, the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigibility; the strange perverseness, perfidiousness, malice, and cruelty of mankind in so many instances (in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Judas,</hi> in the denial of <hi>Peter,</hi> in the desertion of all the Apostles, in the spite and rage of the persecutors, in the falshood of the witnesses, in the abuses of the people, in the compliance of <hi>Pilate,</hi> in a general conspiracy of friends and foes to sin) all these surrounding him, all invading him, all discharging themselves upon him, would it not astone a

mind so pure, would it not wound a heart so tender, and full of charity?</p>
            <p>Surely, any of those persons, who fondly do pretend unto, or vainly do glory in a sullen apathy, or a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born contempt of the evils incident to our nature and state, would in such a case have been utterly dejected; The most resolved Philosopher would have been dashed into confusion at the sight, would have been crushed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to desperation under the sense of those evils which did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault Him.</p>
            <p>With the greatness of the causes, the goodness of his constitution did conspire to encrease his sufferings; for surely as his complexion was most pure and delicate, his spirit most vivid and apprehensive, his affections most pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and tractable; so accordingly would the impressions upon him be most sensible, and consequently the pains which he felt (in body or soul) most afflictive.</p>
            <p>That we in like cases are not alike moved, that we do not tremble at the apprehensions of Gods displeasure, that we are not affrighted with the sense of our sins, that we do not with sad horrour resent our danger and our misery, doth arise from that we have very glimmering and faint conceptions of those matters; or that they do not in so clear and lively a manner strike our fancy (not appearing in their true nature and proper shape, so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and so hideous as they really are, in themselves and in their consequences); or because we have but weak perswasions about them; or because we do but slightly consider them; or from that our hearts are very hard and callous, our affections very cold and dull, so that nothing of this nature (nothing beside gross material af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs) can mollifie or melt them; Or for that we have in us small love to God, and a slender regard to our own welfare; in fine, for that in spiritual matters we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so wise, so sober, so serious, nor so good or inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous in any reasonable measure, as we should be: But
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53986:12"/>
our Saviour in all those respects was otherwise disposed; He most evidently discerned the wrath of God, the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousness of sin, the wretchedness of man, most truly, most fully, most strongly represented to his mind; He most firmly believed, yea most certainly knew, whatever Gods law had declared about them; He did exactly consider and weigh them; His heart was most soft and sensible, his affections were most quick and excitable by their due objects; He was full of dutiful love to God, and most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently desirous of our good, bearing a more than frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good will towards us: whence 'tis not so marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that as a man, as a transcendently wise and good man, he was so vehemently affected by those occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that his imagination was so troubled, and his passions so stirred by them; so that he thence did suffer in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to a degree unconceivable; according to that ejaculation in the <hi>Greek</hi> Liturgies, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Its being very notorious, and lasting a competent time were good advantages; for if he had been privately made away, or suddenly dispatched, no such great notice would have been taken of it, nor would the matter of fact have been so fully proved, to the confirmation of our faith, and conviction of infidelity: Nor had that his excellent deportment under such bitter affliction (his most divine patience, meekness and charity) so illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously shone forth. Wherefore to prevent all exceptions, and excuses of unbelief (together with other collateral good purposes) divine providence did so manage the business, that as the course of his life, so also the manner of his death, should be most conspicuously remarkable:

acknowledgment and all the requital we were able? The case in regard to our Blessed Saviour is like in kind, but in degree whatever we can suppose doth infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall below the performances for us of him, who stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the top of heaven, who laid aside the Majesty and the felicitie of God for the infamies and the dolours of a cross, that he might redeem us from the torments of hell, and instate us in the joys of Paradise; so that our obligations of gratitude to him are unexpressibly great, and we cannot with any face deny our selves to be most basely unworthy, if the effects in our heart and life be not answerable.</p>
            <p>Nor should we forget, that also upon this account we do owe great love and thanks to God the Holy Ghost, who as he did originally conspire in the wonderful project of our redemption, as he did executively by miraculous operation conduct our Saviour into his fleshly taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,<note place="margin">
