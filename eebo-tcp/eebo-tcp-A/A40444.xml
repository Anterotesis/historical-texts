         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Dare not call you Adverſary, indeed, I rather believe we may be Friends; for tho' there may be a miſtake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, yet I hope we both agree in a ſincere love, and ſearch for Truth; and in what we differ therefore, I ſhall rather ſeek to melt you with gentleneſs, than to ſubdue you with oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Page 150. you tell us, <hi>When we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, you hope to hear from us again:</hi> and you ſee you have your deſire; you ſeem to have a ſincere good will to Truth your ſelf, and therefore you will be the leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to ſee it in others; for when you have given ſo <hi>bold</hi> a Challenge to all Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians, you muſt expect, that we have but little reſpect for the Honour, and Glory of God, if we do not anſwer you.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, I come to <hi>diſpute</hi> you, and am no Socinian, and as an Arrian my Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis diſtorts your Argument a little; but as we are both joyn'd in one Common Cauſe, and you <hi>attempt to deface</hi> the Truth of both, ſo you muſt think, we expect you provide your ſelf to give us both ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for tho' you conquer either of us, your Work's but half done.</p>
               <p>You muſt excuſe me therefore, if I mind
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55225:2"/>
not your Socinian Quarrels, but leaving them to themſelves, divert your Argument a little, and bring in a third Hypotheſis; you ſhall ſee I will deal fairly with you, ſtate the Matter truly, and proceed ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and clearly; whether you ſhall think your ſelf obliged to Reply to me, or not, upon it, is not my care, if I can but reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue the Honour of God, and his Unity by it, I am ſatisfied.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>METHOD.</head>
               <p>It cannot be expected therefore, but that I have alter'd your Method, but yet you ſhall ſee withal, that I have juſtly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all your ſcattered Reaſons together, and dealt faithfully with you; and tho' the change of the Hypotheſis neceſſitated this, yet in lieu of it, I ſhall preſent you with a Method both ſhorter and clearer, to recompence it.</p>
               <p>'Tis plain, large Volumes deſtroy the Edge of Reaſoning, and the Vigour of Sence is loſt in the multitude of Words; I have choſen therefore, rather to be ſhort and ſinewy, than tedious and looſe, if the Foundation Reaſoning be bad, Corollaries fall of courſe; and therefore my chief care ſhall be, whether your leading and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work Principles be ſtrong, and to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or not.</p>
               <p>I thank God, I do not ſee my Cauſe ſo weak, as to fly to Colours, or that I ſhould uſe undue Arts for a ſhelter; and therefore if I have omitted any thing material, I proteſt before the <hi>Almighty,</hi> it has not been wilful; and if I have any where reprov'd you, as <hi>God is my witneſs,</hi> 'thas been where Truth has neceſſitated and forc'd me; and if I have wrong'd you, I as heartily beg your Pardon.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, I have endeavour'd with the moſt ſerious Reſpect, and the greateſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity and Meekneſs, to ſhew you where you have err'd: Indeed, I have not ſpar'd to adviſe and reprove you where I ought; but if I have run that liberty into an extream, or been faulty in any thing, 'thas been my frailty, and not my guilt.</p>
               <p>All that I know farther to add in this place, is, That perhaps you may wonder how I came to anſwer you ſo ſoon; but not to offend you, Sir, the Reaſon is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, though Fallacies are difficult, and to be ſtudied, yet Truth is natural, and they are eaſily anſwer'd.</p>
            </div>

                  <head>1. Boaſting.</head>
                  <p>But before I proceed further, I ſee a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to adviſe you of two Faults, Boaſting and Uncharitableneſs; not that I can blame you over-much neither, nor may be acquit myſelf of their guilts, but I ſee a neceſſity to level theſe two Mountains in you, leaſt by the Ignorant, theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of Imagination may be taken for thoſe of Reality.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for Boaſting: In your Preface, Sir, you ſay, <hi>You have ſaid too much for us to anſwer:</hi> And it may be ſo; but if you have not, we ſhall ſeek for Truth, and not to compare our ſelves with you. So <hi>p.</hi> 69, you call <hi>our Reaſon Carnal:</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 73, you tell us, We <hi>puzzle and confound our ſelves with groſs and corporeal Idea's of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Subſtance:</hi> when indeed, if ſuch upbraiding Expreſſions were allowable, we might more juſtly reflect them upon the Eternal Generation you pretend to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So you conclude your Book,</hi> pag. <hi>271. you ſay,</hi> It looks like a Judgment upon us, that while we talk of nothing leſs than the ſevereſt Reaſon, we impoſe upon our ſelves, or hope to impoſe upon the World, by the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55225:2"/>
most childiſh Sophiſtry and Nonſence; <hi>and ſo</hi> pag. <hi>272, your laſt words are, You</hi> will not envy us the Satisfaction of ſuch Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, they being, <hi>you ſay,</hi> all the Comfort we have; but you are pretty confident we ſhall never le able to reaſon to any purpoſe in this Cauſe again. <hi>And what, Sir, is not this Inſolence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pray, Sir, what is it you mean by theſe Triumphs? Is it that you think to ſtorm and brave us out of our Cauſe; or that you are ſure you only are in the right? or that if you had the worſt Cauſe, you could defend it well? Sir, my Charity ſhall ſpeak the beſt for you, that you are ſure you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are in the right; but if you are, has not Modeſty more Charms to recommend you by, than Inſolence.—</p>
                  <p>Excuſe me, Sir, I diſlike not your Zeal in your Preface, to ſtick to your Faith, I rather wiſh it more common; for were it, Truth had ſcarce been ſuch a Stranger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; nor do I queſtion your Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in Charity I hope you are ſincere too; but theſe are Expreſſions that your Zeal has beguil'd you to, that want a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Modeſty, and tho' ſuch a Confidence with a little more Humanity, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Apoſtle, yet how well they do a meaner Chriſtian, I leave to your ſelf to judge, in cooler thoughts.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>2. Uncharitableneſs.</head>
                  <p>The ſecond thing I have to charge you with, is Uncharitableneſs, that becauſe we differ in Judgment from you, in this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, you not only treat us like Dogs, and deny us all hopes of Salvation, but withal you manage your Arguments for Truth accordingly, and give us not ſo much as free Reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus you not only abound with Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on us, as in your Preface you ſay of us, We</hi> are eminent for nothing but Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy and Nonſence: <hi>And</hi> pag. <hi>9. you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect,</hi> It becomes the Wit and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of an Heretick: <hi>But</hi> pag. <hi>24, you write more freely of us, and tell us, You</hi> hope the Diſputes of Hereticks against the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, ſhall not be be called Controverſies in the Churches of God.</p>
                  <p>Now, if thus in the very beginning of your Book, you ſhew we ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd before we are heard, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe does your Infallibility hold a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with us; but I hope this is before you are aware; indeed in a Papiſt theſe Expreſſions might be natural enough, but Proteſtants methinks ſhould be more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, than to take Errours and Hercſies for granted.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, Sir, Churches have err'd, and may err, yea, in Matters of Faith too; if ſo, who is to be blam'd, he that by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning ſeeks for Liberty, or he that unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with-holds it thro' Impoſition? Did we ſeek to impoſe our Hypotheſis's on the World, we were as much to be blam'd as you; but if we only ſet up ours, to confute the Uncharitableneſs of yours, wherein do we treſpaſs?</p>
                  <p>You ſay, we are Hereticks, and have no Underſtanding: And whence come you to judge thus freely of us, and not we of you: So you ſay, we blaſpheme; but pray is not your Charge precarious, and if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, falls it not as heavy on your ſelf? If <hi>we err,</hi> indeed, we blaſpheme the Son and Holy Ghoſt; which we hope we do not; but if you err, do not you both bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme and commit Idolatry, in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them as coequal to the Father?</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, we deſire to have a Charity for your Miſconſtructions, and will give it you where poſſible, if ſo pray at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn our love, you ſee we ſtoop to make the firſt offer; charge us not therefore, that we are only eminent for Blaſphemy and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55225:3"/>
Nonſence, for ſurely you may add in the other ſcale, that we have a courageable good will to Truth, are ſome of us perverſe, or do ſome of us revile; and what, are ſuch Men wanting quite on your ſide?</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>REFLECTIONS.</head>
               <p>If therefore you leave us but room to adviſe you, as much as the Great <hi>Moſes</hi> left <hi>Jethro,</hi> let us beg you for Chriſt's ſake to cut off all theſe Offences; remember 'tis not Generous, much leſs Chriſtianly, to diſcountenance a weaker Brother: But what? you believe not me; yet at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my Truths; for ſurely Chriſt's own Argument will hold you.</p>
               <p>Can you expect Peace in Chriſt's Church, whilſt you thus allarum and ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Mens Conſciences, by ſo great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Impoſitions; Or what, do you expect Men ſhould have no Conſcience or Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Truth? If you do not, do not fetter them thus; you know 'tis no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Errour to be ſingular; nay, I am ſure, you know very well, that Truth is rarely popular, but rather ſuppreſſed and ſtifled through Mens Luſts.</p>
               <p>Let us learn therefore, to let Natural Religion lead our Revelation, elſe the Curſe of the Holy Ghoſt will fall upon us, and tho' we have eyes we ſhall not be able to ſee, nor were we Turks ſhould we be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being converted; indeed, when we are bewitch'd to the fury of a prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd Zeal, will not all Men ſay, we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bafle, than love, or ſcearch for Truth when we argue?</p>
               <p>Excuſe me, Sir, that I am thus free with you, which I ſhould not have been, had it not been in Juſtice to my Cauſe; but I durſt not let theſe prepoſſeſſions enſnare my Reader, and yet not that I think ſo heinouſly of you for them neither, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have wrote much <hi>worſe</hi> then your ſelf on the Subject, have been more <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;</hi> and I could wiſh myſelf, as well as you, out of harms way of Error; indeed, could I have had a fair Hearing without, I had been very eaſily otherwiſe ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

                  <p>They believe, this Trin-unity even now continues to Rule the World by a Joynt Providence; but that for Orders-ſake, they have diſtributed their Dominions into ſeveral, and ſubordinate Perſonal Offices; thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they make the Father alone to perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the True God, the Son to become Incarnate, to redeem us to his Mercy, and the Holy Ghoſt under the Son, to aſſiſt us through Grace in his Trials.</p>

                  <p>They believe there is no co-equal Trinity to Rule the World through a Joint Providence; but that their Dominions are ſubordinate, and adequate to their Powers; thus that the Father alone is the True God, that the Son <hi>became Incarnate</hi> to <hi>ſatisfie God's Juſtice,</hi> to redeem his Creation, and to deſtroy the Devils Malice in <hi>Adam;</hi> that the Son has deputed the Holy Ghost, to aſſist us through his Grace in our Trials.</p>

               <head>PRINCIPLES.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Nothing is more manifeſt, than that the Jews in the Idea of their Firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conceiv'd but One Perſon to be in their One God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Could the Jews, or <hi>Judas</hi> have charg'd Chriſt, with pretending himſelf to be the Supream God, which the Goſpel tells us the Falſe Witneſſes principally la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd after, they would not only have made their Acclamation, <hi>We have no King but Caeſar;</hi> and their Inſcription on his Croſs, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews,</hi> John 19. but they would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, No God, no Falſe God, too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, 'Twas near 300 Years after Chriſt, e're Tradition and Scripture-Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation were ſo much as urg'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and bring forth a Trinity.</p>
               <p>My Reflections upon theſe Principles, ſhall be only Two, and they are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has alter'd the firſt and greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as it were, by chance; and whereas the Goodneſs of God in ſuch a Caſe, would certainly allow us a ſolemn Repeal; the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed is ſo far
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55225:4"/>
from ſuch Mercy, that it makes this very catch poenal of Salvation; and that very Trinity, that without doubt received their Honour jointly before, can now be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on no pretence, to receive it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than ſeverally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You ſee hereby, this Great Myſtery is not purpoſely requir'd, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally enforc'd; ſo that whether this inſcrutable Myſtery, and incomprehenſible Hypotheſis, be a Divine Truth or not, yet at leaſt this is plain, the means of knowing it are Humane, and conſequently the whole Myſtery itsſelf diſputable, and left to the Underſtanding of Man to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>Now, whether the little grounds Men pretend to for the ſupport of this Myſtery, be ſufficient or not, is what I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to diſprove, in anſwer to you, by this following Treatiſe: And for my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Method, I ſhall diſtribute my Subject into Three Parts; to wit, The Proof of the Trinity, from, 1. Reaſon. 2. Scripture. And 3. Tradition. And herein I ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue your Method, and begin with Reaſon firſt.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>REASON.</head>
               <p>KNow then Sir, to avoid all needleſs Arguments, I will grant you, that your Creed may in a Sence be rational, and very near agreeable to what you have wrote, in <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. thus I will agree with you, as you ingeniouſly alledge, <hi>pag.</hi> 49, and 68. <hi>That Three Perſons Self-conſcious and Immaterial, may in a ſence be called One:</hi> Nay, and not improperly give the firſt Commandment as One, as being inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly united in Will and Wiſdom; indeed, Sir, to do you right, what you have in this alledg'd, is the only thing that ever I ſaw like rational for the Trinity yet.</p>
               <p>But then, as you ſay your ſelf, <hi>As by Natural Religion there can be but One God, pag.</hi> 147. And <hi>tho' there be ſeveral Perſons, yet they cannot act apart, but always with One Energy,</hi> pag. 136. So your own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument deſtroys itſelf; for ſurely, where there are mean and under Offices between Perſons, the Energy is manifeſtly not One, nor the Act ſimple.</p>
               <p>Nor will your Arguments, <hi>pag.</hi> 118, help you, for 'tis manifeſt by the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt on Chriſt like a Dove, that the Three Divine Perſons act ſeparately, as well as think ſo; ſo that if your own Arguments be conſiſtent, <hi>pag.</hi> 124, and <hi>God be a pure and ſimple Act;</hi> as you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>pag.</hi> 129, and 167, <hi>And Alterity makes Duality;</hi> as you likewiſe affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 122, 'tis plain, theſe Three Perſons cannot make up ſuch a Deity as you would imagine; indeed they might be One in a Metaphor, and as in Scripture ſence, but to be really One is a Jeſt.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, 'tis their Self-conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which makes them One, and that you apprehend conſiſtent with this Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality: I anſwer, That is to run your ſelf into as great Abſurdities, to avoid the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; Is it rational Self-conſcious, and abſolute Coequals, ſhould take or impoſe ſervile and underling Offices of each other? Beſides, that the Son and Holy Ghoſt are conſcious to the Father, is abſolutely falſe, and groundleſs from Scripture, as I ſhall ſhew you in order.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Explication.</head>
                  <p>But I ſee, Sir, you are reſolv'd not to be at a loſs, you will rather have two Strings to your Bow, than fail of your Mark, and therefore now, we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55225:4"/>
our ſelves for St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Self-conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: And in this you ſay, The Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>are conſcious to each other, as our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Will, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding are, which know and feel whatever is in each other,</hi> v. pag. 50.</p>
                  <p>Alas, Sir, I wonder how that you who live in the fuller Rays of Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, can brook the comparing of Faculties to Perſons, or how you can repeat ſuch Inconſiſtencies as they produce, before you acknowledg'd each Perſon compleat, and rational; and now you make <hi>the Father impotent, and only a Speculation,</hi> pag. 132. <hi>and the reflex Wiſdom, or the Son of God, only powerful to act and create:</hi> And again, by another turn, <hi>pag.</hi> 169, you make <hi>him impotent too.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, Sir, I ſhall forbear to offend you, with all thoſe Comments I could make in this place, did I rather ſtudy Malice than Truth; but this you force me to declare, that if you take ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to prove your Myſtery, as to make Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Faculties, and Faculties Perſons, as you do, 'tis impoſſible that any Reaſoning ſhould hold you; For by the ſame liberty, what may you not ſay? And what, Sir, do theſe Wiles look as from God?</p>
                  <p>And that the Reader may ſee, you have not treated of theſe Faculty-Gods by chance, <hi>pag.</hi> 135, you <hi>attribute the Creation to them,</hi> pag. 182, 183, you make <hi>the Father to have no Mercy</hi> in himſelf; indeed, <hi>pag.</hi> 135, you would ſeem to palliate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by ſaying, <hi>The eſſential Character of the Holy Ghost, in the like caſe, is Love.</hi> But, Sir, a running Eye ſhews this to be all My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery indeed, and really ſuch an one as confounds Perſonality, Trinity, and Deity all at a ſtroke, <hi>v. pag.</hi> 130.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Sir, you make <hi>Love in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the Holy Ghoſt, a Perſon, and God, p.</hi> 133. And pray, Sir, why is not Hatred a Perſon in God, as well as Love? The Reaſon you give why Love is a Perſon, is becauſe there can be no Accident in God; and therefore even an Affection in him is real, and makes a Perſon: But what, Sir, may not this Reaſon ſerve for Hatred, and an hundred Affections more?</p>

                  <head>REFLECTIONS.</head>
                  <p>I ſhall add no more at preſent concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reaſon of the two Hypotheſis's, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will fall more naturally in our way, as we examine the Scriptures; and indeed, I have wrote nothing at all here of the Arrian Hypotheſis, becauſe the Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it is ſo obvious, that it were to fire Candles to enlighten the Day, to illuſtrate it.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave therefore to adviſe you, Sir, that for the future you be wary to reaſon more perfectly, or not at all; 'tis no light Truth that you have oppos'd; and I believe many a Reader would have had leſs Charity for what you have done, than I have; and may be would condemn you for beguiling with the appearance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; but I neither think ſo of you, nor believe otherwiſe, than that your Paternal Zeal has miſguided you.</p>
                  <p>As for the Contradictions of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I ſhall ſpeak of them in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place; in the mean time, I ſhall paſs on to Examine your Scripture-Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: And by this time, I hope you are convinc'd, that you have jump'd out of the Frying-pan into the Fire, and inſtead of helping out an Abſurdity by a Nicety, made it the more ſuſpicious by defending it with a Fallacy.</p>

               <head>Scripture Interpretation.</head>
               <p>BEfore I deſcend into Particulars, I ſhall write a little of the Interpretation of Scriptures in general; and methinks here it grieves me to ſee, how to make out this Myſtery, Men have not ſtopt at any Arts, to force and wreſt the Scriptures to this imaginary Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 153, you ſay, We ought not to force the Scriptures to preconceiv'd Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But what? is not this Myſtery ſuch? Surely, were a Pagan to read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the firſt Commandment would keep him ſo much as from ever dreaming of a Trinity; and I wonder really how it came into Mens Minds: I know the World would be apt enough to embrace it, when it once comes their, as their Superſtition has always enclin'd them to a Polytheiſm; but I ſhould have thought there had been a ſufficient Guard, againſt every colour of it in Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>But to maintain this Hypotheſis, now once up, let me beſeech you to conſider your own evaſive Conſtructions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; I am perſwaded, if you err, as I have ſaid, `tis becauſe you have continued in your firſt Faith with too little circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection; and that the Socinian Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis has not appear'd natural to you; for you ſeem to have much ſincerity, to do otherwiſe, and therefore I preſume this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty with you.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the SON.</head>
                  <p>Conſider then, I ſay, is it not ſtrange that you ſhould make the Son, know things as God, and not know them as Man. <hi>p.</hi> 177, pray after what manner was the God head Incarnate, and what kind of Perſon was this, that by a kind of Ventriloquy you make to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as Divine, when the ordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon knows nothing of them himſelf <hi>i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p.</hi> 270.</p>
                  <p>So, what an Anſwer you have there, that the Son was tempted as to his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but not as to his Godhead; And pray then where was the Godhead all the while, like <hi>Baal</hi>'s aſleep; or was the Man Chriſt now and then as it were poſſeſſed by Fits? Methinks I am aſham'd to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Abſurdities of this Hypotheſis, they make me giddy when I conſider them.</p>
                  <p>So in the ſame Page, in Interpreting, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32. <hi>But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no not the angels that are in heaven, neither the Son but the Father:</hi> Do you not think you wreſt and deſtroy the Scripture Sence, and in pretence of ſaying St. <hi>Matthew</hi> has not what St. <hi>Mark</hi> has, blemiſh the cleareſt Text? You had better write down-right, St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel is not true; or that Gradation, Man, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or Son is impertinent, and then you would anſwer ſomething-like, as if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended a Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>But by the way, you muſt excuſe me, Sir, if for Truth's-ſake, I am forc'd thus to make ſuch Reflections on your words which tho' they may ſeem hard, yet are neceſſary; and yet not that they belong ſo much unto you, as your Cauſe, which I cannot otherwiſe ſet to a full light, which I believe you have hitherto embrac'd with too much inadvertency, and in following the corrupt Interpretations of the Church with too much Zeal: But to return to my purpoſe:</p>
                  <p>Nor will your Evaſion of Self-conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, make God and Man One Perſon here, as you would inſinuate, <hi>pag.</hi> 262. for 'tis plain, God and Man are thus two Perſons, if they acted together, and <hi>God</hi>

                     <hi>commanded the Reaſon regularly, as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon does the Sence;</hi> as you urge, <hi>pag.</hi> 268, 9. there might be ſome pretence for their being One Perſon, but you ſee plainly, the Godhead exerts itsſelf may be now and then as it liſts, nay, ever and anon, as it did at Chriſt's Crucifixion and Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, left the Man by himſelf, and crying out upon the Godhead, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what? Can here be any pretence then that the Godhead ſuffer'd? For ſhame, leave the Blaſphemy; and for his being conſcious to the Man Chriſt Jeſus, that that ſhould make him Incarnate, is ſuch a <hi>ſhuffle,</hi> that you had as good ſay, God is perſonally united to us all, becauſe he is conſcious to all our thoughts; as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Perſonal Incarnation of God himſelf in Chriſt, on that account.</p>
                  <p>So that all that you alledge, of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſibility of the Incarnation, will not ſalve your Sores, for all that you urge of that kind, <hi>pag.</hi> 264, is but <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and you ought to have more Truth in your Foundation, before you can juſtifie ſuch profound Myſteries in the Building.</p>

                  <p>Sir, Give me leave to tell you, your Church and Self have by Time and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, given your ſelves ſuch Methods to blind your ſelves, like the ancient Aſtronomers, with ſo many Epicicles, and blind and precarious Principles, in leading your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Scriptures, that without ſingular Courage and Integrity lead you, I may ſay, the peculiar Grace of God do it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'tis almoſt impoſſible to ſhew you Truth, you are ſo clouded and maz'd from it, by your own corrupt Subtleties in defending Error.</p>
                  <p>But yet, why do I accuſe you ſo far, you have already granted one half of what I deſire, That <hi>ſo many leading Terms, as Hypoſtaſis, </hi>&amp;c. <hi>are to be blam'd,</hi> pag. 139. be pleas'd but to move one ſtep further, clap Homo ouſios among them, which you confeſs is not in Scripture, <hi>pag.</hi> 15, and yield me, that our impoſing Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt at leaſt mud, if not corrupt the ſtream of Truth; and you ſhall ſee after that, that you and I ſhall never diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>

                  <p>I have hitherto ſhewn you, how much you have err'd in your general Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, I ſhall now proceed to rectifie your Errors in particulars, wherein I ſhall be the larger, that I may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Objections of the late Dr. <hi>S</hi>—, and others, on my Subject: I ſhall begin firſt with the Incarnation.</p>
                  <p>Now that I may the better ſhew the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Incarnation, as in your Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, I ſhall ſtate it, as it lies moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in mine: Know then, that tho' I do not violently acknowledge the Son of God to be co-equal to the Father, yet I freely grant him to be as Great, and Eminent as God could poſſibly make him.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I do not imagine <hi>a Proſopopeia In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,</hi> as you ſuggeſt, <hi>p.</hi> 227. nor do I make the Godhead carry about, and now and then poſſeſs a Body, as I have ſhewn your Trinity Hypotheſis will neceſſitate; but I ſuppoſe the great God and Angel, who under the Father fram'd all things, to ſatisfie God's Juſtice, and deſtroy the Malice of Satan, and to redeem his own, willingly condeſcended, that through the Power of God, his Being might be reduc'd as to a firſt Semen, and ſo he might live with Purity, and ſuffer under that Trial, that no Creature but himſelf could be able, beſides, to accompliſh with any certainty, for our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>This, Sir, I conceive, is the great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Incarnation; and this, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, carries ſome ſemblance of Rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; for if we from little Semens, may hereafter grow to the moſt conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Glory, as the Scriptures aſſures us, ſurely there can be no impoſſibility, nor difficulty, that God ſhould be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the moſt glorious of his Beings back again, and make them, as from the firſt Seed of a Soul, arrive to their Ancient Glory.</p>
                  <p>But to this you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 244, That <hi>there is no greater Nonſence in the World, than a Made God, and a Creature God:</hi> Sir, the Propoſition is bold, but you have not ſtoop'd to a proof of it; however<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I hope to ſhew you, 'tis neither Nonſence nor Abſurd; I muſt confeſs, a Creature God to be imagin'd the Supream, were abſurd; but when I ſay a Creature-God, I only mean a Spirit of an ubiquitary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and multitudinary Power; or one that by a perfect Self-conſciouſneſs, can reaſon with infinite Beings at once.</p>
                  <p>If then, Sir, you will not deny it to be in the Power of God to create ſuch a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which I hope, Sir, you will not; for I ſhould be ſorry to ſee my Words draw you to blaſpheme the Power, which you can know no Limits of, but Vice, Error, and Weakneſs: if you'll grant me, I ſay, that God can make ſuch a Power, I will add, he has; for ſurely, to make ſuch more glorious Beings, is much more for his Honour, than all little, ſingle, and weak Individuals, as You and I are.</p>

What <hi>ſhall a meer Man be exalted above Angels?</hi> Yes ſurely, if he were firſt above them, and laid aſide his Being only for a time, and in obedience to his God: And what ſay you? <hi>Can any thing under infinite Wiſdom Rule the World?</hi> Yes, Sir, God's moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Son, that is wiſer than all Men and Angels beſides, and that is in the Boſome of the Father, and ſo has his aſſiſtance, may rationally do it. And pray, Sir, where are the Abſurdities and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of theſe things?</p>
                  <p>Methinks, Sir, in this you ſhould have been aſham'd of your Reaſoning: <hi>You can allow God's begetting a Son co-equal Rational, pag.</hi> 221. but 'tis with an horrour, that you deteſt an Angel-God: But pray, Sir,

if the Notion of God's begetting a Son be not carnal, tell me why he has not more Sons than One? You dare not blaſpheme him ſure, to ſay he is not more fruitful; or are you ſo niggardly, to think, he can multiply his Glorious Iſſue too faſt.</p>
                  <p>But to return to my Subject: Hence it was, if you would know, <hi>That the Son ſays he could do nothing of himſelf,</hi> pag. 169. and hence it was, <hi>That whilst Incarnate he had need of the help of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> but the Reaſons that you have given in theſe things, are ſo ſhuffling, <hi>pag.</hi> 187, 270, that I bluſh to read them.</p>

                  <p>So that all the Objections I know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Hypotheſis, is but, that 'tis the Platonick Philoſophy made Chriſtian; and as to that, I ſhall only ſay this: Is Truth the worſe, becauſe <hi>Plato</hi> hapned to Idea it; or is Chriſtianity to be diſ-eſteem'd, becauſe a Philoſopher chanc'd to be in ſome of her Roads?</p>
                  <p>But leaſt any one ſhould think, that the Doctrine of <hi>Plato</hi> ſhould have the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, in wreſting the Scriptures to this Hypotheſis, I do hereby in the preſence of God declare, what it was that firſt mov'd my Judgment, and turn'd me to be an <hi>Ar</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian; and if it did me, it ſhould move us in Charity to think it did others.</p>
                  <p>An Acquaintance of mine, ſpeaking by chance of the Trinity, told me, Some thought it a breach of the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to convince me, 'twas not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd in the New Teſtament, ſhew'd me that moſt notable Chapter of the Firſt of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Now he little thought what he had done, when he did this; for tho' my Zeal boyl'd againſt his Blaſphemy, as I thought it for a time, yet when I reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again with myſelf, I thought at leaſt, his Diſcourſe had rais'd ſuch Scruples in my Mind, that the very Conſiderableneſs of the firſt Commandment would neceſſitate me to enquire of.</p>
                  <p>Now this was not only all the Diſcourſe I had with him, but I remember to this day, that I could never underſtand by his Diſcourſe, whether he were Arrian or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian, nor indeed what either Hypotheſis was; tho' lately, I muſt confeſs, I have perceiv'd him rather enclin'd to the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</p>
                  <p>But thus it was, that ſhortly after going for <hi>London,</hi> where my Doubt continuing upon me, I reſolv'd to give myſelf ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: I ſaught for Books, but found none; indeed I did not know what to enquire for; whereupon reſolving to know that by myſelf, which I could not by others, without either knowing of Arrianiſm, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianiſm, or Platoniſm, I took this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing courſe:</p>
                  <p>I took the New Teſtament, where I conceiv'd this Truth was to be found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, if any where, and reading it with attention, I collected every Text relating to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, into an Imperial Sheet of Paper; for neither liking giddy Tradition, nor the tricks of wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſingle Texts, I thought that this could be the only way to find the Truth by, if any.</p>
                  <p>Now God is my witneſs, that when I I did thus, I could not but fall into Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm; not that I then knew what Name my Opinion had; but ſome time after meeting with Books, I ſaw the difference of Arrianiſm and Socinianiſm, and found that I was not ſingular in my Sentiments, but that the World had thought the ſame before me.</p>
                  <p>Nor was this all, but before I knew that my Hypotheſis had been known to the World, thinking that I was ſingular in the Truth, I reſolv'd in Charity to Mankind to publiſh my diſcovery, till ſome Friends

                  <p>Upon this reſolving to be reſign'd to Truth, and fearing leſt my preſumption might ruine me, I not only took all my Papers and burnt them, but reſolv'd to read all Books for the Trinity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe all Perſons, and if poſſible, ſatisfie myſelf to believe, and acquieſce in ſo great a Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>But alas, Sir, after all this care, you ſee I am forc'd to differ from you; ſo that tho' I could willingly lay by my Sentiments, the better to examine Truth for a-while, yet when on ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If you deſire to ſee this Matter more amply argued, you muſt read Mr. <hi>Bidell</hi>'s
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55225:7"/>
Twelve Arguments of the Holy Ghoſt, who when he had made the Holy Ghoſt ſo conſiderable as he did, I wonder how he could continue a Socinian longer; for the Scriptures ſo plainly ſet the Son above the Holy Ghoſt, and tell us, That all Power is given to the Son both in Heaven and Earth, which he cannot poſſibly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe manage, that I admire he did not turn Arrian through-out.</p>
                  <p>But to return, this Order of God's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration through the Son, and by the Holy Ghoſt, appears more plainly, when we conſider, their <hi>gradative</hi> Stiles in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Apoſtles Creed; thus the Father only is called God in our Creed, as only being ſo; the Son called Lord, as he only really is ſo under him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5, 6. and the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit, only ſtiled Holy, in oppoſition to the Evil One.</p>
                  <p>And thus, the Divine Benefits we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as from the Father, are called Love and Operation, from the Son Grace and Adminiſtration; but from the Holy Ghoſt and leſſer Power, only Gift and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14. and hence it was, that all Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and Holy Ghoſt, being through the Son, <hi>Prophecies</hi> ceas'd while the <hi>Son was Incarnate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next unto theſe, as I have ſaid, ſucceed Principalities, Powers, and Dominions: Now theſe, by their very Names ſhew themſelves to be as leſſer Deputies; that is, as Governours of Provinces, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, <hi>under the Gods of the World,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt and Satan; and for theſe and their Offices you may ſee, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 12, 13, 20, 21—12. 1. Acts 16. 9.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As for Angels, I need ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them, ſeeing their Names declare their Offices, and the Scriptures abound with Examples of their performing them; thus an Angel came to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and ſeveral others; ſo that of this enough: And if any thing remain, it muſt be to explain the reaſonableneſs of there Hierarchy.</p>

                  <head>REFLECTIONS.</head>
                  <p>I ſay therefore, when we think to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Spirits; we muſt freely allow our ſelves an open and generous ſource of Thought; for as the Air, and much more they are too fine for the groſs Caſements of our Eyes; ſo if we deſign duly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Nature, we muſt be able to walk without Sence a little, and not think to grope groſly after them, as if we would feel them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, I lay it down as a Rule, That Spirits are Immortal, and have no need of any nouriſhment, nor do, nor need we doubt this, when we conſider even how the Sun has ſubſiſted, how his unwearied Rays impair him not, and how ſo many Thouſand Years has not exhauſted his Source of glowing Fuel.</p>
                  <p>2<hi>ly,</hi> To this I muſt add, that I cannot but believe, that like unto Clouds in the Air, they gradually ſubſiſt in each other, by the proportional Purity of each others Subſtances; nor need this be ſtrange to us, for this is evident, that God at leaſt exiſts in all of them, and rules them as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as they by his permiſſion can us; and if ſo, what hinders but that he may have Deputy-Gods to do the like under him.</p>
                  <p>Nor can it well be otherwiſe, than that they ſhould rule one another thus, through their gradual Purity, and Inexiſtency; for when we conſider, that Devils are entirely wicked, and are not to be ruled otherwiſe than through a real force, there remains no doubt, but that as they are in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one another, ſo it is through ſuch a real force as this, that neither Art, nor Conſpiracy can deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>But yet, after all this, methinks I hear
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55225:8"/>
hear you object, that this is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that any Creature ſhould be of ſo extenſive a Power; And yet why ſo? Does not the Sun do the ſame thing in the Senſible, and Vegetable World? And ſhall we think as general a power in a Spirit, that as eaſily pierce the thickeſt Bodies, as he does the Air, impoſſible; nay, or ſo much as difficult, in the rational World: But what? We know not how it is done, no more we know not how God, and our own Spirit exiſt within us.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I ſhall only add, that this being once granted, there remains no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to imagine, how all our Spiritual Actions are perform'd, and how we are tempted; thus only the Supream God, and his Son, poſſibly may ſee our Thoughts, the leſſer Gods, the Holy Ghoſt and Satan, may only have power of Imagery, and prompting us, while Potentates and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, may only have power to rule and converſe us.</p>
                  <p>But of this enough, and I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to handle thoſe particular Texts, that you, and others have cited againſt us.</p>

                  <p>1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. The ſame Anſwer, I ſhall return you to the Text: There are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and thoſe Three are One: and indeed, Sir, without queſtioning the Authority of this place, what can we rationally mean by this Text; unleſs One in bearing Record, according as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. and the Context directs?</p>
                  <p>So <hi>pag.</hi> 51. you alledge, that becauſe Chriſt ſaid, <hi>The Father is in me, and I in him,</hi> that therefore they are eſſentially One; as likewiſe, becauſe Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>in the Boſome of the Father:</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Sir, your Inference is ſo weak, and theſe Expreſſions ſo much better ſuit my Hypotheſis than yours, that they deſerve not an Anſwer; For pray, Sir, let me ask you, Who is to be cheriſh'd in the Boſom? What, a Coequal? And is not the other Expreſſion adequate to both Hypotheſis alike?</p>
                  <p>So <hi>pag.</hi> 50, you ſay, <hi>The Son perfectly knows the Father.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 59, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Scripture to prove it, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it, indeed, which ſhews you he knows but what the Father ſees good to tell him: Beſides, Sir, in this matter you have us'd ſuch a ſhuffling Method of anſwering, as I ſhew'd you before, in treating about the Hour of Judgment, that Chriſt knows not ſomething as Man, and yet all things on occaſion as God, in the ſame Perſon, that really till your Hypotheſis let you write better, you deſerve no Anſwer.</p>

                  <p>Beſides, Sir, if you mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in his pre-exiſtent ſtate he ſees our Thoughts, as you ſeem to alledge, <hi>pag.</hi> 248, and 252, I anſwer you, I never denied it; but if you think, he knew what was in Man whilſt Incarnate, otherwiſe than by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,

I muſt confeſs you make me diſſent from you; for if he had, he could never have ask'd Men occaſionally ſo many Queſtions as he did: as when he ask'd his Diſciples, What <hi>John</hi> thought of him? And what Men ſaid of him?</p>

The laſt Text I ſhall write of in general of the Son, is, That all Men ſhould honour the Son, as they honour the Father: and this <hi>p.</hi> 173, you ſay, <hi>Ought to be equal to the honour we pay the Father:</hi> and I prettily obſerve, that you put off, that God appointed that Honour, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that 'tis natural for the Son to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Honour by the Father.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>pag.</hi> 253, 254, 255, you are upon a continuation of the ſame Argument: But alas, how woodenly: No Reader can pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe you, and not ſee. <hi>Page</hi> 62, you can grant your ſelf, that (as) ſignifies a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not always ſameneſs in degree; And if ſo, why cannot our Brother Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Anſwer ſerve you?</p>
                  <p>But however, that we may put this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of all doubt; Pray, Sir, conſider a little, is there no difference, between the great Son of God our Mediator, and every little Creature, and is not there a difference, between a Mediator appointed by <hi>God,</hi> and one ſet up meerly by the whimſie of Man? If theſe are not good Reaſons, for our giving to Chriſt Honour as a Mediatour, I know not what are, I am ſure they are better, than to make God ſtoop to ſuch a petty Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as to be abſurdly Mediator to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But you have a further Argument, <hi>pag.</hi> 205, from 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 9. 10, 11.

                  <p>Now, that we might the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what Honour is due to the Son, the Scripture hath expreſly called it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to be Mediation <note n="a" rend="inter">

                  <p>I proceed now to write of Chriſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory Kingdom, and here I cannot but obſerve, how the Trinitarian Hypotheſis diſtorts the whole frame of Truth, makes God a Mediator to himſelf, and a Coequal take as an Honour an underling Office, whereas Chriſt in the Arrian Idea, as the great Son of God, is fit to be our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and his Handiwork, and may be deſervedly honour'd with the Title, that he alone can prevail with God for mercy for us.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot but let you ſee, Sir, with what falſe colours you would magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this Office, to make it rational for a Coequal to accept of it; thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 159, you make it nothing, That <hi>God exalted him to it:</hi> And ſo <hi>pag.</hi> 163, That he was forc'd <hi>first to ſuffer for it,</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as a Gift; whereas indeed, if he were a Coequal, it were both ſervile and degrading to him, even to accept it, tho' on any Terms, and tho' with a Reward.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>pag.</hi> 173. I cannot but admire, to ſee how you [glorious] out this Kingdom, how you would fain ſeem to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Father; when alas, Sir, you know your ſelf, all the Power of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is but an humble Interceſſion, <hi>p.</hi> 179.

                  <head>Of the Three Perſons together.</head>
                  <p>Having premiſed thus much in general of the Son, and indeed on whom almoſt depends the whole hinge of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, I ſhall now proceed, to ſhew you how the whole Three Perſons are treated, when they are named together in Scripture, that you may ſee even there our Hypotheſis prevails alſo.</p>
                  <p>Know then, that in ſuch places, the Father is repreſented as our God diſtinct and ſolely, the Son our Lord diſtinct and wholly, and the Holy Ghoſt only as our aiding Spirit or Comforter, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5, 6. So in the <hi>Revelations</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, St. <hi>John</hi> makes the Son and Holy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55225:11"/>
Ghoſt, but as Attendants on the Throne of the Father, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 7. 8, 9, &amp;c. whilſt he only ſits on the Throne; and the greateſt Honour even of the Son is, that he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd us, and ſo is become worthy to open the Book.</p>
                  <p>But yet as I have formerly ſhewn you, as the Father impowers the Holy Ghoſt through the Son, in all Acts of Grace, ſo are their Records One, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. And yet not but that this Record receives a ſtile agreeable to the Excellency of the Perſon giving it, where 'tis diſtinguiſh'd, thus in the Father 'tis call'd Operation, the Son Adminiſtration, and in the Holy Ghoſt Gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. And the manner of Gift in the Father is called Love, in the Son Grace, and the Holy Ghoſt Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe, as all Three being engaged in our Salvation, they are put in as Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to our Apoſtles Creed, but yet with ſubordinate Titles, as God, Lord, and Holy, to ſhew their diſtinction, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority; ſo that your Argument you ſee, Sir, that their being there, makes them Coequal and God, is very weak, <hi>pag.</hi> 197. for by the ſame Reaſon you might make every body, or the Catholick Church, God likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence likewiſe, the ancient Doxology before it was alter'd, was, Glory be to the Father, through the Son, and by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; (ſee <hi>Sparks</hi> on the Liturgy) which ſhew'd plainly their Subordination: Indeed ſince, upon the prevailing of the Doctrine of the Trinity, it has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd: But with what Scripture-Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Now I hope you ſee plainly.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall not diſſent from you, that the Socinians abſurdly baptize in the Name of the Holy Ghoſt, if there were none; and they do worſe than thoſe Diſciples who never heard of him, for they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd him when they did, which theſe, even now, do not: But what, are not they our Brethren? And are we not bound to have a Charity for their Errour? And who ſhall condemn them in it, that they are wilfully blind.</p>
                  <p>However, to return: This makes not but that we are baptiz'd in their Names as our Spiritual Governours, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. for ſo even the Scripture plainly expreſs themſelves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13, 27—10. 2. where we are told, That we are baptiz'd by one Spirit into one body, which is Chriſt; that is, into the Church, by his Miniſter, whereof he is the Head, to the Worſhip, Honour, and Glory of God: And what, Sir, will you interpret againſt Scripture?</p>
                  <p>And this conſider'd, where ſtands any room for your Calumnies, <hi>page</hi> 27, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214. Is not the whole Foundation of your Argument rotten? Does Baptiſm ſhew Worſhip? And if not, how can it be an open and barefac'd Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry? What may not there be a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in it, to ſhew us, who under God, are our Spiritual Governour, as well as by Water to imitate the cleanſing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation? If ſo, why may not my Conſtruction of it, agreeable to Scripture-Interpretation, be as good as yours? I proteſt before God, did not my Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis not only want Abſurdity, but ſuit moſt rationally, yea moſt naturally to Truth and the Scriptures, I would ſooner dye than adhere to it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Sir, to put your Union in your Hypotheſis beyond all doubt, the Scriptures have plainly ſhewn us, that theſe Three Perſons have various and diſtinct Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Powers, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32. <hi>John</hi> 12. 49. And indeed, we might rationally have collected as much, from their being given and ſent, did not our Myſteries quite ſhut our Eyes againſt Reaſon.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I hope by this time, I have given you as ample ſatisfaction in your Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, as you can deſire, you cannot but be ſo ingenious as to grant, that you have had all the advantages that a Succeſſion of Commentators can give you; whereas, I, you ſee, for all that, can heap you up the whole courſe of Scripture againſt you, that have not ſo much as one Arrian Author to aſſiſt me.</p>
                  <p>I have already inform'd you, what turn'd me to be an Arrian, and now I ſhall add, that when I had once reſolv'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55225:12"/>
nothing ſhould be dearer to me than Truth, and bethought me the Corruption even of Primitive Tradition, and ſaw a neceſſity of ſticking wholly to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the Sun was not clearer to me than the Doctrine which you call Heretical, and Arrianiſm.</p>
                  <p>And give me leave to tell you, tho' you have Popularity, and the Temporal Sword on your ſide, yet blaſpheme it more, if you dare, if there be ſuch a thing as bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as we have Chriſt's word there is; to your peril be it, Sir: I tell you, 'tis to blaſpheme the known Evidences of his Truth: and if theſe be ſuch, I dare venture my Truths with the Sword of the Spirit, againſt all your carnal Weapons.</p>
                  <p>Remember, Sir, there is a Sin unto Death, we may not ſo much as pray for, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 16. and all our pretences and good Works will be of none effect, while we blaſpheme the moſt great and ſincere Truths of God; beware, Sir, of this great and fiery Tryal; I mean perverſly to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme God's Truths, eſpecially when ſo conſiderable as this, this is that that will make the Tree good, and the Fruit good, and the Tree evil, or its Fruit evil; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, can you expect to be call'd or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd as a Son, when you openly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly proclaim'd your ſelf a Rebel to the only and great means of Government of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

               <p>HAving now done with the two firſt Heads of my Diſcourſe, the proof of the Trinity by Reaſon and Scripture, I proceed to the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Tradition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in would Men but be content to believe as they pray, I ſhould be ſatisfied; for that they do almoſt wholly to the Father; and therein may I ſay, they give all their pretences to Tradition, the greateſt Lye even the Cauſe is capable of bearing; but alas, the World is made too giddy by this Myſtery, to bear ſuch, or any other Reaſoning.</p>
               <p>I know, Sir, you are very confident that ſhe is of your ſide, as you ſay, <hi>page</hi> 31. but your Proofs and Suggeſtions for it, are as few and inconſiderable as even I can wiſh for, <hi>pag.</hi> 40. Thus, you would fain wheedle us, that Men were Arrians, and not Arrians. And what, Sir, was it out of Charity that they forbore to call the Trinitarians Hereticks? If it was, 'twas a ſign they were the better Chriſtians for it, not that their Cauſe was the worſe.</p>
               <p>So you aſperſe the Great Council of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium,</hi> of 550 Biſhops, of ſo ſeeming or wou'd-be an Imputation, <hi>pag.</hi> 43, that I am aſham'd to ſee't: What, Sir, do you think they would have called the greateſt Council that ever was, if they had deſign'd a tricking? Or are you reſolv'd to truſt more to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> becauſe not ſo many? Methinks, Sir, you ſhould think it enough at leaſt, that your Tradition was diſputable then, that you had ſuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers againſt you, and not repoſe in forging <hi>Rome</hi> for blemiſhing Councils.</p>

                  <p>Tradition was only of uſe till the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were deliver'd; and indeed 'tis well if 'twas contain'd pure till then; as we may moſt juſtly cenſure, by St. <hi>John</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Churches, in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> But to continue Tradition further, what is it, but like the Jews, to make the Law of God of none effect, by our Traditions.</p>
                  <p>You muſt excuſe me therefore, if I think Tradition to be too much a Noſe of Wax, to be alledg'd againſt Scripture; eſpecially ſuch expreſs apparent and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident Texts, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. and <hi>John</hi> 16, I ſhall therefore leave you to jangle out your quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Inconſiſtencies, <hi>page</hi> 107, 108, 113, 114, 119, 120, 121.

                     <p>Alas, Sir, I pity you; had you regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Natural Religion more, and your My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery leſs, you would not have abounded with ſuch an Envy and Monopoly of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: What muſt we have no Faith, but be ſav'd by Works, becauſe we have not juſt this Myſtery? And what is it nothing to Chriſtianity, that we have ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Glory as an Encouragement, ſet in our proſpect and ſearch above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then? Or what, Sir, is your Eye evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is good? Would you have God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55225:13"/>
a Devil, create Men meerly for Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or would you have him damn them to ſupport your Hypotheſis?</p>
                     <p>See how your Myſtery has miſled you, Sir, that Men ſhould be ſav'd, only by parrotting over a few unintelligible words: I might have expected this from ſome ignorant Sectariſt, but I never thought a a skilful Doctor, ſhould make God ſo hard a Task-maſter, as to require Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo penally, what 'tis plain, not One in a Million underſtands: Alas, Sir! you miſtake the Redemption of Chriſt! 'twas to purchaſe us a new Covenant, and not only teach us a new Faith!</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall we chang'd our State, our Tryal by a ſingle Precept for the Law of Nature, but had not the Seed of the Woman begun even then to have broke the Serpent's Head, at leaſt through a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be fulfill'd: Can you blaſpheme God, ſo as to ſay, he would let him be fruitful? Will not a Prophet be able to vindicate his Juſtice, that has declar'd long ſince, every Man, and he alone ſhould bear his own iniquity.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, then Chriſt has purchaſed us a new Covenant, and ſince he is come, there is ſome reaſon for us to honour him, with the neceſſity of our Faith through him, to lead us to Salvation, and to obey his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Precepts, to conduct us through the Second Covenant, the Law of Nature, to Perfection: But where could be the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p>I ſee, Sir, your Virtues have no Extreams, you have Faith, but allow no Credulity; if you did, you could never ſwallow theſe things; you confirm the old Sentence, <hi>Credo quia impoſſibile est:</hi> But alas, Sir, do you think to make your Doctrine prevail by theſe means, by a dead anathematizing implicite Faith, fitter for Paganiſm than Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>No, your uncharitableneſs cannot but blemiſh you, even among your own Friends; indeed the Predeſtinarian does not exceed this; and may be, Men ſeeing thus, how one Errour leads you into another ſo black, will be brought by it to ſee the Truth they conſider'd not before.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Sir, had you conſulted Scripture in this, the Apoſtle tells you plainly, that Chriſt died for the Sins of the whole World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1, 2. And if not, think you God's Mercy would have detain'd him till the latter Ages of the World; beſides, Sir, are we not charg'd not to judge them that are without, and are we not told, that where there is no Law, there is no Sin, <hi>John</hi> 9. 41. <hi>James</hi> 4. 17. and that they that have not been able to receive a Law, or Revelation, are to be tried by Natural Religion, and their Conſcience, as a Law within themſelves, <hi>Rom. cap.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 13.

                     </p>
                     <p>Alas, Sir, had you judg'd of the wilfully ignorant, and perverſe, you had left ſome colour for your Cenſure to be true, and yet even then, were I in your caſe, I ſhould be very unwilling to fling the firſt Stone, eſpecially ſince Chriſt has told us, as we judge, we ſhall be judg'd; I had rather let Men be guilty, and God condemn them, then condemn my ſelf by judging them.</p>

                  <p>But methinks I hear you object to me, What Faith is neceſſary then, if this be not? I ſay, the Faith of <hi>Enoch, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> that God is a Rewarder of the juſt in tender Conſciences, is enough, and that without <hi>Idolizing Works,</hi> as you reflect, <hi>page</hi> 25.

                  <p>To theſe may be alſo added by conſent the Apoſtles Creed, or any other, ſo it be not enforc'd; but for your nice and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Creeds, they are unneceſſary, or elſe you accuſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles, of a cowardly lukewarmneſs for omitting them, for all you inſinuate, <hi>page</hi> 29. that we would be at Creed-making too, Sir; but we beg your Pardon, and have more Charity; for if we explain our Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, 'tis only to confute yours.</p>

               <p>I hope, Sir, too, you ſee, we do not <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate infinite Knowledge,</hi> as you aſperſe us, <hi>page</hi> 5. but vindicate a Truth, clear as the day: Indeed, 'tis plain, the Firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, except to exclude Perſons is Nonſence; and who in this Caſe muſt bear the Reflection, you, or God; ſurely we muſt acquit God; and if we do, our Faith muſt fling you into all the Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Contradictions of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>But you'll ſay, here is ſome colour for the Trinity: And what, is there not then as much ſor Tranſubſtantiation? This is plain, our Bodies are not Two Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame, and tho' differing thus Twenty times in our Lives, we call it ſtill the ſame Body: May not we on this, as juſtly ſalve Tranſubſtantiation, that the Spirit of Chriſt is able to dwell in infinite Bodies at once; and will not this make as properly the ſame Body, as my Body at Twenty, is my Body at Thirty; but you anſwer, you have Scripture of your ſide; and pray ſhew me half ſo ſtrong a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter for the Trinity, as <hi>John</hi> the 6th is for Tranſubſtantiation.</p>

Alas, Sir, you ſee your Fallacies do but divert your Cauſes being expos'd for a time, till a nice Refutation makes it look the blacker for its Sophiſtry: And now you may ſee who 'tis, that brings down the plain Scriptures, to be wreſted by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Reaſon of a Myſtery, <hi>page</hi> 141. And now Men and Angels may ſee, who are thoſe <hi>abſurd and ſenceleſs Inſidels, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject what they have evidence for,</hi> v. page 6. In ſhort, I dare appeal to all the World, tho' againſt me, whether ſuppreſſion of Books be not your beſt Argument.</p>
               <p>You tell us, <hi>page</hi> 148, That <hi>our Buſineſs is, to prove Three Perſons Three Gods:</hi> And we do it by this, That if God be more than One Perſon, when not particularly reveal'd, and contrary to his firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, his Commandment is of no effect: But ſhall we grant that? No, we'll turn the havock of the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment juſtly, in Contradictions upon you; we need not ask with <hi>Nicodemus, How can theſe things be?</hi> page 150. but we'll tell you, with the ſame reaſon, we may make three thouſand Gods, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Lye, <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 11. And you had as good make all Mankind One Man, and deſtroy all Plurality and Numbers, &amp;c. But for Peace-ſake, I ſhall forbear further Reflections, <hi>page</hi> 109.</p>
               <p>Hence, ſhould you invent a thouſand Metaphyſick ſtrains more, this one plain Truth would ruine them all; indeed, did not Myſtery, the Authority of the Whore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. and the great ſupport of Popery, bear up your Hypotheſis, her Epitaph might have been wrote, I doubt not, many hundred Years ago.</p>
               <p>Myſtery do I ſay, Myſtery and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are the Devil's Twins, and ſtand and fall both together; Perſecution without Myſtery were too cruel, and Myſtery without Blood too much Nonſence to be born; 'tis theſe two are Popery, and the worſt of Popery, Tranſubſtantiation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe were an innocent Error: And what, are not Proteſtants aſham'd to weild the Sword of Antichriſt? Yes ſurely; But if they are, why do they ſtille us, and our Books, is it not that they fear our Truths?</p>
               <p>Are you not aſham'd to rail at us for Blaſphemers and Hereticks as you do, if I am not miſtaken, we mean as ſincerely, and Interpret the Scripture as well as you, for all your boaſts, <hi>pag.</hi> 141. and you ſhall ſind, God in the Great Day will ſhew which is the Heretick: What, have we not as much reaſon to complain of the blemiſhes of the firſt and great Commandment, as you have; and cannot the Controverſie of <hi>Eliſha</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> remember you, that 'tis not Numbers, but Minds that God ſeeks.</p>
               <p>But you ſay, This is a Myſtery: And pray who has authoris'd it for one? You be-ly God in his Scriptures, if you ſay that he has; no, 'tis Man's own invention, and that 'tis that makes him idolize the uncharitable Impoſition ſo much: What, ſhall God bid us publiſh what none underſtand? Pray who can agree in this Myſtery? Or were the Copy of it loſt, who would be able ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to hammer it out? Is this clear like a heavenly Truth?</p>
               <p>Are we not aſham'd to caſt this ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block in Chriſtianity, that has ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended all Jews, Turks, and Pagans it ever came neer; indeed, does not <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſupport his diviſion by this very thing, and does he not complain above an hundred times againſt the abuſe of the Unity in his Alchoran?</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay, if we repent not this Error, ſhall we not juſtly ſtand brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Poſterity, a Race of pretended Proteſtants, but really a Philoſophick Sect of Chriſtian Atheiſts: Beſides, what but the corruption of this Unity in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, can have ſo long proſper'd the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> above the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> above the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

               <p>And alaſs! now we ſee wherein our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is imperfect, that it has not preſerv'd our eternal liberty of Opinion, in things not expreſly reveal'd, this is the Root of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and this muſt be cur'd, if ever we hope for Peace; indeed, in a free Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrancy, where all Impoſitions are cut off, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies of courſe pine and die with their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, for want of room to be regarded.</p>

                  <p>And now, Sir, I ſhall more particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſtile to yourſelf: And in the firſt place I beg you to pardon all my Reprehenſions, and if they are any where bitterer than they ought, reckon it my frailty, not my injuſtice, and at leaſt you ought to thank me for my good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but if you approve what I have wrote, return God the Glory for your information, and I am ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>I aſſure you, Sir, in myſelf I am griev'd to write againſt a good Man; nor would I, but that my love to God and Truth commands me, nor do I write this, that I think you want ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Piety or Ability, indeed you ſhine for both in your Church; but I would adviſe you, that you have miſtook the Truth; nor wonder at it, for the greateſt Fathers in the Church have done it before you.</p>
                  <p>You have ventur'd to be ſingular once in Conſcience already, and your Treatiſe of <hi>Death</hi> ſhews you ſincere; dare once a deeper Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and a more ſingular Truth, if you fall not back, you know not what Service God may have for you to do. Remember, Sir, 'tis Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to follow Truth in all changes of Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and but obſtinacy to remain ſtiff after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, 'twill be as much your Glory as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, that you recant; and if you are a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed, you cannot hate your Friend, or Glaſs for ſhewing you your wrinkles, nor will your ſingularity be worſe, if you ſee them; unleſs in Piety, that others are as bad, or worſe than your ſelf, and dare not ſee it.</p>
                  <p>What tho' I am ſingular and contemptible, my Truths if ſincere are Divine, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> as well as you, had both Zeal and Popularity, and yet was in an Error; if you are in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, pray God open your eyes; and if I am, I beg him to grant me to be rectified by your Inſtruction; 'twill be hard if a Miracle be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inſtruct and reconcile us.</p>
                  <p>I cannot perſwade myſelf, that you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to pervert this grand Truth, and by Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Niceties endeavour further to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and cloud it; what you have hitherto done, I hope, nay believe you have done igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, and becauſe the Socinian Hypotheſis was not ſincere enough, you oppos'd it, but for the Arrian, I almoſt dare promiſe myſelf more Charity from you, if not Conviction.</p>
                  <p>At firſt I declin'd this Book, as not thinking it proper to be wrote by an Arrian, and as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leaſt my own Reſentments might ſoyl the Honour of God; and I had done it ſtill, had not I had more than humane motives to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but whatever they were, they were to my ſelf; and my Reader's buſineſs is to mind my Truths, and not my Pretences.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, if Men are ſincere, I think I have wrote enough to convince them, and if perverſe to condemn them; and Charity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages me no further: But alas! what avails it, if God will not vindicate his own Honour, the Attempts of his Servants are otherwiſe in vain; and yet at leaſt I ſhall be content, tho' at any hazard, when I have done my Duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All Glory to whom only due, to the One and Only God, through his great and beloved Son Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>☞ <hi>Whoever Anſwers this, is deſir'd, to make his Anſwer ſhort, that he run not the World into Labyrinths; and that he repeat the whole Body of the Diſcourſe </hi>Verbatim,<hi> that he may not juggle the World out of Subſtance, by ſnarling at Trifles: Theſe two Conditions anſwer'd, I ſhall think I have a Reply worth Reading; if not, I accuſe it before-hand to the World for a Cheat, and a Deceit not worth taking Notice of.</hi>
