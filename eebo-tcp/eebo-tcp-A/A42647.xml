            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>me we would have him, but for my owne part I comfort my ſelfe eſpecially, and deſire you would be comforted againſt all feares or plots layed or plotted againſt us out of two conſiderations. Firſt, the goodneſſe and mercy of our God. Secondly, the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and pollicy of our King. Firſt, let us conſider wee have a good and glorious God watching over us, who will not ſuffer his truth to be extinguiſhed, but as he hath hitherto miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, ſo ſtill he will continue to doe the ſame: The Lord viſits the tranſgreſſions of his children with the rod, yet will he not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly take his mercy from them, nor ſuffer his truth to faile: Let us then reſt in peace, for hee that keepeth us doth neither ſlumber nor ſleepe, and let the remembrance of thoſe many former delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, which he hath wrought for us, aſſure us of the like fatherly care and protection ſtill, if wee faithfully and conſtantly depend upon his mercifull promiſe. Secondly, remember the wiſdome of our King, which is ſo renowned, as for it, he is admired of all, and let this comfort us, and aſſure us that God hath not given him ſo much light for nothing, much leſſe for evill: Let us thinke that ſince he hath beene ſerved by us with ſo much obedience, that hee will ſo much neglect his owne honour and ſafety, or our lives and liberties, as to leave us in the hands of our enemies, or abaſe us in the eyes of Rebells, to leade us, or ſuffer us to be led into temporall or ſpirituall captivity: Let us thinke alwayes, he cannot forget thoſe rebellious perſons which have fought ſeverall times againſt him; nor yet the many attempts and practiſes which they have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt his Perſon, Crowne, Dignity, and the truth he profeſſeth, nor that God will ſuffer him to ſleepe ſecurely in the armes of ſuch, as he knowes watch only for opportunity to deſtroy both Church and State, as alſo him and his: Our love to his Royall Progeny muſt needes aſſure our love to him, and the hate of others to them, aſſure their inward hate againſt him; and for ſuch as perſwade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, that our love to the King, or his children, and hate to the adverſe Party, proceedes either out of diſcontent, or a vaine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in us leading to diſloyalty; let their lies turne upon their owne pates, and let evill happen to them that evill thinke; there are ſubtile enemies which labour to breed jealouſies betwixt him and his Subjects, knowing it to be for their greateſt advantage,

and the only, and chiefeſt plot to blemiſh and cloude the glory and magnificence of Monarchy, they would alienate the heart of the King from his people, the people from the King, and friends from each other; yet thinke, it cannot ſinke into his Majeſties breaſt that ſuch friends and ſervants, who have not onely ſpent and loſt their eſtates, but hazarded their lives dayly and hourely, ſhould intend the leaſt hurt to him who is the defender of their faith; it is for Turkes and Heathens to become bloody Traytors, and it is for Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to ſuſpect their friends: Good Princes who are Fathers of the Common-wealth, cannot nor will not doe thus, whilſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they ſee no cauſe of their ſubjects hate; it is our enemyes plot to ſtir up our heady and haſty humours, by pulling our quills, and racking our Eſtates, and ſo by degrees draw us cleane off from that former affection we bore to our Soveraigne; Let me tell you, <hi>Conſcientia mille teſtes,</hi> and for my part, I had rather go to heaven with a few, then to hell with a multitude. His Majeſty cannot but ſee the actions of the publique enemy, as well as we, and much better; and therefore though you ſuffer with him for a while, yet be you quiet, that their intents and projects upon you may bee fruſtrate: Thinke now, the King is making his owne Chronicle; and aſſure your ſelves, that though he hath ſome imperfection in his ſpeech, yet he meanes ſpeedily with his pen, or at leaſtwiſe, he can anſwer all their Propoſitions with a <hi>non placet,</hi> but what need I ſpeake more? He that can anſwer ſo well, will never ſo far contradict his owne words with repugnant actions, as thereby to race his Armies, to ſtaine the honour he was borne unto, and which he hath made good and bettered hitherto, by high and mighty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of act and admonition againſt ſo many perfidious Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but thinke therefore, that all this time, he is acting his part in <hi>Inſula Vectis,</hi> that hee hath a better game to play, that hee is working his maſter peece in the publique market, and trying his exact skill in King craft, with the Hogle Mogle Parliament of England, and the Grand Committee of Lords and Commons: The Lyon may awake, breake looſe, and teare his Keepers or elſe leade, whilſt he ſeemes to be ledd, and then the world ſhall ſee, that neither the opinion of his ſincerity in the truth, nor of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchleſſe wiſedome and pollicy, were vaine miſtakings, and at

O abominable Treaſon, is this the way to make him a glorious King: O Lord incline not my heart to any evill thing, to practice wicked workes with men that worke iniquity, eſpecially againſt the Lords Anoynted; the Lord I hope will keepe him from all the ſnares which they have privily layde for him: Let the wicked fall into their owne nets, whilſt (hee being guiltleſſe) ſhall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: ſave Lord, let the King of Kings here us when we call, and let all good people ſay, Amen.</p>
