            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VVherin as many haue both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, paynfully, &amp; religiously traueyled: so amongst others, none in my iudgement hath more handsomely and eloquently, with more iudgement and better me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode discoursed the same, then <hi>Lewes Lauaterus,</hi> minister of Tigurine. Others haue handled it in dede wel, but yet <hi>nihil ad nostrum hunc,</hi> beyng eyther to short, or to long, or to darke, or to doubtful, or otherwyse so confused, that they leaue the reader more in suspe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the end, then they founde hym in the begynnyng. As for mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Lauaterus</hi> his discretion herein, I wyll no otherwise commend it, then to desire the reader to view, &amp; iudge hym selfe. For thus much at the first syght he shal see: A cleare methode, with a familier and easie style, the matter throughly handled <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> on both sides, so that nothyng seemeth to be wantyng, nor any thyng redoundyng. And if it be true that Horace saith, <hi>omne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ulit punctum, qui miscuit vtile dulci,</hi> that is, He wynneth the price, that ioyneth pleasure with profite: I thinke this author may also in this respect be pronounced <hi>victor,</hi> &amp; adiudged to the best game. For he so intreateth this serious and terrible matter of spitites, that he now and then insertyng some strange story of Monkes, Priestes,
<pb facs="tcp:8810:2"/>
Fryers, &amp; such like counterfeyts, doth both very lyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly display their falsehood, and also not a litle recreate his reader: and yet in the ende he so aptly concludeth to the purpose, that his hystories seeme not idle tales, or impertinent vagaries, but very truethes, naturally falling vnder the compasse of his matter. And howe profitable this his work is, those may best iudge, which are most ignorant in this question, some thinking eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry small motion and noyse to be spirites, and some so fondely perswaded that there are no spirites, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better enfourmed herein by this author, I suppose wyl confesse his worke to haue done them some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite: if knowledge be profitable, and ignorance discom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modious. And agayne, those which beyng hytherto borne in hande that mens soules returne agayne on earth, crauyng helpe of the lyuyng, and haue spent much of their substance on idle Monkes &amp; Fryers, to relieue them, wyll confesse the lyke. For when they shall see they haue ben falsly taught, &amp; that they were not the soules of men whiche appeared, but eyther falsehood of Monkes, or illusions of deuyls, franticke imaginations, or some other friuolous &amp; vaine perswa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sions, they wil thinke it profitable to haue knowen the trueth, aswel to auoyde error hereafter, as to saue their money from such greedy caterpillers. Some also whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be otherwise well trayned vp in religion, and yet not knowyng what to thynke of these matters, wil not iudge their labour euyl imployed, nor the worke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, wherby thei may be brought out of doubt, and knowe certainly what to beleue. There be many also, euen nowe a dayes, which are haunted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with spirites, and knowe not howe to vse them selues, who when they shall learne howe a Christian
<pb facs="tcp:8810:3"/>
man ought to gouerne hym selfe, beyng vexed with euyl spirites, wyl thynke it a very profitable poynt of doctrine, that shal teache them to direct them selues. Profitable therefore it is, and shalbe, no doubt, vnto many, and disprofitable vnto none, except perchaunce vnto popishe Monkes and Priestes, who are like here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to lose a great part of their gaynes, which somtimes they gathered together in great abundance, by their deceiptfull doctrine of the appearyng of dead mens soules. But this their wicked and deuyllishe doctrine, together with all the patches and appendices therto belongyng, he so notably teareth and cutteth in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that I am well assured they shal neuer be hable to cobble and cloute them vp agayne. And this doth he with suche a moderation of breuitie and tediousnes, that I may rightly say: He hath sayde well, and not to much, and written truely, and not to litle.</p>
            <p>Nowe as touchyng my translation, although I haue not made hym speake with like grace in Englishe, as he doth in Latine: yet haue I nor changed his meanyng, nor altered his matter, endeuouring my selfe rather to make thee vnderstande what thou readest, then to smoothe and pollishe it with fine and picked wordes, which I graunt others myght haue done more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely, and perchaunce I my selfe also somewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yf I would haue made therof a study and labour, and not a recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; exercise. But howsoeuer I haue done herein, verily good reader, I trust thou wylt take it in good part, which is al that I esteeme: yf any man shal mislike therof, let hym amende it.

Againe, there are some which as soone as they heare of any thing, especially if it happen in the nighte, they by and by thinke some spirite doth walke, and are maruellously troubled in mynde, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they can not discerne naturall things from spirites. And some (chéefly those which hunt after gaynes, by the soules of dead men) affirme that the moste parte of suche
<pb facs="tcp:8810:6"/>
things which are hard or séene, are the soules of dead men, whych craue helpe of them that are liuing, to be deliuered out of the tormentes of most cruell payne in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Many not only of the common sorte, but also menne of excellent knowledge, do maruayle whether there bée any spirits or no, and what maner of things they are. Yea &amp; some of my familiar friends haue many times requested me, to shewe them my opinion concerning these matters. Wherefore me séemeth it shall be worth my laboure, if I declare briefly and playnly out of the word of God, what we ought to iudge concerning these things. For the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Gods Churche can take nothing more profitable in hande, than to instructe the people of God purely and plainly, in suche necessary matters as come in question out of the word of God, whiche is a lanterne (as the psalmist saith) vnto our féete, and a light vnto our pathes: and to deliuer them from all erroure and superstition, and bring them out of all wauering and dout. And verily their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and diligence is to be highly commended, who for these fewe yeares ago, haue set foorth certayne bookes drawen out of the scriptures writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Germayne tong against sundry errours: &amp; theirs likewise who in these our dayes by writing of bookes do teache, instructe, and confirme the rude and vnlearned people. For amongst many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent benefits, which God our heauenly Father hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vppon mankinde, this also is a great and most li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall gifte, that in this latter, and as it were olde age of the world, he hath brought to light by the arte of imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as well many other good authors, as also the holy scriptures of the ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As touching this my treatise concerning Spirits,<note place="margin">

                  </hi>
               </note> and straunge wonders, I haue deuided it into three partes for the more clere vnderstanding therof. In the first parte I shewe, that there are visions and spirits, and that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto men sometimes, and that many and maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things happen besides the ordinarie course of nature. In the second I discusse what manner of things they are, that is, not the souls of dead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue thought, but either good or euill Angels, or else some secrete and hid operations of God. In the third I declare why God doth sometime suffer Spirits to appeare, and diuers forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to happen: and also howe men ought to behaue them selues when they happen to méete with such things. In these points or partes, the chiefest thing whereon men vse to reason touching this matter, are conteined. Nowe I meane to handle this matter, being very obscure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, with many questions, (I trust) so plainly, &amp; clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the holy scriptures, wheron we may surely stay our selues, out of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers, allowed historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and other good writers, that those which are studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and louers of gods truth, may well vnderstand what may be denied and thought of those apparitions, and other straunge and maruellous matters. And I also trust y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euen our aduersaries also, (in case they will lay their affections aside, but a litle while) will say that I haue truly allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all their arguments, and confuted them without any rayling or bitternesse.

And albeit that I doo write more largely of this, yet was it not my minde to gather togither all those things whiche I coulde haue spoken and alleaged touching the same matter: but only suche as séeme the chiefest and most especial points, partly because I wold not be tedious to the reader, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also least my bookes should growe vnto an ouer greate quantitie.

There was great contention betwene the monkes of the order of preachers, and the friers <hi>Minorites,</hi> or <hi>Franciscans,</hi> touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the virgin Mary. The Friers prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers affirmed, that she euen as other men also was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in originall sinne, that the <hi>Franciscans</hi> denied and stoutly denied. At the last the matter came to that issue that the preachers determined to auouche and proue their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by false and fayned miracles: taking aduisement in a certeine Synode (which they call a chapter) holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at <hi>Vim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penium</hi> a citie of <hi>Germanie,</hi> where the most conuenient and fittest place for this matter might be founde: and at the last they chose out <hi>Berna</hi> in <hi>Heluetia,</hi> bycause the people there were playne and simple, and giuen to the warres.

The matter séemed vnto them, euen from the beginning, that it woulde take good successe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On a certeine day béeing Fryday, the supprior shrouding

himself in a shéete, together with other Spirites, whom he had coniured vp for this purpose, brake into the Friers cel with great force and noyse, faining with many teares, that he desired his ayde &amp; help. Now had they priuely conueyed Holy water and the Reliques of Saints into his Cell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The poore Frier half dead with feare, denied that he coulde by any meanes helpe him, recommending himselfe to Christ our sauior, and to his holy mother. The Spirite aunswered, that it was in his and his brethrens power to deliuer him out of this miserie, if he would suffer hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for the space of .viij. days, euery day to be whipped vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the bloud folowed, and moreouer, cause .viij.

After he tolde him that the next Fryday before midnight, he wold come again with greater noyse, willing him in any wise not to be afrayd, for the Diuels could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hurt him, bicause he was an holy man. The next day this foolish Frier openeth al the matter to the ringleaders of this deuise, beséeching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to assist him, that the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soule might be deliuered. The matter was out of hand rumored aboute the citie. The Monkes preached openly hereof in the pulpit, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding highly the holinesse of their order, which euen hereby might be séene, for that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite craued helpe of them, and not of the wicked dronken <hi>Franciscans</hi>

endured a hundred and sixtie yeares. He had confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with him also of other maruellous matters, whiche we néed not here to rehearse. Afterwards the same spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againe vnto the Frier, and preferred the order of preachers before al others, bearing him in hand, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them which had bin aduersaries vnto this order, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered most horrible torment in purgatory, &amp; that the citie of <hi>Berna</hi> should be vtterly ouerthrowne, except they bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> &amp; refused y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yearly stipends which they receyued at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> french kings hands. He also talked of sundry things which had hapned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Friar (which thing they had learned before of him by meanes of auricular confession.) Moreouer he hartely thanketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Frier for the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of his deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, giuing him to vnderstande, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was nowe admitted into the .vij. degrée of Angels, and that he should say Masse there for his benefactors.</p>
               <p>After these things thus done, an other night one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto him in the apparell of a woman, sayde he was <hi>S. Barbara,</hi> whome he deuoutly serued, and tolde him that the blessed virgin would shortly appeare vnto him, and make full answere vnto those questions which one of the Monks had written in a paper for him. This paper <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara</hi> promised that she hir selfe wold deliuer vnto our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which they shoulde shortly after finde in a hollie place sealed and signed miraculously. The Frier vppon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth the whole matter vnto his fathers, desiring to bée confessed of his sinnes, wherby he might be found worthy the apparition or séeing of our Lady. He willed them to serche in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> halowed place for the scroule, which at the last they found in the Fratry (as they term it) where they had laide it before. Then they caried it with great reuerence vnto the high alter, affirming that it was sealed with chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bloud, and that the tapers lightned of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. In y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> morning the virgine Mary appeared vnto him agayne, rehersing many things whiche hir sonne Iesus commaunded hir to tell vnto him: to wit, that <hi>Pope Iulius</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:8810:25"/>
was that holie man, which shoulde reconcile the two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in frendship againe, and institute &amp; ordayne the feast of the defiled conception of our Lady, for she woulde sende vnto the Pope a crosse marked with foure droppes of hir sonnes bloud, in signe that she was conceiued in originall sinne: and that they shoulde finde an other crosse marked with fiue droppes of bloud in their fratrie, which they must conuey to <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Pope would allowe and confirme it with large indulgences and after returne it to <hi>Berna</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne: other things likewise she sayde, whereof many things were both reported and written to and fro.</p>
               <p>But in witnesse of the foresayde things, the same Mary droue an yron nayle through the hand of the poore Frier, saying: this wounde shal be renewed in the day wherein my sonne was crucified, and in the feast of my sonnes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. After they toke a burning water made by Necroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, by the which they taking away his senses, made foure other woundes in his body. And after that he came againe vnto him selfe, they bare him in hand that there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine holie thing I wote not what, which appeared aboute him. And when they sawe that many men came flocking about him to sée this newe Christ, they taught him (for hée was of rude condicions) howe to behaue hym selfe. And when they had giuen him a drinke berée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing him of hys senses, and causing him to some at the mouth, then he saide be striued and wrestled with death, euen as Christ dyd in the mount Oliuet. After al this, another of them appeared vnto him, telling him many things: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Frier knowing him by his voice, began to suspecte and mislike the whole matter, and with violence thrust him from him. The next night the Frier himself appeared vnto him, saying that he was Mary of whom he had ben in doubt, and to the ende he shoulde bée out of all suspicion, she had brought him the host of hir sonnes body (for he brought him an host stiped in poyson) to the ende he shoulde no more thinke he sawe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8810:25"/>
an euil spirite: he also affirmed, that he had brought a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of glasse full of hir sonnes bloud, which he would giue vnto him, and to his Monasterie. But the Frier, who also had this vision in suspition, answered: If (sayde he) thou be not an euil spirit, reherse thy <hi>Pater noster</hi> and thy <hi>Aue Maria</hi> with me. The Priour sayde the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> and afterward sayd in the person of our Lady: <hi>Hayled am I Mary full of grace, the Lord be with me. &amp;c.</hi> The Frier knowing the Priors voyce, caught a knyfe, and wounded him therwith, and when he defended himselfe, the Fryer stoutly resisted, and draue him backe. These things thus done, the Supprior béeing in good hope to restore all that they had lost, appeared againe to the Frier, saying that he was <hi>S. Catherin</hi> of <hi>Sena,</hi> and therwith begun to chide him, for that he so discurteously had intreated the holy Uirgin: adding moreouer, I am sent (quod he) to shewe thée, that the wounds which thou hast in thy body, are the very true woundes of Christ, whiche neyther I, nor yet S. Francis hath, and that he enlarged with many wordes. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, the Frier so entertayned him, that he was glad to saue himselfe with running away. Nowe bicause the Fryer wold no longer be mocked at their hands, they, maruellously troubled, and almost at their wits ende, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduise among them selues, brake the matter vnto him, and tolde him, that in very déede they fréely confessed many of those apparitions which he had séen to be fayned, and that for no other cause, but to the ende he should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuere in his profession and Religion, howbeit the very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the matter was most true, and that he ought not to doubt, but that he bare the wounds of Chryst in his body. And forsomuch as the matter was nowe knowen abroad, they ernestly besought him, that he would not refuse to go on in the matter, for otherwise their order should incurre open shame, and bothe he and they fall into present daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but in case he woulde persist in his enterprised pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8810:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the thing woulde fall out to his and their great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage. And so with fairer wordes, they persuaded him to make promise to be ruled by them hereafter.</p>
               <p>After long instruction and teaching, they placed him on the altar of our Lady, knéeling on his knées within a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell before the image of the holy virgine: Where one of the Monkes standing behinde a cloath, spake thorough a cane réede, as if it were Christ talking with his mother, in this wise: Mother why dost thou wéep? haue I not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatsoeuer thou willest, shal be done? Wherto the image made answere. Therfore I wéepe, bicause this businesse findeth no end. Then sayd the image of Christ: Beléeue me mother, this matter shall be made manyfest. This doone, the Monke priuely departing, the chappell dores were shut. As soone as these things were scattered about the citie, by &amp; by ther was a great thronging of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Amongst whom also came foure monks, dissembling and fayning, that they knewe not what was there doone, and therfore they commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the doores to be opened, and after asked the Frier howe and after what sorte he came there. He answered them that he was caried by a spirite. And moreouer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>old them what woords the image had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and that he could by no means moue out of that place before that four of the chéefest Aldermen were come vnto him, vnto whom he had certaine things to be declared: he also desired to receyue the holy sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The Aldermen were foorthwith called, and then the Frier declared vnto them, how the Uirgin Mary lamented and sorrowed, for that the citie of <hi>Berna</hi> shold be shortly destroyed, for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing yerely pensions of the French king: Also for that thei droue not the <hi>Franciscans</hi> out of their citie, who honoured her with the fayned title of vndefiled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception. Unto this his talke the Aldermen answered very little. By and by the other Monkes gaue him the host infected with poyson, which when he refused to receyue, they brought him an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8810:26"/>
which he tooke, then they led him with great pompe into the quire, (for so they call the vppermost parte of the churche. The Frier &amp; the other foure Monkes were soone after called before the Aldermen, to testifie the truth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those things were so or not. But the foure fearing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedingly least he should bewray some thing, bicause they knew he suspected them, endeuored by al means to do him some priuie mischief by poyson giuen in his meat, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gaue him the sacrament dipped in poyson, which he presently cast vp againe by vomite: finally they so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed and tormented him by so many wayes, that in the end he left the Colledge and ran away, and opened the whole matter to diuers and sundry men. In the meane tyme the Monkes dispatched two legates or messangers to Rome, to obteyne a confirmation of these thyngs of the Pope, that hereafter it should be vtterly vnlawfull for any man to contrary or mislike the same. And when these messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were returned, (and as the Prouerbe is) thoughte them selues in a safe hauen, the noble Senate hadde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the foure Monkes to be fast kept in prison: for they had learned the whole circumstance of the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Frier, whom they had committed to ward. And sparing neither labour nor money, sent also vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might perfectly knowe, what they shoulde do in this matter. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende both the Frier &amp; the foure Monks were all put to torments, and there confessed all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>It was commonly reported, that in case the noble Senate of <hi>Berna</hi> hadde not prosecuted the matter with great constancie, and courage, the Cleargie woulde haue cloaked all the knauerie, and haue sette the authours at libertie. For they had greate cause to doubte, as it after

came to passe, lest they should léese their credit and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie amongst many of the orders of Monkes, &amp; that these things wheron the Popedome resteth, as it were vppon pillers, should now be had in great suspition with al men. For it is most euident that after the impietie, deceyt and wickednesse of these Monks began to be knowne abroade, the opinion of the cleargie began to decay, and to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected more and more euery day, of good and godly men: when as they sayd this or that soule required their helpe: that tapers lighted of their owne accorde: that this or that image spake, wept, or moued it selfe from place to place: that this or that Sainct endowed their monasterie with precious reliques: or that Crosses were sprinkeled with the bloud of Christ: yea and although they had obteyned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of these matters from the Pope, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing many afterwards would in no wise belèeue it to be so. Likewise they woulde not be persuaded, that this holy father fallyng into a traunce, sawe any miraculous thyngs: or that Frauncis and Catherin of <hi>Sena,</hi> bare the markes of Chrystes fyue woundes in their body.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, not without great cause, men began to doubte of transubstantiation of bread into the bodye of Christ, sith they had so often poysoned the sacrament: and also of those things which they chaunted vpon with open mouth, touching pardons, vigilies, orders, purgatorie, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water, and satisfaction. For that wée let passe many things, it is clerer then the day light, euen by this history, that many things haue bin beaten into the peoples heads touching these foresayde matters, which were only deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and inuented by these idle bellies.</p>

               <p>In the yeare (sayth he) of our Lord 1534. the <hi>Franciscan</hi> Monks played a bloudy and deadly pageant at <hi>Orleaunce</hi> in <hi>Fraunce.</hi> The Maiors wife of the same citie, when she died, commaunded in hir will, that she shoulde be buried without any pompe or noise, solemnly vsed at that time. (So also <hi>VVilliam Bude,</hi> a rare and singular ornament of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> lying on his death bed at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1540. in the month of August, lefte commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his frends to bury him without any great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie and pompe.) The womans husbande, who reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced the memoriall of his wyfe, did euen as she had wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and because she was buried in the Churche of the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> besides hir father and grandfather, gaue them in rewarde only sixe crownes, whereas they hoped for a farre greater pray. Shortly after it chaunced that as he fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led certeine wooddes, and sold them, they desired him to giue vnto them some parte of it fréely without money: whiche he flatly denied. This they tooke very gréeuously, and whereas before they misliked him, they deuised thys meanes to be reuenged: forsooth to reporte that his wife was damned for euer. The chiefe workemen and framers of this tragedy were <hi>Colimannus,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus Atreba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensij,</hi> both doctors of diuinitie, and <hi>Colimannus</hi> a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8810:28"/>
hauing all his implements in a redinesse, which he woonted to vse in such businesse: and thus they handled the matter. They place ouer the arche of the church a yong no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: he about midnight when they came to mumble their prayers (as they were wont to do) maketh a great ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling &amp; noise: out of hand the Monks began to coniure &amp; charme, but he answereth nothing, then béeing required to giue a signe whether he were a dumbe Spirit or no, he begins to rumble &amp; stirre again: which thing they toke as a certaine signe. Hauing layde this fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacion, they go vnto certain ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, chief men &amp; such as fauored them, declaring that a heauy chance had hapned at home, in their monasterie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not shewing what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter was, but desiring them to come to their mattens at midnight. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those citizens were come &amp; that prayers wer now begun, the counterfet Spirite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to make a maruellous noise in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> top of the church, and being asked what he ment, and who he was, he giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> signes that it is not lawful for him to speak: Therfore they commaunde him to make answer by tokens and signes, to certeine thinges they woulde demaunde of him. Nowe was there a hole made in the vaute, through the which he might heare and vnderstande the voice of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurer: and then had he in his hande a little boorde which at euery question he strake in suche sorte as he might easyly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

First therefore they aske him whether he were one of them that had bin buried in the same place, afterwards they reckning vp many by name which hadde bin buried there, at the laste also name the maiors wife: &amp; there by and by, the Spirite gaue the signe that he was hir soule. He was further asked whether he were damned or no, and if he were, for what deserte or faute? Whether for couetousenesse, or wanton lust, for pride, or want of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or whether it were for heresie, and for the secte of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> newly sprong vp? Also what he meante by that noise and sturre he kept there? Whether it were to haue the

body nowe buried in holy grounde to be digged vp agayn, &amp; to be layd in some other place? To al the which points, he answered by signes as he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, by the which he affirmed, or denyed any thing, according as he strake the boorde twise or thrise together. And when he had thus geuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderstande, that the very cause of his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was <hi>Luthers</hi> heresie, and that the body must néeds be digged vp againe, the monks request y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citizens (whose presence they had vsed) that they would beare witnesse of those things which they had séene with their eyes, and that they would subscribe to suche things, as were done a fewe dayes before. The citizens taking good aduise on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, least they should offende the maior, or bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in trouble, refuse so to do: but the Monks notwithstanding take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence the swéete bread, which they call y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> host, &amp; body of our Lord, together with all the reliques of saints, &amp; cary the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to an other place, &amp; there say their Masse.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8810:29"/>
The like doth the chancelor, master <hi>Anthonius Pratensis,</hi> Cardinall and legate for the Pope, throughout <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Therefore when they hadde no exception to alleage, they were conueyed vnto <hi>Paris</hi> and there constreyned to make their aunswere: but yet coulde nothing be wroong out of them by confession. Whervpon they were put a parte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers prisons, the Nouice béeing kepte in the house of master <hi>Fumaeus,</hi> one of the Aldermen, who being often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times examined &amp; earnestly requested to vtter the truthe, woulde notwithstanding confesse nothing, because he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Monks would afterwards put him to death, for stayning their order, and putting it to open shame: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudges had made him sure promise, that he should escape punishment, and that hée should neuer come into their handling, he ripped vp vnto them the whole matter, as it was done, and being brought before his felowes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched the same to their faces. The Monks albeit they were by these meanes conuicted, and almost taken tardy with the déede doing, yet did they refuse the Iudges, brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and vaunting them selues on their priuileages: but al in vaine: for sentence passed on them, and they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: that they being caried backe againe to <hi>Orleaunce,</hi> and there cast in prison, shoulde finally be broughte foorth to the chiefe Church of the citie openly, and from thence to the place of execution, where they should make open co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their trespasses. But there chaunced at the very same time a greuouse persecution against the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which was the cause why that sentence, (albeit it was too gentle for so great an offence) was neuer put in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For they feared much, because <hi>Luthers</hi> name was odious euery where, least if any sharpe iudgement hadde passed, they should not so muche haue punished the offenders, as shamed their order: and many supposed that whatsoeuer had hapned vnto them, would haue bin a pleasant and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pageaunt and spectacle for the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> Now the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Al the while they were in prison, they wanted nothing: for there was bestowed vpon them, especially by women, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry largelie, for to serue for their liuing, and to purchase to them helpe and fauoure. Except these persecutions &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which we spake of before, had hindred the matter, the king (as many reported) was fully determined, to haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne their house, and made it euen with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground.</p>

The Bishop aunswered: only sayde he for this cause, for that I haue not sayde ouer my Canonicall houres in due time distinctly as I shoulde haue done: for I was in the Emperors Court busied and occupied with matters of his priuie Counsell, in the morning hudling vp all my prayers at once, all the rest of the daye I was troubled with other busines: and for that cause do I now suffer this punishment of miserable heat. But let vs both

togither call vnto Almightie God, that it may please him to restore thy hand againe, which came presently to passe assoone as they had thus sayde. And then spake he to the Monke saying: Go my sonne and desire the brethren of our Church, as also al other of the Clergie ther, to poure out their prayers for mée, to giue almes to the poore and néedie, and to perseuer incessantly in offring vp continual sacrifice for me, for so sone as these things shalbe fulfilled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shall be deliuered out of these my torments, and shal be ioyfully translated to the fellowship of those blessed Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of heauen, which do earnestly desire my company. Out of this historie this argument or reason they make: Yf that good and Godly Byshop, who being ouercharged with affaires of the Emperor leading to publike wealth, could not dispatche his talke of prayers in due time, and therefore is so miserably vexed and tormented, what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment may they looke for, which hauing no necessarie businesse, say ouer the Canonicall houres very coldely, or else leaue them cleane vnsayde, that they maye the better followe there owne lustes and vaine deuises?

laughing and rayling at them: for then they threw grauel stones at them, or hurt them by some other means. These are especially haunting in pittes, where mettall moste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth.</p>
               <p>A certayn godly and lerned man wrote once vnto me, of a siluer mine at <hi>Dauosium</hi> in the <hi>Alpes,</hi> vpon the which <hi>Peter Buol</hi> a noble man, the Schultish of the same place, (whom they cal <hi>Landammanus,</hi>) had bestowed great cost a fewe yeres before, and had gathered therby good store of riches. In the same myne was a spirite or Diuell of the mountayne, who when the laborers filled the stuffe they had digged into their vessels, he séemed, for the most parte, euery Fryday, to be very busie, pouring the mettals of his owne accord out of one basket into an other. Wherewith the Schultishe was not offended: and when he would ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther descende into the pit, or come vp agayne, blessyng him selfe with the signe of the Crosse, he neuer receyued hurt. It chaunced on a tyme that whyle the sayde spirit was too busie intermedlyng himselfe with euery thing, one of the myners being offended therewith, began to rayle at hym very bitterly, and with terrible cursing wordes, byd him get him thence in the diuels name. But the spirit caught him by the pate, and so writhed his necke about, that his face stoode behynde his backe, yet notwithstanding he was not slaine, but liued a long time after, well knowne vnto diuers of his familiar friends, whiche yet liue at this day, howbeit he died within a fewe years after.</p>

               <p>Suche an other was <hi>Snebergius,</hi> who wearyng a black roll about his necke, tooke vp a labourer aloft from the grounde, and sette him in the brinke of a certayne excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding déepe place, where had sometyme bene great store of siluer, not without gréeuous brusing of his body.</p>
               <p>And againe he saith, there be some very milde and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, whome some of the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Cobali,</hi> as the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do, bycause they be as it were apes and counterfeiters of men: for they leaping, and skipping for ioy do laughe, and séeme as though they did many things, when in very déede they doo nothing. And some other call them Elues, or Dwarfes of the Mountaynes, thereby notyng theyr small stature, wherein they commonly appeare. They séeme to bée hoare, wearyng apparayle lyke the mettall fyners, that is, in a petycote laced, and an apron of lether about their loynes. These hurte not the laborers, excepte they misuse them, but do imitate them in all their doings. And he sayth, they are not much vnlike vnto those whom the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Guteli,</hi> bycause they séeme to beare good affection towards men, for they kéepe horses, and do other necessary businesse. They are also lyke vnto them whom they cal <hi>Trulli,</hi> who taking on them the fayned shapes of men and women, do serue as it is sayd, like seruants, both amongst other nations, &amp; specially amongst the <hi>Suetians.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. That there happen straunge vvonders and prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that sodeyn noises and cracks and such like, are hearde before the death of men, before battaile, and before some notable alterations and chaunges.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T happeneth many times, that when men lye sicke of some deadly disease, there is some thing heard going in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chamber, like as the sicke men were wonte, when they were in good health: yea &amp; the sicke parties them selues, do many times hear the same, and by and by gesse what wil come to passe. Oftentimes a litle before they yeld vp the ghost, and some time a little after their death, or a good while after, either their owne shapes, or some other shaddowes of men, are apparantly séene. And diuers times it commeth to passe, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some of our acquaintaunce or friends lye a dying, albeit they are many miles off, yet there are some great stirrings or noises heard. Sometimes we thinke the house will fall on our heads, or that some massie and waightie thing falleth downe throughout all the house, rendring and making a disordered noise: and shortlie within fewe monthes after, we vnderstande that those things happened, the very same houre that our friends departed in. There be some men, of whose stocke none doth dye, but that they obserue and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8810:50"/>
marke some signes and tokens going before: as that they heare the dores and windowes open and shut, that some thing runneth vp the staires, or walketh vp and downe the house, or doth some one or other such like thing.</p>
               <p>But here I cannot passe this in silence: that there are many superstitious men, which vainly persuade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues that this cousin, and this or that friend of theirs wil short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye. For in the end, the falling out of the matter it selfe sheweth it was a vayne and folishe persuasion, that they vnderstod suche things by any signes.</p>

                     <hi>Cardanus.</hi>
                  </note> out of the which so often as any one died, there was séene an olde woman in the chimney corner. On a certaine tyme shée appeared, when a mayden of the same familie laye very sicke, and therefore they cleane dispayred of hir life: but soone after she recouered againe, and in the meane while, an other, which was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in good helth, sodainly dyed.</p>
               <p>There was a certaine parishe priest, a very honest and godly man, whom I knewe well, who in the plague time, could tell before hand, when any of his parishe should dye. For in the night time he heard a noise ouer his bed, like as if one had throwne downe a sacke full of corne from his shoulders: which when he heard, he would say: Nowe an other biddeth me farewell. After it was day, he vsed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire who died that night, or who was taken with the plague, to the end he might comfort and strengthen them, according to the duty of a good pastour.</p>
               <p>It hath bin often obserued in Guilde halles where Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen sit, that when one of those Aldermen was at the point of death, there was hearde some ratling about hys seate, or some other certeine signe of death. The same thing happeneth beside pewes and stalles in Churches, or in other places where men are often conuersaunt or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to exercise their handy labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:8810:50"/>In Abbeys, the Monks seruaunts or any other falling sicke, many haue heard in the night, preparation of chests for them, in such sorte as the coffinmakers did afterwards prepare in déede.</p>
               <p>In some country villages, when one is at deaths dore, many times there are some heard in the Euening, or in the night, digging a graue in the Churcheyarde, and the same the next day is so found digged, as these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did heare before.</p>
               <p>There haue bin séene some in the night whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moone shined, going solemnlie with the corps, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the people, or sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding before the dores, as if some bodie were to be caried to the Church to burying. Many suppose, they sée their owne image, or as they saye, theyr owne soule, and of them diuers are verily persuaded, that except they dye shortlie after they haue séene them selues, they shall liue a very great time after. But these things are superstitious. Let euery man so prepare him selfe, as if he shoulde dye to morrowe, left by being too secure, he purchase himselfe harme.</p>
               <p>There happen other straunge things also. For when some lye in the prison in chaynes, readie to suffer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for their offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, many times in the night season there is heard a great noise and rumbling, as if some body were breaking into the gayle to deliuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prisoners. When me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, they can neither heare, nor sée any body, and the prisoners likewise say they heard no manner thing.</p>
               <p>Some executioners or ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gmen do report, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the most part they knowe before hand whether any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be deliuered into their hands to suffer: for their swords will moue of their owne accord. And there are other that saie, they can tell before, after what sorte the prisoners shall suffer.</p>
               <p>Many wonderfull and straunge things happen about
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8810:51"/>
those which wilfully cast away the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. Somtime their corpses must be caryed a great way off, before they béeing thrust in a sacke can be throwne into the sea: and béeing layd in a waggon or cart, the horse could scant draw them downe the hill, but vp the hill they néed not labour at all, for the carte woulde runne very fast of his owne accorde.</p>
               <p>Some men béeing slayne by théeues, when the théeues come to the dead body, by and by there gusheth out freshe blood, or else there is declaration by other tokens, that the théefe is there present. <hi>Plato</hi> writeth in the firste booke of his lawes, that the soules of suche as haue ben slayne, doo oftentymes cruelly molest and trouble the soules of those whiche slewe them. For whiche cause <hi>Marsilius Fiscinus</hi> doth thinke it chaunceth,<note place="margin">

               <p>The like place is in <hi>Horace</hi> &amp; in other Poets. As a théef sitteth at the Table, a cuppe béeing ouerthrowne, the wyne perceth through the whole and sounde wodde of the table, to all mens admiration.</p>
               <p>Touching these and other such maruellous things there might be many histories and testimonies alleaged. But whosoeuer readeth this booke, may call to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, that they haue séene these and suche like things them selues, or that they haue heard them of their friends and acquaintaunce and of such as deserue sufficient credit.</p>

to the vsuall course of nature. Which things me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cal, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, signes, monsters, and forewarnings of matters to come. There are séene in the aire, swords, speares, &amp; suche like innumerable: there are heard and séene in the aire, or vppon the earth whole armies of men encountring togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one part is forced to flye, there is heard hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible cries, and great clattering of armour. Gunnes, laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and halberdes, with other kindes of weapons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, do often times moue of their owne accord as they lye in the armories. When as souldiers marche towards their enimies, and their ensignes will not displaie abroade but folde about the stander bearers heads: if the souldiours be therewith amazed, they surely persuade themselues there is some greate slaughter towards. It is sayde also, that horses will be very sad and heauie, and will not lette their masters sit on their backs, before they go to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile wherin they shall haue the ouerthrowe: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are coragious and iustilie neighing, it is a sure token of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth, that the company of horses which <hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> let run at libertie,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y all these examples we may plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that many straunge things are obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to mens senses, &amp; that sometimes spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are séene and heard not only (as some haue thought, as <hi>Plutarke</hi> witnesseth in the life of <hi>Dion</hi>) of children, women, sicke folkes, dottards, &amp; otherwise very plaine and simple creatures, but also to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good corage, and such as haue bin perfectly in their wits. Yet it may not bée denied but that there appeare many more vnto some, that vnto other some, as vnto trauellers, watchemen, hunters, carters, and marriners, who leade all their life not only in the day time, but also in night, in iorneying, in the water, woods, hills and vallies. You shal mete with some one who neuer sawe nor heard any of this geare in all his life time, and contrariwise there be other some whyche haue séene and hearde very man suche things.</p>
               <p>So there are some which very seldom chaunce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, &amp; agayne many there are which oftentimes méets with them in their iorney. The common people say, that those whose natiuities chaunce vppon the Auguries (for so they terme the foure seasons of the yeare) do sée more store of Spirites, than those whiche are borne at other tymes, but these are méere trifles. Those whiche are stedfaste in true faithe, see or heare suche thiyngs more seldome than superstitiouse people, as in all other things. Hée that is superstitiouse, vseth some blessing (as they call it) to heale hys horses disease, and it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good effecte: he inchaunteth a Serpente, and it can not once moue out of the place. He applyeth a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng to straunge bleedyng, and it stoppeth presentely:

He taketh a hollie rod, or twisted wand incha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, &amp; it wil moue where a mettle mine is: but he that is of a sounde fayth and doth despise these things, (for he knoweth well they are contrary to the word of god, &amp; also to the Popes decrées) albeit perchaunce he practise such things, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he can bring nothing to passe. And so also it chaunceth that he séeth spirites and vaine visions, a great deale more seldome than superstitious men do, for hée knoweth wel what hée ought to déeme and iudge of them. There are some kinde of men, who thinke it a gay thing, if many suche straunge sightes appeare vnto them.</p>
               <p>There were farre many more of these kindes of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions and myracles séene amongest vs, at suche tyme as we were giuen vnto blindnesse and superstition, than since that the Gospell was purely preached amongest vs: the cause whereof I will shewe heareafter.</p>
               <p>And moreouer it commeth often times to passe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Some men see things whiche other men see not.</hi>
                  </note> that some one man doth heare or sée some thing most plainly, when an other which standeth by him, or walketh wyth him, neyther séeth, nor heareth any such matter.</p>
               <p>We reade in the Historie of <hi>Heliseus,</hi> that he saw cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riottes of fire, and many horsemen vpon the toppe of the Mountaine: and yet hys seruaunt sawe nothing vntil the Prophet prayed vnto the Lord, that he woulde voutsafe for hys confirmation and consolation, to open hys eyes, that he might also beholde this notable miracle. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we reade in the 9. chapter of the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that Christ ouerthew Paule before <hi>Damascus,</hi>

If a spirit apeared, or was heard to say in case these or those things be decréed, to wit, vowed Pilgrimage, and erecting Chappelles, and that this shall be an acceptable kynde of worship vnto God, the Bishoppes and paryshe Priestes weighed not whither those things were agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word of God or no. &amp;c. Spirits appeared in old time, and do appeare still in these dayes both day &amp; night, but especially in the night, and before midnighte in our first sléep.

Spirits haue somtimes appeared in a pleasant fourme, and somtimes in a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shape. At one time some hath bene séene riding on horsebacke, or going on foote, or crawling vppon al foure. At another time hath appeared a man al burning in fire, or berayde with bloud: and some while, his bowells haue séemed to traile out, his belly being as it were rypped vp. Sometimes a shadowe hath only appeared: sometimes a hand, sometimes an instrument, as a staffe, a sworde, or some such like thing which the spirite helde in his hande. Somtimes he appeared in maner of a bundle of hey, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on fire: another while onely a hoarse kinde of voyce was heard. Sometimes a spirit hath bene heard walking in the inner parte of the house, turning the leaues of a booke, or telling money, or playing at dice, or bounsing against the wall. And sometimes there is heard a terrible noyse or clap, as if a peale of Gunnes were discharged hard at hand. And spirits sometimes, taking a man by the

Which opinion <hi>Tertullian</hi> also confuteth. <hi>Plato</hi> in his 9. booke <hi>De legibus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plato.</hi>
                  </note> writeth, that the soules of those which are slayne, do pursue their murtherers so far, that they do hurt them: the which except it be vnderstoode by way of a Metaphor, is likewise to be reiected.</p>
               <p>The Catholik faith amongst the Iewes was, that the soules of the dead did not return into this erth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Iewes opinion.</hi>
                  </note> but either were at rest, which was when they dyed in the faythe of the promised <hi>Messias,</hi> or were condemned if they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hence in their sinnes withoute repentaunce. For Iob in his 7. chapter sayth: Euen as the cloude vanisheth and fadeth away,<note place="margin">

And that soules do returne after deathe, do offer themselues to be séene and beheld of men, and require ayde of them, we find no wher in the old Testament, but rather the contrary. In the 2. of Samuel 12.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Samu.</hi> 12.</note> Dauid speaketh this of his yong childe that he begat by Bersaba, that he could not bring him into life againe, that he would go to him, and the chyld should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer returne vnto him againe. And Iesus the sonne of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach in his .38. chapter sayth:<note place="margin">

               <p>And that in latter ages, long after Christ came in flesh, there were some amongest the Iewes, who thought that the soules seperated from their bodies, dyd straye and raunge a broade: it may hereby be gathered, for that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Rabbines write, that the soule of Naboth (which was slayne, bycause he woulde not sell his Uyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde to Achab) was that Spirite that promised his helpe to seduce Achab, béeing as it were one that coueted his death.</p>

               <p>The first place or receptacle is <hi>Caelum Empireum,</hi> the firie heauen, so termed of his passing gret brightnesse and glorie, which they say is the seate ordeined for the blyssed sort: this place by an other in Scripture is called <hi>Paradise.</hi> The second place is Hel vnder the earth, being the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Deuils and Infidels, departing hence in deadely sinne, without repentance. The third place they tearme <hi>Limbus puerorum,</hi> whiche is prouided as wel for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the faythful as of the vnfaythfull: who (they say)
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8810:62"/>
shal continually abyde there without any sense of payne, being only depriued from the fruition of Gods presence. And therefore they say, that after their death, they ought not to be buried in holy buriall. The fourth place is Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, whiche is prepared for them that departe hence without deadly sin, or if they committed any such sinnes, dyd some penance for them, but yet made full satisfaction for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or else went hence only stayned with venial sinne.</p>
               <p>Of this place, to wit, Purgatorie, Popish writers teach maruellous things. Some of them say, that Purgatorie is also vnder the earth as Hel is. Some say that Hell and Purgatorie are both one place, albeit the paines be diuers according to the deserts of soules. Furthermore they say, that vnder the earth there are more places of punishment in which the soules of the dead may be purged. For they say, that this or that soule hath ben séene in this or that mountaine, floud, or valley, where it hath committed the offence: &amp; that these are particuler Purgatories, assigned vnto them for some special cause, before the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after which time all maner of Purgatories, aswell general as particuler shal cease. Some of them say, that the paine of Purgatorie is al one with the punishment of hel, &amp; that they differ only in this, that the on hath an end, the other no ende: and that it is far more easie to endure all the paynes of this worlde, which al men since Adams time haue susteined, euen vnto the day of the last Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to beare one dayes space the least of those two punishmentes.</p>
               <p>Further they holde that our fire, if it be compared with the fire of Purgatorie, doth resemble only a painted fire. Séeke their Doctours in this poynte, on the fourth booke of Sentences, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Richardus de Media villa</hi> a <hi>Franciscan</hi> frier, writeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Maister of Sentences, &amp; sayth, he verily beléeueth that soules are caried by good Angels, into the places of torment, but yet that they themselues do not torment them, bycause they shall become at length fellow citizens with them. Neyther yet are they punished by Deuils (who after this life do no longer tempte men) but only by the méere iustice of God. And yet (saith he) it may so come to passe, that the Deuils be present at the doing thereof, and reioyce at their tortures. I thought good to repeate these things of Purgatorie somewhat at large, the rather for that the reader might sée, that their Doctours do disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée in a matter of great weight, by which they haue both robbed men of their wealth, and plunged them into very great myserie.</p>
               <p>Héervnto they adde, that the spirites, aswel of the good, as the yl,<note place="margin">

And that by the common lawe of iustice, all men at the day of Iudgement shall come to their trial from hell: and that none before that time can come from thence. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they teach, that by Gods licence &amp; dispensation, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, yea before the day of Iudgement, are permitted to come out of hell, and that not for euer, but only for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for the instructing and terrifying of the lyuing. Héer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon they recite diuers kinde of visions, that certaine Clarkes, and Laye persons being damned, bothe men and women, haue appeared to their ghostly fathers, and others, and haue opened vnto them the causes of their da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: all which to rehearse héere were lost laboure.

soules to returne from those two places, partely for the comfort and warning of the liuing, and partly to pray aide of them. And yet that those soules doo not here represent themselues to be séene of men, when, and how often soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they list themselues. No doubt these men shew them selues to haue a sharpe wit and profounde knowledge.</p>
               <p>These doctours moreouer moue this question, whether we may request without offence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Whether we may wishe to see spirits.</hi>
                  </note> that the soules of suche as are departed may shewe themselues to be behelde and séene of the liuing.</p>
               <p>To ryue asunder this crabbed knotte, they bring thys wedge: that if this request procéede of some good intent, without the spot of lightnesse and vanitie, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might vnderstand the state of some frend, neighbor, benefactour, or of his parents, or some other, therby to help &amp; relieue them spéedily of their torments, it is no offence at all: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause dead mens soules doo of their owne accorde shewe themselues vnto the lyuyng, to receyue helpe of them, and therfore nothing can let vs to aske this thing at gods hande. Of this opinion is Thomas of Aquine.</p>
               <p>But as concernyng the tyme and place, when and where Spirites doe proffer them selues to bée séene, they saye, no certayne rule can be giuen: for this standeth wholly in Gods pleasure, who if he list to deliuer any, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth him to make his appearaunce foorthwith euen in such places as he may be well heard in. And that spirits do not alwaies appeare vnder a visible shape, but sometimes inuisibly, in so much that sometime nothing els is heard of them but snéesing, spitting, syghing, &amp; clapping of hands &amp;c. Of which point I haue noted somewhat before when I spake generally of ghosts, bycause they appeare in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry sorts. And whersoeuer these spirits be, they say, that they endure punishment. Besides that soules do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, nor answeare vnto euery mans interrogatories, but that of a great number they scantlie appeare vnto one.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8810:64"/>
And therefore they teache.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Howe a man ought to vse him self when spirits appeare according to the Papists. Daniel.</hi> 10.11.</note> Whensoeuer suche visions of spirits are shewed, men should vse fasting and prayer or euer they demaund any question of them: which (say they) in the x. and xj. chapters of Daniell, is read to haue ben done by Daniell him selfe. Besides this, shrift, and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing shoulde bée vsed ere we question with them: farther, that we should not giue credite assoone as we heare but one signe, but waite to heare the same thrice repeated, whiche in the first booke of Samuel and 3. chapter is reade to haue bin done by Samuell being yet a childe:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Samuel.</hi> 3.</note> for otherwise the Diuell may delude and deceyue vs, as he doth very often. And so soone as these things are dispatched and performed, that foure or fiue deuoute priests are to be sent for, whych should come to the place where the spirite was woont to shewe him selfe, and that they should vse certeine ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as to take a candle that hath bin halowed on Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse day, &amp; light it: also holy water, the signe of the crosse, a censor in their hande, and when they light their candle, should pray ouer it (as I remember) the seuen penitential psalmes, or reade the gospell of S.

               <p>O Lord Iesu Christ, the sercher of al secrets, which art always woont to reueale healthfull and profitable things vnto thy faithful people &amp; little ones, which haste permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some certain spirite to shew himselfe in this place: wée humbly beséech thée of thy great mercy, by thy death &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and by the sheding of thy most precious bloud for our sinnes, that thou wilt vouchesafe to giue in charge to this spirite, that he may declare and open what he is, without any fraying or hurting of vs, or of any other creature besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: shewing vnto vs thy seruaunts, or to other sinners as we be, who he is, why he is come, and what he desireth, so

that hereby thou mayst be honored, he comforted, and thy faithfull people also holpen and succored. In the name of the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost. Amen.</p>
               <p>Yet do they teache, that a man may choose to vse this or some other forme of prayer, and ceremonies: bicause that without these, spirites haue often appeared, &amp; shewed what they required. This doon, we shold (as they teach) fall to questioning with them, and say: Thou spirite, we beséech thée by Christ Iesus, tell vs what thou art, and if there be any amongst vs, to whom thou wouldest gladly make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, name him, or by some signe declare so much. After this, the question is to be moued, eche man there presente being recited whether he wold aunswere vnto this or that man.

Farther by how many Masses y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may be compassed, by, iij.vj.x.xx.xxx. &amp;c. Furthermore, what maner of priests should say Masse for him, Monks, or secular Priests. Then if he aske for any Fasting, by what persons, howe long, and in what sorte he woulde haue it doone: If he require almes déedes, what almes déedes they should be, how many, and on what persons bestowed, whether on him that lacketh harbour, or that is diseased of the leprosie, or on some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of people.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, by what signe it may be perfectly known y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is released, and for what cause he was firste shut vp in Purgatorie.

accustomed. And if the spirite will shewe no signe at that tyme, the matter should be deferred vnto some other sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, vntill the spirite woulde shewe hymselfe agayne: and yet that the crosse and holy water should be left there, for that by the secret iudgement of God, it was ordeyned, that they shold appeare at certeine houres, and to certeine persons, and not vnto all men. And farther they say that we néede not to feare, that the spirit would do any bodily hurte vnto that persone, vnto whome it doth appeare. For if such a spirit would hurte any, he might iustlie be suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he were no good spirit.</p>
               <p>Moreouer popishe writers teache vs to discerne good spirits from euill by foure meanes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>By what to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens good spirits may be discerned from euill. Luke.</hi> 1.</note> First they say that if he be a good spirit, he will at the beginning, somewhat ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie men, but againe soone reuiue and comforte them. So <hi>Gabriel</hi> with comfortable words did lifte vp the blessed virgin which before was sore troubled by this salutation. They also alleage other examples. Their second note is to discry them by their outward and visible shape. For if they appeare vnder the forme of a Lyon, beare, dog, tode, serpent, catte, or blacke ghoste, it may easly be gathered that it is an euill spirit. And that on the other side good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do appeare vnder the shape of a doue, a man, a lambe, or in the brightnesse, and clere light of the sunne.</p>
               <p>We must also consider whether the voice whiche we heare be swéete, lowly, sober, sorowfull, or otherwise ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and full of reproch, for so they terme it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we must note, whether the spirit teache ought that doth varie from the doctrine of the apostles, and other doctoures approued by the Churches censure: or whether he vtter any thing that dothe dissent from the faith, good maners, and ceremonies of the church, according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall rites or decrées of councels, &amp; against the lawes of the holy Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly we must take diligent héede whether in hys

words, déeds, and gestures, he do shew forth any humilitie acknowledging or confessing of his sinnes &amp; punishments, or whether we heare of him any groning, wéeping, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, boasting, threatning, slaunder or blasphemie. For as the begger doth reherse his owne miserie, so likewyse doo good spirits that desire any helpe or deliuerance.

So that when men by little and little, forsooke holy Scripture, and cast it asyde, mens traditions and precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes began streight way to be had in great price and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea, they were more regarded tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gods owne worde. A great offence was it taken to be, if any would presume once to breake mens traditions. On those apparitions of spirits, as on a sure foundation their Purgatorie is chiefly builded. For by talke hadde with them, Popishe writers taught that men atteined vnto saluation, by their owne, and by other mens merits: which opinion so blinded them, that they became retchlesse, secure, and sluggishe.

The which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the diuell first broughte in, thereby to diminishe the Martyrs prayse and glorie, that so the Sorcerers mighte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lea those persons, whose wicked trauell &amp; help they vsed, &amp; those matters saith he, ar far from truth. For he proueth by the Scripture, that the spirites of the godly are not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the Diuels, nor yet do stray abroade af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deathe: then that they woulde retourne vnto theyr owne bodyes, if they myghte wander whether they lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. And further if they dydde any seruice too theyr Murderers, by that meanes they should at their handes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8810:71"/>
receyue a reward for an yll déede and displeasure. By na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason also it can not come to passe, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body should be turned into an other body, and therfore also the spirite of a man can not be chaunged into a deuill.</p>
               <p>But among other things which proprely belong to our purpose, he sayth: If we heare a noyse that sayth, I am suche a soule, we muste thus thinke, that thys talke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth of some sleight and subtiltie of the deuill, and that it is not the soule of the dead body that speketh these things, but the Deuill that deuiseth them to deceyue the hearers. And by and by he sayeth, that these are to be counted olde wiues words, or rather doting fooles toyes to mocke chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren withall. For the soule when it is parted from the body cannot walke any longer in these parties. For the soules of the iust are in the hands of God. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, the soules of the wicked after their departure hence, are straightway lead aside and withdrawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, which may euidently be séene by Lazarus &amp; the rich man. And in another place also the Lorde sayth: This day will they take thy soule from thée, wherefore the soule cannot here wander when it is departed from the body.</p>
               <p>A little afterwarde he addeth, that it may be proued out of many places of scripture, that the soules of the iust doo not here wander after death. For Steuen saide, Lorde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my Spirit, and Paule desired to be loosed and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte hence, and to be with Christ.</p>
               <p>Also the scripture, as touching the patriarks death, vseth this phrase, he is layde vnto his fathers, growen vp vnto a good olde age. And that the soules of sinners and wicked men cannot after their departure here abide any longer, we may learne by the riche mans words, if we will wey and consider with our selues what he demaunded &amp; coulde not obteine. For if after death mens soules might any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger haue their conuersation here on earth, no doubte the riche man him selfe woulde haue retourned as his desire
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8810:71"/>
was, and certified his friends of hell torments. Out of which place of scripture it is most cleare, that soules im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vpon their departure from their body, are caried vnto a certein place, whence they cannot of themselues returne, but néeds must wait there for that terrible daye of iudgement.</p>
               <p>Also in his seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d homily of Lazarus, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other things he saith, It is most playne not only by that we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearsed, but also by this parable, that soules par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the body, haue their abiding here no longer, but are forthwith lead away. For it came to passe (saith he) that he died, and was caried away by the Angels. And not only the soules of the iust, but of the vniust and wicked are hence lead away, &amp; caried to their proper places, which doth euidently appeare, by another rich man, of which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made in the 12. of Luke, to whome the Lorde said: Thou foole this night will they take thy soule from thée.</p>
               <p>And in hys fourthe homily of Lazarus he plainly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that we should giue more credite to holy Scripture, than to one that came from the dead, or an Angell from Heauen. Herewithall he also sheweth that the dead do not only make no apperance vnto men liuing, but yeldeth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons wherfore they do not returne hither, in these words. If god had knowen that the dead being raised might haue profited the liuing, he would neuer haue let passe so great a benefite, who otherwise dothe giue and prouide vs all things profitable.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he addeth, that if it were requisite still to raise vp dead men, to make relation vnto vs of such things as there are done, this no doubt in continuaunce of time would haue bin neglected: and so the Diuell very easily would haue broched and brought in damnable opinions into the world. For he might often haue made counterfeit sights or suborne suche as should fayne their selues to be dead and buried and by &amp; by to present themselues before
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8810:72"/>
men, as if they had bin in déede raised from death, and by suche manner of persons might so haue bewitched simple soules, that they would beleue whatsoeuer he would haue. For if now when there is in déede no such thing, the vayn dreames as it were of men decessed, that haue bin shewed to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in sleep, haue deceyued, peruerted &amp; destroyed many: surely much sooner wold the same haue fallen out, if it had bin a thing truly done, &amp; this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had preuailed in mens heads. For if many dead persons had retourned backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into this life, the wicked spirit the diuell would easily haue deuised many sleights &amp; wiles, &amp; brought in much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore god hath cleane shut vp this dore of deceit, &amp; not permitted any dead ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to returne hither &amp; shewe what things be done in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other life, least y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuell might gredely catch this occasion to plant his frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t policies. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets were, he raised vp false prophets: when the Apostles were, he stirred vp false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ appeared in flesh, he sent hither false Christs or Antechrists: And when sincere &amp; sound doctrin was taught, he brought into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world corrupt &amp; damnable opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, sowing tares whersoeuer he came. And therfore although it had come to passe, that dead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, yet wold he haue counterfeited y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same also by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, by some fained raising of the dead through the blinding &amp; bewitching of mens eyes: or otherwise by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning of some whiche should feine themselues to be dead (as I said before) he would haue turned al things topsitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and vtterly haue confounded them. But god who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth all things, hath stopped his way, that he should not thus deceyue vs, and of his great mercy towards vs, hath not permitted that at any time any shold returne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; tel vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing, such things as there are done, héerby to instruct vs that we shold be of this opinion &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the scriptures oughte to be beleued before other things whatsoeuer, bycause that God in them hath most clerely

taught vs the doctrine of the last resurrection. Further, by them he hath conuerted the whole world, banished error, brought in truth, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed al these things by vile &amp; base fishers, and finally in them hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs euery where plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull argumentes of his diuine prouidence. &amp;c.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. That the true Samuell did not appeare to the vvytche in Endor.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Owe touching the examples by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly alleaged, whiche do thinke that the soules of the dead do return again vnto the liuing vpon the earth: I wil first intreat of Samuels apparition, of which matter now adayes there is greate contention and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning. And (as I trust) I shal proue by strong argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that very Samuell himselfe did not appeare in soule and body, neither that his body was raised vp by the sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, which perchaunce then was rotten &amp; consumed vnto dust in the earth, neither y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his soule was called vp, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some diuelish spirite. First the author of the two boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of Samuel sayeth, that Saule did aske counsell of the Lord, &amp; that he would not answer him, neither by visions, nor by Urim, nor by his Prophets. Wherfore if God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned by his Prophetes yet liuing, and other ordinarie wayes to giue answer vnto him, whom he had alredy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, we may easily coniecture, that he would much lesse haue raysed a dead prophet to make him answer. And the rather, for that as we haue a little before sayde, the law of God hathe seuerely by a greate threatening, forbidden to learne oughte of the deade, and woulde not haue vs to searche for the truth of them, nor that any manne should vse dyuination by spyrites, and suche other diuelyshe Artes. Secondly, yf very Samuell in deede appeared, that muste of necessitie haue come to passe, eyther by the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8810:75"/>
will of God, or by the worke of arte Magike. But Gods will was not that Samuel should retourne. For he hath condemned Necromancie, and would not haue vs to aske counsell at the dead: &amp; that the spirit of God did that which was contrary herevnto, or did permitte the saints to do it, or was present with them that did ought contrary thereto, it may not be graunted. And that those things were done by the force and operation of Arte Magike, wée can not affirme. For the wicked spirit hath no rule or power ouer the soules of the faithfull to bring them out of their places when he lust, sith they be in the hand of God, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of Abraham, nay (which is lesse) he hath no power ouer filthy and vncleane swine, for he was driuen (as we reade in the viij. chapter of Matthew) to beg leaue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.</note> before he could enter into the heard of swine: and how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should he haue any power ouer the soule of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? yet can it not be denied, that God somtimes for certein causes doth giue the Diuell and his seruants, Magitians &amp; Necromancers, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to do many things, as to hurte and lame man &amp; beast, and to worke other straunge things. But that God dothe giue the Diuell leaue to raise dead bodies, or to call, bring forth, or driue away soules especially out of Heauen, it hathe no grounde at all in Scripture, neither can there be any reasonable cause alledged, wherefore God would or should giue the Diuell licence to do these things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the vsuall and common order, yea and against his owne expresse commaundement. For vayne and childishe is the cause hereof that is giuen of some men, that Samuell shoulde appeare to certifie and astonishe Saule: as if God coulde not haue feared hym by other wayes and meanes. Was he not before vtterly abashed &amp; dismayed? Thirdly, if Samuel were brought backe, the same was done either by his will and consent, or without the same, but that he did fréely and of his owne accorde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the sorcerers, no man I thinke is so blinde to imagin.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8810:75"/>
For that were vtterly repugnaunt to the Lawe of God, that he should confirme Witchcraft and Sorcerie by hys example. If the Witch had called for Samuell, whilest he liued, doutles he would not haue approched vnto hir. And how then can we beléeue that he came to hir after his death? We may not so say, that the Witch compelled him to resort to hir agaynst his wil: for the Deuil hath no power ouer the Soules of the godly, and Magike of it self is of no force.

In the new Testament the 10. chap of the Acts of the Apostles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Actes.</hi> 10.</note> we read that <hi>Cornelius</hi> met with Peter, fel down at his féet &amp; worshipped him, yet, so as he had ben an Embassadour from God &amp; not God himselfe, &amp; yet Peter lifted him vp &amp; said, arise for I my self am a man also. He said not to <hi>Cornelius</hi> thou dost wel herein: nor as his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Uicare (with a mischiefe) is wont to do, proffered hys foote vnto him to kysse. We may read also that Elias dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples worshipped Elizeus that succeded into his office, in which place the worde to bowe the knée, or fal downe, is vsed.

For who is he (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>) that wil be afraid to cal a man painted, a man, considering that without staggering, we are acustomed to giue eache thing his proper name, as soon as we behold the picture of the same: as when we take the viewe of a painted table, or wall, we say straight waye, this is <hi>Tullie,</hi> this is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust,</hi> hée <hi>Achilles,</hi> that other <hi>Hector,</hi> thys is the floude called <hi>Symois,</hi> that place tearmed <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof these

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E wil now come to the Confutation of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which mainteine, that very Samuel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe appeared to the Sorcersse, for he that rightly ouerthroweth his aduersaries arguments, is supposed by the same meanes to confirme his own cause. The chéefest
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8810:78"/>
arguments which our aduersaries vse, is taken out of the 46. chapter of Ecclesiasticus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccle.</hi> 46.</note> where these words are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Samuel before his death made protestation before God, &amp; before his anoynted, that he tooke from no man his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, no not so much as the value of a shoe, and no man could then reproue him. And after his deth he Prophesied and tolde the King of his ende. From the earth he lifte vp his voyce, and shewed that the wickednesse of the people should perish.</p>
               <p>This place somewhat troubled <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and other Godly Fathers. For if the Deuill onely appeared, and not Samuell, howe is it there sayde that he slept, that is, dyed, for the Deuill neyther sléepeth nor dieth. Héerevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I maye shape thys aunswere, that this booke is not to be numbred among the Canonical bokes of the olde Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, and that Doctrine in controuersies, cannot bée proued by the authoritie thereof, the whych Saincte <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> also confesseth in hys booke <hi>De cura pro mortuis agenda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But howesoeuer that be credited as true or false, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere them playnly, that Iesus the Sonne of Syraches intente was, to alleage the Storie literally, as the woordes lye, and not by reason to debate the matter, whether Samuell truely appeared or no. Hée spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth there according too the opynion of Saule and the Witche, whiche thought that Samuell hymselfe was raysed. Further they say, that hée whiche appeared vnto Saule, is sometymes expresly and in playne woordes called Samuell. And an vnséemely matter it were, making muche for the reproche of so greate a Prophete, if hys name hadde béene applyed vnto the Deuill. If say they, it hadde not béene Samuell, but some wicked Spirite, the Scripture woulde in some one woorde, or other haue noted the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:8810:78"/>To this Argument fyrst I aunswere, that euen in our common speache, it is an vsuall phrase by the figure <hi>Metonymia,</hi> to terme the Image by the name of the thyng, that it presenteth. So wée terme the Armes and Ensigne of a Noble man, by the name of that Lorde hymselfe, that giueth those Armes. We saye, this is <hi>Iulius Cesar, Nero,</hi> Saint Peter, Saint Paule, or here thou mayest sée the Cities of <hi>Tigurine,</hi> and <hi>Argentorat,</hi> also the Duke of <hi>Saringe,</hi> whereas in deed they are onely theyr Counterfeicts, or Armes, and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Honor.</p>
               <p>In a Commedie or Tragedie, wée call thys manne Saule, that Samuel, an other Dauid, whereas they do but betoken and represent their Personages. So saythe <hi>Vergill,</hi> in his fyrst booke of <hi>Aeneidos</hi>: They wonder at <hi>Aeneas</hi> gyftes, and haue <hi>Iulius</hi> in admiration. And yet was it not <hi>Iulius</hi> or <hi>Ascanius,</hi> but <hi>Cupide</hi> feining himselfe to bée <hi>Iulius,</hi> whereby hée myght the eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>libus Scripturae,</hi> sayth, that holie Scripture dothe sometymes applye the verie names of things to the Images and similitudes of the same. Hée alleageth there this example, that the foule spirit is called Samuel bycause hée dyd falsely beare Saule in hande, that hée was Samuell: whyche fraude of the Deuill, coulde no ways turne too Samuels reproch. For who would say, that it should bée a reproche for an honest manne, if some knaue would terme hymselfe by his name, as if hée were hée himselfe.</p>
               <p>The false Prophetes sayde, they were true Prophets, and Goddes Seruauntes, yea (which is more) they fained themselues too bée the verie <hi>Messias,</hi> the Sonne of God. And that Scripture doth not so muche as in one woorde make mention, that this was verie Samuell in déede,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8810:79"/>
but rather some spirite, we must think that it so came to passe, for this cause, that all men by the Lawe of God might vnderstand, that Magike and enquirie of things at the dead, dyd much displease God. Saule himselfe before by the counsell and motion of Samuell, slewe all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians that he could any where finde. And God is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed in this wise to interprete Figuratiue speaches: for many of them are soone descried by suche as giue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent héed to them. A vaine &amp; superfluous speach it were, if a man wold say this is Peter, this is, that is the Image of Peter, whiche by a figure, is called by the name of Peter.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, holie Scripture dothe vse to speake of things, rather according to the opinion and iudgement of men, than accordyng to the substance and true béeing which they haue in déede. So Iesus is called the Sonne of Ioseph, and Iosephe named his father, whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, our Sauiour Chryst Iesus, was borne of a chast and vnspotted Uirgin, without any helpe of man. And yet neuerthelesse many of the Iewes, imagined, that he was the Sonne of Ioseph. In the 1. Cor. 1. the Gospel it selfe is named foolishnesse,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> bicause that men did account the great wisdom of God but as méere foolishnesse. So in the first epistle to the Corinthians .x. chap. the Scripture termeth them gods,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> which be nothing lesse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so in dede. And that for this cause onely, for that the Heathen tooke them for Gods,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iere.</hi> 10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 96.</note> and so dyd worshippe them. Euen so the Scripture doth terme the Deuil Samuel, bycause Saule thought him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.</note> &amp; the father of lyes. Here vnto a man may easily answere: The Diuell knewe howe things stode with the Iewes, and the Philistines, he vnderstode euen the very secrete consultations, priuy practises, and warlike preparation on both sides. He sawe that the Israelits were slenderly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed vnto battaile, and vtterly daunted of courage. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, Samuel had a little before thretned Saul with gods heauie wrath and vengeaunce, and that Dauid shold be aduaunced to the kingly throne wherby he might ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gather what would ensue, and that Saule must nedes giue place to Dauid. And if the euent had bin otherwise, yet he knewe that Saule with this prophesie woulde be quite dismayde, and driuen to dispaire: which thing muste néedes well content and please Sathan, who layeth hys baits day and night to intrappe men.</p>
               <p>The Diuell doth not presently vnderstande things to come,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and therefore he giueth doubtfull aunswers to such as séeke oracles of him: As when he saide,

               <p>That is, Cresus passing ouer the riuer <hi>Halis</hi> shal ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne many kingdomes. And yet oftentimes he gathereth one thing no otherwise than by an other. Hereof writeth <hi>Augustine</hi> in the 26.27. and 28. chapters of his booke <hi>De Anima.</hi> The Diuell is one which hath bin long beaten in experience, the which thing in all affaires and matters is of very great force. For olde and practised souldiours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by and by foresée to what issue things will come, but yong men, and suche as want experience do not forthwith espye out the euent of eche enterprise. Moreouer, the Diuels are very actiue, and can soone dispatch their matters. The marriners knowe when winds and stormes will arise. Husbandmen also are not destitute of their prognosticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The skilful astronomer can many yeares before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8810:80"/>
foretell when there will happen an Eclipse of the Sunne and Moone. The Phisitian by the critical dayes, pulse, and vrine, can lightly iudge whether his patient shal liue or no: builders sée before hand when an house wil fal, and a practised souldioure can straight wayes iudge who shall winne the victory. And what maruaile then may it be, if the Diuell an olde trained souldiour, can sometimes foreshew some certain thing? Shall we be of this minde, that so many yeares experience hathe broughte them no knowledge at all? Otherwhiles he telleth things which be true in déede, and yet to no other ende, but that he may therby purchase a certaine credite vnto his lying, to seduce the ignoraunt.</p>
               <p>For euen that counterfeit Samuell, made wise, as if he had taken it in very ill parte, that Saule did so molest and disquiet him, and that he shold be forced to talke with him: he vseth farther the words as it were of Samuel him selfe. And hereof it commeth, that many gather, he was the true Samuell in déede. But what doth not Sathan deuise to deceyue men, and to force them vnto desperacion? Here I could alleage examples of suche as haue bin perswaded, that they sawe and heard this and that man, and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knewe them perfectly by their spéeche: whereas they haue afterwards had euident intelligence, that they were at that time many miles distaunt from them. So craftie is the Diuell, and knoweth howe to worke these and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other feates.</p>
               <p>There are farther, diuers places alleaged out of the auncient fathers that séeme too make for them, whyche affirme that true Samuell appeared vnto Saule. But these places wée haue béefore for the moste parte aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared. For albeit Augustine in some places moue a doubte, whether it were the true Samuell or no, yet in certeine other places he lyketh and beste alloweth their opinion, who denye Samuell to haue appeared at

               <p>

And no man shoulde maruaile hereat, sith that the selfe same author dothe by and by adde, that he is of this iudgemente, that all the soules of Prophetes and iust menne are subiecte vnto suche power as a man may in very déede beléeue, to haue bin on thys gréedy and subtile Witche. But this none of the fathers will graunt him. Other Gréeke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters also, whyche in their tender yeares applyed theyr mindes to Philosophie, and not to the studie of holy Scriptures, and afterwardes were conuerted to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, do sette foorthe in their writings certaine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whyche are not agreable to the word of God.

               <p>The same author <hi>in Responsionibus ad Orthodoxos, quest.</hi> 52. mainteineth the contrary assertion. For, sayth he, what soeuer things were done by that hungry witche, were in déede the workes of the Diuell, who dyd so da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell the eyes of suche as beheld him, that it séemed vnto them, they sawe Samuell him selfe, when in very déede he was not there. But the truth of his words procéeded from God, who gaue the Diuell power to appeare vnto the sorceresse, and to declare vnto hir, that which shoulde afterwards come to passe. &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Idem.</hi>
                  </note> But this may not so be vnderstode, that <hi>Lactantius</hi> was of this iudgement, that they by their wicked artes did bring the soules back again into their dead bodies: but that they did so vaunt and boast that they had raysed vp this &amp; that soule. He also confuteth the opinion of the Ethnikes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by the testimonie of the very Magitians, whom they highly reuerenced, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the soule was immortall. These men affirmed and taught, that they did call vp soules from the dead, the which poynt euen those of the Gentiles beleeued, who notwithstanding thought, that the soule did streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way die with the bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustine</hi> the Martyr in the seconde Apologie whiche he wrote in the defence of Christians, hath these wordes: I will (sayth he) say the truth: In times past wicked angels through vayn visions deceyued women, and children, and with straunge and monstrous sightes made men afrayde, by whiche meanes they often wroong that oute of foolishe and rude persons, whiche by reason they coulde neuer get

of them. And therefore not knowyng that these were the Diuels engins and policies tendyng to delude them, they by one consente termed the workers of these slye conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, by the name of Gods, assignyng to eache of them their propre names, as best pleased themselues. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Afterwardes in the same Apologie hée exhorteth the heathens, that they would not deny mens soules after this lyfe to be indued with sense, but at the least way, woulde giue credite to their owne Necromancers, who teach that they call vp mens soules. Also let them beléeue those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm they haue ben vexed with spirits of dead men, which persons the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people term furious &amp; frantike bodies. In Augustin <hi>de ciuitate dei,</hi> many such things be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined.</p>
               <p>Now what dreadfull, strange, and maruellous ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they vsed when they went aboute by their Magicall artes to call vp the soules of the deade, a man may sée in the first booke of <hi>Lucan</hi> the Poet: where he setteth foorth howe <hi>Erictho,</hi> a famous Wytche in <hi>Thessalye,</hi> reuiued and restored a souldioure to lyfe againe, who was lately slayne before. Whiche acte he did at the requeste of <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Pompeius,</hi> that so he myght by him learne what wold be the issue of the battayle fought at <hi>Pharsalia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This kind of Magike they proprely terme <hi>Necromancie</hi> or <hi>Psycomancie,</hi> which is wrought by raising vp the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and soules of the dead. Of whiche there were dyuerse sortes.

               <head>CHAP. XI. VVhether the holy Apostles thought they savve a mans Soule, vvhen Chryst sodenly appeared vnto them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Resurrection.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E reade in the 24. Chapter of S. Lukes Gospell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 24.</note> that two Disciples which retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from <hi>Emaus</hi> to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> tolde the Apostles, that they had séene Chryst aliue againe, and whyles they yet spake, the Lord stoode in the myddest of them, and sayd vnto them, peace be vnto you: but they being amased and afrayd, thought they sawe a spirit. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Out of this some go about to proue, that the Apostles beléeued that spirits or soules did walke and appeare vnto men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples supposed they saw a ghost.</hi>
                  </note> and that they themselues did thinke they sawe the spirite of Chryst (as certaine of the olde Wryters doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it) or else some other mannes spirit.</p>
               <p>This Argument may be answered two wayes. First if they thought they sawe a Soule, they thought a mysse. But they were no lesse deceyued with the common sorte nowe, than when they thought Chryst would rayse vppe an outward and earthly kingdome, in which they shoulde be chiefe. Secondly, it may be, that they supposed they sawe an euil or good Angell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Many kynd of spirites.</hi>
                  </note> for there are more kyndes of spirites than one. There is a spirit that created al thyngs, to wit, God the Father, the Sonne, and the Holie Ghost. Agayne there be spirites that be created, as good and euill Angels, as also the soules of men, which eyther are in the body, or by death seuered from the body, and abyde either in euerlasting lyfe, or in eternal damnation. As touching the state of Soules in Purgatorie, where they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Heauenly iourney, and of <hi>Limbus puerorum,</hi> there is nothing extant in holie Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:8810:85"/>It is manifest in scripture that God appeared vnto the holy patriarches, to the prophets, to kings and others, in diuers visions and formes, and that he shewed hym selfe vnto them and spake with them. Iacob sawe a ladder reache from the earth vp to Heauen, and God leaning on it. Isaias sawe the Lord sitting vppon an high throne. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell sawe an olde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sitting and his sonne comming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and receyuing all power of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> and other holy fathers do teache, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of God, which at the appointed time shoulde take vppon him humaine fleshe, didde appeare vnto the Patriarches in an angelicall shape.</p>
               <p>When Iohn Baptist did baptise our sauioure in Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, the Holy ghost was séene in the shape of a doue. The holy scriptures in many places do testifie, that good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells haue oftentimes appeared to Gods ministers.</p>
               <p>That euill spirits are often séene, and that at this day they shewe themselues in diuers formes, to inchaunters and coniurers, and to other men also, as well godly as wicked, both histories and daily experience doth witnesse.</p>
               <p>Truely we reade not, that soules haue appered on this fashion. By these we may easly gather, that the Apostles, when they thought they sawe a spirit, did not beléeue they sawe a soule. Could they not thinke I pray you, they sawe an euill spirit? Or rather that they sawe a good spirit, or a good angel? For it may be shewed by many examples, that euen the faithfull haue bin troubled, and feared at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of good Angels.</p>
               <p>In the eyght and tenth chapter of Daniel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Daniel.</hi> 8.10.</note> we read that the Prophet fel into a sicknesse at the sight of Angels. The virgin Mary hirselfe was afrayde when she sawe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell Gabriel. So was Zachary the priest, &amp; many others.</p>
               <p>In the 12. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Acts, we reade, that Herode killed Iames the Apostle with the sword,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Actes.</hi> 12.</note> and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sawe that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Iewes, he caught Peter also, and when he hadde
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8810:86"/>
put him in pryson, hée deliuered him to .16. Souldioures to be kepte, entending after the feast of Passeouer to kyll him. But the Angell of the Lorde led S. Peter out of the prison by night through the Souldiours watch, and sette him in the right way to the house of Mary, the mother of Iohn, whose surname was Marke (where many were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered togither and prayed.) And when he had knocked at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> entrie doore, a maid came forth to harken, named <hi>Rhode.</hi> But when she knew Peters voice, she opened not the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie doore for gladnesse, but ran in and tolde howe Peter stood before the entrie, but they said vnto hir thou art mad: yet she affirmed constantly that it was so. Then said they it is his Angel, but Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened and saw him, they were astonied. In like maner, now also when the Apostles saw Christ, peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they thought they sawe a good Angel. For there are Angels giuen of God vnto men to keepe them. Of this matter ther is somwhat red in the .18. of S. Matthew, &amp; in the 19. Psal. &amp; we wil note somwhat more of it hereafter.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>Psalme.</hi> 19.</note>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:8810:87"/>At this day also there are many honest and godlie men which haue this faulte, that they are too quicke of beléefe, and altogither ruled by others. They iudge other men by themselues, they would be ashamed to reporte any thing that were false, and thinke suche men in like manner to be affectioned, which doe abuse their simplicitie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Often times these men, through their too muche lightnesse of beleefe, fall into great daungers.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, in that age wherin <hi>Gregorie</hi> liued, men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to attribute muche to those apparances and visions. And at that time the true and sincere Doctrine began greatly to decay. Truly the time in which a man happens to lyue, is much to be regarded: he himselfe confessed that hys time was the latter tymes. Therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures shoulde haue béene more diligently haue lent vnto, neither should any thing haue béen retained that was not agreable vnto them. Some going about to excuse him, for that he hath stuffed his Dialogues full of myracles and wonders, say he dyd it to mollifie by those examples, the peruerse and hard heartes of the <hi>Longobardes,</hi> to the end they might embrace the true Religion, which they had so gréeuously persecuted. But that it is in no wise profitable to make knowen the true fayth, by these helpes, which are nothyng else but vayne tales, euen <hi>Viues</hi> himselfe, in his first booke <hi>De tradendis disciplinis</hi> doth acknowledge.</p>

               <p>A certaine Deane when he had giuen ouer his Dean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, went into the Wildernesse to doe penaunce: after his deathe he appeared to his Byshop, and tolde him that

Also in the 24. of Matthew, the Lord doth saye in the late dayes there shalbe signes and wonders that the very elect if it were possible might be seduced, therefore they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude those things which councels do say of suche apparitions, are to be beleued. Christs words ar not so to be vnderstode that the chosen can neuer be broughte into errors (for the contrary may be shewed by many examples) but that they do not abide in erroure, albeit some do very hardly get out of the same agayne. Tell me, I pray you, who they were that came togither in auncient Councels? were they not holy fathers? It is manifest that in many points they were at variaunce among themselues, and that they haue shewed by their contrary writings: yea and many times they ar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to themselues, and therfore they haue not alwayes thought aright. Sometime they send vs to the word of God, as to the most certayne rule and leauell of faith. There are examples ynow, by whiche it may be shewed, that the olde Councelles haue erred in some of their determinations. The Councell of <hi>Ariminum</hi> hath allowed the Arrians doctrine.

It is well ynough knowen by histories who hathe resisted Councels, and ruled them, and what hath bene chiefly handled in them for certayne hundred yeares: And what for the most parte hathe by and by followed after them, euen cruel warres and bloudy slaughters. If nowe those auncient Councels coulde erre, who will maruayle
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8810:88"/>
that they which haue assembled since haue erred? But as touching the apparitions, that I may (all other things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) talke only of them, tell me I pray you who should certifie the Councles, whether this or that vision were true or false? Certaynly no Councels can bring to passe, that the lyes whiche haue bin scatred abroade, shall nowe begin to be true tales, although they of the Councel haue saide they are true.</p>

How can the bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> being so far off, knowe any thing better than they which dwell in the same places? If the bishop hauing no other assuraunce than out of their words or writings, which perhaps go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to erecte newe pilgrimages, and newe deuises to get money, confirme once that this or that soule was séene, it must straight way without any gaynsaying be beleued. But if any other men who haue with diligence sought out the truth of the matter, do testifie the contrary: al that they say must not be regarded. Consider (I beséeche you) of this matter. Before, all haue doubted whether the thing were so or no, but assoone as the Pope doth giue his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicte, or some Church man do in his dreame sée it to be so, it is a heynouse matter afterwards to doubt of it.

But it foloweth not therfore, that they were soules indéede, much lesse that any dead man hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in body and soul vnto them. For at Domes day only the soules shall returne to their bodies agayne. Soules are

spirits, but spirits are inuisible, wherefore they cannot so be séene, vnlesse they take some outward shape vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. But it can neuer be proued by the testimony of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that as good &amp; euil Angels, so soules take some shapes vpon them. Besides this, it is most true that oftentimes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shapes and formes of them whose soules are not yet sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from their bodies by death (as when one lieth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his death bed) are no lesse séene than theirs which are already dead.

For as yet the laste sentence hath not pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on them, and therfore as yet they maye bée helped, and therefore also they doe craue helpe, and shewe themselues vnto men. But wée haue proued before at large, bothe out of the scriptures, and also out of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8810:89"/>
of the auncient fathers, that the soules of the faithful are saued, and that the soules of the vnbeleeuers are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned immediatly without delay, and therefore there is no Purgatorie. Agaynst this, they alledge sundry argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes amongst the whiche thys, albeit it be very common, yet is it the chéefest, when they say, that no man is saued excepte he be purged from all his sinnes, and that sinne cleaueth vnto vs euen vnto the graue. If wée saye that puritie and cleannesse consisteth not in our woorkes, or in the paynes which we endure, but that God through faith in his sonne Iesus Christe (who is our only redemption, iustification, satisfaction, and raunsom for our sinnes) doth iustifie vs: they streyght aunsweare, that our faith is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecte, and that the moste godly men complayne when they departe hence, of the weakenesse of their fayth. And therefore that God dothe not take vp suche kynde of men straightwayes into heauen, nor yet bycause they are not vtterly voyde of fayth, thrust them presently downe into hell. And therfore, that there is a middle place betwene bothe, whiche is called Purgatorie, in which the soules are purified from the imperfection whiche remayned in them at the time of their death, and out of the which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by the merits of the liuing, and by large pardons. Is not this as muche as to attribute that vnto our owne paines and to external fyre, whiche ought only to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto the death of Christ? Doth not Christe teache vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if at any time we féele any weakenesse of faith, we shold crye out with the Apostles: Lorde increase our faith? Doth God disdaine to heare the prayers of his faithfull people in the extremitie of death? Christ sayth, he that is washed hath no néede saue to washe his féete, but he is cleane eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whitte: Hée wyll saue vs, not for the woorthinesse of our faythe, but by his méere grace onely. He dooth bestow these things amongst vs, as if some ryche man did fréely giue meate and drinke vnto others, wherof some of them
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8810:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
receyueth it in woodden, some in earthen, and some in sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or golden vessels: or as if a Prince did distribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery one a piece of golde, and some receyue it with a féeble hande, and some with a strong and lustie hande. He that hath the weake hande receyueth money as wel as he that hath the strong hande. Saincte Paule exhorteth the Thessalonians in his firste Epistle and fourthe Chapter,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thessa.</hi> 4.</note> that they mourne not for the dead as the Gentiles doo. If there had bene a fyer of Purgatorie, as they haue falsely imagined, hée coulde not haue bene angrie with them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had taken their frendes departure somewhat impaciently. &amp;c. Other argumentes whiche are broughte for the confirmation of Purgatorie, are of late so confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many godly and learned men, that it is maruel our aduersaries will so often repete them.</p>
               <p>But before I leaue this matter, I will here insert this historie folowing. A certaine Germain béeing accused by the Inquisitours of heresie (as they terme it) that amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest his companions he denyed Purgatorie, contrarie to the common consent of the Catholike Churche, made his answeare thus: If our parishe Priest (quod he) whome I credite very muche, preache vnto vs true doctrine in the Pulpet, eyther there is no Purgatorie at all, or else it is cleane emptie. For he oftentymes sayeth, that Turkes, Iewes, heretikes, and wicked men goe not into Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, but straight into Hell fyer, from whence they shall neuer bée delyuered: Then that by Pardons whyche are euery where solde for money, many soules are resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their first perfection: And moreouer, that the Masse is of suche force, that there is not one soong in al the world by whiche one soule at the least is not deliuered out of the flames of Purgatorie. If these things (quod he) be true, (for I wil not go about to refell that whiche master Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath sayde) I will stande in this my opinion. For you do all complayne, that the number of the Catholykes is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8810:90"/>
very small, the greater parte of men béeing deuided into sundry se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes, and the multitude of Epicures dayly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Then are all mennes pursses many times drawne drie by pardoners, which for money sell their indulgences, that by them the soules of men may be deliuered out of the torments of purgatorie. Furthermore, there is no village but there are a great many Masses soong in it, before any one husbandeman dyeth. What followeth then, but that there is eyther no Purgatorie, or one vtterly voyde and emptie? When the Inquisitours (who knewe very well that their men commonly taught such doctrine) herd these things, they were amazed, and taking aduise togither, they all berated him for occupying his heade aboute questions nothing appertaining vnto him, which they commaunded him to leaue vnto diuines, and to folow his owne busines.</p>
               <p>There was in our countrey an honest and sober man, who before the light of the Gospel began to appeare, vsed this <hi>dilemma</hi>:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dilemma, is a kinde of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth him vnto whome it is spoken.</hi>
                  </note> The bishop of Rome either hath authoritie to bring soules out of the paynes of Purgatorie, or else he hath no authoritie: If he haue that power, and will not vse it, excepte hee receyue money, hée can not escape the faulte of crueltie and couetousenesse: But if hée haue no suche authoritie, surely it is great villanie to robbe so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye widdowes and fatherlesse chyldren, and so arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to boast hymselfe of aucthoritie whyche hée hathe not. And if there be no Purgatorie (as by the holy Scriptures it is playnly gathered there is not) surely then mennes soules can neyther returne from thence, nor offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be séene of men.</p>
               <p>Nowe as touching the fourthe place, namely <hi>Limbus puerorum,</hi>

                  </note> (in the which innocent chyldren, as they call them, are sayde to bée) Papistes themselues scante dare affirme, that they return again and appeare vnto men, and craue their helpe: for they teache, that if they depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baptisme, they shall neuer enioy the sight of God, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:8810:90"/>
for that cause they may not be buried in the same church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard with other christians. Merciful God! how many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matrones hath this false deuise miserably vexed? I call it a false deuise, for that they bring nothing out of the holy Scriptures wherby to proue this poynt of doctrine. The Scriptures do not attribute so muche vnto externall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, whiche is by water. Was the condition of infants better in the olde testament than in the new? You do not reade that the olde fathers, supposed that infantes whych dyed before the eyght day, and therefore were not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, should be separated from the sight of God for euer. Dauid the king and prophet said he shold folow his sonne, whome God had called out of this lyfe before he was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised. But it was not Dauids meaning that he should go into a place where he should be depriued of the sight of God for euer. But it appertaineth not much vnto our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to dispute any further hereof. Thus haue I nowe answered the chéefest argumentes of our aduersaries, whereby they woulde proue the soules of good and euill men, to offer them selues to be séene sometimes of them that liue, after their departure by death from their bodies.</p>

But whether that euery one of the elect haue hys proper Angell, or many Angels be appoynted vnto him, it is not expresly sette foorth, yet this is most sure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, that God hath giuen his Angels in charge to haue regard and care ouer vs. Daniel witnesseth in his tenth chapter, that Angels haue also charge of Kingdomes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Daniel.</hi> 10.</note> by whom God kéepeth and protecteth them, and hindreth the wicked counsels of the deuill. It may be proued by many places of the Scripture, that all Christian men haue not only one Angell, but also many, whome God imployeth to their seruice. In the .34. Psalm it is sayde, the Angell of the Lorde pitcheth his tentes rounde about them whiche feare the Lorde, and helpeth them:<note place="margin">

We reade that they appearing in sundrye shapes, haue admonished menne, haue comforted them, defended them, deliuered them from daunger, and also punished the wicked. Touching this matter, there are plentifull examples, whiche are not néedefull to be repeated in this place. Somtimes they haue eyther appeared in sléep, or in manner of visions, and sometimes they haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed their office, by some internall operations: as when a mans mynde foresheweth him, that a thing shall so happen, and after it happeneth so in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is wel knowen by histories, what sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes went before the deathe of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> amongest the whiche, a greate noyse was hearde in the night time, in very many places farre and néere.</p>
               <p>As concerning other Emperors, and Kings, and other great mennes deathes, we reade that some certaine fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings were hearde or séene, wée must also consider what those straunge things are, which for the most parte happen before the innouations of kingdomes, before bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, seditions, and subuersions of Cities.</p>
               <p>I say flatly, euen as I sayde before concerning spirits: if they be not vayne persuasions, or naturall thyngs, then are they forewarnings of God, whiche are sent, eyther by good Angels, or by some other meanes vnknowen vnto vs, that we might vnderstande that all these things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen not by aduenture, without the wil &amp; pleasure of God,

but that life and deathe, peace and warre, the alteration of Religion, the exchaunge of Empires, and of other things, are in his power, that we might thereby learne to feare him, and to call vppon his name. In the meane season Sathan also fayneth and worketh many thyngs to terryfie men, and to plant superstition in their hartes. But that all thyngs are not doone by Sathan, héereby we maye vnderstande: It chaunceth that one is thrust thorowe and slayne by one wyth whome hée neuer was at variance, but hath euer vsed him as hys friende, some man is drowned, or falleth down from some highe place, or otherwise is miserably slayne, an euill spirite can haue no foreknowledge héereof (for there are no naturall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or coniectures going before them, as there are in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases) yet notwithstanding, some signes and rare casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties fall out before.

               <p>There was a certayne Magistrate within the liberties of <hi>Tigurine,</hi> not long before I wrote this, whom certaine of his friendes taried for to breake their fast with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tooke his iourney, and thus waighting, they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed they heard a knyfe falling from the vpper parte, or floore of the stewe, wherein they were, yet sawe they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and sodenly as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned togither of this stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unge wonder, they thought they heard it agayne. In the meane while commeth the Magistrate, vnto whome they declare what had happened, and as they had skant ended their talke, the knyfe fell agayne the thirde time, in the hearing of the Magistrate, who before doubted very much of the matter. And therefore taking occasion héereby, hée began to exhorte them, that whereas within fewe dayes

But in case they bée euyll Spyrites,

(as for the most part they are) the faithfull are moued by occasion of them vnto true repentaunce.

God dothe also suffer them to be exercised with haunting of spirites, for this cause, that they shold be the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lowely. For in the second Epistle to the Corinth. and .xij. chap.

Neither should we be touched with compassion of other mennes miserie which are vexed with spirits: but we woulde rather say, that they can not tell what they speake, and that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine many vayne feares. Moreouer, if other vnderstande that godly men are for their exercise vexed by spirits, they become more pacient when soeuer they are sicke, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise troubled, acknowledging theyr owne harmes to be but small in comparison of other mens. For nothing is

God suffreth these things to chasten them. For so muche as they will giue no place vnto truth, but are wilfully deceyued, it is good reason they be taught by diuelishe illusions what they must do, or leaue vndone, and that they be illuded by euill spirits, after some other meanes.</p>
               <p>Thus we reade in the .13. chapter of Deuteronomie:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.</note> if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreames, and giue thée a signe and wonder, and that signe or wonder that he hath saide come to passe, and then say, let vs go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter straunge Gods, which thou hast not knowne, and lette vs serue them: hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not thou vnto the words of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or dreamer of dreames. For the Lorde thy God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you, to wit whether ye loue the Lord your God with all your soule. Ye shall walke after the Lorde your God and feare him, kepe his commandements, and hearken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his voice, serue him and cleaue vnto him. And he addeth further, that the same Prophete or dreamer shall dye the death.</p>
               <p>By these words we do not only sée that God doth suffer suche leude fellowes to worke maruellous things, but also to what ende and purpose he permitteth it, that is, to trye his faithfull, how constant they be, and how faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would beleue in him, if at any time spirits do come and foretell things to happen hereafter. Our sauioure Christ saith in the thirde chapter of Saincte Iohn:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loued darknesse more than light, bicause their déedes were euill: for euery one that doth euill, hateth the light,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8810:100"/>
neyther commeth he to the light, least his déedes shoulde be reproued. &amp;c. By the which woordes our Sauiour she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the cause why the worlde is condemned, whiche is, bycause they receyue not the lyght of the woorde of God, or Christe himselfe, who is the light of the worlde, sette foorth vnto vs in his woorde: but rather shut their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the cleare light, preferring darkenesse, that is, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, superstition, and wickednesse, before the woord of God. If God then condemne and reiecte the vnthankfull worlde,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.</note> what maruell is it, if he vexe them with spirites and vayne apparitions? Chryst sayth in the fyfth of Iohn, I come in my Fathers name, and you receyue me not: yf an other come in his owne name, you receyue him. Christe laboured for their health and saluation: this they woulde not acknowledge, but refused him: therfore was it the iust iudgement of God, that they shold receyue others, that hunted after their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie and profite: suche as were <hi>Theudas, Iudas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and many other false doctours, and seditious seducers. Wherefore if any refuse to giue eare to Christe and his ministers, it is by the iust iudgemente of God, that they hearken vnto Spirites, and suche like things. Saincte Paule in the seconde to the Thessalonians and seconde chapter writeth of Antichrist,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Thessa.</hi> 2.</note> that he shoulde exercise greate tyrannie in the Churche of God, and sheweth agaynst whome, and for what cause God will suffer him so to do, saying: Among them that perishe: bicause they recyued not the loue of the truth that they might be saued. And therefore God shall sende them strong delusions, that they shoulde beléeue lyes, that all they myght be damned, whiche beléeue not the truth, but had pleasure in vnrighteousnesse. And in the fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his seconde Epistle to Timothe,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.</note> he earnestly besée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his scholer to be diligent in preaching dayly. He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this reason: for the tyme will come, when they shall not suffer holsome doctrine: but after their owne lustes
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8810:100"/>
shall they (whose eares itche,) get them an heape of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and shall withdraw their eares from the truth, and shalbe turned vnto fables. Now we sée the cause why god dothe suffer seducers, false teachers, and wicked spirites, to deceyue men in the place of true doctours: which is for that eyther they vtterly despise his woorde or little esteme it, and can not abide godly and constant preachers.</p>
               <p>Touching which matter,<note place="margin">

The Prophete went on, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: heare the word of God: I sawe the Lord sitting in his seate of maiestie, and all the host of Heauen stand about him on his righte hande, and on his lefte hande. And the Lorde sayde, who shall entice <hi>Achab</hi> that he may go and fall at <hi>Ramoth Gilead.</hi> And one sayde on this manner, and an other sayde on that manner. Then there came foorth a spirit, and stoode before the Lorde and sayde, I will entice him. And the Lorde sayde vnto him, wherewith? And he sayde, I will go out and be a false Spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets. Then he sayde, thou shalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise him, and shalt also preuaile: go foorth and do so. Nowe therefore behold, the Lorde hath put a lying Spirit in the mouth of all these thy Prophets, and the Lorde hathe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed euill agaynst thée. Then <hi>Sedechias</hi> came nere and smote <hi>Micheas</hi> on the chéeke, and sayde: when went the spirit of the Lorde from me, to speake vnto thée? And <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheas</hi> prophecied what should happen also vnto him. So the king commaunded him to be cast into prison, and to be fed with bread and water vntil he returned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres. Then sayde <hi>Micheas,</hi> if thou returne in peace, the Lorde hathe not spoken by me: and therewith he willed all the people to hearken what he spake. Notwithstanding the kings went forewarde with their enterprise, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themselues, and led foorth their armes against their enimies. <hi>Achab</hi> was slayne in the battaile: <hi>Iosaphat</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he ioyned him selfe with the wicked was in very great daunger &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:8810:102"/>I haue handled thys historie somewhat at large, that we might vnderstand, howe God by his iust iudgement sendeth spirits vnto those which despise his word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be beguiled and deceyued.</p>
               <p>The very same happened vnto the Christians after the Apostles tyme. For when the word of God began to be lesse estemed than it shoulde haue bin, and men prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their owne affections before the hearing thereof: and when as they would incurre no manner of daunger, for the defence of their faith, and of the truth, but accounted of all religions alike, God so punished them that nowe they began to giue eare vnto false teachers, whiche fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them selues vnto theyr veine affections, they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of images, whom they called lay mennes bookes, they kissed these mens boanes, and shrined them in golde (if happely they were their boanes) whose doctrine before they disdained to receyue: they gaue credite vnto false ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions and diuelishe visions: and so suffered they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy punishment for their greate ingratitude. Euen as yong men, which will not be ruled by their maisters, are after compelled to obey other men with great shame: so also happened it vnto those men: for they fell dayly more and more from the word of God, in so muche that when they had once lost the truthe, some ranne one waye, and some an other to fynde a meanes for the remission of their sins: and one man beleued this spirite, an other that, which no man can deny.</p>

                     <hi>A storie of S. Benedict, seing many diuels in a monastery and fewe in the market.</hi>
                  </note>It is not much vnlike which <hi>Aeneas Siluius</hi> (who was afterwardes made Pope, called <hi>Pius.</hi> 2.) reciteth in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of the Councell of <hi>Basill,</hi> out of the lyfe of holy <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict,</hi> father of the Monkes called after his name. Hée sometymes visityng a certayne Monasterie of holy men, espyed an infinite route of diuels, who as it were fighting with the holy fathers, labored to disturbe the good workes which they went about. And he foorthwith going to a faire full of marchandise and buying and selling, saw there but one diuell, and he also idle and sad, sitting vppon a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure, wherat saint <hi>Benedict</hi> maruelling, that he saw the place whiche was holy and dedicate to prayer, full of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, and that he founde the prophane place which was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with periurie and other offences, garded but with one Diuell: hée coniures the same Diuell to declare and shewe vnto him the true cause therof: who streight answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that it was néedefull the holy place shoulde be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by many diuels, but those whiche sinned of their voluntarie accorde, had no néede to bée deceyued by the Diuell.</p>
               <p>But I aske thée thys question O thou Papist, myghte not the Gentils in ancient tyme haue obiected the same to the Christians, when they demaunded of them why their Oracles ceassed? and why there were so fewe Uisions? If those Spirites or bugges be Diuels, why doe you then saye and beléeue that they are the soules of dead menne, whiche desyre helpe of you? I wyll shewe you the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye true cause why those visyons are nowe so seldome ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes séene: forsoothe bycause the Dyuell perceyueth, that wée vnderstande hys subtleties and craft, therefore hée
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:8810:103"/>
hunteth after other men, and seeketh to deceyue them. As for example, when thou wilt cramp some man by the toes in the night time (as sometimes pleasant fellowes vse to do, to recreate themselues when they trauel) and so draw him out of his bed, if thou perceyue he be acquainted with thy sleyght, by and by thou leauest him, and goest vnto an other which is fast asleep, and cannot perceiue the deceyt.</p>
               <p>There be other causes also why these things happen nowe more seldome. If any man deceiue thée once, twice, or thrice, afterwardes thou openest thy eyes, and espiest what he doth and what he goeth about: so when we haue béene often beguiled with false apparations, we will not easily be persuaded, if any man tel vs that a soule, or spirit hath appeared (as the prouerb saith.) Moreouer whereas nowe adayes fewe stand in feare of spirites,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A burnt childe dreads fire.</hi>
                  </note> many might be easily found, who would séeke them, feele them, yea and also handle them. This is wel known, &amp; therfore no man will gladly put on a visour, or otherwise counterfeit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a ghost. A man may soone persuade a childe that ther is is a black man, a tall woman, which wil put chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that crie in their budget. &amp;c. but after they are come to maturitie of yeares, they will no more be feared with visours and such like persuasions: they will laugh at thy follie, if afterwards thou go about to make them so afraid. Euen so when we were children in the Scriptures, that is, when we vnderstood them not, we might be easily se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to beleeue many things: But nowe that we reade them in all manner of tongs, and do dayly profit in them, we do not suffer our selues to be so mocked, neither do we beléeue euery vaine apparition. How many sightes of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites did the knauerie of the Monkes of <hi>Berna</hi> driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, after it was once detected?

For by these means God sheweth that nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or by aduenture, but that the life and deth, the prosperous or vnfortunate estate of al men, is in the power and hand of God. It is nothing so as the Epicures affirme, that God hath no regard whether any man lyue, or be borne, or do well or euill, or otherwise, or whether common welthes do florish, or be made wast. Chryst himselfe techeth vs, that not so much as a sparrow falleth vnto the ground without the wil of God. <hi>Salomon</hi> &amp; Daniel say, that the hearts of kings are in Gods hands, and that he appoynteth or deposeth kings at his pleasure. Wherfore if we happely do heare any noises or such like, they ought rather to put vs in good comfort, than to make vs afrayd. And againe, God héereby admonisheth vs, that we be not idle and secure, for he hath in al ages stirred vp his seruants not only with words, but also with rare and strange apparitions. The very Gentiles accounted these myraculous things, as the admonitions and warnings of their gods, as it may be séen euery wher, in ther histories.

To wit, that first we ought to be of good
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8810:106"/>
courage without feare, being assured &amp; constante in true faith.</p>
               <p>For if they be good Angels which shew themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, then are they sent vnto vs from God, to a good ende and purpose. But if they be wycked and euyll, they can do vs no harme be they neuer so desirous, excepte God giue them leaue thereto. If it be nothing but a vayne imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we haue, or an idle sight obiected vnto our eyes, surely it is great follie to be any thing afraid. In déed it is naturall vnto vs, to be amazed with feare when we sée suche things: for verie godly menne, as we read both in the olde and newe Testament, were stricken with excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding feare when they sawe good Angels, but yet a man must pul vp his heart againe. When Chrystes Disciples sawe their Maister walking vpon the water, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching neare the shippe, they thought they sawe a spirite, and they were astonished, and cryed out through feare. But the Lorde sayde vnto them, be of good comforte, it is I, be not afraide.</p>
               <p>The lyke is reade in the foure and twentie Chapter of Saint Luke,<note place="margin">

               <p>Be not dismayde, although thou heare some spirit stir and make a noyse, for in case hée rumble onely to make thée afrayde, care not for him, but lette hym rumble so long as he wyll, for if hée sée thée wythout feare, hée wyll soone depart from thée. And if thou thinke good, thou mayst boldly say vnto him, get thée hencewith a myschiefe thou wicked Deuil, thou hast nothing to do with me, who haue sette my onely beléefe in Christ Iesu my Sauiour.

I am owner of this house, and not thou, vnto whome ther is an other place apoynted. &amp;c. If hée perceyue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther is no feare or dreade of him, and that his bustling is not estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he will not continue long time. I will make thys matter manifest with a similitude, which is wel knowne. There be certaine men, whiche if they thinke other men stande in feare of them, they make wise to drawe their sworde, and sometymes too they drawe it, and strike the stones therewith, chafing and swearing lustily: But if they knowe their aduersaries haue a good courage, and that (if néede require) they will fight it out stoutly, they will quickely put vp their sworde into their skabberde. In lyke manner, if the Deuill sée thou art of a good sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and wel armed with Gods worde, he wil soone seeke after others whome he may mocke with feare.</p>
               <p>But if it please God to exercise thée by the Deuill for a certayne tyme, as hée dyd sometime Iob, thou must pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently suffer all things whiche he layeth vppon thée, and that willingly for Goddes commaundement sake. And knowe thou well, that he cannot thus much hurt, neither thy goods, nor body, nor soule without the permission and sufferaunce of Almightie God: if God giue him leaue to plague thy bodie, thinke with thy selfe howe so euer it be doone, that God hath so doone for thy profitte and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, who also sendeth gréeuous sicknesses vppon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, by other meanes and instruments, or else doth exercise them with other kyndes of calamities. Be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore strong and constant in faythe, yet lette euery one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of boldnesse, temeritie, and headdie rashnesse.</p>

In the 12. &amp; .16. of Iohn he saith: the Prince of this worlde shalbe cast out of the doores, that is to say, out of the harts of them which cleaue to the word of God, and are not in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8810:107"/>
loue with the worlde, wherof he is prince &amp; ruler. For he hath power ouer such, which doo gréedily loue the worlde.</p>
               <p>In the fyrst of Iohn the third chapter, it is sayde: The sonne of man appeared, that is, came into the worlde for that cause, that he might destroy the woorkes of the diuel.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> There are many miracles in the gospell which shew that Christ cast out diuels. Albeit God for a tyme do suffer the diuel in many things, yet hath he apointed him his bounds, which he may not passe. And he dooth not suffer the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be tempted any more of him than they are able to endure. He giueth his grace plentuously vnto them, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whome he layeth great afflictions.</p>
               <p>Wée ought not to maruel if spirits somtymes be séen or heard. For as sainct Peter sayth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The diuel is conuersant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men.</hi>
                  </note> Sathan raungeth euery where, in houses, fieldes, water and fyre: and yet he is not alwayes espied of men, neyther can he so be, except God giue him leaue to shewe himselfe. In that that we doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways sée him (for he being of an inuisible nature, taketh on him diuers shapes) or heare him, wée haue to thank the goodnesse of almightie God: for otherwise we should not be in rest one moment of tyme. But if sometime wicked spirites méete with vs in a visible forme by the wil of god, or do otherwise trouble and disquiet our houses, we must not think therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were neuer in our house before.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. It behoueth them vvhich are vexed vvith spirits, to pray especially, and to giue themselues to fasting, sobrietie, vvatching, and vpright and godly liuing.</head>

and that euill Angels very often appeare, we ought the rather to committe our selues more diligently to the tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of almightie God, both when we go to bed, and also when we arise agayne.</p>
               <p>Our sauioure amongst all other things taught vs to pray to this purpose: <hi>Deliuer vs from euill.</hi> And moreouer he saith in the .17. chapter of Matthew, that some kind of diuels are not driuen away by any other kind of meanes than fasting and praying. As touching those which suppose that diuels ought to be cast out with coniurations, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable curssings, I wil entreat in the end of this my booke. Watch &amp; pray, least ye fall into temptation Matthew .26. And in the 22. of Luke, Christ sayth vnto Peter, Sathan hath desired to sifte you euen as corne, but I haue prayed that thy faith faile not. And eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this present also he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth intercession for vs sitting at the right hand of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father.</p>
               <p>The auncient fathers in olde tyme, called vppon God in all theyr daungers and troubles, whereof it were a néedelesse matter to aduouche many examples. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so very profytable and good to craue the Prayers of the whole congregation, when soeuer we are vexed with euill spirits and vayne fantasies. For wée knowe righte well that the prayers of the Church haue bin very proffitable and effectuall vnto others, and that the godly in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses haue euermore desired them.</p>
               <p>It is Gods pleasure, that the faithfull should succoure one an other with their good prayers. Howbeit that the Saints after their departure from hence, shoulde pray for vs, or that we shoulde in any wise desire theyr pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, surely there is no commaundement of God, or any example thereof in the holy scriptures.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Apostles teache vs to withstande the crafte and subtiltie of the Diuel by this meanes. Saincte <hi>Paule</hi> to the Ephesians the 6. chapter, and Peter in hys

Wherefore we ought to giue our selues to watching, praying, fasting, and godly liuyng: we must heare the worde of God often and gladly, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire too reade and talke of hym contynually, that wée may thereby put from vs those diuelishe illusions and sightes.</p>

Enter into no communication with suche spirites, neither aske them what thou must giue, or what thou must doo, or what shal happen hereafter.

For if they be good, they will lyke it well, that thou wilte heare nothing but the woorde of God: but yf they be wicked, they wyll endeuour to deceyue thée with lying.

Except Eue had talked with the Serpent, she had neuer transgressed Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>If Spirites of their owne accorde woulde gladly tell vs many thinges: yet wée must not giue eare vnto them, muche lesse ought we to coniure them to tell vs the truth.

Saynte Paule to the Galathians the firste Chapter, sayth in great eanest vnto them, that if an Angell come from Heauen, and preache vnto them any other Gospell, hée shoulde be accursed.

Unto these words some religious men added, Iesus Christ amen. Therefore the Angell vttered not all those words of the <hi>Aue Marie</hi> (as it may manifestly be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the very text of Saincte Luke chapter .1.) not bycause we deny these words to be good and holy, for the text saith of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that she was full of the holy ghost: but that which the Angell spake not, is not to be attributed vnto hir. You shall not finde in any allowed authors that in the time of the apostles and many dayes after, this grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was accounted as a prayer, or that any godly men did

salute, and call vpon the holy virgin. Which thing I write not, bicause I would bereue the holy Uirgin of hir honor, but least that against hir will, wée giue hir that honour which is only due to God the Father, and to his sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su Christ.

They also consecrated salte, and taught, that whether soeuer it were cast, it draue away spirits, and all deceytes of the diuel, yea and the diuel himselfe also. Moreouer, they coniured with certain ceremonies and words, candles, palme, herbs, and other creatures, to driue awaye fantasies (as they terme them.) They layde these and such lyke things, as also the relikes of Saintes, in those places wheras Spirits had ben séene or heard. They also beare men in hande, that greate belles and sancebelles by their noyse frayed spirites out of the ayre. All these things are founde more at large in the Papists bookes whiche are written of the consecration of suche things, and are publikely extant. If belles be roong on S. Iohns day, or S.

And it is also plain by reding the Poets and Historiographers, that the Gentiles had their sacrifices for the dead, as their rites called <hi>Nouendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> which were obserued the ninth day, and their yearely feastes. &amp;c.

               <p>Afterwards certaine Monks and priests well séene in Magicall sciences (for they were neuer without such trim men) toke vpon them to coniure and driue away euill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits out of houses into wods &amp; desert places. They wroght maruellouse &amp; straunge things, and they sayd that a spirit in the name of saincts, and by the vertue of their coniuring and charecters, was constrayned to giue place whether he would or not. In dede the Diuel giueth place, but he doth it as enimies do, which by flying chuse a more fitte place to fight in, or more apte to embushe them selues. That which Sathan doth, he doth it willingly and of his owne accorde, that he might withdrawe men from trusting in God only, and driue them hedlong into Idolatrie. Christ and his disciples cast out Diuels, but they were loth and vnwilling to departe.

If you bring out of the bookes of Tobie, that the harte and liuer of the fish being layed on the coales, droue away the Diuell with the smell, we say that the same booke is not accounted amongst the canonicall scriptures: and moreouer that the same Diuell was rather vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the prayers of Tobias and his wife, than by any fumigation.

Our Lord Iesus Chryste who can best tell how we should fight against the crafte and subtiltie of the Diuell, teacheth vs in many places to pray continually, he biddeth vs to pray in the Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that we may be deliuered from euil, calling Sathan by the figure <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: Euill it selfe, bicause he excelleth therein. Nothing can be more acceptable and pleasing to the Diuel, than when any man vseth cursing and banning. He feyneth that he is hereby driuen away, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane season he crepeth inuisibly into their bosoms. If you liste ye may driue away the Diuel, in saying that he hathe no place with you, but his place is in Hell, and that he hathe nothing to do with those whiche put their only trust and confidence in Christ Iesus. For in the eyght chapter to the Romans in the beginning,<note place="margin">

A man may commaund the diuel to departe from him without any cursing or banning. And that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to be blamed that certaine wicked and rashe men talke very beastly, and filthily with spirits, if they appere at any time vnto them.</p>

with weapons. In the Grecian histories we reade, that a certayne <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> passing by a sepulchre in the night season, when a spirit séemed to appeare vnto him, ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes it thinking to run it through with his speare: say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: whether flyest thou O thou soul wich shalt twice dye?

                  </gap>ing with a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite is not afrayde, but yet boldnesse and rashnesse can not be commended. If thy enimy, albeit he be very weake be not to be despised, muche lesse ought an enimy so mighty &amp; so crafty, to be neglected. There haue bin some who when they would haue striken a Spirit with their sword, haue thought they haue striken the fetherbed, the Diuel so moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them.

               <p>It is reported that there haue bin some, who supposing with their weapons to hurte spirites, haue wounded them selues, for their armes and other members of theyr body haue neuer serued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after.
