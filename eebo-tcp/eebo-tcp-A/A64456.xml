            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
Teſtimony from the People of God,
Called
QUAKERS,
AGAINST
Many Lying and Slanderous Books, and a Ballad lately publiſhed in Envy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
to render the ſaid People odious, and accuſing them of things they are
clear of.</head>
            <p>VVhereas there was lately publiſhed a Ballad, called,
a Wenching <hi>Quaker,</hi> or the <hi>Roſemary-Lane</hi> Wonder,
Being a <hi>Chandler,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Roſemary-Lane,</hi> as
the Ballad ſpecifieth; which hath been enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and a Teſtimony from the Inhabitants, Neighbours, and
Officers was taken as followeth; viz, That the Party intended in
the Ballad neither is, nor ever heretofore was reputed or account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a <hi>Quaker</hi> by any that knows him; and if occaſion be, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Inhabitants may be brought, to teſtifie to the truth hereof:
And this is written for the clearing of the Truth, and taking off
all Aſpertions, Lyes, and Slanders that are caſt upon the People
of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> by Lyars and Slanderers; but we know
it is no new thing; for when at any time any wicked action is done
by any bad Perſon, then envious People are ready to caſt it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
upon us the People of God aforeſaid; and make Ballads
and Books of it, thinking by ſo doing it will ſell the better, and
they ſhall get the more money for it; and ſo the Sayings of Chriſt
are fulfilled, <hi>They ſhall ſpeak all manner of evil of you falſly for my
Name ſake; but rejoyce, and be exceeding glad, for happy are ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there are ſeveral lying Pamphlets, and bundles of Lyes ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
up and down the City and Country againſt us called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi>
that is to ſay, There are two of <hi>Robert Riches,</hi> and ſeveral
of <hi>Mugletons,</hi> the <hi>Tayler;</hi> and of <hi>Robert Cobbet,</hi> the <hi>Tayler;</hi> and of
a ſhameleſs woman, one <hi>Elizabeth Atkinſon,</hi> that ſelleth Meal and
Bread; and one of <hi>Rice Jones, Welch</hi>-man; and a lying ſlanderous
Pamphlet of <hi>Nathaniel Smiths,</hi> a <hi>Shoemaker,</hi> who would have been
called a <hi>Doctor,</hi> but he was ſufficiently known, and the Lord cut
him off by death before he got his wicked work publiſhed; alſo
there is another envious Book againſt the Principles of Truth, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Robert Gorden Scotch</hi>-man, which <hi>Michael Stancliffe Hoſier</hi>
helps to ſpread up and down; and formerly another railing, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous,
and lying Pamphlet of one <hi>Bunions,</hi> the <hi>Tinker,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
called, News from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where the Judgments of God
were ſeen upon the woman, who was a drunken Sot, and the
ground of that ſcandalous Book; who afterwards hanged her
ſelf. All which lying and ſlanderous Books we teſtifie againſt;
for by Printing their Lyes and Slanders they think to render us
odious to the World, and to ſet the Magiſtrates againſt us, and
the rude Multitude upon us; but the Lord doth clear his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and preſerve his Heritage, and the ſlanderous Lips and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tongue he doth abhor; and we know that modeſt and ſober
People, and the Neighbours will not receive ſuch things againſt
an innocent People; but the rude Multitude, that are neareſt to
the Slanderer, and Lyer, and that is the Devils laſt ſhift, when
he cannot reſiſt the Principles of Truth, then he will invent Lyes
and Slanders, and caſt them upon the Truth, and the People of
God; and ſuch as are given up to believe Lyes are the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
(to them that invent ſuch Lyes and Slanders) to receive
them, but the clamorous ſpirit plucks his own houſe upon his
head.</p>
            <p>And theſe ſcandalous Pamphlets ſtuft full of Lyes by envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſpirits, againſt the People of God called <hi>Quakers;</hi> ſome of
them are not worth the anſwering, or beſtowing Paper upon,
more then what is already written in anſwer to them; for we
are ſo well known, and our Principles are ſo well known to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
People, that they will not give credit to their Lyes and
Slanders, vented from their envious malicious ſpirits, which they
are well known moſt of them: For all unrighteouſneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs,
either private or publique, our Principle of Truth,
which leads us to Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and Heavenly-Man,
doth teach us to deny, and to love Virtue, Righteouſneſs, and
Holineſs, without which none ſhall ſee the Lord; and ſo we can
defie all the Regiment of Slanderers and Ballad-mongers, with all
their Scandals and lying Pamphlets, and we are over them in
the Truth, and their end will be according to their works.</p>
            <p>And further to clear the precious Truth profeſſed by us, called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> We teſtifie againſt all diſorderly, looſe, and prophane
ſpirits and perſons; and when any are manifeſt, or found out to
be in any uncleanneſs, wickedneſs, or ſcandalous enormous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who have feignedly come ſometimes to our Meetings (ſome of
whoſe own party have watched for wickedneſs, and then ſet it to
ſale) We deny and reject it and them (whatever they pretend or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs)
as Inſtruments in the Devils hand to gratifie his Followers (who
rejoyce in Iniquity) by raiſing Blaſphemies and Reproaches
againſt the Innocent, and the Truth it ſelf. And we do not
own Society with ſuch as are diſobedient and corrupt, who hold
the Truth in unrighteouſneſs; neither can we own or receive
them or any ſuch, until they truly repent and reform; for true
Judgment amongſt us is ſet upon the head of all deceit and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
