            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable EDWARD, Earl of <hi>CLARENDON,</hi> Viscount <hi>CORNBERY,</hi> Baron HYDE of <hi>HYNDON;</hi> Lord High Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> Chancellour of the Vniversity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and one of the Lords of His Majesties Privy Council.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have had so great a thirst to testifie to your Lordship, and to publish to the World the extraordinary Zeal which I have for your service; that pretending to so little merit of my own, and yet having so many obligations upon me, I am to be excus'd, if in making use of anothers Labours to accomplish my design, I take occasion by this Dedication, to declare to the world, how immense your favours are, and how prone I am to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them to the utmost of my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents: And perhaps it will be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to your Lordship, that I express <hi>this</hi> rather by putting an excellent <hi>Authour</hi> into your hands (of which I pretend onely
<pb facs="tcp:53837:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to have been the <hi>Interpreter</hi>) than, whilst that learned person discourses so well of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Books,</hi> to have multiplied the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>ill-ones,</hi> by some production of my own. I have made choice (my Lord) of this Argument to present to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, because I esteem it the most apposite, and the most becoming, as it has an aspect to your Lordships noblest <hi>Character,</hi> which is to be as well <hi>L. Chancellour</hi> of the most famous <hi>University</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> as <hi>L. High Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; and, because I think, worthily to preside over Men of Letters, is a greater dignity than to be born to the name of <hi>Empire</hi>; so, as what was said of the great <hi>Themistius</hi> in the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramm,</hi> may with equal truth be applied to your Lordship in all the glorious steps which you have ascended— <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>That you were never less than now you are</hi>; especially, since your Lordships Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles are not so much the product of your Fortune, as the effect of your Merits; verifying by your universal knowledge, the Rank you hold over the <hi>Learned Republique,</hi> as well as over the <hi>Political</hi>; which is, in summ, to be the greatest and most accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd <hi>Minister,</hi> that this Nation has ever celebrated. But in nothing does this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb facs="tcp:53837:3"/>
more conspicuous, and for which your Lordship has greater cause to rejoice in, then that God has enlightn'd your great Mind, with a fervour so much becoming it in the promoting and encouraging of the ROYAL SOCIETY; which is in one word, to have dared a nobler thing, than has been done these fifty <hi>Ages</hi> and more, that the <hi>Knowledge of Causes,</hi> and the <hi>Nature of Things</hi> have layn concealed from us; and that the World has continu'd, without once having assum'd the Courage and Resolution, which our <hi>Illustrious Prince,</hi> and your <hi>Lordship,</hi> have shewed in esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing, and cultivating a Design so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and perfective of Humane Felicity, as far, at least, as in this life men may hope to attain it. My Lord, This is your Honour, and this is truely to fix and to merit it. For let men talk what they please of the Laurells of Conquerours, the Titles of great men, illustrious and ample Posterity; all the pleasures of the lower senses how exalted soever by the effects of Opulence, and Fortune; which make indeed a great noise, and stir for the time; and, whilst the World is in the <hi>Paroxysme,</hi> bear much before them; dazling the eyes of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and flattering the weaker discerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb facs="tcp:53837:4"/>
They arrive not to the least per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible degree of that Dignity, and true honour which a man may raise to himself by noble and virtuous Actions; Because there is nothing solid in them, they last but for a moment, in their using lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and expire. He that would lay a Foundation of true and permanent Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that would place it beyond the reach of Envy, must qualifie it with something more noble and intellectual, and which is not obnoxious to the common vicissitudes; because, by whatever circumstances such a worthy Design may happen to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd, it will nevertheless be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as long as Virtue shall have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate here; and when the World shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so deprav'd, that there is nothing sincere remaining in it, God himself will remunerate it hereafter. If the Soveraignes and Puissances of the Earth (having sated themselves with their Triumphs over Men and Provinces, enlarged their Dominions, and establish'd their estates) would one day think (as our glorious <hi>Prince</hi> has begun to them) of extending, and amplifying the Bounds and Empire of real Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, in pursuite of those <hi>Magnalia Naturae,</hi> to the glory and contemplation of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
<pb facs="tcp:53837:4"/>
and the universal benefit of Mankind; how happy would such <hi>Princes</hi> be, how fortunate their <hi>People</hi>! And truely this has made me frequently to consider, wherein the felicity of that great <hi>Monarch</hi> consisted, whose heart was so enlarged with knowledge, improv'd to the good of his Subjects, where silver was as the stones of the streets for abundance, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of life so generally affluent: Certainly it is by such a Design as our own <hi>Solomon,</hi> and your <hi>Lordship,</hi> is about to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that even We may hope for those glorious times again, and by which the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique health may be confirm'd, our Lives produced, knowledge and conversation improv'd, and joy and contentedness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as universal as the Air which gives us breath: For my Lord, what can be more glorious, and worthy a <hi>Prince,</hi> to which <hi>God</hi> himself has said, <hi>Dixi, Dii estis, I have said ye are Gods,</hi> then by this means to aid, and to comfort Mankind, which is environ'd with such variety of Miseries? And to emancipate, and redeem the rest, who by the utmost of their endeavours aspire to more happiness, to be freed from the Pressures, Errours and infinite Mistakes which they fall into, for want of
<pb facs="tcp:53837:5"/>
Experiences, and competent subsidiaries to essay them. But to accomplish this, my Lord, There is certainly nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, than in pursuite of that stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <hi>Idea</hi> of your Illustrious <hi>Predecessor,</hi> to set upon a Design no way beneath that of his <hi>Solomons House</hi>; which, however lofty, and to appearance <hi>Romantic,</hi> has yet in it nothing of Impossible to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, not onely considering it as Himself has somewhere defin'd the Qualifications, but as your <hi>Lordship</hi> has design'd the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> (and may in time, the <hi>Materials</hi>) as all the World must needs acknowledge, that shall but cast an eye over the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of such as have already devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; Because (but for the mistake which they made in honouring me with their suffrages) I should not blush to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the <hi>Royal-Society</hi> furnish'd with an Assembly as accomplish'd for that noble and great Attempt, as <hi>Europe,</hi> or the whole <hi>World</hi> besides, has any to produce; And that, my Lord, because it does not consist of a Company of <hi>Pedants,</hi> and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial persons; but of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and Refined Spirits that are universally <hi>Learn'd,</hi> that are <hi>Read, Travell'd, Experienc'd</hi> and <hi>Stout</hi>; in summ, my Lord, such as becomes
<pb facs="tcp:53837:5"/>
your Honour to cherish, and our <hi>Prince</hi> to glory in. These are the Persons, my Lord, that without the least of sordid, and self interest, do supplicate the continuance of your Lordships Protection, and by your Influences to put them into a farther capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to proceed in that glorious Work of Restoring the <hi>Sciences,</hi> Interpreting <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> unfolding the obstrusities of <hi>Arts,</hi> for the Recovery of the Lost; Inventing, and Augmenting of new and useful Things, and for whatsoever else is in the Dominion of inferiour Agents. For my own part, my Lord, I profess it, that were it in my power to choose, I had rather be the Author of one good and beneficial <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> than to have been <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> or the great <hi>Alexander</hi> himself; and do range the Names of a <hi>Gilbert,</hi> a <hi>Bacon, a Harvey,</hi> a <hi>Guttemberge, Columbus, Goia, Metius, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellus, Thyco, Galileo</hi> (not to mention <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, Proclus, Hieron, Archimedes, Ctesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, Boetius,</hi> and what more of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients) who gave us the <hi>Use of the Load-stone, Taught us the Art of Printing</hi>; found out the <hi>Circulation of the Blood, detected new Worlds, invented the Telescope,</hi> and other <hi>opticall Glasses, Engines</hi> and <hi>Automates,</hi> amongst the <hi>Heroes,</hi> whom they <hi>Deifi'd,</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="tcp:53837:6"/>
above the Stars; because they were the Authors of ten thousand more worthy Things, than those who had never been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med but for their blood-shed and cruelty, pride and prodigious lusts; nor would any memory of them have been preserv'd from oblivion, but for the Pens of such great <hi>Genius</hi>'s and learned men, of whom some of them did the least deserve. The noble <hi>Verulam</hi> your Lordships Predecessor, as he out-stripp'd all who went before him; so is he celebrated as far as knowledge has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Empire; and (maugre the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his latter Fortune) the Learned rise up at the sound of his very <hi>Name</hi>; And for what is all this? But his great and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning endeavours to advance the excellency of mens Spirits, cultivate humane Industry, and raise an <hi>Amphitheatre</hi> of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which this publique Soul of his had slept as much neglected and forgotten, as those who onely became great by their power, and perish'd with it. All this your Lordship knows; and therefore as your Education has been amongst the most refin'd, you burn with a desire to improve it also amongst others; so that the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours</hi> of <hi>France</hi> shall not for ever bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Reputation of having rendred
<pb facs="tcp:53837:6"/>
that Spot the envy of <hi>Europe,</hi> for being <hi>Fautors</hi> and <hi>Mecoenas</hi>'s to so many rare <hi>Witts,</hi> and laudable <hi>Societies,</hi> as are amongst that Mercurial people; since there is <hi>that</hi> left for your <hi>Lordship</hi> and our <hi>Nation,</hi> which is as far beyond the polishing of <hi>Phrases,</hi> and cultivating <hi>Language,</hi> as Heaven is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to Earth, and <hi>Things</hi> are better than <hi>Words</hi>; Though even those also will not be neglected in their due Time and Order: But it is prodigious onely to consider, how long these shells have been plai'd with, and pleased the World; That after so many Revolutions, in which Learning has been seen as it were at its highest Ascendent, there never yet appeared any man of Power, who possess'd a Soul big enough, and judgement suitable, to erect some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable <hi>Foundation</hi> for <hi>Practical Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> and for the Assembling of such whose united, and assiduous Endeavours, might penetrate beyond the Walls of what is yet discover'd, or receiv'd upon trust
<q>
                  <l>Atque omne immensum peragrarent mente, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moque</l>
               </q>
That might redeem the <hi>World</hi> from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency of so many <hi>Errours</hi> as we find by
<pb facs="tcp:53837:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
daily experience will not abide the <hi>Test,</hi> and yet retain their <hi>Tyranny</hi>; and that by the credit onely and address of those many <hi>Fencing-Schools</hi> which have been built (not to name them <hi>Colledges</hi>) and endow'd in all our <hi>Universities</hi>: I speak not here of those reverend, and renouned <hi>Societies</hi> which converse with <hi>Theologie,</hi> cultivate the Laws, <hi>Municipal,</hi> or <hi>Forreign</hi>; But, I deplore with just indignation, the supine neglect of the Other, amongst such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as are set apart for empty, and lesse fruitful <hi>Speculations</hi>; especially, since I find the pretences of so many sober and qualified persons as have deplor'd this effect, so very reasonable, and so eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beneficial. But why do I abound? Your <hi>Lordship</hi> who is already possess'd with all this, is not to be instructed, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and impertinence, which cannot be the least design of this <hi>Epistle</hi>; since those who know both your Lordships affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and inclination to promote so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Work, know also, that there is none more able to make it attain to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired protection. And this is, my Lord, worthily to consult your <hi>Fame,</hi> and to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize your <hi>Name</hi> in the World amongst the <hi>Good</hi> and the <hi>Virtuous</hi>; which will make

            <p>THis Advice occasion'd by a certain dispute, which was some moneths since controverted in his Library, who was then pleas'd to accept of it, had never been drawn out of the dust of my study, and expos'd to the Light; till not finding my self able to render a better, or more speedy satisfaction to the curiosity of many of my Friends, who desired Copies of it, I at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to print it: as well that it might deliver me from the charge and inconveniency of the Transcribers, as for my natural propensity to oblige the publique; whom, if this Advice be not worthy to satisfie, it may yet serve as a Guide at least to those who desire to furnish the world with better, that it may no longer be deprived of a piece which seems wanting to its felicity; and, for which respect alone I have been first constrain'd to break the Yce, and trace the way cursorily for those who may render it more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous at their leasure; This if you shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, I shall have cause to acknowledge your civility, and good will; If otherwise, I shall, at least, request you to excuse my faults, and those of the Printer.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53837:10"/>
(to my knowledge) upon whose advice a man might regulate himself concerning the choice of Books, the means of procuring them, and how they should be dispos'd of, that they might appear with profit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in a fair and Sumptuous Bibliotheque.</p>
            <p>For though we have indeed the Counsell which is given us by <hi>Iohn Baptist Card<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tortosa,</hi> touching the erecting and entertainment of the Royal Library of the <hi>Escurial</hi>; yet he hath so lightly passed over this subject, that though we did not esteem it as good as nothing, yet at least ought it not to retard the happy designe of those who would undertake to impart some greater light and directions to others, upon hope, that if they succeed no better, the difficulty of the Enterprise will not render them lesse excusable then him, and exempt from all sort of blame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch.</p>
            <p>As true it is, that it is not every mans Talent to acquit himself happily in this affair, and that the pains and the difficulty which there is in acquiring a superficial knowledge only of all the Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to deliver ones self from the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and slavery of certain opinions, which make us speak and govern all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53837:10"/>
to our Fancy, and to judge discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without passion, of the merit and quality of Authors; are difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties more then sufficient to perswade us, that what <hi>Iustus Lipsius</hi> elegantly spake, and much to the purpose, of two other sorts of persons, may be truly verified of a Library-keeper: <hi>Consules fiunt quotannis, &amp; novi Proconsules:</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Electis</note> 
               <hi>Solus aut Rex aut Poeta non quotannis nascitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if I, my Lord, assume the boldnesse to present you these <hi>Memoires</hi> and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; it is not, that I so much value and esteem my own Judgment, as to interpose it in an affair of so much difficulty; or that I am so far transported with self-love to imagine there is that in me, which is so rarely to be encountred amongst others: But the great affection which I have to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a thing which may be acceptable to you, is the sole cause which excites me to joyn the common sentiments of divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Learned, and extreamly versed in the knowledge of Books, and the several expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients practised by the most famous <hi>Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,</hi> to that which the little Industry &amp; Experience I have my self obtain'd, may to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether furnish me withall; that I may with this Advice, represent unto you the Precepts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53837:11"/>
and the means on which it is necessary to regulate ones self, and attain a fortunate successe in this noble and generous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.</p>
            <p>And therefore, my Lord, after I have made it my most humble request, that you would rather attribute this tedious discourse to the candor and sincerity of my affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then to the least presumption of being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to acquit my self of it more worthily then another; I shall freely tell you, that unlesse your designes be to equall the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Library, or the <hi>Ambrosiane</hi> of Cardinal <hi>Barromeus,</hi> you have already sufficient to give your minde repose, to be satisfied, and contented in possessing such a quantity of Books, and so rarely chosen, that though it be not arriv'd to those dimensions, it is yet more than sufficient, not only to serve your particular contentment, and the curiosity of your Friends; but to conserve likewise the reputation of being one of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, and best furnished Libraries of <hi>France</hi>; since you there enjoy all the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals</hi> in the chief <hi>Faculties,</hi> and a very great number of others, which may minister to the various rencontres of particular and less obvious subjects. But if your Ambition be to render your name illustrious by that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53837:11"/>
of your <hi>Bibliotheque,</hi> and to joyn this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient also to those which on all occasions you practise by the Eloquence of your Discourses, the Solidity of your Judgment, and the glory of the noblest Dignities and Magistratures which you have so successful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borne, to render an eternal Lustre to your Memory, and assure you whilst you live, that you may with ease disinvelope your self from the innumerable Volumes and Scrowles of Ages, to live and be famous in the Memories of men; it will then be needfull to augment, and every day to perfect what you have so happily begun; and insensibly to give such, and so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous a Progress to your Library, that it may become as unparallel'd as your self, without equal; and as fair, perfect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd, as it can be made by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of those, who never effect any thing without some spot and imperfection. <hi>Adeo nihil est ab omni parte beatum.</hi>

               <p>ANd now, my Lord, since all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of this Designe consists, in that (being able to execute it with facility) <hi>You</hi> think fit to undertake it. It will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, that, before we arrive at those Precepts which may serve to put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, we first deduce, and explain the reasons which are most likely to perswade You, that it is to Your advantage, and that You ought by no means to neglect it. For not to go far from the nature of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, common sence will informe us, that it is a thing altogether laudable, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, and worthy of a courage which breathes nothing but Immortality, to draw out of oblivion, conserve, and erect (like another <hi>Pompey</hi>) all these Images, not of the Bodies, but of the Minds of so many gallant men, as have neither spared their time, nor their Industry, to transmit to us the most lively features and representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of whatsoever was most excellent and conspicuous in them. And this is also a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53837:12"/>
thing which the younger <hi>Pliny</hi> (who was none of the least ambitious amongst the <hi>Romans</hi>) would seem particularly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us in, by that handsome expression in the first of his Epistles;<note place="margin">Epist. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Mihi pulchrum in primis videtur, non pati occidere quibus aeternitas debetur:</hi> since this curious passage, not trivial and vulgar, may legitimately pass for one of those lucky presages,<note place="margin">Lib. de utilit. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pienda ex adver.</note> of which <hi>Cardan</hi> speaks in his Chapter <hi>de si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnis eximiae potentiae</hi>; for that being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, difficult, and of great expence, it can no wayes be effected without giving every man occasion to speak well of it, and with Admiration, as it were, of him who puts it in Execution:<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53837:13"/>
those, who have never sought after these superfluous Inventions, and, for the most part, unprofitable; well judging and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that there was no expedient more honest and assur'd, to acquire a great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongst the people, than in erecting of fair and magnificent <hi>Libraries,</hi> to devote and consecrate them afterward to the use of the Publick? As true is it, that this Enterprise did never abuse nor deceive those who knew how to manage it well, and that it has ever been judg'd of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that not only particular persons have made it successeful to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as <hi>Richard de Bury, Bessarion, Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Pinelli, Sirlettus, Henry de Mesme</hi> your Grandfather of most happy memory, the English Knight <hi>Bodley,</hi> the late Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Thuanus,</hi> and a world of others; but that even the most ambitious would still make use of this, to crown and to perfect all their glorious atchievements, as with the Key-stone of the Arch, which adds lustre and ornament to all the rest of the Edifice. And I produce no other proofs and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of what I say, than those great Kings of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and of <hi>Pergamus, Xerxes, Augustus, Lucullus, Charlemain, Alphonsus</hi> of <hi>Arragon, Matth. Corvinus,</hi> and that great
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53837:13"/>
Prince <hi>Francis</hi> the First, who have all of them had a particular affection, and sought (amongst the almost infinite number of Monarchs and Potentates, which have also practis'd this Stratagem) to amass great numbers of Books, and erect most curious and well furnisht Libraries: not that they stood in need of other subjects of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and Fame, as having acquir'd sufficient by the Triumphs of their great and signal Victories; but because they were not ignorant, that those persons, <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus sola mentem animosque perurit gloria,</hi> should neglect nothing which may easily elevate them to the supream and Sovereign degree of esteem and reputation. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, should one enquire of <hi>Seneca,</hi> what are to be the actions of these gallant and puissant <hi>Genius</hi>'s, which seem not to have been sent into the world but to do Miracles, he would certainly answer us, <hi>Neminem excelsi ingenii virum humilia delectant &amp; sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. 39<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>magnarum rerum species ad se vocat &amp; allicit.</hi> And therfore, my Lord, it seems very much to the purpose, since you govern and preside in all signal Actions, that you never content your self with a Medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity in things which are good and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and since you have nothing of mean
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53837:14"/>
and vulgar, that you should also cherish, above all others, the honour and reputation of possessing a Bibliotheque, the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the best furnish'd and maintain'd of your time. In fine, if these Arguments have not power sufficient to dispose you to this Enterprise, I am at least perswaded, <hi>That</hi> of your particular satisfaction will of it self be sufficiently capable to make you resolve upon it: For if it be possible in this world to attain any sovereign good, any perfect and accomplisht felicity, I believe that there were certainly none more desireable than the fruitful entertainment, and most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able divertisement which might be received from such a Library by a learned man, and who were not so curious in having Books, <hi>ut illi sint coenationum ornamenta,</hi>

Briefly, seeing he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Master of this Contentment, that he might manage it after his own fancie, enjoy it when he would, quit it when he pleas'd, entertain himself in it at his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that without contradiction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out travail, and without pains, he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct

               <p>I shall only adde then, for the result of of all these reasons, and of many other; that it is easier for you to conceive, than 'tis for any other to expresse it, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not hereby to engage you in a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and extraordinary expence, as being not at all of their opinion, who think Gold and Silver the principal nerves of a Library, and who perswade themselves, (esteeming Books only by the price they cost) that there is nothing good to be had but what is dearly purchased. Yet, neither is it my designe to perswade you, that so great a provision can be made with a shut purse, and without cost; very well knowing that the saying of <hi>Plautus</hi> is as true on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as in many others, <hi>Necesse est facere sumptum qui quaerit lucrum:</hi> but to let you see by this present Discourse, that there are an infinity of other expedients, which a man may make use of with a great deal more facility and lesse expence, to attain at last, the scope which I propose to you.</p>

               <p>AMongst these now, my Lord, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there are none more profitable and necessary, than to be first well instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones self, before we advance on this enterprise, concerning the order, and the method which we ought precisely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to accomplish its end. And this may be effected by two means, sufficiently easie and secure.

The Second is, to consult, and diligently to collect those few Precepts that may be deduc'd from the Books of some Authors, who have written but sleightly upon this matter; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, The Counsel of <hi>Baptista Cardonius,</hi> the <hi>Philobiblion</hi> of <hi>Richardus de Bury,</hi> the life of <hi>Vincentius Pinelli,</hi> the Books of <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevine, de cultura ingeniorum,</hi> of that which <hi>Lipsius</hi> has made concerning Libraries, and of all the several <hi>Tables, Indexes,</hi> and <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi>; and govern ones self by the greatest and most renowned Bibliotheques which were ever erected: since to pursue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and precept of <hi>Cardan,</hi>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53837:16"/>
of the great and most famous Libraries, whether ancient or modern, publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, with us, or amongst strangers; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the <hi>Studies</hi> and <hi>Cabinets,</hi> which for not being much knownn, or visited, remain buried in perpetual silence: A thing which will no way appear strange, if we consider four or five principal reasons, which have caused me to establish this proposition. The first whereof is, That a man can do nothing in imitation of other Libraries, unlesse by the means of their Catalogues he have knowledge of what they contain. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, For that they are able to instruct us concerning the Books themselves, the place, the time, and the form of their Impression. The third, Because that a minde which is generous and nobly born, should have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and an ambition to assemble, as in one heap, whatsoever the others possesse in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>ut quae divisa beatos efficiunt, in se mixta fluant.</hi> The fourth, For that by this means, one may sometimes do a friend ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and pleasure; and when we cannot furnish him with the Book he is in quest of, shew, and direct him to the place where he may finde some Copie, a thing very fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible by the assistance of these Catalogues. Finally, Because it is altogether impossible,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53837:16"/>
that we should by our own industry, learn, and know the qualities of so vast a number of Books, as it's requisite to have, it is not without reason, that we follow the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the most intelligent and best ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this particular, and then to deduce this Inference; Since these Books have been collected and purchas'd by such and such, there is reason to believe, they deserv'd it for some circumstance unknown to us: And in effect, I may truly say, that for the space of two or three years, that I have had the honour to meet sometimes with <hi>M. de F.</hi> amongst the Book-sellers, I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently seen him buy Books so old, ill bound, and wretchedly printed, that I could not chuse, but smile and wonder together, till that he being afterwards pleas'd to tell me the cause and the circumstances for which he purchas'd them; his reasons seemed to be so pertinent, that I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver otherwise think, but that he is a person the best versed in the knowledge of Books, and discourses of them with more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and judgment, than any man whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not only in <hi>France,</hi> but in all the world besides.</p>

and divers other like it, which he gives us in five or six places of his Works, may in some measure favour, and fortifie this opinion, by the authority of so great a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: But if we would entirely subvert it, to establish our own as the most probable, we need only fix our selves upon the great difference which there is between the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of a particular man, and the Ambition of him who would appear conspicuous by the Fame of his Bibliotheque: or 'twixt him that alone disires to satisfie himself, and him that only seeks to gratifie and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Publique. For certain it is, that all these precedent reasons point only to the Instruction of those who would judiciously, and with order and method, make some progress in the Faculty which they pursue; or rather, to the condemnation of those that shew themselves sufficiently knowing, and pretend to great abilities, albeit they no more discern this vast heap of Books, which they have already assembled, then did those crooked persons (to whom King <hi>Alphonsus</hi> was wont to compare them) that huge bunch which they carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their Back; which is really very sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably reproch'd by <hi>Seneca,</hi> in the places before alledged; and in plainer terms yet,

And therefore I shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think it extreamly necessary, to collect for this purpose all sorts of Books, (under such precautions, yet, as I shall establish) seeing a Library which is erected for the publick benefit ought to be universal, but which it can never be, unlesse it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all the principal Authors that have written upon the great diversity of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Subjects, and chiefly upon all the Arts and Sciences; of which, if one had but considered the vast numbers which are in the <hi>Panepistemon</hi> of <hi>Angelus Politianus,</hi> or in any other exact Catalogue lately compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: I do not at all doubt, but that you will be ready to judge by the huge quantity of Books which we ordinarily meet with in Libraries) in ten or twelve of them, what number you ought to provide, to satisfie the curiosity of the Readers upon all that remains.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53837:20"/>
it would be an eternal shame and reproch in us, to come beneath them in this particular, which we may surmount with so much advantage and facility. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as the quality of Books does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly augment the esteem of a Library amongst those who have the means, and the leasure to understand it; so must it needs be acknowledged, that the sole quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them brings it into lustre, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as well amongst Strangers and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, as amongst many others, who have neither the time, nor the conveniency of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly turning them over in particular; as may easily be judged by the prodigious number of Volumes, that there must needs be an infinity of good ones, signal, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. Howbeit, neither to abandon this infinite quantity without a definition, nor to put those that are curious out of hopes of being able to accomplish, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish so fair an enterprise; it would, me thinks, be very expedient to do like those Physitians, who prescribe the quantity of <hi>Drugs</hi> according to their qualities; and to affirm, that a man can never fail in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting all those which shall have the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and conditions requisite and fit to be placed in a Library.

               <p>Neither are you to omit all those which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53837:23"/>
have innovated or chang'd any thing in the <hi>Sciences</hi>; for it is properly to flatter the slavery, and imbecillity of our wit, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the small knowledge which we have of these Authors, under the disdain which we might have, because they oppose the Antients, and for that they have learnedly examin'd what others were used to receive, as by Tradition: And therefore, seeing of late more then thirty or fourty Authors of reputation have declared themselves against <hi>Aristotle</hi>; that <hi>Copernicus, Kepler, Galilaeus,</hi> have quite altered Astronomie; <hi>Paracelsus, Severinus</hi> the <hi>Dane, Du Chesne,</hi> and <hi>Crollius,</hi> Physick: and that divers others have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced new Principles, and have established strange and unheard of <hi>Ratiocinations</hi> upon them, and such as were never foreseen: I affirm, that all these Authors are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in a Library, since according to the common Saying,
<q>
                     <l>Est quoque cunctarum novitas gratissima rerum.</l>
                  </q>
and (not to insist upon so weak a reason) that it is certain, the knowledge of these Books is so expedient, and frugiferous to him who knows how to make reflection, and draw profit from all that he sees, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53837:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it will furnish him with a million of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and new conceptions; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received in a spirit that is docile, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, and disingag'd from all interests,
<q>
                     <l>Nullius addictus jurare in verba Magistri,</l>
                  </q>
they make him speak to the purpose upon all subjects, cure the admiration which is a perfect signe of our weaknesse, and enables one to discourse upon whatsoever presents it self with a great deal more judgment, experience, and resolurion, then ordinarily many persons of letters and merit are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do.</p>
               <p>One should likewise have this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the choice of Books, to see whether they be the first that have been composed upon the matter on which they treat. Since 'tis with mens Learning, as with water, which is never more fair, pure, and limpid, then at its source; All the Invention come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the First, and the Imitation with repetition from others: as 'tis easy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Reuchlin</hi> who first writ of the Hebrew Tongue, and the Cabal; <hi>Budeus</hi> of the Greek, and of Coyns; <hi>Bodinus</hi> of a Republique; <hi>Cocles</hi> of Physiognomie; <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lombard, S. Thomas,</hi> of Scholastical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53837:24"/>
have done better then those many others, which ingag'd themselves in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting since them.</p>
               <p>Moreover ought one also to take notice, whether the Subjects of which they treat be trifling or less vulgar; curious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; spinie or facil; seeing what we use to say of all things else that be not common, may be so appositely applyed to curious new Books;
<q>
                     <l>Rara juvant, primis sic major gratia pomis,</l>
                     <l>Hibernae pretium sic meruere rosae.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Under the notion then of this precept we should open our Libraries, and receive them therein, who first wrote of Subjects the least known, and that have not been treated of before, unless in Fragments, and very imperfectly; as <hi>Licetus,</hi> who hath written <hi>de spontaneo viventium ortu, de lucer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis antiquorum; Tagliacotius,</hi> how to repair a decayed Nose; <hi>Libanius</hi> and <hi>Coclinus</hi> of the Magnetick Oyntment; Secondly, All curious and not vulgar Authors; such as are the books of <hi>Cardan, Pomponacius, Brunus,</hi> and all those who write concerning the <hi>Caball, Artificial Memory,</hi> the <hi>Lullian Art,</hi> the <hi>Philosophers Stone, Divinations,</hi> and the like matters.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53837:24"/>
For, though the greatest part of them teach nothing but vain and unprofitable things, and that I hold them but as stumbling blocks to all those who amuse themselves upon them, yet notwithstanding that one may have wherwithal to content the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wits, as well as the strong; and at the least satisfie those who desire to see them, to refute them, one should collect those which have treated on them, albeit they ought to be accounted amongst the rest of the Books in the Library, but as Serpents and Vipers are amongst other living Creatures; like Cockle in a Field of good wheat; like Thorns amongst the Roses: and all this in imitation of the world, where these unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and dangerous things accomplish the Master-piece, and the Fabrick of that goodly composition.</p>
               <p>And this Maxime should lead us to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of no less consequence, which is, not to neglect the works of the principal <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resiarchs</hi> or Fautors of new Religions dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from ours, more common, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as more just and veritable: For it is very likely, since the first of them, (not to speak of the new ones) have been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, and drawn out from amongst the most learned personages of the precedent Age,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53837:25"/>
who by I know not what Fancie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive love to novelty, did quit their <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>socks,</hi> and the Banner of the Church, to enroll themselves under that of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvine</hi>; and that those of the present time are not admitted to the excercise of their Ministry till after a long and severe <hi>Examen</hi> in the three Tongues of the Holy Scripture, and the chief points of Philosophy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inity: There is a great deal of likelihood, I say, that excepting the passages controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they may sometimes hit very luckily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, as in many indifferent Treatises they have done, on which they often travail with a great deal of Industry and Felicity. And therefore, since it is necessary that our Doctors should finde them in some places to refute them; since <hi>M. de T.</hi> has made it no difficulty to collect them; that the antient Fathers and Doctors had them, that divers religious persons preserved them in their Libraries; that we make it no Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to have a <hi>Thalmud</hi> or an <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which belch a thousand Blasphemies against Jesus Christ, and our Religion, infinitely more dangerous then these: that God permits us to make profit of our enemies, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Psalmist, <hi>Salutem ex inimicis nostris, &amp; de manu omnium qui ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53837:25"/>
nos</hi>; that they are prejudicial but to them onely, who destitute of a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, suffer themselves to be transported with the first puff of wind that blows.</p>
               <p>And to conclude in a word, since the intention which determines all our actions to good or evil, is neither vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious not cauterised, I conceive it no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance or danger at all, to have in a Library (under caution nevertheless of a license and permission from those to whom it appertains) all the Works of the most learned and famous <hi>Hereticks,</hi> such as have been, — and divers others of lesser consequence, <hi>Quos fama obscura re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This also ought to be retained as a <hi>Maxime,</hi> that all the bodies and assemblies of several Authours writing upon the same subject; such as are the <hi>Thalmud,</hi> the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,</hi> the <hi>Biblotheques</hi> of the Fathers, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saurus Criticus, Scriptores Germanici, Turcici, Hispanici, Gallici, Catalogus testium veritatis, Monarchia Imperii, Opus magnum de Balneis, Authores Gyneciorum, De Morbo Neapolitano, Rhetores antiqui, Grammatici Veteres, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores Graeciae, Flores Doctorum, Corpus Poeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and all those which contain such like Collections, ought of necessity to be put
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53837:26"/>
into Libraries; forasmuch as they save us, first of all, the labour of searching an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of Books extreamly curious and rare: and secondly, because they spare abundance of other, and make room in a Library. Thirdly, for that they handsomly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in one Volume, what we should be otherwise long in searching with a great deal of pains, and in divers places; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, because they are less expensive, they being nothing so chargeable to purchase as they would be, should one buy separately all the Authours which they contain. I hold it also for a tenent as necessary as any of the precedent, that one should draw out and make election from amongst the great number of those who have written, and do daily write; those who appear as an Eagle in the Clouds, and as a Star twinkling and most refulgent in the midst of obscurity; I mean those great Witts, which are not of the common alloy;

               <p>Neither must you forget all sorts of <hi>Common places, Dictionaries, Mixtures,</hi> seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Lections, Collections of Sentences,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>HAving now, my Lord, shewed by these three first Points, what one ought to pursue to inform himself in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of a Library; with what quantity of Books it is expedient to furnish it, and of what quality they ought to be chosen: That which now ensues, is to enquire, by what means a man may procure them, and what we are to do for the progress, and augmentation of them: Upon all which, I shall truly affirm, that the first precept which is to be given on this subject, is, that a man studiously preserve those which are actively acquired, and that he yet obtain new ones every day; not suffering any to be lost or embezled at any hand. <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilius enim est, faciliusque</hi> (sayes <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>non acquirere, quam amittere, ideoque laetio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res videbis quos nunquam fortuna respexit, quam quos deseruit.</hi> Add, that t'will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be this way to augment much, if that which you have collected with so much pains and industry, come to be lost, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53837:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to perish for want of care: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ovid</hi> and the wisest men had reason to say, that it was no less vertue to preserve a thing well, than to acquire it so: <hi>Nec minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tueri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is, that we neglect nothing which is worth the reckoning, and which may be of use, be it either to our selves or others; such as are <hi>Libels, Placarts, Theses, Fragments, Proofs,</hi> and the like, which one ought carefully to unite, and gather according to Titles, and subjects of which they treat; because it is the onely expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to render them considerable, and so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, <hi>Ut quae non prosunt singula, juncta ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</hi> Otherwise, it ordinarily comes to pass, that whilst we despise these little Books, which appear onely as me<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and pieces of no consideration, we happen to lose a world of rare collections, and such as are sometimes the most curious pieces of the whole Library.</p>
               <p>The third may be deduced from the means that were practis'd by <hi>Richard de Bury</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> great <hi>Chancellour</hi> and L. <hi>Treasurer</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in publishing and making known to every body the affection which we have to Books, and the extraordinary desire which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53837:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we have to erect a Library; for this being once divulged and communicated, it is certain, that if he who designes it be in sufficient credit and authority to do his friends pleasure; there will not be a man of them but will take it for an honour to present him with the most curious Books that come into his hands; and that will not voluntarily admit him into his Study, or in those of his friends; briefly, who will not strive to aid and contribute to his intention all that he can possibly? as it is very well observed by the same <hi>Richard de Bury,</hi> in these proper terms, which I therefore the more willingly transcribe, because his Book is very rare, and of the number of those which are lost through our neglect. <hi>Succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentibus</hi> (sayes he) <hi>prosperis,</hi>

To which he yet adjoyns, the several Voyages which he made himself in quality of <hi>Ambassador,</hi> and the great number of learned, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious persons, whose labour and industry he made use of in this research; and what yet induces me to believe that these practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses would have some effect, is, that I know a person, who being curious of <hi>Medalls, Pictures, Statues, Intaglia</hi>'s and other <hi>Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> pieces, hath collected by this sole indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, above twelve hundred pounds worth, without ever having disbursed four. And in earnest, I hold it for a <hi>Maxime,</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very civil and good natur'd man, should alwayes second the laudable intentions of his friends, provided they be not prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to his own: So that he that has <hi>Books,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53837:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Medalls, Pictures,</hi> which come to him by chance, rather than out of affection to them, may easily be perswaded to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate such of his friends <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he knows to desire, and is curious of them. I shall willingly add to this third Precept, the craft which <hi>Magistrates</hi> and persons of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority may practise, and exercise by means of their dignities: but I would not more nakedly explicate it, than by the simple narration of the Strategem which the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> made use of, to obtain the best <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts</hi> of <hi>Pinellus</hi> immediately after his decease; for upon the advice which they had, that they were about to transport his Library from <hi>Padua</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> they sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly dispatched one of their <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who seised upon a hundred Bales of Books, amongst which there were fourteen of them that contain'd <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> and two of them above four hundred <hi>Commentaries</hi> on all the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi>; alledging for their reasons, that though they had permitted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct <hi>Seigneur Pinelli,</hi> in regard of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, his design, his laudable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachless life, and principally, the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which he ever testified towards the <hi>Republique,</hi> to have Copies of their <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives,</hi> and <hi>Registers</hi> of their affairs; yet
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53837:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it was neither fit nor expedient for them, that such pieces should come to be divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, discovered and communicated after his death; whereupon at the instance of the Heirs and Executors of the <hi>Testament,</hi> who were powerful and authorised, they retained onely two hundred of these <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,</hi> which were placed in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber apart, with this inscription, <hi>Decerpta haec Imperio Senatus e Bibliotheca Pinelliana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is, to retrench and cut off all the superfluous expences, which many prodigally and to no purpose bestow upon the binding and ornaments of their Books, and to employ it in purchasing such as they want, that so they may not be obnoxious to that censure of <hi>Seneca,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quill.</hi>
                  </note> who handsomly reproaches those, <hi>Quibus voluminum suo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum frontes maxime placent titulique</hi>; and this the rather, that the binding is nothing but an accident and form of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without which (at least so splendid and sumptuous) Books become altogether as useful, commode and rare; it becoming the ignorant onely to esteem a Book for its cover; seeing it is not with Books, as it is with men, who are onely known and respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for their robes and their clothes, so that it is a great deal better, and more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53837:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for example, to have a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Books, well and ordinarily bound, than to have a little Chamber or Cabinet full of washed, gilded, ruled, and enriched with all manner of nicity, lux and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity.</p>
               <p>The fifth concerns the buying of them, and that may be divided into four or five Articles, suitable to the several expedients which may be observed in the practise. Now, amongst these, I should willingly set down for the first, the speediest, easie and advantagious of all the rest, that which is made by the acquisition of some other entire and undissipated Library. I call it prompt, and speedy; because that in less than a dayes time one may have a goodly number of Books curious and learned, which one shall not be able to amass and collect together during a mans whole life. I call it facil, because one spares both the pains and the time which would be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in purchasing them separately; In fine, I name it advantagious, because, if the <hi>Libraries</hi> which we buy be good and curious, they serve to augment the credit and reputation of those who are enriched by them; whence we see that <hi>Passe vinus</hi> so much esteems that of <hi>Cardinal de Ioyeuse,</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:53837:40"/>
for that it was composed of three others, one whereof had been <hi>Monsieur Pitheus,</hi> and for that all the most renouned Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have received their augmentation in this manner; as for instance, that of <hi>S. Mark</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> by the donation of Cardinal <hi>Bessarion</hi>'s; that of the'<hi>Escurial</hi> by that great one which <hi>Hurtado de Mendoza</hi> had collected; The <hi>Ambrosian</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> by the ninety Bales which were added to it at once by that one sole naufrage and ruine of <hi>Pinelli</hi>'s; that of <hi>Leyden,</hi> by above two hundred Manuscripts in the Oriental Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> bequeathed to it by his <hi>Testament</hi>; and finally, that of <hi>Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Colomna,</hi> by that incomparable one which Cardinal <hi>Sirlettus</hi> left it; whence I conjecture, my Lord, that yours cannot but one day emerge one of the most famous and renouned amongst the greatest, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that of your Fathers, which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy so famous and universally known from the relation which has been left to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by <hi>La Croix, Fauchet, Marsillius, Turue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, Passeratius, Lambinus,</hi> and by almost all the gallant persons of that strain, who have not been mindfull of the benefit and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which they have received of them.</p>
               <p>After all which, me thinks, the means
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53837:41"/>
which nearest approaches to this first, is, to rummage and often to revisite the shops of frippery <hi>Booksellers,</hi> and the old <hi>Stores</hi> and Magazines as well of Books bound up, as of those which have so long remained in waste sheets, so many years, that there are many, not much knowing and versed in this kind of search, who conceive they can be of no other use then to hinder.

                     <l>Ne toga cordivis, ne penula de sit olivis,</l>
                  </q>
albeit we often encounter very excellent Books amongst them, and that (the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence well managed) one may chance to purchase more for ten crowns, than one can otherwise buy for fourty or fifty, should one take them in several places and pieces; provided nevertheless, a man have a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient stock of care and patience, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that one cannot say of a Library what certain Poets said of our City,
<q>
                     <l>Quo primum nata est tempore, magna fuit:</l>
                  </q>
It being impossible so speedily to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish a thing, of which <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us there is no end; <hi>Libros enim faciendi non erit finis</hi>; and to the finishing whereof, though

                  <hi>Monsieur Thuanus</hi> has laboured twenty years, <hi>Pinelli</hi> fifty, and divers others all their lives long, yet are you not to believe, that they are arrived to that utmost perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which were to be wished one might attain to, in point of a Library.</p>
               <p>But since it is necessary for the growth and augmentation of such a piece, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it diligently with all the new Books of merit and consideration that are printed in all parts of <hi>Europe</hi>; and that <hi>Pinelli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and the rest have for this purpose entertain'd correspondency with an infinite number of friends, strangers, and forreign Merchants; It would be very expedient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to put the same in practice, or at least, to make choice of two or three rich <hi>Merchants</hi> knowing and experienced in their vocation, who by their various intelligences, and voyages, might furnish us with all kinds of novelties, and make diligent perquisition of what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we demand by <hi>Catalogues</hi>; which thing it is not so necessary to practise for old Books, forasmuch as the surest expedient to store ones self good cheap with them, is, to seek for them indifferently among<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:53837:42"/>I will not yet infer, for all the good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry which we have proposed above, that it is not sometimes necessary to exceed the limits of this <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> to purchase at extraordinary prices some certain Books that are very rare, and which one shall hardly get out of their hands who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them, but by this onely means. But the temper which is to be observed in this difficulty, is, to consider that <hi>Libraries</hi> are neither built nor esteemed but for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and benefit which one may receive from them, and therefore one should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect such Books &amp; Manuscripts as are only valuable in respect of their <hi>Antiquity, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, paintings, binding,</hi> and other weak considerations; Such as <hi>were the Froissard,</hi> which certain Merchants would have sold not long since at three hundred Crowns; The <hi>Bocace</hi> of the unfortunate Nobles, which was estimated at a hundred; The <hi>Missal</hi> and <hi>Bible</hi> of <hi>Guinart</hi>; the <hi>Howres,</hi> which they are wont to say was inestimable for its curious figures and copartiments, The <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> and other Historians in <hi>Manuscripts</hi> &amp; painted in <hi>miniature; Chinese</hi> and <hi>Iapan</hi> Books, such as are drawn in <hi>Punchment,</hi> stained Paper, of extream fine Cotton, and with large Margents, and

several others of the like stuff; to employ the great sums which they cost, upon Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes more useful in a Library than all these we have mentioned, or such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble them, which shall never make the passionate Collectors of them so much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, as was <hi>Ptolomeus Phil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> forasmuch as it onely appertains to those who would build places expresly for this purpose, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely to observe all the rules and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which depend on the <hi>Architecture,</hi> many particularities being necessarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to submit to the divers shapes of their dwellings, to place their Library as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently as they can; and to speak se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, I conceive it the sole occasion which has perswaded <hi>Architects</hi> to add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to what <hi>Vitruvius</hi> has said thereupon. Howbeit, not to publish this advice lame and imperfect, I shall offer you my opinion in short, to the end that every body may make use of it according to his power,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53837:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or as he shall judge it to his liking.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns then the situation, where one would build, or choose a place convenient for a Library, it seems that this common saying

would oblige us to take it in a part of the house the most retired from the noise and disturbance, not onely of those without, but also of the family and domesticks; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the streets, from the kitchin, the common hall, and like places; to situate ir (if possible) within some spacious Court, or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

it from intemperatures of the air; as those whose roofs are low quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the incommodity of the rain, snow, and heats; Which if there be no means easily to avoid, yet ought one at least to be careful that they ascend to them by four or five steps, as I have observed in the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosian</hi> at <hi>Milan</hi>; and the higher the better, and that as well in respect of its beauty, as to avoid the named inconveniences; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, the place being humid, and ill situated, you must of necessity have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to mats or tapistries, to line the walls withall, and to the stove or chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in which nothing must be consumed save wood, which will burn without smoke, to heat and dry the room during the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and other wet seasons of the year.</p>
               <p>But all these difficulties and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are nothing to those which are to be observed for the giving light, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently placing the windows of a Library, as well for being of so great importance, that it be fully illuminated to the very far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest corners, as in respect likewise of the several natures of the winds which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily blow, and which produce effects as different as are their qualities and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces through which they pass; upon which,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53837:45"/>
I say, there are two things to be observed; the first, that the <hi>transum</hi> and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Library (if they must be through-lights) be not diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, unless those onely which give day to some table; that so the lights passing not <hi>through,</hi> the place be sufficiently supplyed. The second, that the principal overtures be alwayes placed towards the <hi>East,</hi> as well because of the early light which the Library may receive in the morning, as in respect of the winds which spire from that quarter, which for being hot and dry of nature, do wonderfully attemper the air, fortifie the senses, subtilize the humors, depure the spirits, preserve a good consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, correct the bad, and in a word, are very healthy and salubrous: whereas on the contrary, those which blow from the <hi>West</hi> are more troublesom and noxious, and the <hi>Meridional</hi> more dangerous than all the rest, for that being hot and moist they dispose things to corruption, thicken the air, nourish wormes, engender ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, foment and create sicknesses, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us to new ones; whence that of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, Austri auditum hebetantes, Caligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosi, caput gravantes, pigri, dissolventes</hi>; for that they fill the head with certain vapors
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53837:46"/>
humidities which cloud the spirits, relax the nerves, obstruct the conduits, obfusk the sense, and render us dull and almost unfit for all sorts of actions; Therefore, in defect of the first, you should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the <hi>septentrionall,</hi> and which by reason of their qualities, cold, and drye, ingenders no humidity, and do well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve both the Books and Papers.</p>

               <p>THe seventh point, and which seems absolutely necessary to be treated of after the precedent, is that of the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Disposition</hi> which Books ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in a <hi>Library</hi>; for without this, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, all inquiring is to no purpose, and our labour fruitless; seeing Books are for no other reason laid and reserved in this place, but that they may be serviceable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such occasions as present themselves; Which thing it is notwithstanding impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to effect, unless they be ranged, and disposed according to the variety of their subjects, or in such other sort, as that they

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53837:47"/>
I conceive that to be alwayes the best which is most facil, the least intricate, most natural, practised, and which follows the Faculties of <hi>Theologie, Physick, Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, Mathematicks, Humanity,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which should be subdivided each of them into particulars, according to their several members, which for this purpose ought to be reasonably well understood by him who has the charge of the Library; as for example, in <hi>Divinity,</hi> you should ever place the <hi>Bibles</hi> first, according to the order of the tongues, next <hi>these,</hi> the <hi>Councells, Synods, Decrees, Canons,</hi> and all that concerns the <hi>Ecclesiastical constitutions</hi>; forasmuch as they retain the second place of authority amongst us; After these, the <hi>Fathers, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>; then the <hi>Commentators, Scholasticks, Mix'd Doctors, Historians,</hi> and finally, the <hi>Heretiques.</hi> In <hi>Philosophy,</hi> to begin with that of <hi>Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus</hi> as the most antient, follow by that of <hi>Plato,</hi> of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> of <hi>Raymondus Lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Ramus,</hi> and finish with the <hi>Novators, Telesius, Patricius, Campanella, Verulamius, Gilbert, Iordanus Brunus, Gassendus, Basso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Gomesius, Carpenter, Gorleus,</hi> which are the principal amongst a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and so to observe the like in all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53837:48"/>
with these cautions, sedulously observed: the first, that the most univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal and antient, do alwayes march in front; the second, that the <hi>Interpreters</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators</hi> be placed apart, and rang'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of the Books which they explicate; the third, that the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Treatises follow the rank and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their matter and subject, in the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi>; the fourth and last, that all Books of like argument and subject be precisely reduced, &amp; disciplin'd in their destin'd places; since in so doing, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is so refreshed, that it would be easie in a moment onely to find out whatever Book one would choose or desire, in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary that were as vast as that of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>; to effect which yet with more ease and contentment, care must be had, that those Books which are in too small Volumes to be bound alone, be joyned onely with such as treat upon the like or very same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and yet it were better to bind them also single, then to make so great a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in a Library as joyning them with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of subjects so extravagant and wide, that a man should never imagine to find them in such Companies. I know well, that one may represent to me here
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53837:48"/>
two notable inconveniences, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company this order; <hi>viz.</hi> the difficulty of handsomly reducing and placing of certain mixed Books in any <hi>Classes</hi> or principal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and the continual pains which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the disturbing of a Library when one is to range a thirty or fourty Volumes into several places thereof: But to this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, First, that there are but very few Books but what are reducible to some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, especially when one has many of them; being once placed, a very sleight memory will serve to admonish one where they stand; and at the worst, it is but to destine a certain place to martial them in altogether: And as to the second Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, It is true, that a man might avoid some trouble by setting the Books loose, or in leaving some small place at the extreams of the shelves, or places, where every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ends: but it would yet, me thinks, be much more advantagious, to choose some place destin'd for such Books as should be purchased during every six moneths, at expiration whereof they should be ranged amongst the rest, each in their proper stages; since by this means also they would be the better, being dust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and handled twice a year; And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53837:49"/>
I conceive, that this order being the most practised will ever be esteemed much better and easier than that of the <hi>Ambrosian Library,</hi> and some others, where all the Books are indifferently ranged <hi>pell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesle,</hi> according to the order of their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes and Ciffers, and onely distinguished in a <hi>Catalogue,</hi> wherein every piece is found under the name of its Author; forasmuch as that to avoid the precedent inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, it draws along with it an <hi>Iliad</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to many whereof one may yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a remedy, by a <hi>Catalogue</hi> faithfully compiled according to the <hi>Classes,</hi> and each <hi>Faculty</hi> subdivided to the most precise and particular of their parts.</p>
               <p>There now remains only Manuscripts to be spoken of, which cannot be better placed then in some quarter of the Library, there being no occasion to separate and sequester them from it; since they compose the best part and the most curious, and esteemed; to this add, that divers easily perswade themselves, when they do not see them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest of the bookes, that all those Chambers where we use to say they are lock't up, are onely imaginary, and only destin'd to excuse such as indeed have none. There we may see one intire side of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53837:49"/>
the <hi>Ambrosian</hi> Library which is filled with nine thousand <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> which have all been assembled by the care and diligence of the <hi>Sieur Iovanni Antonio Olgiati</hi>; And in that of <hi>M.</hi> the <hi>President Thuanus,</hi> there is one Chamber of the same floor with the rest, destin'd for this purpose. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in prescribing the order which one might thence observe, you must consider that there are two sorts of <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> and that those which are of a just Volume and Bulk may be martial'd as other Books are; with this precaution nevertheless, that in case there be any of great consequence, prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and defended, they be placed upon the upmost shelves, and without any exteriour Title, that so this may be the farthest distant both from hand and eye, and so neither to be known nor handled but at the discretion of him which hath the charge of them; the same which ought also to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice with the other sort of <hi>Manuscripts</hi> which consist in sheets, and small loose pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which should be united by bundles and parcels according to their subjects, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upmost of all the rest, because being small, and easily transcribed, they would be daily obnoxious to be taken away or borrowed, if they should be placed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part where they might be seen and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53837:50"/>
by every one, as it frequently happens to Books which lye upon <hi>desks</hi> in antient Libraries: And this is sufficient to have been spoken upon this point on which there is no farther need of enlarging, since the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Nature</hi> which is alwayes uniform and like her self, not being to be exactly imitated, by reason of the extravagancy and diversity of Books, there onely remains that of <hi>Art,</hi> which every man will for the most part e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish according to his own fancy, and as he finds best to suite his purpose, by his own judgement and understanding, as well to satisfie himself, as because he will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the tracks and opinions of others.</p>

But that we may extract some instructions from these disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53837:51"/>
we ought to choose and draw out of these extreams that which is so requisite for a Library, that we may at no hand neglect it, without avarice, nor exceed without prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality; I say, first of all, That as to the binding of Books, there is no need of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary expence; it were better to reserve that mony for the purchasing of all the books of the fairest and best editions that are to be found; unless that to delight the eyes of Spectators, you will cause all the backs of such as shall be bound as well in Rough, as in <hi>Calveskin,</hi> or <hi>Morroccin,</hi> to be gilded with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and some little flowers, with the name of the Authors; for which you may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the <note n="*" place="margin">They are two several Trades in <hi>France</hi>

               <p>Nor is there any necessity of seeking for, and amassing in a Library all these pieces and fragments of old Statues,

It being sufficient to have good Copies drawn from such as are most famous in the profession of Letters; that thereby a man may at once make judgement of the wit of the Authours by their Books, and by their bodies, figure, and physiognomy by these Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Images, which joyn'd to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription which many have made of their lives, may serve, in my opinion, as a puissant spurre to excite a generous and well-born Soul to follow their <hi>track,</hi> and to continue firm and stable in the wayes and beaten paths of some noble enterprise and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Much less ought one to employ so much gold on the Cieling, Ivory and glass upon the Walls, the Cedar Shelves, and Marble Floors, seeing this is not now in use; nor do they now place their Books upon Desks, as the antients did; but upon Shelves that hide all the Walls; but in lieu of such gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Finally, it would be a great forgetfulness, if after we have thus furnisht a Library with all things requisite, it should not have the

                  </hi>; of <hi>Ranzovius,</hi> at <hi>Brandeburg</hi>; of <hi>Foulcres,</hi> at <hi>Ausbourg</hi>; and finally, the Kings at <hi>S. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> and of <hi>M. de T.</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> which are all of them fair and admirable; but neither open to every one, nor so easie of access, as are the three precedent: for to speak of the <hi>Ambrosian</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> onely, and shew how (by the same means) it surpasses as well in greatness and magnificence, as in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging the publique, many of those that were even amongst the <hi>Romans</hi>; is it not a thing altogether extraordinary, that any one may
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53837:53"/>
come into it, almost at all hours he will, stay as long as he pleases, see, read, extract what Authors he desires, have all the means and conveniences to do it, be it in publique or particular, and that without any other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, than visiting it himself at the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary dayes, and hours, placing himself in the seats destin'd for this purpose, and asking of the <hi>Bibliothecary</hi> for those Books which he desires to make use of, or of any three of his servants, who are well stipendiated, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd as well for the service of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,</hi> as of all those who come every day thither to study in it.</p>
               <p>But to regulate this <hi>liberty</hi> with civility, and all those precautions which are requisite, I suppose it would be expedient to make ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and choice in the first place of some honest person, learned, and well experienc'd in Books, to give, together with the charge and requisite stipends, the title and quality of <hi>Bibliothecary</hi> unto, as we see it has been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in all the most renoun'd Libraries, where divers gallant men have alwayes thought themselves much honoured in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting this charge, and have rendred it most illustrious and recommendable by their great learning and capacity; as for instance, <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius Phalerius, Callimachus, Apollonius, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus, Aristoxenus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zenodotus,</hi> who had the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53837:54"/>
charge heretofore of that of <hi>Alexandria; Varro</hi> and <hi>Hyginus,</hi> who govern'd that on <hi>Mount Palatinus</hi> at <hi>Rome; Leidratus</hi> and <hi>Agobardus,</hi> that of the Island <hi>Barbe</hi> near <hi>Lyons</hi> under <hi>Charlemaine; Petrus Diaconus</hi> that of <hi>Mount Cassin; Platina, Eugubinus</hi> and <hi>Sirlettus,</hi> that of the <hi>Vatican; Sabellius</hi> that of <hi>Venice; Wolphius</hi> of <hi>Basil; Greuter</hi> that of <hi>Heidelburgh; Douza</hi> and <hi>Paulus Merula</hi> that of <hi>Leyden,</hi> whom the learned <hi>Heinsius</hi> has succeeded; as after <hi>Budaeus, Gosselinus,</hi> and <hi>Casaubon, M. Rigaultius</hi> does at present govern the <hi>Bibliotheque Royal</hi> established by King <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> and exceedingly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the extream industry and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which he used.</p>
               <p>After all which it shall be very requisite to make two <hi>Catalogues</hi> of all the Books contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Library, in one whereof they should be so precisely dispos'd according to their several <hi>Matters</hi> and <hi>Faculties,</hi> that one may see &amp; know in the twinkling of an eye, all the Authors which do meet there upon the first subject that shall come into one head; and in the other, they should be faithfully ranged and reduced under an <hi>Alphabetical</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their <hi>Authours,</hi> as well to avoid the buying of them twice, as to know what are wanting, and satisfie a number of persons that are sometimes curious of reading all the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53837:54"/>
works of certain Authors in particular. Which being thus established, the advantage to be gained is in my opinion extreamly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant; be it in respect to the particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which the <hi>Owner</hi> and <hi>Bibliothecary</hi> may thereby receive, or in regard of the renown to be acquired by their communication with everybody; that we may not be like to those avaritious persons, who take no felicity in their riches; or to that malicious Serpent, who suffered none to approach and gather the fruits of the Garden of <hi>Hesperides</hi>; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering, that there is nothing esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, but as it becomes profitable and useful: and for that, concerning Books in particular, they are like to the Man of whom <hi>Horace</hi> speaks in one of his Epistles,
<q>
                     <l>Odisti claves &amp; grata sigilla pudice</l>
                     <l>Paucis ostendi gemis, &amp; communia laudas.</l>
                  </q>
However, since it were unreasonable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane that indiscreetly which should be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with judgement, we ought to observe; that seeing all Libraries cannot continually be so open as the <hi>Ambrosian</hi>; it were yet at least wise permitted, that whoever had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for it, should have free accesse to the <hi>Bibliothecary,</hi> who should introduce him with the least delay or difficulty; secondly, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53837:55"/>
those which were altogether strangers, and all others that had use onely of some passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, might search and extract out of all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Books, whatever they stood in need of: thirdly, that persons of merit and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge might be indulged to carry some few ordinary Books to their own Lodgings, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless yet with these cautions, that it should not be for above a fortnight or three weeks at most, and that the <hi>Library-keeper</hi> be careful to register in a Book destin'd for this purpose, and divided by Letters Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betically, whatsoever is so lent out to one or other, together with the date of the day, the form of the Volume, and the place and year of its impression; and all this to be subscribed by the Borrower, this to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel'd when the Book is returned, and the day of its reddition put in the margent, thereby to see how long it has been kept; and that such as shall have merited by their diligence and care in conserving of Books, may have others the more readily lent to them. Assuring you, my <hi>Lord,</hi> that if it shall please you to pursue what you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun, and augment your Library to make this use of it, or some other which you shall judge to be better, you shall obtain praises incomparable, infinite acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not vulgar advantages, and in brief, a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53837:55"/>
satisfaction indicible, when by running over this <hi>Catalogue,</hi> you shall consider the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies which you have done, the gallant men you have obliged, the persons which shall have seen you, the new friends and servants which you shall have acquired, and in a word, when you shall have judged by the finger &amp; the eye, how much glory &amp; reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your <hi>Library</hi> shall have produced you; Towards whose progress and augmentation, I protest I would willingly, and whilst I live, contribute all that I could possible; as I have already taken the boldness to render you some testimonies of it by these Instructions, which I hope in time so to polish and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it shall not blush the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to discourse and speak more at large on a subject not hitherto treated of, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the world see, under the Title of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliotheca Memmiana,</hi> what has been so long wished for, An ample and particular History, both of Letters and of Books; the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Censure of Authors, the Names of the best and most necessary in each <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; the Scourge of <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> the Progresse of the <hi>Sciences,</hi> the Diversity of <hi>Sects,</hi> the Revolutions of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Disciplines,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadence of the <hi>Antient,</hi> the several Principles of the <hi>Novators</hi>; and that <hi>Excellent Law</hi> of the <hi>Pyrrhenians</hi> founded upon the ignorance

            <p>TO what purpose I had design'd the <hi>Copy</hi> which you were long since pleas'd to favour me with accepting, I do now publish; and by this acknowledgement express my obligations to you; that though there was nothing of mine in what I transmitted to you beside the pleasure of putting a subject into <hi>English,</hi> which I thought might be acceptable to you; you would yet honour me with Printing at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and where, since it was lost, it is here retriv'd, and by the same hand presented again to you; but not as a thing which can in the least pretend to instruct you, who not onely have presided over one of the most illustrious. <hi>Libraries</hi> in the World; but are also of your self (as <hi>Eunapius</hi> would express the merits of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phist Longinus</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">
