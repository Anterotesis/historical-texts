            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The Phiſicion and the diſeaſe do mutually oppugne one an other and ſtriue for maiſtrie. For the Phiſicions charge and only care is, and ought to be, to recure his Pacient with
<pb facs="tcp:6107:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sickneſſe attaynted. The Sickneſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe employeth his whole deuoire and bendeth all his force to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſpoyle and ruyne of the bodye whereinto he hath made breache and entraunce. Now, is the Patient (all this while) the Subiect and partie in whom this conflict and combate is dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigned: who if for his part, he do wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and politikely reſiſt the ſomonce of his enemie Sickneſſe, directing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his diete and daylie vſage by the Dyal of the Phyſicions learned preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and counſell, and abſteine from thinges hurtfull and inconuenient by practizinge that which is holeſome and expedient, he is ioygned in commiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and made (as it were) felowe in office with the Phyſicion agaynſt all raginge aſſaultes of Sickneſſe. Whereby they twaine being thus firmely confederate and linked together, the diſeaſe and Sickneſſe ſhal be eaſely driuen to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe exigent and glad to diſclaime his intereſt, and great hope is to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the victorie and vpperhand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6107:3"/>
As contrarywiſe, if the Pacient reuolte from the Phyſicion, wilfully refuſe and ſtubbornely diſobey his lore &amp; aduiſe, altogether framinge himſelfe to ſerue the humour and will of his Sickneſſe, litle hope and leſſe helpe is to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of his recouery. For in flyinge to thone, and ſtartinge from thother, hee addeth great increaſe to the diſeaſe and prouoketh it to ſhew the vttermoſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his tyrannicall force and qualitie vppon the bodie that is ſo willinge and readie euen at the firſte onſette and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme to ſurrendre.

               <pb facs="tcp:6107:4"/>
the third and laſt <hi>Cheirurgice.</hi> Beſide theſe thre, is there none, for by whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer names any remedies for Sickneſſe or preſeruatiues for health are called by otherwiſe, they are to bee referred to one of theſe three neceſſarilie. For ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they belonge to diete, either elſe they are too be done by receipt of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable drouges, potions and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or elſe finallye by the miniſterie and artificiall woorkemanshippe of the hand, called (as I ſaide) Chyrurgerie. The beſt and ſureſt of all theſe is Diet, the which oftentimes of it ſelfe alone is hable and ſufficient to cure the diſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and without which, the other twoo cannot well and conuenientlie to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe be practized. Be the Chirurgian neuer ſo ſkilfull, yet vnleſſe the partie paſſioned vſe good reſpect in daylie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ete, his cunninge hand not onely tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to no profitable conſequence and effect at all, but rather many times the partie is thereby brought into further hazard and daunger. Medicines (bee their vertues neuer ſo ſoueraigne and
<pb facs="tcp:6107:4"/>
effectual) are not hable to helpe in ſuch extremities as they be employed vnto, if Diet be not reſpected accordingly, as <hi>Galen</hi> in his booke <hi>De Theriaca</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Pamphilianus</hi> moſt learnedly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth. Thus is Diet the ſafeſt, the ſureſt and the pleaſanteſt way that can be vſed and farre to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other kindes of remedies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the diſeaſe be of ſuch vehemence quality, condition and extremitie that it ſeeme to requyre ſome great ſpeciall conſideration otherwiſe, and in time of ſickneſſe is not onely a ſpecial &amp; harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe recuratiue, but alſo in time of health, the beſt and almoſt the onely preſeruatiue. And for that I ſaw the ſame in this litle Pamphlet, ſo clerkely and compendiouſly decyphered, I haue aduentured to deueſt him of his Latine weede, and after a homely ſorte forced into barbarous Engliſhe, whereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I haue miniſtred large occaſion to the worlde, to thinke in mee ſome ſpice of preſumption and foly, for thus entermedlyng in an Art nothinge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
<pb facs="tcp:6107:5"/>
to my profeſsion, yet do I not miſtruſt but the equanimitie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter ſort, weighyng my goodwill and meanynge in the balance of reaſonable conſideration, will freendly diſpence with my ouerſight that way, &amp; ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſiniſtre doome of all opinionatiue affection. Man is ſubiect to very many diſeaſes. Antiquitie reckened vp in a beadrolle, and regiſtred in ſundry of their Monuments left behinde them for our erudition and furtheraunce, three hundred and odde ſeuerall kindes of Maladies, beſide caſualties. Since when, there hath encreaſed and ſprong vp a freſh ſupply and ſwarme of many ſtrange and new diſeaſes earſt not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen nor heard of, ſeemyng as it were to denounce defiance and continual warre to al the cunnyng that Phiſicions haue. VVhich by good counſel and aduiſe to preuent, or maturely to remooue and take away (as farre as Arte hath his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation) deſerueth in mine opinion to him that beateth his brayne for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers auayle in that behalfe no ſmall
<pb facs="tcp:6107:5"/>
commendation. This cauſed learned <hi>Homere,</hi> after he had taken a perfect ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of man, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared his ſtate with euery other kinde of Creature to geeue verdict and affirme that man among all Creatures was moſt miſerable. <hi>Silenus</hi> iudged it beſt, either not to be borne at all, or els moſt quickly and out of hand to dye and bee ridde out of worldely thraldome. <hi>Plini</hi> helde opinion that ſhortneſſe of life was the greateſt and beſt gift that euer the Goddes gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man. In <hi>Lucian</hi> alſo wee do reade, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> after he had ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times chaunged his ſexe, and ſhape and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (Pylgrymelike) in the bodies of all men, women, and fourefooted beaſtes of euery degree and callyng, playnely confeſſed that hee liued a great deale more pleaſantly, when he was a Frogge then when he was a King. And al theſe, although abſurd in report, yet in ſenſe iarred not far from a truth, if that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Philoſopher had not otherwiſe aſſured our weake conſciences of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtyng felicitie after this life, layde
<pb facs="tcp:6107:6"/>
vp in the ſtorehouſe of his mercy for ſo many as vnfeynedly repoſe all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance, truſt and ankreholde in him and do frame their liues and conuerſacion by the ſquyre and leuell of his ſacred woorde. Chriſtian it is therefore and natural alſo, euery one accordyng to his talent to helpe an other. And if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian examples were ſcantie and hard to finde (wherof there be almoſt infinite) yet let vs conſider and call to memorie the maner and rite that was among the olde <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Aſsyrians,</hi> amonge whom, if any happened to fall ſicke, he was ſtreightways layde abroade in the high way, that euery man paſsinge by and beholdyng the maner of his ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, might tell, if he or any other of his acquayntaunce had euer beene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſed with the like, and if he or they had ſo beene attached, what Medicine or thyng it was that had cured and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, that the ſame remedie might likewiſe be applied to the pacient ther languiſshing. By whiche meanes and way, it is thought, yea conſtantly aduou

deuided into two partes, that is to witte, <hi>Conſeruation,</hi> and <hi>Preſeruation.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, when the bodie is of it ſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly ſounde (as ſeldome is to bée ſéene) but Preſeruation is, when the bodie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to bée enfeebled and like to fall into ſome infirmitie. And theſe two Indications and common medicines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne to vs in this preſent worke to bée diſcuſſed. For ſithens Conſeruation and Preſeruation belonge either to the <hi>Gymnaſticer</hi> or els to the Phiſition, and <hi>Gymnaſticke</hi> Arte, which is the trade of exerciſing men in feates of Actiuitie, is in theſe our daies antiquate and growen out of vſe, therefore they do onely apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the Phiſicion, as <hi>Galene,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one little ſeuerall boke of this ſame Argument, but alſo in others of his workes plainly affirmeth. The other Indications gathered of the nature of the diſeaſe and the cauſes therof, and the bodie diſtempered and diſcaſed (which are thinges againſt Nature, whoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and common Indication is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Ablation) belong to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicion,
<pb facs="tcp:6107:8"/>
whoſe office is to cure diſeaſes. But the Indications of the Neutrall or meane eſtate betwene health and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the cauſes of thinges not naturall, do ſhew, ſo that ſomtime Conſeruation and ſomtime Ablation therein muſt be vſed. And the cauſes not naturall are theſe: Ayre, meate and drinke, moouinge and reſte, Emptineſſe and Repletion, Sleape and watch and the affections of the minde: wherunto are added the Age, Temperature, Cuſtome, Arte, and the proper nature of euerie ſeuerall perſon. And they be called meane, becauſe they do ſomtimes the office of Conſeruation and ſomtimes of Ablation. Ablation when (for example) the Ayre is hurtfull to ſickneſſe: For it is either altered with contraries: or elſe cleane chaunged: if it be holeſome and profitable, we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it with his like, and thus do we in conſeruing them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be whole. Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications are called commune, becauſe aſwell the Conſeruer or the Preſeruer of health, as alſo the Curer of diſeaſes vſeth them. I therefore meaning to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
<pb facs="tcp:6107:9"/>
vppon theſe two poinctes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and Preſeruation, will follow <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his order in the diſcourſe of thoſe fiue thinges, which are alſo auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by <hi>Galene,</hi> in diuerſe of his workes and namely in his ſecond boke, <hi>De Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Sanit.</hi> And theſe be they: Laboure or excerciſe, Meate, Drinke, Sleepe, and the acte of carnall copulation. Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge orderly, conueniently, and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently vſed, haue great power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie to kepe a man in health, and in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chiefely (as theſe two Graunde Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Auncient fathers of Phiſicks doe affirme) conſiſteth the whole poyſe and cauſe of healthineſſe. Vnto theſe fiue, (through God his aſſiſtaunce) I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to annexe a Surpluſage and addici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other thinges not naturall and ſuche as ſeeme néedefulll and expedient hereunto.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore begin with the firſt whiche is Exerciſe, with humble praier to Almightie God, to further our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes, for his deare ſonnes ſake Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord and Sauiour. But
<pb facs="tcp:6107:9"/>
this by the way muſt we admoniſh the Readers, that for aſmuch as the natures and complexions of men be diuers, they alſo require a diuerſe trade and order in diete and exerciſe. And therefore ſayth <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Galene,</hi> euen as a ſhoomaker cannot make one ſhooe to ſerue euery mannes foote, ſo neither can a Phiſicion deſcribe and appoint any one generall order and dietarie for all maner of perſons.

Now, whereas there is both diuerſitie in bodies, and alſo diuerſe trades of liuinge, it cannot be that any one abſolute way ſhould be appoincted to ſerue euerie nature in euerie facultie generally.

For their ſakes therefore that liue of them ſelues freely and are not enthralled or mancipated to the inconueniences aboueſaide, we haue compiled this treatiſe, how and in what ſorte they may liue a long life in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous health and welfare. Furthermore that which in euerie kinde is ſimple and faultleſſe ought alwaies to be preferred before all others. And in bodies that ſame is called ſimple and faulteleſſe, which is in a very good plight &amp; likinge: but in the trade of life, that is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted beſt, which is free and not in ſubiection. For it behooueth that ſuch a one as would liue longe and neuer be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached with any Sicknes, ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt and frée from all turmoiling trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and publique affaires in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, liuinge onely to himſelfe, cheriſhinge his body and tendringe his health.

that immortall, which naturally was begotten &amp; created mortall, but to make the ſame to be of longe life and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, may be done and brought to paſſe. <hi>Galene</hi> ſaieth, that if he which hath his bodye in good likinge and temperature doe not intermeddle with the laborious cares of worldly buſines, but geeue him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe onely to quietneſſe and tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of his owne health ſhall not at all (as farre as is poſſible) be arreſted and vexed with any maladie, neither be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented with death vntill he haue liued a merueilous long age.

               <p>And by this meanes ſhalt thou ſo doo, if thou géeue diligent eare to the ſounde counſayles of approoued Phiſicions, by mée in this litle Booke breefely noted, the chiefeſt whereof is Exerciſe.

But becauſe not euery kinde of Exerciſe, nor euery time and hower is conuenient and méete for it, therefore will I declare bothe the time when it ſhould be vſed, and alſo the particuler kindes thereof.</p>
               <p>Then is it a fit time (ſaieth <hi>Auicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na)</hi> to exerciſe the bodie when there be no

<pb facs="tcp:6107:14"/>
is not to bee miſliked but is thought to be very holeſome and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Therefore when the meate is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed downe from the Stomake and the time approcheth eftſoones to eate, then is exerciſe both fit and profitable. In So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, about the Sunne riſinge, leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the bodie ſhoulde be annoyed with a double heate: and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the Sprynge, and Autumne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute twoo howers after the Sunne ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that the coldeneſſe of the mornynge may be auoyded. For as the heate of the noone time of the day is hurtful and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſo is the colde of the mornyng, and namely in Autumne, and winter to be eſchewed. Notwithſtandynge a man may exerciſe himſelfe at home aſſone as he ariſeth. In winter <hi>Auicen</hi> counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to exerciſe our ſelues within the houſe, or in ſome cloſe couert place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout noone, hauyng the ayre a litle war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for feare leaſt colde els ſhould take away or hinder that commoditie that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe bryngeth: For nothynge is more hurtful to the vertue Regitiue then cold,
<pb facs="tcp:6107:15"/>
namely if it be much, and at ſuche time as the body is hoat. Now wheras there be ſundrie ſortes of exerciſe, I will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recite here ſuche as I know to be beſt and moſt agreable for them, vnto whom I namely haue penned and written this compendie.</p>
               <p>And firſt to beginne with walkynge: which if it be ſoft, and not faſt, nor apace <note place="margin">Walking</note> is a weake exerciſe and may beſt be vſed in hoate moonthes, &amp; in the beginnyng of Autumne, for at thoſe times heate and drineſſe cheifly reigneth. And therefore the body ought not to be more inflamed and dried by ſtronge motion and exerciſe eſpecially in a Cholerique man. For truely there is no time in all the yéere, wherein the body ought leſſe to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed then in Sommer, and therefore in hoat Regions and Climates, a ſofte and gentle motion is a greate deale better, and more requiſite then ſtrong motion, becauſe nothyng doth ſo muche incende and enflame naturall heate, as laboure and moouing. Often and longe walking vſed without intermiſſion, is a ſtronge
<pb facs="tcp:6107:15"/>
exerciſe and meeter too be vſed in the Springe ſeaſon, becauſe exerciſe in the Springe time by good reaſon ought to be greater and ſtronger then in So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer. And therfore ſomwhat long deambulaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t withal, not weariſome, nor exceſſiue, is in my oppinion very méete and apt for this ſeaſon of the yéere. I meane, it muſt be ſomwhat longe, to thend it may with more facilitie reſolue ſuche ſuperfluities as aboute that time were gathered and congeled together duringe the winter precedinge: and I would haue it to be ſomwhat gentle and pleaſant, leaſt the bodies ſhould be ſet in a chafing heate with too much Agitacion and ſtirring, eſpeciallie of them that are of a hoate complexion. For this kinde of ſofte and longe continuinge exerciſe is moſt agreeable &amp; commodious to hoate and moyſt bodies. A ſtrong and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t walking, eſpeciallie vp and downe highe and vnequall places, as manytimes to goe vp and downe a ladder, or a ſtiepe hill, till a man pant and fetche his breath thicke and often with difficultie, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:6107:16"/>
good and comendable exerciſe, &amp; beſt to be frequented in cold &amp; moyſt ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
               <p>There is an other kinde of exerciſe, whereof <hi>Galene</hi> wrate, but not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note place="margin">Teniſe and ball play</note> for ſuch as be graue perſonages and men muche buſied with waightie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or for ſuch as haue not their heads in good temperature, which is called the Teniſe. In which kinde of paſtime, all members and partes of the body are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallie mooued, but it is hurtefull to the head by reaſon of often ſtowpinge: and therfore I counſell all them that delight to playe thereat, to ſtand holdinge theire heades vpright, whiche may be eaſely done, by ſtriking and receauing the balle with a raquet.</p>
               <p>There is an other kinde of pleaſaunt exerciſe fitteſt to be vſed in the countrey in ſeaſonable and tempeſtiuious times of the yeare, called Riding. It is highlie <note place="margin">Riding.</note> to be commended and is good for the head ſtomacke and intrayles, wherby men in the olde time got both health &amp; pleaſure.</p>
               <p>That exerciſe whiche <hi>Auicen</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to draw and bring down humours
<pb facs="tcp:6107:16"/>
from the head to the lower partes of the body is very profitable and to be done in this ſorte folowyng: Tie and make faſt <note place="margin">Hanging by the handes</note> a ſtronge roape to ſome Beame or poſt, and through the ſame roape put a good bigge wodden Cudgell ouerthwart, and takyng holde with your handes at bothe endes of the Cudgell, lift vp and poyſe your body ſo, that your feete touche not the grounde, and mooue your legges to and fro, hangyng ſtill by your handes.</p>
               <p>But the bodie muſt be very well pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, leſt when the ſuperfluous humours be drawen downe to the lower partes, there be engendred an Abſceſſe, which is ſome impoſtume or courſe of euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to ſome one parte of the body.</p>
               <p>As for wreſtling and daunſing, which be accompted amonge vehement exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (becauſe they be nothyng agréeable and ſitting for a ſage Magiſtrate nor for a ſerious Student) I haue nothynge to ſay: but this by the way I may not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that thoſe perſons which féede vpon groſſe meates, and ſuche repaſt as brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſtronge nouriſhment, may vſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementer
<pb facs="tcp:6107:17"/>
exerciſe and ſtronger ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as running, wraſtling, hunting, quoytes, handeball, and to be breife all ſuche exerciſe as beſt agréeth with theyr nature, which may brynge difficultie in fetchyng the breath, augment heate and humecte the ſkynne and exteriour parte of the body, with a thin ſubtile ſweate.</p>
               <p>For quicke and nimble exerciſe maketh the body leane and ſlendre, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie maketh it groſſe and thicke: much exerciſe drieth the bodie, but meane and conuenable maketh it fat and corpulent. Notwithſtandyng, for them that vſe a ſlender diet and ſpare féedyng, a ſhorter ambulacion and ſmaller walkynge will ſuffice. Now, there be ſome whiche be of a very hoat temperature &amp; complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ought not at all to be exerciſed: for ſuch perſons, a moderate walkyng, bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng or a gentle Fricaſie and rubbynge <note place="margin">Fricaſie</note> ſhalbe fully ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Al ſuch are ſlender, leane and very Cholerique. And this is euermore to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> a man muſt vſe ſuch moderation in his exerciſe, that be get not a laſſitude or wearineſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
<pb facs="tcp:6107:17"/>
but aſſoone as he perceaueth the ſame to come vpon him, it were beſt for him to deſiſt and leaue of. For the bodie with all his partes ought ſo to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that excremental matter by idleneſſe and reſt, be not gathered. But when you beginne to ſweate, and the exerciſe ſéemeth not to be ſo pleaſant as it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ceaſſe and leaue of, wypyng away the ſweate from your bodie: then again after that you haue a litle pauſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted your ſelfe, the body muſt be refreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For in exerciſe aſwell as in meate and drinke and all other thinges, there ought to be a conuenient meaſure vſed, ſo that the thyng it ſelf be neither ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with to much, nor yet debarred from that ſtinte and ſufficiencie that is néedefull and requiſite, becauſe by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, the powers are enfeebled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, and by want or defect, there is ſo muche of the vtilitie abated, as there lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of due ſufficiencie. For our powers are muche ſtrengthened and chéered, if with moderate and fit exerciſe they be refreſhed and cheriſhed. Now let vs
<pb facs="tcp:6107:18"/>
bréeifly declare the kindes of ſmall and gentle exerciſes, whiche (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng) to the health of the body are néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and expedient. The firſt ſorte wée haue heretofore declared, that is to ſay a ſwéete and ſofte walkynge.</p>
               <p>Then there are Fricaſies or Rubinges, whiche are the exerciſes of them that be ſickly. For vnto them that be in perfit health, they are not ſufficient, as <hi>Plato</hi> moſt elegantly, and after him <hi>Galen</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth. But we adiudge and thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be very good both to mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>defie the head and diuert the fumes therof to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and extreame partes, and alſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the pores and conduites of the bodie therby to extenuate and expell ſubtill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. In olde time, men vſed fricaſie and vnction before and after euerie kind of exerciſe: before, to the end that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and pores of the bodie beinge ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by fricaſie, the humours might haue more eaſie egreſſe: and after, beecauſe the matter, which did exude &amp; come out, might be wiped away from the ſkin, and that which remained in the fleſhe, might
<pb facs="tcp:6107:18"/>
be extenued and diſſolued, which order in my oppinion is not to be miſliked. And therfore my counſaile is, that before thou ariſe out of thy bed, either to rubbe or els to make ſome bodie els to rubbe, with warme hands or ſom warme linnen clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, thy backe, breaſt and bealy eaſely &amp; ſoftlie, and thy armes and legges hardlie and ſtronglie, but ſuche partes as thou canſt reache and come vnto, vſe to rubbe thy ſelfe. For this fricaſie and rubbinge concocteth crude humours, and alſo nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth and comforteth the whole bodie. And if thou chaunce to ſweate, cauſe it with a ſoft rubbing and fricaſie to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith that hard frica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie doth binde and conſolidate the bodie, ſofte doth looſe and mollifie, muche doth extenuate and diminiſhe fleſhe, meane augmenteth and maketh it wax bourlie. It is good alſo when you gee to bedde if your head be heauie or payned with the murre or reume, to rubbe and wringe hard your legges and handes, for by ſuch meanes the vapours that aſcend vpward are deriued and brought downeward.
<pb facs="tcp:6107:19"/>
Alſo fricaſie and rubbing the whole body in the eueninge, is profitable for them that be throughly wearie, or with driues to much moleſted, or with the <hi>Atrophie</hi> &amp; conſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pined and troubled: which being done, there ſhould enſue an oynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or perfuſion of temperate oyle (if the auncient and laudable cuſtome of vnction were not antiquated and growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of vſe as many other good thinges are) for it helpeth to the ſpéedines and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locitie of frication, it looſeth and ſuppleth the members that be ſtiffe and indurate and it comforteth and mollifieth the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that are wearied.</p>
               <p>To be rowed vppon the water in a <note place="margin">Rowing.</note> wherrie or barge is an exerciſe gentleſt and eaſieſt of all other. Now ouer and beſide the fricaſies aforeſaide, let vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerlie recite thoſe motions that do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe not all, but certaine partes of the <note place="margin">Exerciſe for diuers partes of the bodie</note> bodie. To ſhoote in a longe Bowe, to pitche or throwe great Stones or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heauie thinges ſittinge or ſtandinge is the exerciſe of the armes and other partes next vnto them, albeit the whole
<pb facs="tcp:6107:19"/>
bodie may ſeeme to be therin exerciſed, In readinge, to ſpeake at the firſt with a ſofte voice, and afterward to ſpeeke low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lowder is the exerciſe of the Tongue, Breaſt, Throate and Lunges yea it is good for the ventricle or Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke alſo. But the exerciſe of the heade muſt verie carefullie be looked vnto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">How the head muſt be vſed.</note> amonge al the partes of the bodie the braine is the coldeſt, and therfore his naturall heate muſt with all diligent heede bée conſerued and kept, that it bee not diſtempered nor oppreſſed with the multitude and abundance of ſuperfluous humours. Therfore euerie daye when thou ariſeſt, after that thou haſt beene at the ſtoole, rubbe thy head with a cleane drie linnen cloath ſomwhat warme, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foreparte of thy head backewarde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the hinderparte, and at the firſt, let thy fricaſie be ſmall and eaſie, but afterward harder and faſter. Then kembe it with a cleane combe, beginnynge at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and vpper part of the head bringing the Combe backeward, and then againe mundify and make it cleane with linnen
<pb facs="tcp:6107:20"/>
clothes as is aforeſayd. And if the ſame clothes be a litle perfumed with poudre of <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> or Gelouers and drie Roſes, their vertue is a greate deale the more to helpe the brayne and comforte the ſences. Certes thou ſhalt féele a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous effect for the healthineſſe of thy head if thou vſe this ordre of fricaſie and combyng. For therby naturall heate is excited and ſtirred vp, the pores are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, (which beyng ſtopped, ſuperfluous matter and humours are retayned and conſequently the brayne payned and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected) but beyng opened, the ſame il hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and fumes are propulſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and the brayne is made ſincere, ſtronge and healthfull. There is an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſetled in the heades of many now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies and eſpeciallie amonge the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſorte, that it is not good for the head to be waſſhed, alledgynge for their proofe an olde ſayinge, common almoſt in euery mans mouthe, neuertheleſſe for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moſte parte vntrue, which is this: <hi>Waſh thy hands often, thy feete ſeldome, but thy</hi>

And for this cauſe <hi>Auicen</hi> affyrmeth that it is not good to ſuffre the heare of the bead and beard to grow longe, becauſe they gather and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne muche groſſe filthe and baggage, ſtoppyng the pores about the rootes, if they be not waſſhed away. To theſe namely, and to all others generally that vſe waſſhynge, <hi>Auenzoar</hi> géeueth in charge to be waſſhed with warme wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Lie, and if you put into the ſame water or Lie, ſo it be not to ſtronge, a ſmall handfull of drie Roſes, and <hi>Lignu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Aloes,</hi> and a litle Camomile or Betony for ſuch as he ſomwhat of a colde nature

But as in all other thinges moderate vſe
<pb facs="tcp:6107:22"/>
is alwaies to be preferred before immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, euen ſo fareth it by bayning. For a man may not be ouer haſtie in aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turinge to vſe it, eſpeciallie if the partie that is minded to be bained, be troubled with many humours gathered throughe continuall cruditie and vndigeſtion, or haue not longe afore enfarced himſelfe with plentie of meate vnboyled and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted in the ſtomake, whiche crude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours being within the bodie (by reaſon of the vehement force of heate) cauſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.

And vnleſſe the age and place of man ſéeme otherwiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,

they are at this time a great deale more to be eſchewed. In déede no man doubteth but baines vſed at due and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable times, help the bodie verie much (for nothinge doth ſo well concocte and driue away il humours &amp; corrupt iuyce as ſleepe after bayning) but I ſay that the vſe therof is very hurtfull, if they be vſed at inconuenient times and when they ought chieflie to be refrained. Now as concerninge waſhing in colde water, I do ſay that it is vtterly to be forborne of all ſuch as are not therto accuſtomed, as being more hurtfull then profitable, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe vrgent occaſion of great heate and luſtie youth do otherwiſe ſeeme to craue it.

But when he is come to his full growthe, then may he acquainte himſelf with colde bathes, becauſe the bodie is therby cooled and ſtrengthened, and the ſkinne made harder and thicker. And the fitteſt time thereto is the beginninge of Sommer, that ere winter come, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent cuſtome, it may not turne to any hurtfull diſtemperaunce of the bodie, and let it beginne in a verye hoate daye the place where it is vſed beinge likewiſe hoate.</p>

ſtipticke and harde: agayne that whiche is more eaſely concocted before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is of ſlow digeſtion: as potched Egges before fleſhe and ſuche like. Likewiſe ſuche as are of theyr owne nature ſoone corrupted, as Mylke and moyſt fruites, as wee ſhall hereafter more largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. For when meate of eaſie digeſtion is eaten after that whiche is ſlowly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, it is holden backe, and ſtopped by the meate of ſlow digeſtion before taken that it cannot paſſe into the entrayles, &amp; therfore the meate of eaſie digeſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng perfitly concocted remayneth and is forcibly kept in the ſtomacke longer then it ought to be, whereby it is made very apt to corruption, whiche to health is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurtfull and a great hindrance. But there be ſome meates betwéene whem there is but ſmall difference of digeſtion, as between a henne and a ſucking Calfe, a Chicken and a Kidde, the fleſh of a big olde Calfe and a younge Bullocke, or Steere, in ſuch reſpectes as theſe where the difference is ſo ſmall, it ſkilleth not greatly, if they whiche be ſomwhat hard

For heauie meates and ſuch as be of ſlow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, require a ſtronger and greater power digeſtiue. And all men (without exception) doo confeſſe and know that the lower part of the Stomacke or Maw in the act of concoction is ſtronger then the vpper and middle parte is. Therefore meates of eaſie digeſtion ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before thoſe, which doo differ ſo farre from them in eaſineſſe of concoction as the power of the loweſt parte of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle differeth from the firſt and middle: which difference ought to be referred to the diſcretion and iudgement of the ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Phiſicion. Thus may the fleſh of a Bullocke be eaten before the fleſh of a bigge calfe, and the fleſh of a ſuckinge kid or yonge tender calfe after veale of a calf of bigger growthe: thus alſo may yonge Pigeons, Hennes, and Capons be well eaten before Partriches and Chickens. Neither néedeth a man to feare leaſt thei

               <p>That wine is beſt, whiche is neither to olde nor to new, but meane betwéen bothe, well fined and cleare, reddiſh or of a citron couler, pleaſant in taſt and of a ſwéete ſmell, of ſuche reliſh (I ſay) as in taſt ſéemeth neither to be very tarte and ſharpe, nor yet very doulcet &amp; ſwéet.

age or the age of conſiſtencie, and for hoate complexions and namelye in Sommer for many cauſes, but chieflie becauſe it cauſeth no headache but rather driueth it and taketh it awaye if it come throughe heate of the ſtomacke. Néere vnto it in goodnes is an other wine which in the olde time was named <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutum,</hi> and in Italie (ſpeciallie in <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardie)</hi> it is commonlye termed by the <note place="margin">Ablutum or the wine of Auicen.</note> name of <hi>Auicen</hi> his wine.

For beyng drunken at any ſuche times, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye bryngeth many inconueniences and diſeaſes procéedyng of Fleame, and namely the Apoplexie in ſuche caſe is much to be feared. After meales alſo to

Alſo to drinke after ſuch meat as encreaſeth ill humour (of which ſort are Muſheromes) <hi>Auicen</hi> vtterlie forbiddeth: ſemblably after ſuch fruictes,
<pb facs="tcp:6107:32"/>
as Melons, Pompons, yealow Quinces and ſuche like. For wyne being dronke after ſuche fruictes, enforceth them to perce to the veines, whereby their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt iuyce is mixed with the bloude, and ſo is cauſe of the corruption thereof. But men now a dayes do cleane contrarie, for they loue to drinke with theſe and ſuche like fruictes the beſt wine they can gette as a remedie (for ſo they ſay) of fruictes, yea and ſometimes they haue the phiſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelues compaignions with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But if thou wouldeſt kéepe thy ſtomack from the harme that proceedeth by the coldnes and moyſtnes of theſe fruictes, it were a great deale better to vſe to take Aniſeede, or Cinnamome, or ginger, or Honie and ſuche like.</p>
               <p>Héere as it were in the way of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion to the declaration of Wyne, I wil ſpeake a woord or twaine more, to teache you to know whether your Wine bée pure, or els mingled. It is ſometimes ſéene (as now in many thinges there is muche legierdemayne and deceite vſed) that Wyne is mingled with Hony, to <note place="margin">How to know whe</note>

make it ſwéete and pleaſant. If it be <note place="margin">ther wyne be made ſweet with Hony.</note> thus abuſed and mixed, it may be eaſely knowen by this meanes. Take a few droppes of it, and powre them vpon a hoate plate yron, and the Wyne if it be pure being reſolued, becauſe it is thinner and ſubtiler, the Hony wil remayne and thicken, becauſe it is of a groſer and thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſubſtance. If you ſuſpect, that your Wine be mingled with water, you may eaſely know whether it be ſo or no by <note place="margin">How to know whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther wine be mingled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> putting a Peare into it: for if the Peare ſwim a lofte and deſcende not to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, then is the wine pure &amp; vnming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but if it ſinke to the bottome, it is an infallible token that it is mingled with water. Many ſuche pretie concluſions might here be ſhewed, but theſe for this matter are ſufficient.

AFter Breade and Wyne (two of the cheefeſt mainteiners of mans <note place="margin">Fleſh.</note> life) fleaſhe is next in order to be ſpoken of. For <hi>Auicen</hi> ſayeth, that fleaſh is a meate comfortynge the body and of néere tranſubſtantiation and conuerſion into bloud, ſpecially the fleaſh of thoſe beaſtes and fowles that be of the beſt nouriſhyng ſort. And the wiſe Sages of our profeſſion, commend as moſte profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the conſeruacion of healthe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge foure footed Beaſtes, the Fleſhe of younge Kiddes and ſuckyng Calues, whiche be ſo muche the better if they be nouriſhed with wholeſome milke and in good paſtures. For this is to be noted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of al Beaſtes which be of ſound complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and qualitie, the youngeſt are moſt wholeſome, as Kiddes, Calues and ſuch like: but of them that be moyſt, the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt are moſt harmefull. And therefore <hi>Auicen</hi> ſayth, that Lambes ſhould be a yeere olde before they be eaten. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng in this poinct the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and temperature of the Countrey muſt be reſpected, where vpon <hi>Auicen</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6107:33"/>
ſayde that in the Eaſt and South partes of the world, Lambe and Mutten nught without daunger be eaten, whiche in our moyſt Countrey, and in moyſt bodies is not alway expedient. Seldome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and warelie muſt Lambe be eaten, <note place="margin">Lambes fleſh.</note> and rather in the ſommer and Autumne then at any other time of the yeere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe drineſſe then beareth ſway. And if wée eate therof in the Winter or in the beginning of the Springe, it were much better roſted then boyled. Younge Béeif bred vp in wholeſome paſture and well exerciſed and chaſed, is in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Beeife.</note> and Spryng not to be miſliked, for then Ventres be moſte hoate of nature, and ſleape very longe as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affyrmeth, and therefore they may the better digeſt heauie meates: but in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Autumne, meates of light di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion muſt be vſed, becauſe the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and naturall heate is then weaker by reaſon of the heate of the Ayre. As for groſſe meates that are drie and harde as cowes Beeif and ſuche like I vtterly diſalow: becauſe beſide many other <note place="margin">Cowes fleſh</note>

harmes that it bringeth by reaſon of the hardneſſe of it, and difficultie to be digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, this namely is one, that it inferreth harme to the reaſonable parte of man whiche is the minde. Porke or Hogges fleſh nouriſheth very much, and is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and toothſome in taſte, but if they be very younge, there fleaſh is too moyſte and heauie of digeſtion, and therefore we muſt leaue it to ploughmen and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of ſtronger Stomackes. But being of middle age, as from ſixe monthes to a yéere olde (if they be not to fatte) theyr fleaſh is reſtoratiue to them that neede meates of ſuch operation &amp; haue ſtronge Stomackes: for no kinde of fleſh (ſaieth <hi>Galen)</hi> more nouriſheth the body then it doth. The fleſh of wild hogges are much commended, for by reaſon of their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and drye feedinge they are not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie moyſte but in a manner temperate. The fleſhe of an Hare is not good to bee eaten often, but it is beſt about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge <note place="margin">Hare.</note> of the ſpringe or winter becauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> drineſſe of it, for it maketh groſſe bloud and melancholique humoure. But the

braine is good for them that haue verie moiſte braines and tender ſofte bodies.</p>
               <p>Of fethered fowles there be manye ſortes: wherof Hennes and Capons are holeſomeſt in winter and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of the ſpringe, and Chickens in Sommer, and Autumne becauſe they encreaſe good bloude and humours, and qualefie thoſe that are ill.

more then the domeſticall dooues do, are lighter of digeſtion. <hi>Auicen</hi> thinketh them beſt to be eaten in Sommer (I thinke for their moyſtnes) for els if they be eaten at any other ſeaſon be apointeth the iuyce of a lower grape called <hi>Agreſla &amp; Coriandre</hi> to be eaten withall, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue and take awaye the heate that is in them.

but it is heauie to digeſt. Therfore it is better for Labouringe men and ſtronge ſtomackes then for quaſie and weake bodies. The winges of fowles do nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe commendablie, becauſe they be wel <note place="margin">Winges</note> exerciſed and eaſier to digeſt, retaynyng very few ſuperfluities by reaſon of their frequent motion. The fleaſh that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bones is ſwéeter and better to digeſt then other: ſo is alſo the Fleaſh <note place="margin">Fleshe neere the bone.</note> of the right ſide. Looſe and ſpoongie fleſh as the Vdders and the rootes of tongues is toothſome in taſte, but ſlow of digeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but béeynge concocted, ſometime they make phelgmatike nouriſhment, yet commonlie none but good.

Alſo fleſh that is fat is eaſely conuerted into Choler mixed with phelgme, and ill vapours.

<pb facs="tcp:6107:36"/>
that beſt agréeth to euerie mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Alſo euery kinde of fleſhe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended or diſcommended accordinge as <note place="margin">Kindes of fleshe.</note> it is in qualitie: for the more that the fleſhe of Beaſtes doth degenerate from whytenes, the leſſe good iuyee is therein it. And by all mens confeſſion this is true, that of thoſe beaſtes which be of one kinde, ſo longe as they be young and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the make moyſte nouriſhement: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge in their middle or conſiſtent age, their nouriſhement is hoater and dryer. But when they be olde, their fleſhe is worſt of all, becauſe it encreaſeth melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholique and excrementall humour, yea and the bigger bodied the worſe.</p>
               <p>Wylde beaſtes and they that liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade in the fieldes, are hoater and drier then homiſhe and domeſticall. All which (notwithſtandinge) beynge vſed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at conuenient times and in due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that is to ſay accordinge as the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their temperature requireth, are thought nothinge at all to imbecile and hinder health. Salte meates meates (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe <note place="margin">Salt meats</note> they were moyſte before) do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="tcp:6107:37"/>
a vehement power to drye and heate and geeue ill nouriſhement: and to be ſhorte, all maner of ſalte meate gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally engendreth putrefiynge and rotten menlancholique bloude, and greatlie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth the lieuer. Therefore it muſt be ſeldome eaten and in moyſt times of the yere, to witte in winter. Furthermore this ſayinge of <hi>Auicen</hi> may not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted, that the fleſhe of any blacke couloured beaſt and alſo of the male, is pleſaunter and lighter then of others.</p>
               <p>And I haue thought good here alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the opinion of the expert man <hi>Auen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zoar,</hi> who writeth that it is beſt to eate fleſhe immediately or not longe after it is killed. And if they be ſomewhat barde (as the fleſhe of wylde duckes and olde Turtles is) he thinketh it beſt, to haue them boyled in water within twelue howers after thei be killed, and in Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer within ſeuen, of the whiche opinion <hi>Galen</hi> is alſo, which is in déede not to be <note place="margin">Gal. de atten. vic. ratione</note> miſliked, but both to be praiſed and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. For the ayre doth alter them, wher by they are made apte to putrefaction,
<pb facs="tcp:6107:37"/>
when they remaine longe after their kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, eſpeciallie in a hoate &amp; moiſt ayre. And this is verified &amp; plainly to be ſeene in fiſhes, which (doubtles) are much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if they be dreſſed and eaten immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atelie after they be taken out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and I am not ignorant that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their watriſh moyſtnes they wyll quicklie putrefie. And fleſhe is better hoate then colde, ſpeciallie in winter and Autumne: except kiddes fleſhe whiche <hi>Auicen</hi> ſuppoſeth to be better and hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer <note place="margin">Whether hoate or cold fleshe be better</note> when it is colde, becauſe it then yeldeth no vapoure, but Lambe (he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) is better when it is hoat. If the fleſh be ſomewhat fatte, tender and verye moyſt, it is beſt to roſte it and ſpeciallie in winter and the Springe, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is beſt to boyle it, namely in So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Autumne, becauſe thereby they are of lighter concoction and kéepe away ſiccitie or dryneſſe which at thoſe times chieflie reigneth in mans body.

               <p>Now wée ſpeake ſomwhat of other ſortes of nouriſhment, amonge whom <note place="margin">Egges</note> wée do affirme the Egges of a Henne, Partriche and Pheſant to excell any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> commendeth them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing halfe roſted that is to ſay meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene rere and hard, ſo that they may be ſupped, becauſe they be then eaſely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and increaſe good bloud. <hi>Auicen</hi> reckeneth them amonge ſoueraigne and cordiall meates, affirmyng the yolke to be of a laudable temperature: albeit he ſayth in his ſecond Canon, that the yolke inclineth to heate, and the white to colde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but the whole to be temperate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serapio</hi> thinketh it to be more colde then hoate and not without good reaſon: for the whight of the egge is more colde then the yolke is hoate, becauſe the yolke is
<pb facs="tcp:6107:38"/>
thought to be temperate or very néere to temperatenes. Egges wooulde be eaten before other meates becauſe they are quicklie digeſted and ſoone deſcend from the mouth of the Stomacke, and nouriſh very quickly. For they haue all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties that belongeth to good nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; are ſoone tranſmuted into bloud, and leaue ſmall ſuperfluities: finallye they make ſubtile and cleare bloud wher by the principall member is nouriſhed.</p>
               <p>For it goeth to the very hart, and for the diſſolution of the ſubſtance of the ſpirite and cordiall matter it is a preſent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Beyng harde roſted, they be of ill<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nouriſhment, <note place="margin">Harde Egges.</note> heauie to digeſt, cauſinge ſtinking fumes in the ſtomacke, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng the lower part of the belly ſtiptick, but poched, they do aſſwage and lenifie it. Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> hath theſe wordes aboute the beginninge of his booke <hi>De Euchym. &amp; Cacochym.</hi> Cockels (ſaith he) are accompted to be of a groſſe iuice, and ſo are Egges, whiche are either ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or roſted harde. If they be fried, they make il iuice and cauſe fumes in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
<pb facs="tcp:6107:39"/>
ere they be decocted, and do alſo corrupt other meates with whom they be mingled. But beynge meaſurably ſodden and vſed, that is to wit ſomwhat rere, they are apt to digeſt, nouriſh, and encreaſe good bloud: ſo alſo are poched Egges good to aſſwage ſoreneſſe &amp; rough neſſe of the throate. In milke and egges there is great abundance of fat and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie moiſture, the one appropriate to ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and nouriture, the other to Sperm or ſéede of generation. The Egges or Spaune of fiſhes are nothyng ſo calefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and nutritiue: for ſo far as the fleſh of Birdes is better then fiſhe, ſo muche are the egges: of fiſhes inferiour in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the egges of birdes <hi>Auicen</hi> allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the eatinge of Mylke in rype and <note place="margin">Mylke</note> conſiſtent age better then in adoleſcencie and therefore he thinketh it good for col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerique perſons, but ill for them that are phlegmaticke. Albeit he alſo ſayeth that it is not good for th'entrayles, nor for the ſtomacke, and alſo cauſeth dimneſſe of ſight, hurteth the teeth, annoyeth the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, engendreth obſtructions in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>Wherefore that all theſe diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be eſchued, he woulde that it ſhould be dronke alone, and after it is dronke to reſt from labour, and then to ſleepe and to eate nothynge vntill it he deſcended from the ſtomacke. But cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he warneth that in no wiſe vineigre, or ſower meates be eaten after it. Yet do I counſell them that eate it, for feare leaſt it ſhould congele in their ſtomacks to put a litle ſuger or Salt, or pure hony vnto it, and to ſtirre it all together.</p>
               <p>Salt ſeaſoneth and taketh away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes that come by Mylke and all other kindes of victualles, ſo dothe Hony alſo make Milke muche the better. Now the commodities y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> come by eating of Milke <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modities of mylke.</note> are the moderate deiection and purging of thinges in the bealy ſuperfluous, good nouriſhment and making of wholeſome tuyce. The paſtures wherin the beaſtes <note place="margin">What milke is beſt.</note> feede, whoſe Milke wée vſe, is of greate force and validitie to this purpoſe. And whereas there be many ſortes of Milke
<pb facs="tcp:6107:40"/>
of all others, womans Milke is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenteſt, becauſe it is very good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall <note place="margin">Womans mylke</note> to mans bodie, namely to the brayne, for it is thought to increaſe it merueylouſly, and preſerueth agaynſt conſumption. Next vnto it, is Goates Mylke, for it is temperate and hath in <note place="margin">Goates mylke</note> it but ſmall quantitie of Butter. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the milke of Camels and Aſſes, whiche by reaſon of the nature of the <note place="margin">Camelles mylke and Aſſes milk</note> beaſtes themſelues, hath in it but litle Chéeſe, and therefore doth purge excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and is very wholeſome. The Milke of Ryne and Ewes is fatter: but if the beaſt that géeueth it, féede in good and wholeſome paſtures, out of Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and Marſhes, and with temperate fodder, it is much better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if thei ſhould féede in ſmall cloſes or watrie grounds. And it ſhould be dronke warme from <note place="margin">When to drinke milke</note> the vdder, or not very longe after, it is milked, for the ayre doth ſoone alter it, and of good and wholeſome, maketh it il and noyſome. But héere may ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, why Milke ſhould be forbidden younge men and not to men of ripe and
<pb facs="tcp:6107:40"/>
conſiſtent age, conſiderynge that vnto younge infantes it is géeuen by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial benefite of Nature as a moſt fit and conuenient nouriſhment. But this and ſuch other ambiguous quiddities are els where to be ſought, for in this ſmal booke wée write a Regiment how to conſerue health and not arguyng diſputations.</p>
               <p>The vpper parte of the milke is not to <note place="margin">Creame.</note> be prayſed, for it loſeth the ſtomacke, and by reaſon of his vnctuoſitie is ſoone tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into yelow choler. The Creame or thicke ſummitie of Milke whiche is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered after the milke hath been ſodden and ſuffred to ſtande a night is vnwhole<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſome and hurtefull.</p>
               <p>Butter is very vnctuous, and all vnc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuous <note place="margin">Butter</note> meates eſpecially Butter (by the opinion of <hi>Auicen)</hi> is preiudiciall and harmefull to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtomacke.

The beſt Butter is that whiche is made of
<pb facs="tcp:6107:41"/>
Cowes milke in May. In hoate and moyſt complexions it is ſoone conuerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into Choler. The thicke and curdie Milke, whiche firſt commeth into the Dugges incontinently after the Cowe <note place="margin">Bieſting</note> hath calued, commonly called <hi>Bieſtings</hi> is very daungerous, for it is ſlow of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and deſcendeth ſlowlye from the ſtomacke, and is alſo groſſe of ſubſtance, cauſing groſſe humours and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is thought to engender the ſtone.</p>
               <p>Freſh and new Cheeſe (ſayth <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides)</hi> is beneficiall to the ſtomacke, but <note place="margin">Freshe Cheeſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Auicen</hi> doubteth therof. But I thinke, that in hoate ſeaſons and aboute the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnynge of Autumne it may without daunger be eaten. But being olde, and yet not rotten nor hard with age, conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſalted, I iudge better to be eaten in colde ſeaſons and at the latter ende of meales: yet herein as in all other things, Nature and Cuſtome is of greate force and muche to be conſidered. For there are ſome, whiche do abhorre Chéeſe and cannot in any wiſe brooke it: as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do lothe Wyne and ſo forthe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb facs="tcp:6107:41"/>
                  <hi>Auicen</hi> ſayth that ſuch indiuiduall proprieties as theſe, are without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of reaſon, and that experience and triall herein is aboue reaſon. The thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt part of the mylke called whaye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge vſed by way of medicine rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For it waſheth the breaſt, prouoketh vrine, maketh cleane the bladder, and without any pain or excoriation draweth out ill humours, and (as <hi>Auicen</hi> ſayeth) rectifieth nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and openeth the partes of the bodie that are with obſtructions ſtopped. All which vertues and operatious make <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicen</hi> to thinke that it maketh men fat.</p>
               <p>Into it may be put a conuenient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Roſes or Sene (accordinge as the pacient ſhalbe opplete with humoures) the ſpace of a night with a little Anyſe ſéede or Cinamome to make it woorke more ſtrongelie. But then were it good that the humours ſhoulde be concoct and

<pb facs="tcp:6107:43"/>
is altogether to abſtaine from them. The Gréeke poet <hi>Homer</hi> for his manifolde knoweledge in al faculties worthie to be called the pereleſſe Phenix of learninge moſt learnedly bringeth in, that <hi>Vliſſes</hi> when he had trauailed longe vpon the Seas, and all his victualles were ſpent, was by neceſſitie enforced and driuen to fiſhe. Meaninge therby, that ſo longe as we may liue without fiſhe, we ſhoulde refraine it. But for aſmuche as euerie man may not alwayes eate egges nor fleſhe, nor at all ſeaſons without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and difference, and alſo appetite ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny times beareth ſwaye aboue reaſon: Therefore I will declare &amp; deſcribe ſuch fiſhes as are leſt hurtfull. And firſt this is to be knowen, that thoſe fiſhes are beſt which be neither verye harde and drye, <note place="margin">Beſt fishes.</note> neyther yet full of ſtimie and clammie toughnes, nether opplete with much fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe (for all fatte is ill, but of fiſhes the fatteneſſe is worſe then anye other) ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ill ſauoure and relice: but pleaſant ſwéete and toothſome in taſte, and which will not ſoone ſtinke after they be taken

out of the water. It is further alſo to be noted that of thoſe which are ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der, the greateſt are beſt, but of hard fiſhe take the ſmaleſt. For that which among moyſt thinges is found drye, muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as moderate as that is, whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge drye thinges is founde moyſte. Yet let a conuenient meaſure aſwell in the bigneſſe as in the ſmaleneſſe be obſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued. Alſo the fiſhes that liue about cleare Rockes and in ſtony places are (as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſayeth) better then any other.</p>
               <p>And it is not without good cauſe that ſuche fiſhes be preferred and winne the commendacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from others. For they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and mooue themſelues muche and often, and lye in ſuche places, where they are often toſſed and beaten with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſurges and waues of the tempeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Sea, and neuer are embroyned with anye filth or diertie ſlimiſhnes.</p>
               <p>Thoſe fiſhes alſo are greatly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that come ſwymminge out of the Sea into Riuers, ſith they come agaynſt the ſtreame, and the farther of that they be from the Sea, the holeſomer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore thoſe fiſhes that féede vpon ſwéete herbes, rootes and wéedes aboute the banke ſides are better then thoſe that liue by mudde and ſlime: amonge which ill ſorte are thoſe fiſhes that are called Mugles or Lompes, which are not hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome although they ſéeme to haue a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <note place="margin">Mugles or Lompes.</note> taſte and ſauoure.

And therefore if you make oyle of theſe Oliues before they come to their full ripeneſſe, truely in hoate ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons you ſhall finde the eatynge thereof very wholeſom.

of cleane, for if it be not, it is prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to be windie and inflatiue.

Alſo ſharpe and ſower honie is the worſt of al others foraſmuche as it is of ſome thought to be peſtilent and venemous.

mitigate and open obſtructions, and alſo to drye vp and wype away il humours, and it is good for the ſtomacke if no yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low choler be therin, for it is eaſelie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and turned into choler. Alſo it pur geth phlegme that is founde in the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and comforteth the bealie. This therfore is very good to be eaten at anye time of the yere, but honie is beſt in win<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter to be eaten and in the ſecond parte of Autumne. Vinegre is ſaid to be good for them that are melancholique but nought <note place="margin">Vineiger.</note> for them that be cholerique, and therfore it agréeth beſt to a ſtomacke that is hoat and moyſte: it ſtirreth vp appetite, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth concoction, repreſſeth choler and ſtoppeth humours from beinge diffuſed into the inward partes, it maketh them ſubtile, cutteth them a ſunder and preſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth againſte phlegme, ſpeciallie if it be mixed with Cinamome and Corraunts to take awaye and alay the ouermuche coldenes and egerneſſe of it.

by reaſon of the repugnant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie and naturall enemitie that is betwéene the Vyne and them.

Alſo the iuice of Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wortes is cleane contrarie to Wyne, and therefore whereas the Vyne with his tendrelles will take holde and lappe aboute all other thinges, it will neuer turne towarde the Coleworte.

               <p>They are alſo ſayde to make one fatte: but althoughe ſuche fattineſſe continueth but a while, and differeth much from the nouriſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that bread maketh, yet they géeue greater nouriſhement and are of more ſtrength then other fruictes. And becauſe figges do quicklie deſcend and are ſoone diſtributed into euerye parte of the bodie, and mundefie and ſcower the paſſage and way whereby the meate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe, therefore they are beſt to be eaten before other meates.

               <p>And they haue power to cleanſe the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell being in the Reines of the backe.</p>
               <p>Drye fygges ſayeth <hi>Galen</hi> eaten with nuttes, are an excellent meate and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if they be eaten with Almondes, for ſo, they open obſtructions, but they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe

not ſo well neither engender they ſo good bloude and iuyce when they be mixed with nuttes. And therebe ſome, which plainly affirme, that drye figges <note place="margin">Againſt poyſon</note> eaten with rue and nuttes, are a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne remedie agaynſte all maner of poyſon. White Grapes are a greate deale better then blacke, ſo that the place <note place="margin">Grapes</note> of their growyng and ripeneſſe be like. And thoſe that haue béen hanged vp two or three dayes in the Sunne ere they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten are beſt, and moſt wholeſome, and make nouriſhment very néere as good as figges, whiche ought to be eaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other meates aſwell as figges. For they lenifie the bealy, but much vſinge of them is ill for the bladder, and therefore thoſe that haue the grauell or ſtone ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Reynes or Bladder muſt forbeare them. For they leaue much fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent and dreggie matter in the body and ſende many fumes to the brayne, as it may appéere by the veſſel wherein the Wyne that is made of them is put. Alſo Grapes &amp; Figges annoy the Bow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>els and Intrayles drawing them like a

               <p>Rayſons of the Sunne clenſe the body and comfort digeſtion and be very hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <note place="margin">Rayſons</note> for the ſtomacke, but ſpecially for the Liuer totally.

Of them that ſhould be eaten before other meate, <hi>Auicen</hi> amonge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindes reckeneth theſe, Melons, Pompons, Mulberies, yealow Quinces Peaches, Plummes, Prunes, Sloes, Bullaſſe, Chéeries &amp;c. For theſe kindes
<pb facs="tcp:6107:58"/>
of fruictes engendre very much humour and ſuche as is eaſely corruptible.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is beſt to driue them out of the bodie as quicklie as may be conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, whiche by this way and meane may be done, if they be eaten alone with out any other meate and after the eating of them to walke and then to eate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge to make them ſlipperie and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendible. And he ſayeth further, that theſe fruicts being new are good for none but them which are exerciſed &amp; much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with redde Choler, and in Sommer ſeaſon, and géeueth counſell alſo that it is beſt to abſtaine from them becauſe they make watriſhe bublinge bloude whiche will ſoone putrefie. Notwithſtanding by reaſon that they be great coolers, they are good for them that be hoate, euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye ſame houre that they be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they be colde and moyſte. Yet this their moyſture engendreth putrefaction and corruption and likewiſe maketh the bloude full of rawe and crude humiditie, as the gréene Melon which is commonly called <hi>Auguria:</hi> which alſo muſt be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne <note place="margin">Melon</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6107:58"/>
for an other ſpeciall conſideration, and that is becauſe it is tourned into any humoure that it findeth in the ſtomacke. For if it finde phlegme, it is tourned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to phlegme, and if it finde choler it is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into choler &amp;c. And becauſe ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture are deſirous to know theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid fruictes, which be beſt, or rather which be leſt hurtfull I will brieflie run ouer them. And among theſe fruictes, the Melon maketh better iuyce and more nouriſhement then any of the other and is not ſo ſoone conuerted into that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moure which it findeth in the ſtomacke as the gréene Melon called <hi>Auguria</hi> is: it is abſterſiue and prouoketh vryne, but it muſt be eaten in ſuche ſorte as before is declared, for els it putrefieth, and of his putrefaction cauſeth feruent and ſharpe diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Mulberies although they haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ſtipticke vertue, yet dothe <hi>Auicen</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:6107:59"/>
but they which be tart &amp; ſower are colde.</p>
               <p>Muche like vnto them in nature are Cheries, for they are ſoone corrupted and <note place="margin">Cheries</note> putrefied: and thoſe Cheries (vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly) are moſt wholeſome, whiche are bothe ſharpe and bitter and alſo ſwéete and rype, whiche are commonlie named <hi>Maraſchae.</hi> For they are not ſo eaſelie corrupted as the other and do refrigerate and coole a great deale better. Al Cherics are cold and moyſt in the firſt degree and of them ſome are ſofte and ſwéete, ſome harde and harriſhe, and whiche do binde more. The firſt ſorte are better becauſe they be ſooner digeſted and deſcend from the ſtomacke quicklier. The ſecond ſorte agrée better to the ſtomacke encombred with choler, becauſe they are vneth at all corrupted and confirme the Stomacke with a certaine binding or aſtrictiue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: but much vſinge of them if they be not tourned into corruption by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward humours engender watriſhe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moure.</p>

Therfore thoſe that can not eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie digeſt them, but haue them longe aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge in their ſtomacke, I would aduiſe and counſaile not at all to eate of them.</p>
               <p>For Abrecockes being moyſt and new, are muche ſubiecte to corruption and therfore engender Agues and Feuers. <hi>Auicen</hi> ſayeth that Maſticke and Amſe minged with Wyne made of drie and withered grapes or els with hony ought to be drunke when wée eate Abrecocks. Peaches (ſaieth <hi>Dioſcorides)</hi> are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the ſtomacke and if they be ripe, <note place="margin">Peaches</note> they mollefie and comfort the bealy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng eaten before other meates: but ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after other meates, they are bothe corrupted themſelues, and alſo corrupt the other meates that are neere vnto them. Drie Peaches and Abrecockes muſt be eaten not before but after other
<pb facs="tcp:6107:60"/>
ſuſtenance, becauſe they are not onely heauy to the ſtomacke, but alſo géeue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry litle nouriſhement. Notwithſtanding <hi>Auenzoar</hi> ſayeth, that peaches are good for them that haue ſtinkinge breathes, procéeding of diſtemperaunce of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke: and as for anye other vertue he ſayeth they haue none. Plummes and <note place="margin">Plummes Dameſons.</note> Dameſons are better then they, if they be well digeſted and ſent downe into the mawe, for in ſome perſons, theſe alſo are many times corrupted, by reaſon that they abide longe in the ſtomack ere they be expelled. Plummes that are ſwéete make the ſtomack weake with to much moyſture, but thoſe that haue a meane taſte betwéene ſwéete and ſower are of more force to quenche and repreſſe cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. And as for the coldenes of them (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Auicen)</hi> it may be qualefied by drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge honie, water and wine of grapes withered in the Sunne.</p>
               <p>But now it is time for vs to entreate of ſome ſuche fruictes as maye be eaten after other meates. For there are manie whiche let vapours from aſcendinge and
<pb facs="tcp:6107:60"/>
moleſtinge the braine, and whiche do ſtrengthen the mouth of the ſtomacke, of whiche ſorte are Pomegranardes, Quin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardes Sweete</note> Peares and ſuche like. But firſte let vs confuſelie ſpeake of them that maye be eaten either before or after meate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differentlye. Of Pomegranardes there be thrée kindes, ſwéete, ſower, and mean betwéene both. Swéete Pomegranards beinge colde and moyſte in the firſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree be very profitable for the ſtomacke and Lieuer, and merueilouſlie helpe and comforte the naturall ſpirites, and are reckened among thoſe things that make a man fatte. They alſo directe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the waies and paſſages of the vrine much better then the ſower do. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they are highlie to be praiſed, and may without any harme be eaten at any time of the yere, but ſpeciallie in Autu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne at anye time of meales. They of meane <note place="margin">Meane</note> taſte betwéene ſwéete and ſower, are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then the ſwéete are, and therfore they beſt agree to them that haue hoate Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes: and they are of an indifferent good abſtertion with ſtipticitie and refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration.
<pb facs="tcp:6107:61"/>
                  <hi>Auenzoar</hi> telleth a wonderfull vertue that they haue, and <hi>Auerrois</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the ſame, that they do not ſuffer anye corruption of the meate in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke if it be fumous or like to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure of Egges. But if the corruption be eigre or ſower, he warneth vs to be ware how we eate them, but ſwéete Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granardes in that caſe (he ſayeth) do no harme.

But yet their tartnes may be alayed and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by eating a litle Sugar or Hony or ſome ſuche ſwéete thinge: They haue a great vertue to quenche hoate burninge choler and to repreſſe the euaporation of fumes in the head. To conclude, al Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granardes generallie are of a light nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhement and euer make thinne bloud, and are very amicable and holeſome for the ſtomacke, and do aboliſhe and driue awaye all frettinge iuyce and byting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. And therfore thou mayeſt verye

conuenientlie and well vſe them at all times, when thou feeleſt in thy bodie muche heate to abounde, or els when the time and ſeaſon of the yeare ſhall ſeeme to require.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideringe that the mouth of the ſtomacke by a certaine aſtrictiue power which is in them is ſhutte together, and the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhement or meate before eaten, forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie protruded and thruſte forward, as we ſée by experience in a bottle or in a bladder when we wring hard and thruſt out of them being full the licour.</p>
               <p>In the noumber of fruictes alſo, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice

               <p>Of Apples, thoſe that are ſwéete (ſayeth <hi>Aegineta)</hi> haue more power to heate <note place="margin">

the head is diſtempered throughe drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king muche wyne, they haue bene found right commodious to alaye and redreſſe the inconueniences thereof: but they be thought to be hurtefull to the Sinewes and to hebetate or dull the memorie, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie if they be of nature ſower. For they be colde ynough and by the ſlyneſſe of there ſubſtaunce pearce and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed euen into the very innermoſte partes.

               <p>Cheſtnuttes becauſe they are of heauie concoction and engendre groſſe &amp; crude humours (albeit not verye ill) and cauſe windynes very greatly, I iudge fitter to be left to them that vſe labour and much exerciſe.

Filberdes becauſe they be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trictiue <note place="margin">Eilberdes</note> and reſtraine Reumes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarres, might be thought to be profitable to the ſtomacke, but for all that, they are very ill and hard to be digeſted, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the thicke ſubſtaunce that is in them, and conſequentlie becauſe they binde the bealie the more. But <hi>Auicen</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, becauſe they are good for all Lieuers, by reaſon of the ſmall heate

wherwith they be endued. For they are hoate and drye in the firſte degrée: and therefore they do no hurte ſo a Lieuer that is hoat, and vnto it that is colde they do muche good. Alſo they are aperitiue and open oppilations and obſtructions and make good iuyce in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie: but they inflate and engender windineſſe in the bottome of the bealie, and cauſe headache with augmentacion of the braine.

For the one requireth good ſpace ere they be concocted, but the other do ſoone deſcende downe into the bealie.

For abſtinence (ſaieth <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Diete</note> is one maner of euacuation.

But if their be ſuch abundance of ill humoures, that diette or abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is not hable to purge them, then
<pb facs="tcp:6107:72"/>
muſt thoſe humours be educed and dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen foorth by eaſie and light purgacion, ſpeciallye in two quarters of the yere, Springe and Autumne.

And the dryneſſe and heate of Rubarbe, Agaricke and Sene, maye be mitigated and taken awaye, if they be mixed with ſuche thinges as be moyſte and colde: of whiche ſorte are Plummes, Sebeſtens and cordiall flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. And vnto them it were not amiſſe, to put a little quantitie of Anyſe or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namome becauſe of the weakenes and imbecilitie of the ſtomacke. And if great extremitie and néede ſéeme to require, to
<pb facs="tcp:6107:73"/>
take ſome purgation or medicinable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for healthes ſake in a great heate, let the confect be dronk with the waters or rather with the decoctions of Sorell, Endiue, Borage, Violettes, Succorie, Hoppes and Raiſons, accordingelie as it ſhall ſéeme expedient by the aduiſe and counſell of the ſkilfull Phiſicion. Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alwayes, that non of all theſe whiche are here rehearced, nor yet of any other, be taken in anye great quantitie. For ſome (ſayeth <hi>Galen)</hi> are glad when they often and largelie make great Stooles: But the more they be emptied, the more is their bealie bounde within few dayes afterward, whiche to be true, not onlye good reaſon, but alſo daylie experience perſwadeth.

               <p>ANd becauſe they which are in helth ought to haue a ſpeciall regarde to Sléepe, that it neyther be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nor leſſe then nature requireth, but vſed in due and conuenient moderation, to thende that the commodities whiche come therby may be felte and taken, and the harmes comminge by longe watche auoyded: we will here briefely entreate of both. And firſt, this muſt diligently be inculcate, that neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſe meaſure. For beinge vſed out of meaſure (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirmeth) they bringe ſo muche hinderance and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance <note place="margin">2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 3 <hi>Much Sleepe</hi>
                  </note> to health as nothing more. For immoderate and too muche ſléepe filleth the body with many humours and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb facs="tcp:6107:74"/>
not onely ſweate but alſo all other ſuperfluities maketh the bodie dull and heauie, weakeneth and in a maner boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the ſenſes and maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blunt and vnapte to honeſt exerciſes, euen as if muche ſtore of aſhes ſhoulde be caſte vpon fier, they couer and quight quenche it out, yea <hi>Auicen</hi> alſo doubted not to ſay that it dampnified and hurte the ſoule or reaſonable part of man. Contrarily, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſléepe after meate doth moyſten the whole bodie and is thought to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecte euen the very innermoſte partes of the bodie, to ſtirre vp and exuſcitate the powers and vertues therof, to make the actions of the Senſes more freſh and luſtie, to reuiue and quicken the ſpirites Naturall, Vitall and Animall and as it were to refreſhe and repaire the whole bodie new agayne. Beinge vſed before <note place="margin">Sleepe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meat.</note> meate, it dryeth vp the bodye, while the naturall heate worketh inwardly exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge his force and violence againſte it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe. For ſléepe is nothinge elſe but a pleaſant and delightfull detention of the ſenſes and a reuocacion of heate into the
<pb facs="tcp:6107:74"/>
inwarde partes of the body: where, if it finde nouriſhment ready to work vpon, it digeſteth and diſtributeth it into all the veines, Arteries and members of the whole bodie. The ſame effect hath it, if it finde crude and rawe humours vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocte. Thus ſléepe before meate is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. But if naturall heat finde no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyment or moyſture inwardlie, then is it too muche incended, and tourneth all his violence againſt the radicall and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall moyſture of the bodye, and for want of other exhauſteth it. Semblably immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and too muche watchinge is as <note place="margin">Watch</note> hurtfull to the powers and hindereth the chiefe functions of life, for therby natural heate is cooled (as <hi>Auerrois</hi> ſayeth) like as fier which with too muche moouinge and ſtirringe is blowen abroade and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percled. Thereby alſo the ſpirites be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, and the power Animall troubled, digeſtion letted, the body made apte to Conſumptions, the braine debilitate and filled with many noyſome vapours and fumoſities. But moderate Sleepe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſaide, ſtrengtheneth the vitall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
<pb facs="tcp:6107:75"/>
and maketh the vertue naturall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to accompliſhe and completelie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patche all her operations, whereof the chiefeſt is digeſtion and concoction of the meate. Furthermore it maketh the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue Animall to take reſt, and remooueth and taketh away the weakenes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie that commeth by ſtudie and labor. But ſome will ſtande in doubte concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge the meaſure and time of ſléepe whether it ought to be ſo great and ſo longe as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> appointeth it. For he ſayeth, that that Sleepe is laudable and naturall whiche lacketh no parte of the night, neither hindreth anye parte of the daye. Whiche ſéemeth to be the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome and maner of men in the auncient time (if we beléeue <hi>Homere)</hi> who hath diligently deſcribed the maners, rytes and ſtudies of men. For aſſoone as the Sunne is downe, he wryteth and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth that men ſurceaſſed from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and betooke themſelues to reſt: and when the Sunne was riſen and vp, he alwayes lightlie ſéemeth to ſtirre vp and cal men to their buſines and vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:6107:75"/>
Whereby he ſignified and ment, that all the night we ought to ſléepe, and all the daye to watche. Neither is it without good reſpecte and conſideracion that the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in an other place <note place="margin">1. <hi>Aph.</hi> 16</note> wryteth, that ventres in winter and Springe are very hoate and ſleepe verye longe. As concerninge what howers of the daye time are fitteſt to ſléepe in, he in his booke entituled <hi>De praeſagiis</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">2. <hi>Prae.</hi> 11.</note> the morninge to be leſt hurtefull vntill the thirde houre of the day whiche is nine of the clocke. But becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cuſtome may not be forgotten and neglected as he the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo noteth, therefore I thinke, that wée ought not to ſléepe the whole night longe in winter. For eight houres for the age <note place="margin">The time &amp; ſpace of Sleepe</note> and common cuſtome of them for whoſe ſake this ſmall Treatiſe is purpoſelye written, is ynoughe or rather too muche vnleſſe it be in them whoſe ſtomackes are very weake and of ſlow digeſtion. In Sommer let ſléepe be equall with the night in length becauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nightes are ſhorte: and it will not be very ill, to
<pb facs="tcp:6107:76"/>
recompence the diſſolution and drineſſe of the Spirites with longer ſléepe and to take a little nappe in the morninge or at noone daies (if néede be) Albeit it is much better not to ſléepe at all at noone, vnleſſe <note place="margin">Sleepe at noone</note> common cuſtome be to the contrarie, or elſe that thou feeleſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it doth thée good, and guardeth thee from further &amp; worſe inconueniences. For it bréedeth manye moyſte diſcraſies and maladies and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth humours to fall downe, marreth the coloure of the face and bodie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſalowe, inflateth and puffeth vp the Splene, loſeth the ſinewes, cauſeth dulneſſe, weakeneth and enféebleth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and is a foremeſſanger or way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker to Feuers, Apoſtumations, and Abſceſſes. But cuſtome (as before hath ben often noted) is of ſo great force, that it becommeth and is made nature. For as we daylie ſee by experience that ſome do and haue a longe time accuſtomed themſelues to very ill dyet and to meats of naughtie nouriſhement, and yet haue not thereby béen endaungered and hurt: ſo is it alſo to be thought by Sléepe, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:6107:76"/>
when neceſſitie enforceth, as when we haue watched before and our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites through heate and labour of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or mind be greatly diſſolued and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. For then they ſéekinge a refreſhing and inſtauracion againe gather and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyghe themſelues into the inwarde partes, whereby the ſenſes beinge for a time lefte and forſaken, there hapneth Sléepe. For Sléepe is nothinge elſe but a bonde or detencion of the ſenſes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they intermitte their offices and func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the tyme, and is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of Reſt. But in Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſpeciallie I do aduiſe and counſaile thee for one hower at the leaſt after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to ſitte and recreate thy ſelfe wyth reading of ſome light and mery matter, abandoning cares and fancies out of thy minde, and not in any wiſe to ſléepe. For commonlye this reſte doth no leſſe good, yea perhappes it is more holeſome to a great maignye then ſléepe, becauſe it bringeth a commoditie without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie. For thereby the ſpirites are gathered together and (the cogitacions of
<pb facs="tcp:6107:77"/>
the minde being relaxed) are wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie refreſhed and comforted. But if ſléepe wil néedes come vpon thée, and as a thief ſteale vpon thée (for the auncient Sages of Greece tearmed ſléepe by that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thete) looke that thou ſléepe with thy head vpright, hauing al the windowes of thy chamber faſt ſhutte for the ſpace one hower. But in any wiſe beware of ſléepe immediately after ſupper, for ther ought <note place="margin">Sleepe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelie after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</note> to be a conuenient ſpace betwéene ſupper and ſléepe, to witte an hower and a halfe at the leaſt. For thou muſt not ſléepe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the meate be deſcended from the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parte of the ſtomacke to the lower: which thinge that it may the more eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and ſpeedelie be doone, it ſhalbe beſte after ſupper to walke ſoftely and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately. For by that meanes ſléepe ſhalbe both the quieter and longer, &amp; the braine ſhall not be ſo muche troubled with fumes and vapours, whiche are wont to ſtrike vp into the heade when the meate tarieth to longe in the mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke. If the ſpace betwéene ſupper and goinge to bedde be ſomewhat longe, and
<pb facs="tcp:6107:77"/>
the walkinge hath made the meate to deſcend to the loweſt part of the ſtomack thou ſhalt firſt lye vpon thy lefte ſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this liynge the Lieuer appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <note place="margin">The maner of lying in bedde</note> better to the Stomack and helpeth the better to haſten digeſtion. To ſleepe proſtrate or grouelinge vpon the bealie is verye good and namelye for them that haue feeble digeſtion, for that kinde of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge containeth and keepeth in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate wherewith the meate is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted. But if ſléepe come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thée before they meate be deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of thy ſtomacke, firſt lye on thy right ſide, vntil it be deſcended from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpper parte (for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of the ſtomack is on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lefte ſide) and then muſt thou tourne thée on the lefte ſide or vpon thy bealie, that the meate may more eaſely be concected in a more fleſhie and hoate parte, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpes and furtherances aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But lyinge vpright vpon the backe is vtterlie to be abhorred, for it cauſeth manye perillous diſeaſes and fond paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Lethargie, the Mare, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexie &amp;c. and not without cauſe whye:
<pb facs="tcp:6107:78"/>
for this maner of liynge bringeth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours backewarde to the hinder partes of the bodie and head and hindreth them that they cannot haue egreſſe and vente out by their proper and conuenable iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues which are the palate and noſethrils. When thou haſt ſlepte conueniently and meaſurablie, thou ſhalt finde an excellent commoditie if thou vſe fricaſie and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ouer thy body, firſt with thy ſhirte ſléeue or bare hande to rubbe and chaufe thy legges, then thy armes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde thy whole bodie both before and behinde, and then to put on thy cloathes <note place="margin">What is to be done in the mor, ninge at our vpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge</note> and goe to the ſtoole, then to rubbe and kembe thy head and to ſtretche thy ſelfe and to waſhe thine eyes (if néede ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) with water of Roſes and Fenell, and to cleanſe thy téeth with ſome hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Toothpicker, and to chawe a litle Maſticke or Galingale, for they drawe ſuperfluous humours from the head and are moſte ſoueraigne both for the head and the ſtomacke.

becauſe among many other harmes and daungers, which much Coiture and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalitie bringeth, this is not the leſt, that it weakeneth the heart, debilitateth the <note place="margin">The hurt of muche vſing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall act.</note> braine, and dryeth vp all the bodie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it waſteth the ſubſtance of the laſt alime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For Sperm or Séede of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayeth) the laſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of profitable aliment. And alſo, as we haue before declared, becauſe through the great pleaſure that is in it, the ſpirits and naturall heate are to muche reſolued and the ſtomacke principallie endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: as contrarywiſe, by conuenient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie and oportune forbearing therof it is cheriſhed and preſerued. It was not without good cauſe that <hi>Auicen</hi> thought if neuer ſo litle Sperme or Seede ouer and aboue the meaſure and ſtinte of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">Sperme</note> do paſſe from a man in doing this acte of generation it harmeth him more, then if he ſhould bléede fortie tymes ſo muche. For the Sperme is a thing more conforme to natural heate and moyſture and more ſpiritual then bloude is. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer carnall apetite is a deadlie enemie
<pb facs="tcp:6107:81"/>
to dry complexions &amp; likewiſe to colde: but vnhurtfull (beinge moderately vſed) onely to them that are hoate and moyſte and whiche haue naturally great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Sperme. <hi>Galen</hi> ſayeth, that the <note place="margin">Venerie whom it hurteth &amp; whom not. De tuend. Sanit. 6.</note> ſtate of thoſe bodies is worſt, which haue abundaunce of hoate Séede, becauſe it doth prorite and tickle them to expell it ſithens both the mouth of their ventres is reſolued, and all their bodie is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relaxed and made weak, but alſo they be drye, ſlender, pale, and holow eyed, vnto whome he in that ſame place preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth ſtore of remedies. But if a man woulde abſtaine from very hoate meats and wyndie, and muche drinkynge of <note place="margin">How to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerie.</note> headie wyne and refrayne venerous imaginations, and ſuche like pleaſures, he ſhall not lightly be muche aſſailed and tempted with deſire of any carnall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. Likewiſe if he erneſtly addicte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the ſtudie of Morall Philoſophie and of the ſacred Scriptures, baniſhinge Idlenes and forbearinge the companye (ſo farre as he conuenientlye maye) of beawtifull damſelles and amorous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb facs="tcp:6107:82"/>
Or if a man vſe the Séede of <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos Caſtus</hi> (which is alſo called <hi>Viter)</hi> he ſhall ſée and féele a merueilous effecte to repreſſe his fleſhlie concupiſcence. If thy loynes be to hoate, annointe them with the Oyle of Henbane or Popie, and do likewiſe to thy Genitories, and do not vſe to lye in a ſofte feather bedde. Some there be, whiche coole there Priuities in colde water, and finde thereby a preſent remedie, They that drinke the iuyce of water Lillie (called of the Apothecaries <hi>Nenuphar)</hi> the ſpace of xij. dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall haue no maner of deſire to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalitie. And therefore it is good for wiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Bachelers and huſbandleſſe may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to drinke, to driue away theire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane dreaminge of venerie and the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy pollutions that they haue by night.</p>
               <p>But in fine, bidde daintie fare a dieu, and vſe not to pamper thy ſelfe with muche gurmandize, but onely ſo muche as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requireth to kéepe thy bodye in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte health and ſoundnes. For there is an olde Prouerbe and a true ſayinge:
<pb facs="tcp:6107:82"/>
                  <hi>From frequent Venus, muche cheere and ſleepe, Eche Studient ought, himſelfe to keepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember that I haue read in ſainct Chriſoſtome, that our Sauiour Chriſte when he dwelled héere amonge vs on earth vſed to eate and drinke ſo litle and ſo ſeldome, that he encreſed not this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Seed. But as in this poinct ſo in many other Chriſt hath but very few Imitatours and folowers wheras (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge) there be many whiche haue ſtill this ſaying in there mouthes how that euery action of Chriſte is our inſtruction.</p>
               <p>But let vs draw towarde an ende of our purpoſe. When nature is deſirous of carnall coniunction and is neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked <note place="margin">The time of carnall copulation</note> therevnto by imagination and thought, nor any other outwarde cauſe but with multitude and abundance of Sperme it muſt be vſed in a fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient time. And that is when the meat is throughlie concocted and yet no hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nor deſire to eate approcheth: that Sleepe or reſt immediatlie after it, may take away the laſitude gotten and cauſed through the action there of or at the leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:6107:83"/>
mitigate and lenifie the ſame. But if we ſhould erre in either parte it were much better (as <hi>Galene</hi> ſayth) to offend being replete and armed with a full Stomack then when it is emptie and pynched with ouermuch defect and want of foode. For it is better, that is to ſay, it doth leſſe harme to vſe when the bodie is warme and calefied then when it is cold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigidate: and full infarced rather then when it is emptie, and when it is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mected rather then when it is drye. But he the ſame <hi>Galene</hi> taught before, that meaſure and temperateneſſe therein ought to be choſen and obſerued that the bodie neither ſhould be too hoate nor too cold, too moyſt nor too drie, too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete nor to much emptied. Neither do I heere allow the Law and ordinance of <hi>Solon</hi> whereby the enacted that a man ſhoulde carnally know his wyfe at leaſt <note place="margin">Solons Lawe</note> thriſe in a moneth For often vſe thereof to many men is harmefull, yea to ſome, once is to muche.

               <p>Studientes many tymes are troubled with a phlegmaticke humour deſcending from their heades into their ſtomackes being of them ſelues colde: whiche incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience may eaſely be remedied, if they take in the morning a dragme or twaine of the confection named <hi>Diatrion Pipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion.</hi> Or elſe, they may drinke Pepper alone (ſpecially that whiche is white) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge brayed and put into water, or let them take betime in the morning a litle Ginger condite, or elſe a <hi>Chebule</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, which is a kinde of mirobolanes.</p>
