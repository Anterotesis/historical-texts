            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe mighty day of the Lord is come, according as he promised of old, and this day is witnessed, wherein he is establishing his Mountain, and exalting it above all Mountains, and is gathering his people which have been scattered in the dark and long night of Apostacie, which Christ and his Apostles saw coming into the churches then, and hath had dominion long over the world, and hath reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till now, and reignes now in all the Professors in all Forms everywhere. But now the time is come wherein the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world are become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ; and thousands witness it to the praise of his everlasting Name. And therefore the Nations are angry and the Princes of the earth, because <hi>Michael</hi> our Prince is arisen to plead with all who make war against him.

And all you who live in Forms, and know not the Power, do now persecute and joine your selves together being in the same nature as the Persecutors of old which were born after the flesh. And now you Sons of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and of Hagar are to be cast out; and now you are all made manifest that you are in the flesh; for all your bows are bent, and all your arrows are shot at a people which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by you as the filth of the world, and as the off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all things whom the world calls Quakers, in whose fore-heads is written the Name of the living God; and unto
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40394:3"/>
you I say that make war against them, and now take part with the Dragon against the Lamb, you shal all drink of the cup of fury and indignation of the Lord. And unto the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God who is holy and jealous for his own glory and his name, which hath manifested his minde and will by his Eternal Spirit unto us, shall you all bow and stoop. For now the Lord hath rent the vail of the covering which hath been spread over all the nations in all professions; and you are all seen by the eternal eye which is opened in thousands; even all from the highest to the lowest, who have stollen and paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your selves with other mens words. And all your Images which you have set up, and all your traditions from men in which you have walked, are all seen to be stubble, and will not abide in the day of the Lord. And all your Churches which you have gathered together by imitation from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall all be scattered; and there you all are, for you all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Revelation, and say it is ceased; and so you call the Letter the Light and the Word: but with that which was before the Scripture you are seen and judged, even with that which shall endure for ever. And seeing you have cast reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Name of the God of Heaven and Earth whom we worship, and which you call delusion: for the truths sake are we moved to lay open your nakedness, that you may be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that which you say is your rule. Here in this little book thou who hast any honesty in thee, or any desire of truth and wilt search the Scripture, thou wilt see that all the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world in all Forms, and all Professors ever cryed out (who had but the Form) against them who had the life and power, as you all do now against them who worship God in the Spirit, and have no confidence in the flesh: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this following Discourse which is written by the same spirit that gave forth the scripture, thou shalt see who are the false Prophets, and who they are that preach another Gospel, and who they are that deny the Scriptures; and thou may see
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40394:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when the false prophets came in, and who they are clearly proved to be by their own rules. And all you who call your selves Magistrates and Christians, you may see your selves to hold up that which Christ, the prophets and apostles cryed out against, and persecute them who stand in the counsel of God, and them that declare against all the deceit, as the holy men of God did: and so you are the beast which holds up the false prophets and those whom the Scripture declareth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. God is arisen to dash to pieces al them vvho withstand him: and therefore come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and out of all your painted forms, and come to own the first Principle which wil change your mindes, even the Light of Christ which he hath enlightned every one withal; and by it you shall see what you are doing. Now if you deny this, you deny the Corner-stone, and you stumble and shall be broken; and by that which you call natural shall all your Image of gold and silver, and all your mixed invented worship be dashed to pieces and be for the Pit. Therefore all be silent and speak not evil of those things you know not; for now you are all seen, you who say you are Jews and are not, but are of the synagogue of <hi>Satan,</hi> and your voice is known, for none is turned from the evil of his way; and therefore is wrath coming upon you to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40394:4"/>WHereas we are accused by the teachers and people of this generation, That we are false Prophets and Deceivers; and that we deny the Christ which dyed at Jerusalem; and that we preach another Gospel then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles preached; and that we deny the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To these false Accusations I answer: It is no new thing, nor no strange thing to the children of Light, who are seper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from the world and worldly-worships, and from the works of darkness, to be accused falsly, and to be slandered, by being called deceivers and seducers by the generation of chief Priests and Pharisees; in which generation are the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and professors of this age, who have a form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but deny the power. Christ was called a deceiver and a blasphemer; and the Apostles were called Movers of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hereticks, and turners of the world up-side down, by them who professed in word what Christ was in substance, &amp; what the <hi>Apostles</hi> witnessed, and so it is now.

He is a false prophet and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver which hath not the word from the mouth of the Lord but takes that which the Lord spoke to another, and calls it his, and useth his tongue and saith, the Lord saith it, when the Lord never spake to him: and here are the teachers of the world themselves guilty of that whereof they falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse us; for they take the Prophets words, Christs and the Apostles words to talk upon, but have not received the word
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40394:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the mouth of the Lord: and their prophesie and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching would soon be ended if they had not the Scripture which is other mens words, and that which was spoken to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to speak their imaginations from: and these are the false Prophets and Deceivers which run and are not sent; which speak to others pretending to be sent of God, but walking contrary to all that ever God sent to declare his Name in former generations, and so are known to us by their fruits, having no example from the Prophets, Christ nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles for their practice; but do walk in the example of the false prophets of Israel, of the scribes and pharisees, and of the false brethren. O foolish people which have eyes and see not; which have hearts and do not understand: Is the Lord changed from what he was? Were they false prophets and deceivers in <hi>Isaiahs</hi> time which he was sent to cry out against, which sought for their gain from their Quarter? and are not your teachers false prophets now which act the same things? were they false prophets &amp; deceivers in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> time which he was sent to cry against, that fed themselves with the fat and clothed themselves with the wool, and made a prey upon the people? and are not your teachers false prophets and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers now which act the same thing?

And here again I charge the teachers of this generation, that their gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which they preach is not the Gospel which the saints preached, but another gospel, &amp; they are guilty of that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves whereof they falsly accuse us; for they have received their gospel from man and by man, from the Printers and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, and are made ministers of it by the will of man, at Schools and Universities; and their preaching is in the will of man, a limited time and place; neither do they suffer by man, but are set up with man, and feeds the wisdom and reason of man; and the fleshly man is not judged, nor the captives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by their gospel which they preach; here they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed which preach another Gospel, as saith the scripture. And ye are a blinde and ignorant people which cannot see these things: Did they that preached the true gospel receive it contrary to the will of man? and can it now be received by the will of man? Did they which preached it suffer for it by man? and can they now who preach it be set up by man who lives in the same persecuting nature? Did the true Gospel once judge the fleshly man, and lead to live according to God

in the spirit? and doth it now give liberty to the fleshly man to live after the flesh in the lusts of it, as the teachers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of this generation do, who profess the Gospel, but are discovered not to be come to the Law? And the scriptures we own to be a true declaration of the Life which they lived in which spoke them forth; and by the same spirit from which they were spoken (which we have received) do we set to out seals that they are true; and the scripture is ours who wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And here again I charge it upon the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and professors of this generation, that they deny the scripture, and are guilty of that themselves whereof they fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuse us; for they say, None must be perfect upon the earth; when as the scriture declares of such as were perfect upon the earth: and they say, None must be free from sin when as the scripture declares of such as were free from sin, &amp; were the servants of righteousness: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They then, as the teachers of the world do now, denyed the spirit and life which gave forth the scriptures.</p>
            <p>And the Ordinances of Jesus Christ we own and witness, preaching, praying, baptism, communion, singing, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was ordained for his saints to practice in life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; we witness these things in the eternal substance, having

Prayer by the spirit and in the spirit we own and witness, which is not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a time and place. And we deny all the worlds formal customary preaching and praying for a pretence. Baptisme we own and witness, which is with one spirit into one body, into the death of Christ: and we deny all baptisms which are imagined and imitated by conforming the outward man to the outward letter, which is but a likeness of the true bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism: communion we live in, which is in the light by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which will endure eternally: and we deny the worlds imitation, which is in word and declaration, and visible car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things which will pass away. Singing which is with the spirit and with understanding of the redeemed of the Lord, we own and witness; but the worlds singing in rime and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, proud men singing, <hi>That they are not puft in minde:</hi> and prophane men singing, <hi>That the Law of God is dear to them</hi>; this singing we deny, for it must be turned into howling, the Lord hath said it. And here again I charge it upon the teachers of the world, that they deny the substance and power of what Christ commands his saints to practice by, upholding their own imitations, and so deceiving the simple: but where the substance is witnessed, the figure is denyed, and the false imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are discovered and denyed: and mans free-will we

And we deny all the worlds Churches, whereof they were made members by visible things without, and gathered by traditions (and not by the spirit) whereof the Serpent is head (and not Christ) and which is the body of Antichrist, some of whom commits Idolatry in an Idols-temple; and the Ministry of this church we deny, for it stands in the will of man, and the Ministers of it are such as all the servants of the Lord witnessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst; the churches, the ministry and the ministers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God; but the ministry which is to the seed, which is out of the will of man, we own and witness, which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters life unto life, and death unto death, and divides the word aright; judgement to the fat and to the strong, and feeds the hungry, and looseth the bars of wickedness, and breaks not the bruised reed, nor quencheth the smoaking flax; this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry we deny not, but are friends unto it; and who are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters here, we have union withal; but proud men, and such as are called of men master, are cast out of this Ministry, and are Ministers to the body of Antichrist, and know not the mystery of the Ministry of Jesus Christ, which is to the spirit in prison.</p>
            <p>Magistrates and magistracie we deny not, but do give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto for conscience sake; for who bears the sword of justice, who use their power to be a terror to the wicked, and for the praise of them that do well, are ministers of God, and we desire that there were more magistracie here, and that the magistrate would more use his power to be a terror to lyers, to swearers, to drunkards, to railers; to false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, and to proud men and oppressors, this we are friends unto: but to such as act by their own wills in corrupt Laws, and do thereby violence to the innocent, and strengthens the hands of evil doers, we cannot be subject, but choose rather (then to transgress the Law of God which is written in our hearts, by submitting to such mens wills and Laws) to suffer

            <head>A further Answer to that Accusation, of being false Prophets and Deceivers.</head>
            <p>JEsus Christ prophesied and said, That in the last dayes should many false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets arise, and should deceive many, if it were possible the very elect. Now the Teachers and people of this generation do say, That we (who by the world are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Quakers) are those false Prophets and Deceivers which Christ prophesied of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of this their false accusation have they drunkards, lyars, swearers, and all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly people in every profession to witness them. But their accusation, and their Witnesses we do deny, though they preach it among the people for doctrine. And now in answer to this false accusation and slander, I am moved to write a little, and shall to that principle of God in every mans conscience clear my conscience, and declare what I know from God concerning those false Prophets; who they are, when they came in, and how they may be known, and shall leave it to every honest heart to consider of. The Apostles and Ministers of Jesus Christ saw the same false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which Christ prophesied of to be come, and coming in their dayes, before a quaker was heard of: <hi>Iohn</hi> said, by that they knew it was the last time: for said he, Even now are there many Antichrists, and false Prophets gone out into the world; such were they, who confessed not Christ to be come in the flesh, and they were of the world, and spoke of the world, and the world heard them. Now here I charge it upon the Teachers of the world, that they are of that generation which went out into the world then; for as they then confessed not Christ to be come in the flesh, so these uphold those things which were under the Law, which was before Christ came in the flesh outwardly; and so confesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They uphold an outward Temple and an outward worship, and take tythes, as the Priests under the Law did, as a type and figure of Christ, but when he was come and sacrificed, these things (which were to stand for a time) were put to an end. And none who witnessed Christ come, and were sent by him to preach the Gospel, did uphold those things, but witnessed forth the substance, and denied the figure; they denied the outward Temple, and witnessed they were the Temples of God, and that God dwelt in them, and denied the outward worship, and witnessed the worship of God in spirit and in truth within them, (for
