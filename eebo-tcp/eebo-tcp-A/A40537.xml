            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>After which an Indictment of High-Treaſon was read againſt him: Which ſet forth, <hi>That be being a Perſon of very Evil Fame, did Traiterouſly, Falſly, Maliciouſly and Deviliſhly Adhere to, Aid, Abet, and Comfort the King and Queens Enemies that now is: And did (of his Malice, before thought) endeavour our Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queen to final Death and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to bring, and to raiſe War and Rebellion among the Subjects of our Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queen that now is, within this Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>and elſwhere,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to Accompliſh and Bring thoſe his Treaſonable, Falſe, Malicious and Deviliſh Practices and Purpoſes to paſs, did, on the</hi> 6th <hi>Day of</hi> July, <hi>in the ſecond Year of their Majeſties Reign, in the County of</hi> Kent, <hi>convey him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on Board of ſeveral Ships belonging to the</hi> French Fleet, <hi>which were then riding not far off from the Town of</hi> Lidd <hi>in</hi> Kent: <hi>And there had held Correſpondence with them, particularly with Sir</hi> William Jennings, <hi>then Commander in Chief of the French Admiral; from whom he brought Letters of Invitation to ſome Perſons here in</hi> England, <hi>To come on Board him: And carried Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to them of the ſtate of Affairs here, againſt the Duty of his Allegiance, and againſt the Form of the Statute in that Caſe made and provided,</hi> &amp;c. To all which Charge he had before pleaded Not Guilty.</p>
            <p>Then the King's Councel proceeded to open the Matter of Fact, and the horrid Nature of it, to the Gentlemen of the Jury; giving them to underſtand, That he was Indicted for a Crime of a very high nature, (Firſt) For adhering to the French King, who was an open and profeſſed Enemy to this Nation; which did find him to be guilty of a manifeſt Intention to deſtroy it, and to bring the King and his Subjects under the Power and Dominion of the French King: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great Charges and Trouble the preſent King of <hi>England</hi> hath been at to reduce it, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect all their Villanies, in that Vigorous and Unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Attempt that he is ſtill making againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy. And that the French did not altogether truſt to their own Power and Strength, but they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Correſpondent Helps from the King's Enemies; Amongſt which perfideous ſort of Men this Priſoner at the Bar appeared.</p>
            <p>And furthermore the Priſoner at the Bar, on the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> laſt, at the Town of <hi>Lidd</hi> aforeſaid, about ſeven a Clock in the Morning, did appear on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, near the Water ſide, within View of the French Fleet; and a Sloop coming near the Shoar, he waved his Hat as a Token or Sign to them to come nearer; then they ſent out their Long-boat, he riding his Mare up to the Belly in Water to the Boat-ſide, and went into the Boat, quiting his Mare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at which the Priſoner ſeemed to laugh: But the King's Councel told him, That it was no laughing Matter, or to that effect. The Councel further declared the Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Crime; How that he being one of the King's Natural and True born Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, inſtead of taking up Arms for the King and Queen, as by the Duty of his Allegiance he ought to have done, he goes on Board the French Fleet and carries Intelligence to them of the ſtate of Affairs here in <hi>England;</hi> and brings back Letters and Notes of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43508:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Invitations and Intelligence to others, to joyn with him in his Traiterous, Deviliſh Deſigns, and Wicked Encompaſſings and Imaginations; which did particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly tend to the Depoſing of the King and Queen; and that the People of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be no longer a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So that ſurely the thing it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> His going on Board the French Fleet, was Evidence enough, beyond all Papers, or any thing elſe that could be brought againſt him; but to clear all Doubts, there were ſeveral Good Evidence produced to prove the Matter of Fact more fully upon him, the firſt of which was one <hi>Stephen Stacy,</hi> who declared upon Oath.</p>
            <p>That he ſaw him ride into the Water up to the Mare's Belly, and go into the Boat, to ſome French Men, who were coming towards the Shoar, having before waved his Hat, and halloed towards them; and that he turned his Mare looſe and a Grey-hound that followed him; which were afterwards found upon the Shoar. This Witneſs ſwore poſitively that he ſaw him do all this, and that he was the ſame Man that went into the Boat; and that it made up to the neareſt Ship.</p>
            <p>There was a ſecond Evidence called, who declared, after being ſworn, That he was upon the Watch, on the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> laſt, over againſt the Body of the French Fleet, where they ſaw a ſmall Man of War put out a Long-Boat, making towards the Shoar; whilſt they were gone to give Intelligence of it, the Boat had taken in the Priſoner, and his Grey-hound lay upon the Sea Shoar, and the Mare was looſe, which he and three more Men took up and carried to <hi>Lidd:</hi> And that he knew the Mare to be <hi>Croſs</hi>'s Mare, and the Dog to be his alſo: And that the Mare had lately been in the Water, for that ſhe was wet; and was ready bridled and ſadled: And when they came to <hi>Croſs</hi>'s Houſe, he was not at home, his Servant telling them, That his Maſter rode out upon the Mare that Morning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Witneſs, being ſworn, depoſed to the ſame effect, confirming the Truth of what the former had declared, as to the Boat coming aſhoar, and the Mare and Dog being found looſe, after the Priſoner was gone on Board the French Ships: And that he ſaw the Boat come exactly from the Fleet: As alſo that the Mare and Dog were <hi>Croſs</hi>'s own Goods: And that he rid out upon the Mare that Morning: And that the Boat came within a Muſquet Shot of the Shoar, and went directly to the French Fleet.</p>
            <p>There were others that ſwore to the ſame effect as the former, ſo ſhall give no further account of them, but proceed to another, which indeed was one of the moſt material to bring the Matter home upon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner: Who being ſworn for the King, depoſed,</p>
            <p>That he was informed by ſome who were on the Top of the Steeple, That they ſaw the Boat coming from the Fleet aſhoar, and a Man landed about twelve a Clock at Noon, on the ſaid <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>July;</hi> and afterwards arming himſelf, he raiſed the Town, and coming to the Sea-ſide he found it to be <hi>Godfry Croſs,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar; whom he toook at ſome Rods Diſtance from the Shoar, and ſaid to him; <hi>Neighbour</hi> Croſs <hi>is not this a ſhameful thing of you, to go a Board of an Enemy? Did you go to give Intellence how our Town ſtood effected? Or did you go to carry Letters?</hi> Upon which the Priſoner gave him very abuſive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſaid, <hi>You one eyed Dog, what have you to do?</hi> &amp;c. After which he was ſeized and and carried to <hi>Lidd,</hi> and examined by the Bayliff, not denying the Matter charged againſt him: Nor that he had not been on Board the Fleet; but complained that he had loſt his Mare. Which was confirmed alſo by another Witneſs, that help'd to apprehend him; and that he had given a Crown to the Boatmen that ſet him <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Shoar; and that he had been a Board three or four Veſſels of the French Fleet.</p>
            <p>There were two other Evidence, who gave account of his Examination, and that he did own to have been on Board the French Fleet: And that he had brought two Letters from on Board the French Admiral, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Sir <hi>William Jennings,</hi> which were found about him: The firſt was directed to one Mr. <hi>Bryant Bowles</hi> of <hi>Deal,</hi> the other to one Mr. <hi>Thomas Tedman</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Dover;</hi> dated on Board the French Admiral, and ſigned by Sir <hi>William Jennings:</hi> The Contents of them were both to the ſame purport, <hi>viz. To invite any of their Majeſties Subjects to come on Board the Fleet; and if they did, they ſhould have liberty to go back, for they came not to hurt any Perſon, but to protect all Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to puniſh Rebellious ones: For that the Fleet was as much the King of</hi> England<hi>'s as ever it was the French King's,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Priſoner being ask'd, What he had to ſay in his Defence againſt ſo home a Charge, anſwered, That he had but little to ſay; but that he had always been a true Proteſtant, and a Church of <hi>England-</hi>Man, (as he himſelf termed it) and never did nor intended any harm to any one: And that he had done no dammage, ſo was willing to ſubmit to the Judgment of the Court. Although when he was apprehended he pretended that he rode into the Water to look after ſome Boards that were floating there; and the Men in the Boat asked him to drink a Drachm, which he did: And after two of the Men forced him off his Horſe into the Boat; but was looked upon as a feigned Excuſe.</p>
            <p>But in the Concluſion a further Proof was brought againſt him, which was omitted through Inadvertency, <hi>viz.</hi> That when he was on Board the French Admiral, Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi> asked him, In what Poſture the Nation was? to which he, the Priſoner replyed, That for the Town, they had affrighted moſt of the People out of it; and the reſt were making provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for themſelves: Or Words to the like effect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King's Councel, after this, made ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the hainouſneſs of the Crime, and that his going on Board to the King's Enemies Fleet, and giving them Intelligence, was a manifeſt Token of his adhering to them, ſo conſequently muſt be found High Treaſon, although the Court ſeemed to be of the contrary Opinion at the firſt, and that it was but a Miſdemeanour: But after the Councel had pleaded it further, the Lord Chief Juſtice ſumm'd up the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in a particular and diſtinct Manner, to the Gentlemen of the Jury, telling them, That if they did believe that he went voluntarily on Board, and did bring thoſe Letters from Sir <hi>William Jennings;</hi> and that they were to perſwade Men to forſake their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; and to endeavour to reſtore the late King; and to aſſiſt all thoſe that were for the Late King: Then they muſt find him Guilty. But if he did this ignorantly, and not to ſeduce the King's Subjects from their Allegiance, then they muſt find him Not Guilty. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which the Jury withdrew for the ſpace of about a quarter of an Hour, and returning they brought him Guilty of High-Treaſon.</p>
