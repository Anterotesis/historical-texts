            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>NOTES ON <hi>DRYDEN</hi>'s VIRGIL. In a Letter to a Friend.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen the late Translation of <hi>Virgil</hi> first appear'd in Public, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd my Thoughts of it: The Task was not ingrateful; for tho I never had any great Opinion of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Performances of <hi>that kind,</hi> yet I had so great a Respect for <hi>Virgil,</hi> as made every thing which might endenizen <hi>him,</hi> acceptable to me: I set therefore upon reading the <hi>Translation</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and cast my <hi>Observations</hi> on it into Writing: But meeting with many <hi>Avocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> of which you are not ignorant, I have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55478:3"/>
had since no Leisure to look over or compleat them. Being at last Master of a little, I send them you; of what Weight they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to <hi>the Few,</hi> Time will shew.</p>
            <p>And here, in the first place, I must needs own <hi>Iacob Tonson</hi>'s Ingenuity to be greater than the <hi>Translator's,</hi> who, in the <hi>Inscription</hi> of his fine Gay in the Front of the Book, calls it very honestly <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Virgil,</hi> to let the Reader know, that this is not <hi>that Virgil</hi> so much admired in the <hi>Augustaean Age,</hi> an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor whom Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> once thought <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>translatable,</hi> but a <hi>Virgil</hi> of another Stamp, of a courser Allay; a silly, impertinent, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical <hi>Writer,</hi> of a various and uncertain Style, a meer <hi>Alexander Ross,</hi> or some body inferiour to him; who could never have been known again in the Translation, if the <hi>Name of Virgil</hi> had not been bestow'd upon him in <hi>large Characters</hi> in the <hi>Frontispiece</hi> and in the <hi>Running Title.</hi> Indeed, there's scarce the <hi>Magni Nominis Umbra</hi> to be met with in this Translation, which being fairly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Iacob,</hi> he needs add no more, but <hi>Si Populus vult decipi decipiatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> himself, after some little <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>litations</hi> and odd <hi>Complements</hi> bestow'd on my <hi>Lord Clifford</hi> and the <hi>E. of Chesterfield,</hi> shews his <hi>Triarii,</hi> and in a large Battle, with a Front of extraordinary <hi>Length,</hi> but not very <hi>Deep,</hi> in his Address to my <hi>Lord Marquis of Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>; Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> knew he had to do with a <hi>Critic of the First Rate</hi> in that Noble Lord;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55478:3"/>
That he perfectly understood the <hi>Author, and his Translation,</hi> and therefore try'd to tyre him so with a very familiar indeed, but te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and confus'd Epistle, as might, if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, prevent his looking more nicely into the Translation: and doubtless if that <hi>Noble Lord</hi> had patience to read over such <hi>a Volume of Impertinence,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> might justly give him leave to damn all the <hi>rest of the Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may perhaps be worth the while to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine that Epistle a little, to see what Thoughts Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in it has of his <hi>own Performances, and the Intellectuals of others</hi>; tho a Man must be very carefull of his Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, since a dreadfully barbarous, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural <hi>Postscript</hi> lyes behind in <hi>Ambuscade,</hi> and Heaven knows how many <hi>little Scribblers</hi> have fallen into the Hands of those <hi>merciless Monsters,</hi> to the perpetual Terror of such <hi>unthinking presumptuous Creatures.</hi> However I'le March as warily as I can, and being forewarn'd, may be perhaps forearm'd too, till I have gone through what I design'd, and you expected from me.</p>
            <p>After some Discourse of <hi>the Nature of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic Poem,</hi> He tells us, as he says, from <hi>Bossu,</hi> That <hi>Statius had a mind to try his Strength with Virgil on a particular Subject,</hi> as Funeral Games, <hi>as Virgil had with Homer</hi>: I have not <hi>Boss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> by me, but if he talks so, he mistakes. <hi>Statius</hi> never pretended to come up to <hi>Virgil,</hi> much less to <hi>Wrestle a Fall with him in Heroics. Tu ne Divinum Aeneida tenta, sed longe sequere,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55478:4"/>
&amp; vestigia semper adora,</hi> was more agreeable to his Modesty. He might <hi>imitate Virgil</hi> without incurring the Name of <hi>that Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus of a Poet,</hi> which perhaps, may pass for a <hi>fine Thought,</hi> but indeed is <hi>Nonsence</hi>; nothing but <hi>Lightning</hi> could hinder <hi>Capaneus</hi> from <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring Thebes</hi> in spight of all their Gods. Pray what hindred <hi>Statius</hi> from mateing <hi>Virgil?</hi> And <hi>Virgil</hi> can scarce be said to <hi>borrow</hi> any thing from <hi>Homer</hi> in this case, since <hi>his Games</hi> were of another Nature as 'twas fit they should have been, only <hi>his</hi> were <hi>Funeral Games</hi> as well as <hi>those of Homer,</hi> and might have been so, tho he had never read the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians Poems.</p>
            <p>After a long Story about the <hi>Epic and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Poem,</hi> especially the <hi>Tragedy,</hi> He closes his Paragraph, with a Character of his own <hi>Tragedies,</hi> tho he introduces it with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on <hi>the Lord Orrery,</hi> what ever that is, the rest is true on certain Experience. <hi>We can believe Achilles or Aeneas routed Armies in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or Virgil. But, Ne Hercules contra duos in the Drama.</hi> This is <hi>coming to Confession</hi> for <hi>Almanzor.</hi> Afterwards He tells some more Truths of <hi>Himself,</hi> such as may perhaps make him a <hi>Hero,</hi> but of <hi>no perfect Virtue</hi>; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>He's a Native of Parnassus, and bred up in the Study of its Fundamental Laws.</hi> Now if I'm not mistaken <hi>those</hi> are <hi>Monarchical,</hi> but Mr. <hi>D</hi>— since he received Mr. <hi>M—es</hi> stamp is of another <hi>Clan,</hi> a mere <hi>Renegado</hi> from <hi>Monarchy, Poetry, and good Sense.</hi> But let <hi>him</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55478:4"/>
praise <hi>himself,</hi> while we wonder at <hi>his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> and conclude with himself, That <hi>All are not Heroic Poets,</hi> I add, Nor fit to Translate them, <hi>who have assum'd that lofty Title in Antient or Modern Ages, or have been so esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their partial or ignorant Admirers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are not to be rank'd among the</hi> three <hi>whom I have nam'd,</hi> This passage is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what obscure, for whether he means <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Tasso,</hi> or <hi>Tasso, Spencer,</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> or speaks of <hi>three</hi> where he had nam'd but <hi>two,</hi> only to <hi>burlesque Scripture,</hi> may be disputed. But why was not Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> nam'd as well as <hi>Spencer,</hi> or <hi>Milton,</hi> since <hi>Spencer</hi>'s <hi>Fairy Queen</hi> is no more finish'd than Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s <hi>Davideis,</hi> I know those who have <hi>little</hi> of <hi>their own,</hi> condemn the <hi>Superfluity</hi> of <hi>his Wit,</hi> the Reason is <hi>their Unhappiness,</hi> not <hi>His? Those who have Wit may use it, and those who want it may be Angry</hi>: But I'd sooner yield to my <hi>Lord Bishop of Rochester's</hi> Character of that Beginning of the <hi>Davideis,</hi> That <hi>It's a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instance and beginning of a Divine Poem than he had ever yet seen in any Language,</hi> than submit to the Censorious Ignorance of our latter Scriblers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Poet cannot speak too plain on the Stage</hi>— I'm afraid then a great many fine words in the <hi>Conquest of Granada,</hi> must be lost, such as <hi>Vivarambla, Mirador, Escapade</hi> &amp;c. which may create some difficulties to <hi>Unhispanioliz'd Readers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55478:5"/>That the <hi>Moral of the Aeneis is less Noble than that of the Ilias,</hi> I know no Reason to grant, That <hi>union</hi> among <hi>Confederates,</hi> or <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle States,</hi> is necessary for the their <hi>support,</hi> and for their <hi>compassing any great or generous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,</hi> is a great Truth, and made good by the <hi>Ilias,</hi> is own'd, That <hi>Piety to the Gods, Reverence to Parents, exact Iustice, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Valour</hi> are necessary and effectual to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Men thro Difficulties, and <hi>as Noble a Truth</hi> and as clearly made out by the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> and is its <hi>great Moral</hi> must be own'd too. That the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> from thence should make an Inference, <hi>That they could not be happier than by a quiet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Conduct and Government of a Prince in whom all these Qualifications met,</hi> was reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; it was what the Poet design'd, and what <hi>Augustus</hi> might have cause to value the Poem for, and, supposing it the <hi>great Moral,</hi> How comes <hi>Obedience to an excellent Prince</hi> to be a requisite inferior to that of <hi>Unity among little Confederates</hi>? Why should it be less Noble in an <hi>Englishman</hi> to be <hi>Loyal and Faithful to William the</hi> III. than for the <hi>seven Provinces</hi> to be true to their <hi>Uniting Leagues,</hi> in Opposition to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or the <hi>Princes of Germany</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Monarch of France</hi>?

               <hi>With what a whirling force his Lance he tost.</hi> Did ever any one talk so before? <hi>Tossing</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates no extraordinary Violence in a thing which is aim'd at a Mark, as a Lance is in Battel; <hi>Tossing in a Blanket,</hi> which the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator deserves, indeed is somewhat a <hi>violent Motion</hi> upward, but downward it's very <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> as honest <hi>Sanco</hi> would have inform'd him; <hi>Tossing</hi> and <hi>Hurling,</hi> are very different, one infers Force and Rapidity, the other only a looser and more careless Impulse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heavens what a Spring was in his Arm to throw!</hi> Is too <hi>Philosophical</hi> for an old <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian General,</hi> and no way fit for a <hi>grave, old Prince,</hi> to say the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of another, nor is it in <hi>Virgil.</hi>

            <p>Spencer, <hi>and</hi> Milton <hi>are nearest in English to</hi> Virgil, <hi>and</hi> Horace <hi>in the Latine.</hi> But which of them resembles <hi>Horace? Spencer</hi> aim'd at an <hi>Heroic Poem,</hi> and so did <hi>Milton,</hi> (tho neither of 'em with that <hi>success</hi> which might have been wish'd) but <hi>Horace</hi> never attempted such a thing as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves before; unless either of them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for that <hi>Curiosa Felicitas,</hi> formerly admir'd in <hi>Horace</hi>; but Mr. <hi>D.</hi> knows his own meaning well enough, tho I don't.</p>

               <hi>My chief Ambition is to please those</hi> Readers, <hi>who have discernment enough to prefer</hi> Virgil <hi>before any other</hi> Poet <hi>in the</hi> Latin Tongue. The <hi>Ambition</hi> was <hi>good,</hi> but never did any

               <hi>The Mob Readers are but a sort of</hi> French Huguenots, <hi>or</hi> Dutch Boors.

               <hi>I shall not be wholly without Praise, if in some sort I may be allowed,</hi> &amp;c.

Whether <hi>Homer</hi> ever left any such is more than Mr. <hi>D.</hi> knows; He had an <hi>Aristarchus</hi> to perfect and correct what <hi>He</hi> thought needed it, and who was fit for the <hi>Work</hi> he undertook. None durst pretend to the same for <hi>Virgil</hi>; he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no Sense, and he had no Equal.

               <hi>Text is not Scripture</hi>; but if it were, his Church has such <hi>Guides</hi> as have more than once adventured upon that <hi>Anathema,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> a true <hi>Republican,</hi> Son of a <hi>Monarchical Church,</hi> has imitated them, having given his <hi>Author.

            <p>After the great <hi>Encomiums</hi> of his <hi>clawing Friends,</hi> enter Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> himself in his, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, <hi>Immortal Strain</hi>; whose Performance, whether it answers their <hi>Hyperboles</hi> or not, is the Subject of our next Enquiry.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed to a <hi>Critical Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Translation,</hi> it may be fit to lay down some <hi>Axioms,</hi> as we suppose they will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, with respect to the <hi>necessary Qualifications</hi> of <hi>him</hi> who undertakes to <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize a good Poet,</hi> and to make him <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> to the <hi>unlearned</hi> Reader.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's necessary the <hi>Translator</hi> should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Author</hi> he undertakes and be acquainted, in some measure, with the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms</hi> and <hi>Usages</hi> of that <hi>Country,</hi> which the <hi>Original</hi> more particularly respects.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's necessary he should have a <hi>right taste</hi> of the <hi>Poets Genius and Character,</hi> so as to endeavour to write as <hi>chastly</hi> and <hi>purely,</hi> in as <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>noble a Stile</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi>; where he's <hi>lax</hi> and <hi>profuse,</hi> to indulge himself in a <hi>greater Liberty</hi>; where he's <hi>concise and short,</hi> to keep within the <hi>same Bounds</hi>; where he's <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>Majestick,</hi> not to be <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling</hi>; or where he's <hi>low</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> not to <hi>stalk in Buskins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Translator</hi> should be able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish exactly between the <hi>Low,</hi> the <hi>Mean,</hi> and the <hi>Sublime Stile,</hi> and adapt the <hi>Language
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55478:26"/>
he translates into,</hi> to all the <hi>varieties</hi> observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the <hi>Original.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It's necessary he should give us the <hi>true Sence and meaning of his Author,</hi> if he knows it, that he who understands not the <hi>Original,</hi> may be sure yet that he knows the <hi>Author's Mind,</hi> has <hi>his</hi> true <hi>genuine Thoughts,</hi> and not the <hi>Interpolations</hi> of another. That especially where the <hi>Author</hi> says <hi>neither too little, nor too much,</hi> the <hi>Interpreter</hi> should neither <hi>clip his Sterling,</hi> nor give it <hi>worthless Bulk and Weight</hi> with the Additional <hi>Alloy</hi> of his own <hi>base Metal.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="5">5. He should make his <hi>Author</hi> speak so in a <hi>Modern Language,</hi> as he could reasonably conclude he would have spoken if <hi>now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>writing on the same Subjects,</hi> and <hi>maintaining the same Characters</hi> he had taken up before.</p>
            <p>These seem to be <hi>undeniably necessary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications</hi> in a <hi>good Translator</hi>; how our <hi>Author</hi> has observ'd 'em may be doubted; but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by the <hi>smaller,</hi> which are innumerable, we shall only animadvert on his more <hi>notorious</hi> and <hi>indefensible</hi> Errors.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>VIrgil</hi>'s Georgics, are call'd by Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, The best Poem of the best Poet.</hi> Of his own <hi>performance,</hi> he says in <hi>this</hi> what's true of all the <hi>rest, I have too much injur'd my great Author,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist. to Earl of</hi> Chester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</note> 
                  <hi>I would have Translated him, but fear, according to the literal</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Italian <hi>Phrases I have traduced him</hi>: and this <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment</hi> is true, for never was <hi>Poet</hi> so abus'd, nor <hi>Mankind</hi> so impos'd on, by a <hi>Name</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Virgil</hi> I know, is not the <hi>easiest Author</hi> in the World to Interpret; But <hi>Veteranes in Poetry,</hi> at least, should have <hi>sence</hi> enough to know —<hi>Quid valeant humeri, quid ferre recusent:</hi> A <hi>Camel,</hi> they say, will take no more, when he finds his <hi>Burden</hi> sufficient for his Strength:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55478:54"/>
But there's another Beast which crouches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all, without Reluctance. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> may Plead <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi> and <hi>many a sorry Meal,</hi> to excuse his Attempt; but his <hi>Belly</hi> here, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Magister Artis,</hi> nor <hi>Ingenij largitor,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it forc'd him, <hi>negatas sequi voces.</hi> And <hi>Etsi dolosi spes refulserit nummi,</hi> the Man must be <hi>too weak,</hi> who, with respect to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Translator, Cantare credat Pegaseium me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los.</hi> But methinks, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is soon weary of his humble Talk, and for ought I know, may desire to be understood so, <hi>That the Glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Ephraim,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> in comparison with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>will surpass the Vintage of Abiezer.</hi> I hope, he means not that <hi>the Produce of his more than fumbling Age is more valuable, than the vigorous Writings of others, in their unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Years</hi>; that would grate too hard upon Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Con.</hi> the <hi>former</hi> of which, has us'd the World better in his <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Manilius,</hi> than ever Mr. <hi>D.</hi> could in his <hi>best Translations</hi>; but he means, this <hi>Performance</hi> of his <hi>old Age,</hi> is to be preferr'd before the <hi>volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous trifles</hi> of his <hi>greener Years.</hi> Now, I must confess, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> was never the <hi>Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> of my <hi>Iudgment,</hi> there appear'd always somewhat <hi>forc'd</hi> and <hi>unnatural</hi> to me in his <hi>finest Pieces,</hi> which his own extravagantly <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious,</hi> and injudicious <hi>Humour</hi> render'd the more notorious; but this <hi>Virgil</hi> is far the <hi>worst</hi> of all, a Poem neither <hi>tolerable</hi> when Read <hi>alone,</hi> nor when compar'd with what he calls, or few would believe, was the <hi>Original</hi>; but this will
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55478:54"/>
be more apparent afterwards. I'm some what concern'd to see Mr. <hi>D.</hi> still Railing at the <hi>Court,</hi> what, tho he lost the <hi>Laurel</hi>; Must it follow, that the <hi>Court</hi>'s a place of <hi>Forgetfulness,</hi> at the best, for <hi>well-deservers?</hi> Have not his own <hi>Morals</hi> been a little infected with that <hi>Air,</hi> as he represents it? Or is <hi>Good Life now his task</hi> indeed?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> I'm afraid, however he might be <hi>first cheated</hi> himself, it's no <hi>extraordinary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral accomplishment,</hi> to endeavour to recover <hi>his losses,</hi> by <hi>learning to cheat others.</hi> But can a <hi>good, unchang'd Catholick</hi> talk of <hi>losing a Maiden-head in a Cloyster</hi>? Is he relapsing to the <hi>Spanish Fryar? Constancy</hi> then, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the <hi>Motto</hi> of his Arms. It's an odd Complement to his <hi>Patron,</hi> That <hi>God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd good Sense on his Lordship, but he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd good Learning upon himself.</hi> I thought, <hi>Learning</hi> always came from the same <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Hand,</hi> who gives the <hi>Sense and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension. What has any Man which he has not receiv'd?</hi> It's very hard, that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> should represent his <hi>Patron</hi> less Religious than <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>; who thankfully acknowledges <hi>to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, the Assistance he had given him in the Beginning, the Prosecution, and Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his present Studies</hi>; which, therefore I conclude, he thinks, <hi>more happily perform'd, than he could have promis'd to himself.</hi> But this <hi>Rapture,</hi> perhaps, was soon after <hi>Saul</hi> had seen <hi>the Vision,</hi> and therefore ought to be past over.</p>

                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:55478:55"/>The <hi>Essay on Georgics,</hi> it seems, is not Mr. D's, yet, whoever was the <hi>Author,</hi> since by appearing before his <hi>Work,</hi> he lays himself open to the <hi>Reader's censures</hi>; he must not take it ill, if I among others, presume to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what I think an Error in't, such is the <hi>definition</hi> of a <hi>Georgic. A Georgic is some part of the Science of Husbandry, put into a pleasing dress, and set off with all the Beauties and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishmeuts of Poetry.</hi> Now this is a good Account of the <hi>Georgic,</hi> as already Written by <hi>Hesiod</hi> or <hi>Virgil,</hi> because they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Georgics in Verse,</hi> and set 'em off with <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Beauties.</hi> But a <hi>true Georgic,</hi> that is, <hi>an exact Art of Husbandry,</hi> might be as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in <hi>Prose,</hi> and without any <hi>Ornament,</hi> as the <hi>Moral Rules</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or <hi>Epictetus</hi>; and <hi>Varro</hi> wrote <hi>Georgics</hi> as <hi>truely,</hi> tho not so <hi>pleasantly</hi> as <hi>Virgil.</hi>
