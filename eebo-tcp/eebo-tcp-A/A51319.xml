            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Believe thou wilt wonder at the preposterous Order of my publishing these Two <hi>Dialogues</hi> before the Three first have seen the Light; and indeed, it may be, most of all, why I publish them at all. If it were a matter of ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible <hi>Political Interest,</hi> or the Solution of some <hi>Algebraicall Probleme,</hi> or the Discovery of some quaint Experiment towards the perfecting of <hi>Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106935:3"/>
or the Decision of some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Point in <hi>Polemicall Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> Reason would that we should accept of your Performance, and have the patience to peruse it. But to draw out a long tiresome Story of the Kingdome of God and Fate of the Church, through I know not how many dark Types and obscure Aenigmaticall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, where we can fix no sure footing in any thing, <hi>Quis leget haec?</hi>— The <hi>Gallio's</hi> of this Age care for no such things.</p>
            <p>Well, admit the case to stand so, Reader, as thou suggestest; yet this could be no just Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to either the Writing or Publishing these <hi>Dialogues.</hi> For every genuine Minister of the Kingdome of God has a commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb facs="tcp:106935:3"/>
to <hi>preach in season and out of season.</hi>

And for the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Aenigmaticall Obscurity</hi> of the Types and Prophecies, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of this Authour has been that they should cease to be so any longer; which I believe they do to them that look upon them with an impartial eye, and are duely prepared to receive the
<pb facs="tcp:106935:4"/>
Sense of them. For some Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may hinder them from see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing; as they say it is in the looking into the <hi>Magick Crystall</hi> or <hi>Shew-stone;</hi> Two loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into the same <hi>Crystall,</hi> but differently prepar'd or predispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the one sees clearly a Scene of things to come, the other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Which though it be strange in that case, yet it seems far stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this of the Prophecies, the main things aimed at being of as clear Solution, the <hi>Postulata</hi> admitted, (that is to say, the truth of History and the Sense of the Prophetick style, though no farther then the Scripture it self interprets it) as any Probleme in <hi>Algebra.</hi> As will certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the intelligent from
<pb facs="tcp:106935:4"/>
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mede</hi>'s <hi>Synchronisms,</hi> and the eight last Chapters of the first Book of <hi>Synopsis Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> And admit but that <hi>Joint-Exposition</hi> of these two Chapters of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> the thirteenth and seventeenth, there will be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Controversie of the Solution of the rest. And still the less upon the Perusall of these <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi> which give light into the whole <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and so take away that Excuse from some that pretend they cannot safely promise themselves they understand any part, unless they understand all.</p>
            <p>This, Reader, is in return to thy false Surmize, as if the whole <hi>Dialogues</hi> were stuffed with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the recitall of <hi>dark Prophecies:</hi> Whenas, besides
<pb facs="tcp:106935:5"/>
plain <hi>History,</hi> there are many use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>moral Passages.</hi> As that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of regaining a due <hi>Divine temper of Body,</hi> which consists in a more aethereal Purity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that we may possess our Vessell in a right measure of Sanctity and Holiness, that it may be more meet to receive and retain Divine Truths. As also the means of arriving to that state which is the <hi>Kingdome of God within us.</hi> Which though it be not a matter of <hi>Politicall</hi> or <hi>Secular</hi> Interest, yet it is so palpable an Interest of every man, as, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, there should no man be such a <hi>Gallio</hi> as to slight it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he think it an indifferent thing whether he be damned or saved. But believe it, if any one
<pb facs="tcp:106935:5"/>
have really attained to the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God within</hi> him, it is then impossible that he should be unconcerned for the <hi>Kingdome of God without</hi> him, he being so certainly united with that Spirit, the Eternall Minde that superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Affairs of the Vniverse, and of his own peculiar Kingdome and People in a more special manner. He that has lost the sense of his own carnal and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Concerns is naturally, as I may so speak, seised upon and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the Spirit of God, and all his Affections of Love and Care and solicitous Foresight are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with the Interest of that Communialty of which he is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Member under one Head <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106935:6"/>And therefore as it is supposed by the Poet that it was a great satisfaction to <hi>Aeneas</hi> to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>Anchises</hi> concerning the Fate and Success of his Family and Posterity, their glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements and the Largeness of their Empire, that they should

               </q>
so likewise they that once have got into a real Cognation and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Consanguinity with the true Apostolick Church, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving derived upon them or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into them from their Head that Divine Spirit that actuates the whole Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a transcendent Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to them to understand the overspreading Glory and Success
<pb facs="tcp:106935:6"/>
which the Family of God, of which they are part, I mean the true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Church, will have in the World before the Consummation of all things. Which illustrious Scene of Futurities, though they neither descend with <hi>Aeneas</hi> to get a view of them amongst the Shades be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nor with S. <hi>John</hi> have the Heavens open upon them from above to exhibit those Celestiall Visions, yet they, casting the pure eyes of their Minde upon the <hi>Scripture,</hi> see all those glorious Futurities, writ in Heaven, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflected to them from the Books of the Prophets, (as we see the Sky and Clouds, the Moon and Stars, by looking on some River or Pool) to their ineffable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and satisfaction. Which
<pb facs="tcp:106935:7"/>
may excuse this Authour's so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious a Ramble (as it may seem to some) through so many dark Types and Prophecies, to finde out this future Glory of the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> upon Earth. For these are the proper Ioys and Entertainments of those Souls who, being dead to all Self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, finde it the solace of their heart to behold the flourishing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and growing Prosperity of the People of God.</p>
            <p>I must confess that the Authour of these <hi>Dialogues</hi> interprets Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies at an high rate of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the behalf of Reformed Christendome against their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Adversaries: Which may seem to some the more wild and Ecsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, the Discourse having been
<pb facs="tcp:106935:7"/>
drawn up in such Circumstance of Affairs as every one conceived to bode ill to the Reformed Party. And how busie and successfull the <hi>Romanists</hi> have been this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age in proselyting people to their Church, there is none but must take notice of from either Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience or common Fame. But this could not discourage the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour from receiving those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truths which were so clearly reflected to him from the pure and infallible Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. Which he steddily fixing his eyes on, did not at all regard the ill-boding aspect of the Affairs of the World. For he that has not a due measure of <hi>Faith in God</hi> and <hi>Fortitude of Spirit</hi> can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be Prophet,<note place="margin">More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voch. part <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>38.</hi>

of the Prophets.</p>
            <p>I know the good news will not be alike acceptable to all nor alike credible, but that very well-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning people may be prone to imitate that of <hi>Abraham,</hi>

            <p>Nor can I divine what Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars may any ways disgust any one that is Christianly affected, unless the <hi>Behmenists, Cartesians</hi> and <hi>Platonists</hi> may fansie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not so civilly dealt withall. <hi>The first,</hi> because their great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, <hi>Jacob Behmen,</hi> though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a pious and well-meaning Writer, and not unusefull for the exciting of the Sentiments
<pb facs="tcp:106935:9"/>
of sincere Piety in others, is not allow'd to be such an inspired Man, as that all that he dictates should go for infallible Oracles. But it being so discernible to the intelligent that he is an <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast,</hi> there is no faithfull Minister of the Kingdome of God will ever stick to declare it, for fear of that great Dis-interest that would be done to Religion, if those that are the most zealous Well-willers thereto should not discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be of so sound a minde, as not to be imposed upon by the highest Heats and strongest Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises or Confidences of any man's Melancholy, whenas the Prophaner wits are so prone to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that there is no Religion but is such.</p>
            <p>The <hi>other two</hi> may haply be
<pb facs="tcp:106935:10"/>
offended at the Writer of these <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogues</hi> for introducing <hi>Cupho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron,</hi> who sustains the person of both a <hi>Cartesian</hi> and <hi>Platonist</hi> at once, so unsettled and fickle and unconcerned in the great Points of Christian Religion, as if <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesianism</hi> and <hi>Platonism</hi> did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily incline men to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound temper of minde. Which I am confident is not the opinion of the Authour of the <hi>Dialogues:</hi> But being aware how some Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems in those Philosophies may easily fill up and swell those Souls that are more aiery-minded, and how this Anticipatory Self-fulness, join'd, forsooth, with the affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a strict Mathematicall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for every thing, (such as <hi>Cartesius</hi> pretends to, but falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely short of almost every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb facs="tcp:106935:10"/>
in his Philosophy) he being aware, I say, that this may raise a <hi>Genius</hi> (in this Philosophicall Age) over-wanton and coy, and such as will keep aloof off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so heartily concerned in the Apostolick Truths of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as they ought, his foresightful Solicitude in the behalf of the Kingdome of God, and for the preventing the growth or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any such mischievous Monster, stirred him up thus timely to set out the Contemptible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Ridiculousness of that Dispensation, that it may never have the Confidence to appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage to the destruction of Souls and detriment of the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> So that how-ever harsh this may seem to some, yet it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent preventive Physick, and
<pb facs="tcp:106935:11"/>
the sound and judicious must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the purpose of him that administers it to be sober and laudable. Thus well fitted every way are these <hi>Dialogues</hi> to serve the <hi>Spiritual Interest</hi> of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>And lastly, for that <hi>Interest,</hi> Reader, which thou callest <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi> they have their Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness in that regard also. As to instance in some few Passages for many. One of the Principles whereby Reformed Christendome is represented as reducible to this excellent State we speak of is a <hi>sincere and unspotted Loyalty in the Protestants to their Lawful Sovereigns.</hi> Another, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing or Allowing of that chearfull and effectual Doctrine for promoting a good Life, I mean
<pb facs="tcp:106935:11"/>
that of <hi>A Faith in the Power of the Spirit of</hi> Christ <hi>for a signal vanquishing and subduing all manner of Sin in us,</hi> such as Pride, Covetousness, Revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and the like. For there is nothing that can tend more to the publick Peace then this. The conscience of Religion in its crude and raw estate is a thing very harsh and bitter (especially in an hot Complexion) both to it self and others, like the state of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> in Children, which makes them wrangling and froward and vexatious both to themselves and the whole house. And for want of this Doctrine I speak of, few or none of the seriously-Religious can well emerge out of this childish condition. Whence the World is full of wrangling and vexation
<pb facs="tcp:106935:12"/>
even about the pettiest Points of Religion that are. Whereby mens minds must needs be exulcerated, and the Government disturbed, and the Safety of the Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded. Which would not at all be if this wholesome searching Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine had but place in the hearts of men. For it would so ripen their growth in Christianity, that all their Harshness and Sourness would soon mellow into Christian Love and Sweetness. For believe it, there is nothing more civil, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more humane, nothing more gentle and governable, then a mature and well-grown Christian. Again, in the Description of the Character of the <hi>Elias</hi> to come, a main Note of him is, that he is <hi>a Reconciler of the Magistrate to the People, and of the People to
<pb facs="tcp:106935:12"/>
the Magistrate;</hi> that he is for Peace and Vnion in the Church of God, and a declarer against Rents and Schisms. And lastly, that great Point of all, <hi>That the Pope with his Clergie is that Antichrist,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church that City out of which God's People are bid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, as it is most certainly true in it self, and of huge Consequence to be known upon the account of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Interest, so does it most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly also consolidate the Secular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of all Protestant Princes and People against the Pretensions of the Pope, and is a safe <hi>Cynosura</hi> to steer their Counsels by. For I dare appeal even to the Pontificians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, upon supposition that the Pope and his Clergie be Antichrist, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>Babylon</hi> out of which God's people are bid to
<pb facs="tcp:106935:13"/>
depart, whether any thing in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell that makes towards the reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's people nearer to that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ensnaring them again in their former Captivity, can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseable for any Protestant Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate either upon point of Piety or Policy, or (supposing a God in Heaven) can promise any prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Success. Wherefore for any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Subject so persuaded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal so important a Truth, would be the greatest Perfidiousness, even to his Terrestriall Sovereign, as any man can stand guilty of.</p>
            <p>These, I think, were sufficient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for the publishing these <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues.</hi> But for the preposterous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in publishing them, the plainest account is the will of the Authour: of which no worse Construction ought to be made, then that, as it seems,
<pb facs="tcp:106935:13"/>
he has a greater Concern for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Christianity then for the Curiosities of Philosophy. For such is the Subject of the three first Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues: Which, had he had as great a propension to gratifie the Curious as to edifie the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> he would not have failed to have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished at least as soon as these; the matter of them being both Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall, as I said, and that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most enticing Points in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and also intermixt with much Pleasantry and Humour; which, by reason of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gravity of this present Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it was thought fit, I suppose, the more strictly to abstain from.</p>
            <p>But though I have no commission to publish the three first Dialogues themselves, yet I thought fit, for the more punctually understanding these
<pb facs="tcp:106935:14"/>
two last, to publish the Arguments of those, they being sufficient for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding any References or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions on <hi>them</hi> occurring in <hi>these.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, Reader, I have added, for thy farther Entertainment, by way of Appendage, (though not altogether so necessary, I confess, yet sutable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to some Points in these <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi> if not to the whole Design) <hi>A brief Discourse of the true Grounds of the Certainty of Faith in Points of Religion;</hi> as also some few <hi>plain Songs</hi> or <hi>Divine Hymns</hi> on the chiefest <hi>Holy-days</hi> in the Christian Kalendar, agreeable enough with these <hi>Divine Dialogues</hi> both in Purpose and Title. Wherein the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them has observed always this Method, to adde to the <hi>Historicall Narration</hi> an <hi>Application to the Emprovement of Life.</hi> Which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:106935:14"/>
in Verse or Prose, if it were dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently observed in the handling of the Historicall Articles of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, would be of so great force for the making men good, that I doubt not but <hi>Philotheus,</hi> had he thought of it, would have added this as a ninth Instruction tending to the Acceleration of those happy Times of the Church which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages.</p>
            <p>These, Reader, if thou pleasest candidly to accept for the present, it will be the greater Obligation to the Authour to let what still remains in his hands in due time see the Light, and be as willing to condescend to gratifie the Philosophicall <hi>Genius</hi> in those three first Dialogues, as he has been in these ambitious to edifie the Religious.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106935:16"/>
the due understanding of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Kingdome. For if there be no God nor any Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, there can be no Kingdome of God upon Earth, as <hi>Hylobares</hi> well noted at first.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106935:17"/>
Points of Christian Religion, so far forth as the Scripture has declared them. So that that of Christianity, which hung more loosely and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly in my mind before, methinks I have now imbibed into the very centre of my heart and soul, and do without all hesitancy close with the truth thereof.

of his dominion. Bless the Lord, O my Soul.</hi> This in the 103. Psalm. And in the 148.

Thou hast laid the foundation of the Earth, and it abideth; they continue this day according to thy ordinance: for all things serve thee.</hi> Whence it is plain that the Dominion of God and his Kingdome reaches as far as the whole comprehension of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>

                  <p>Methinks it sounds very od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and besides, we may conceive a subordination betwixt the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome of Nature</hi>; but the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome of the Devil</hi> seem to be in utter opposition one to another, and therefore in no capacity of being parts of the same Kingdome.</p>

                  <p>That is wittily urged, O <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phophron,</hi> as to the exteriour sound of the words; but look into the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall nature of things, and set the Beasts of the field and the Devils of Hell one by another, and tell me the difference that uncapacitates the one from being the members of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God more then the other. Is it because the Devils have more subtiltie then the Beasts of the field? This were reprochfully to intimate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106935:24"/>
the Kingdome of God to be a City of Fools. Is it because the one is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, the other Corporeal? This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would also exclude the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the choicest part of God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Is it because the Devils are lapsed? Yet their Lapse is but into the <hi>Animal life,</hi> whose deepest root and fountain is <hi>Self-love</hi> or <hi>Selfishness,</hi> which stands in opposition to that other fountain or root of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> which is the <hi>pure Love of God,</hi> or of that which is simply and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Good. But Self-love or Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness is equally the Root of Life in Brutes as in Devils.

                  <p>The difference, O <hi>Bathynous,</hi> seems to be this, That the Brutes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the integrity of their nature, but the Devils have degenerated from their first condition, and forsook their station God had placed them in.</p>

                  <p>I confess, O <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> that the Lapse of the fallen Angels

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>That's a thing, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> I could yet never understand, that the most omnipotent Power that is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable can ever have a right to doe what is wrong, that is to say, to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate any evil that is truly so upon the full compute of all circumstances, or in the entire comprehension of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106935:27"/>
whole Oeconomy of the Universe, No <hi>Power,</hi> though never so <hi>omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> can claim a right to such an act, no more then any <hi>Intellect,</hi> never so <hi>omniscient,</hi> can claim a right of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentickly thinking that true which is really false.</p>
                  <p>But in answer to your main questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein the Right of this abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sovereignty in God is founded, I must tell you both distinctly and compendiously at once, That to <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, permanent</hi> and <hi>immutable Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of right belongs as well <hi>Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> as <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> the one as her <hi>Secretary,</hi> the other as her <hi>Satellitium.</hi> But the <hi>infinitely-good God</hi> is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>of right,</hi> but <hi>by nature,</hi> both <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent.</hi> And from these three, his infinite <hi>Goodness, Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> issue out all the Orders of the Creation in the whole Universe. So that all the Creatures being his, and his Goodness being so perfect, immutable and permanent, as never out of any humour, (as I may so speak) vacillancy, or supine
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106935:27"/>
indifferency, to be carried otherwise then to what is the best, and his Wisedome never at a loss to discern, nor his Power to execute it; we see the clearest foundation imaginable of the <hi>Right</hi> of that <hi>absolute Sovereignty</hi> we acknowledge in God. For is there not all reason, that he that is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably Good, that it is repugnant that he should ever will any thing but what is absolutely for the best, should have a full right of acting merely according to the suggestions and sentiments of his own minde, it being impossible but that they should be for the best, he having propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable <hi>Wisedome</hi> also and <hi>Power</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to this infinite <hi>Goodness,</hi> to contrive and execute his holy, just and benign designs?</p>

                  <p>In my apprehension, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus,</hi> this is marvellously plain, and such as I wanted no instruction in. And therefore let me intreat you to draw nearer to the main point in hand, which is the Kingdome of God properly so called. For, methinks,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106935:28"/>
we have done hitherto, as if some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a design to observe more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly some one Kingdome in the Map of the World, suppose <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> should forget their intended purpose, and lose time in taking a vagary through all <hi>Europe</hi> at least, if not all the four quarters of the World. I desire, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what that Kingdome of God is that is amongst <hi>Men,</hi> being less cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious touching that part of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion that he exercises over <hi>Angels,</hi> whether lapsed or unlapsed, or that Power he exserts upon the Kingdome of Nature, whether Animals or Plants or other inferiour creatures. <hi>Quae supranos nihil ad nos:</hi> and there is in some sense the like reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those <hi>things below us.</hi> I desire my prospect may be enlarged onely towards those things that are on the same levell with my self: which I press the more earnestly, because of the streightness of the time I fear we shall be cast into.</p>

                  <p>O no, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> there is no sameness at all betwixt this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Stoicks</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome of God.</hi> For this Kingdome of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> is the Kingdome of <hi>Selfishness,</hi> and <hi>Self-love</hi> sways the Sceptre there and wears the Diademe: But in the Kingdome of God, God himself, who is that pure, free, and perfectly-<hi>unselfed Love,</hi> has the full dominion of the Soul, and the ordering and rule of all the Passions. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing to consider how multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farious the Impostures and false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions to this <hi>inward Kingdome</hi> are discovered to be by those that are really possessed thereof; how one Passion (as suppose <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness</hi>) subdues all the rest unto it self, and rules in stead of the <hi>Divine Love</hi>; how <hi>all the Passions</hi> are brought into a demure subjection to the sense of some <hi>externall Interest,</hi> especially if it bear the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Sacred</hi> or <hi>Holy</hi>; and how men may be disciplin'd or educated thereto, as Setting-dogs for the Game, whenas the Soul in such a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106935:29"/>
case has subdued all her affections, onely to surrender her self a more absolute slave to the will of those men whose business it is to bring the World into blinde obedience (by studied Impostures and Hypocrisies) to such Laws as are made for their carnal Interest, and, in stead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Kingdome of God, to plant the Kingdome of the Devil or Antichrist amongst men. Let the Soul in such cases as these have never so great a command over her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, this is no <hi>Kingdome of God,</hi> but a presumptuous and tyrannical Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of some petty Masters against the Right of his Kingdome.

The most effectual means in the general is intimated up and down in the Gospels by our Blessed Saviour. As where he compares the Kingdome of Heaven to <hi>a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure hid in the field,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 13.44, 45.</note> and to a <hi>single Pearl of great price,</hi> for which one <hi>sells all that he has to purchase it</hi>; and where he tells us that the <hi>Kingdome of God suffers violence,</hi>

signifie thus much to us, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever would acquire so excellent a state of the Soul as this which we call the Kingdome of God, he must forthwith quit all things else what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever that stand in competition with it; That he must with all imaginable earnestness of spirit and with a kind of holy violence reach at it, and endeavour the taking of it through all dangers, hardships and resistences whatsoever, as he that would scale the walls of a City to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Crown; and, lastly, That this pursuit be without any intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or lazy relapses into the power of the World or the Flesh again, but that it be peremptory, constant and continued, till we have wone the prize, and finde all that fulfilled in us which we desired or expected; which is the perfect subduing of all our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and the establishing of the Reign of the true <hi>Melchizedek</hi> in us, the <hi>living Righteousness</hi> of God, and the replenishing of our hearts with purity, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>

                  <p>Truth lies in a little room, especially that of it that is most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, O <hi>Philopolis.</hi> And therefore I will trouble you with no farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions then what are comprized in these few Principles. As first, That we have a firm and unshaken Faith in the Power of God, and in the assistence of the Spirit of the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> for the subduing all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Pride, Lust, all Worldliness and Selfishness, and what-ever is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Kingdome of God in us, that we may have a comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest over these and all like corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions through him that strengthens us. This is the first necessary Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we ought to be imbued with, if we mean seriously to set our selves to the atchieving so great and weighty an enterprise: This, I say, is the first necessary Principle, namely, <hi>A full and firm belief that the Atchievement
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106935:32"/>
is possible.</hi> The second is, That we believe it to be our duty to arrive to this blessed state, and not to satisfie our selves with any condition on this side of it, much less, out of any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian Sophistrie or Witchcraft, to phansie our selves released from all obligation to any real and living Righteousness in us; but to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely obedient to the voice of Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Truth,<note place="margin">Matt. 5.48.</note> 
                     <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>; and to remember, that it was the end of <hi>Christ</hi>'s coming into the world,<note place="margin">Matt. 15.13.</note> 
                     <hi>to pluck up every plant that was not of his Father's planting,</hi> and to raise such a seed upon earth as <hi>have neither spot nor wrinkle,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.27.</note> 
                     <hi>nor any such thing, but are holy and without blemish.</hi> If either of these two Principles be wanting, the defect will be notorious in the success. For who can with any courage attempt such difficulties as he thinks either impossible to be overmastered, or not his duty to grapple with. Wherefore being sound in these, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> he must
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106935:32"/>
adde <hi>Meditation, Circumspection,</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> Meditation in private e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially. Circumspection in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with externall objects, whether men or things, that he be not carried away unawares against those rules and resolutions he made to himself in private, but ever stand upon his guard; and if he be assaulted with any temptation, to call to Heaven for succour, and to trust in the strength of God against the surprize. Which I think is the true meaning of <hi>praying continually.</hi> But in a more particular manner, to adde to your private Meditation the fervency of Devotion, and earnestly to beg of God, that he would every day more and more discover to you the ugli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sin, and the amiableness of Righteousness, and that your hatred may be more keenly edged against the one, and your love more highly inflamed towards the other; that the work of the Heart may go on, and not those umbratile skirmishes of the Brain in Phancie and exteriour Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106935:33"/>
but that we may effectually feel the difference of the contrary actings of the <hi>Powers</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome of Light</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome of Darkness,</hi> charging one another in the field, <hi>Life</hi> against <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> against <hi>substance,</hi> till Hell and Death be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorpt into victory, and the evil Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be quite consumed into a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flame of Love and Triumph. These all are the Mysteries of the <hi>Heart,</hi> O <hi>Philopolis,</hi> not of the <hi>Head,</hi> which, in comparison, is but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Shop of Phancies and fine Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; but the transactions of <hi>substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial life</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> are in that other part, which is the <hi>secret Tabernacle of God,</hi> and hidden <hi>Temple</hi> for most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Prayer. For the <hi>Heart</hi> is the <hi>proper Pavilion</hi> of either the <hi>spirit of the World,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which kindles there the holy desire and thirst after Righteousness: Which vehement, sincere and cordial desire, the true gift and fruit of the Spirit, is the very <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>substance of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and a certain <hi>Divine Magick,</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:106935:33"/>

to doe with either the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> or <hi>Moses,</hi> and yet believed One onely true God, the Authour and Governour of the Universe, and were singularly good and vertuous in their conversations? were they any part of the Kingdome of God?</p>

                  <p>That the Philosophers had nothing to doe with <hi>Moses,</hi> and that their wisedome derived not it self from that fountain, is more then I dare averr.

                  <p>If you think so favourably of them, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> for my part I cannot be of so sour and severe a temper as to grudge them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. In the mean while I am not onely satisfied touching the so timely commencement of the Kingdome of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106935:36"/>
God or the Church, but of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of it to the coming of <hi>Christ</hi>; which answers to the second part of my second Quere, <hi>Where it has been to be found since its beginning.</hi> And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God had his Church so time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seems to be intimated by that timely Martyrdome begun in it in the Murther of <hi>Abel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 23.35.</note> from whose <hi>righteous bloud Christ</hi> seems to begin the <hi>Martyrology</hi> in his commination to that murtherous City, the carnal <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

                  <p>This is notably well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of <hi>Philopolis,</hi> O <hi>Philotheus,</hi> and puts me in minde of something a dark passage in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may receive light from hence, namely,<note place="margin">Apoc. 13.8.</note> there where it is said, That <hi>all would worship the Beast whose names are not written in the Book of life of the Lamb slain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world,</hi> that is, <hi>à mundo condito.</hi> Which passage, I conceive, alludes to the murthering of <hi>Abel,</hi> it being so early an example of the wicked martyring the good. And
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106935:37"/>
therefore by the Lamb is here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, according to the <hi>Prophetick style,</hi> the whole succession of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones or elect of God, spotless in life and invincible in their patience, no persecution being able to subdue their minds to evil, or to make them violate their Consciences. For there is no deceiving or overcoming the <hi>Elect,</hi> whose Names are written in the Book of Life: which Book is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Book of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> or of the <hi>Elect</hi> of God, because their names are enrolled there; and this Lamb said to be slain from the foundation of the world, because the example of the wicked murthering the innocent and just began so early in <hi>Cain</hi>'s mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of his brother <hi>Abel.</hi> But to understand by the <hi>Lamb slain</hi> from the foundation of the world, the <hi>Lamb that was to be slain,</hi> is so bold an abuse of all Grammar and Logick, that I must confess, till this consideration came into my minde, the Text seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me to be of a desperate obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; unless we should have taken the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106935:37"/>
liberty to understand by this slaying of the <hi>Lamb</hi> in the ordinary sense, (that is, of <hi>Christ,</hi>) the murthering of <hi>his members,</hi> of which the earliest example is this of <hi>Abel:</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> you know,<note place="margin">Acts 9.4.</note> cried out to <hi>Saul, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> when he onely persecuted his Members.</p>

                  <p>O <hi>Bathynous,</hi> how kindly could I embrace thee for the great ease and pleasure thou hast done me in this Notion!

                  <p>You are to understand, O <hi>Philopolis,</hi> that the Kingdome of God in the New Testament signifies vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. Sometimes <hi>Physically,</hi> as I may so speak, and is the same with that externall happiness we hope to enjoy in Heaven: sometimes <hi>Morally,</hi> as where it is said to consist in <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> and sometimes <hi>Politically</hi>; in which sense also I conceive it to be understood in all those places you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And it is that very <hi>Kingdome</hi> upon Earth which <hi>Daniel</hi> foretells of,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.44.</note> and is also the <hi>Kingdome of Christ</hi> or of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and is likewise styled the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> even in a <hi>Politicall</hi> sense, as where it is compared to a Net, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106935:41"/>
elsewhere. This Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> is the Kingdome of God in a more eminent and illustrious signification, not onely for its <hi>holiness,</hi> but also for the <hi>vast extent</hi> thereof, according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Idiom: For at long run it is to take in all the Kingdoms of the Earth. But there is a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occasion of the styling of it the Kingdome of God, from that passage in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 2.44.</note> 
                     <hi>And in the days of those Kings shall the God of Heaven set up a Kingdome which shall never be destroy'd.</hi> From hence the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Christ</hi> is called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, and of God. Now this great and notable Kingdome of <hi>the Son of man</hi> or the <hi>Messias</hi> was not present in our Saviour's days, though it was in a near approch. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Disciples might very well be taught to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdome come</hi>; and our Saviour preach, that <hi>the Kingdome of God was at hand</hi>; and encourage his little flock, his few Followers, in that at last the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire would fall into their hands,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106935:41"/>
as it did under <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, when <hi>Christianity</hi> became the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Empire. But in that he saith,<note place="margin">Mar. 1.15.</note> 
                     <hi>The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdome of God is at hand</hi>; that undoubtedly relates to the Seventy weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> which were upon their expiration about that time that <hi>Christ</hi> preached the Gospel of the Kingdome, that is, a little before his Suffering.<note place="margin">ver. 25, 26.</note> For <hi>after seven weeks</hi> and <hi>threescore and two weeks</hi> (that is, sixty nine weeks) the <hi>Messias</hi> was to be <hi>cut off,</hi> and the people of the <hi>Iews</hi> cease to be God's people any longer under the <hi>Mosaicall</hi> Dispensation, and the <hi>everlasting Righteousness,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 24.</note> or the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law or Religion of <hi>Christ,</hi> to be <hi>brought in,</hi> and the <hi>Iudaicall</hi> Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to cease, the Son of God being once made an Oblation upon the Cross for the sins of the whole world. This is the Inchoation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God so much spoken of in the Gospel, which though it was at first but <hi>as a grain of mustard-seed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 13.31.</note> yet in a little time spred far and wide in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106935:42"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and was at last made Master thereof. For I must confess I understand that Parable of the Mustard-tree in a Politicall sense, not in a Moral, and compare that which our Saviour adds by way of illustration of its greatness <hi>(so that the birds of the air lodge in the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es thereof)</hi> with that propheticall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>'s Kingdome is also resembled to a wide-spreading Tree,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.12.</note> 
                     <hi>(The Beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the Fowls of the Heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof.)</hi> And thus was <hi>Christ</hi>'s promise made good to his <hi>little flock,</hi> to whom he had declared that it was his <hi>Father's good pleasure to give</hi> them <hi>the Kingdome.</hi>

                  <p>This is handsome, and to me not unsatisfactory, O <hi>Philotheus,</hi> so far as it goes. But did not the Church of God both in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time and after pray, <hi>Thy Kingdome come?</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106935:42"/>
to pray, in the <hi>Moral</hi> sense, either for our selves or others; but hitherto it has been also seasonable in the <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi> For though the Church (where uncorrupted with Idolatry and other gross Pollutions) has been the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God ever since it had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether in prosperity or persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet it has been hitherto but <hi>Regnum Lapidis,</hi> not <hi>Regnum Montis</hi>; and therefore in a Politicall sense they might ever pray that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> That <hi>the stone cut out without hands might smite the Image upon the feet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 2.34, 35, 44.</note> 
                     <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a great Mountain, and fill the whole Earth, and be a Kingdome that shall stand for ever,</hi> a Kingdome of God's setting up that shall never be destroyed, that is to say, shall never relapse into Idolatrous practices, nor be under their lash and subjection that do. No power shall be able to persecute them for the purity of their Religion. For it is the Kingdome of God triumphant and permanent that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106935:43"/>
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> seems chiefly to point at, as if that short stay of the Seventh King mentioned in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> were scarce worth noting in these more compendious Visions.<note place="margin">Apoc. 17.10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which seeming omission in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Statue is more palpably repeated again in the Vision of the Four beasts. For though the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Son of man was in the Reign of the Seventh King in a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant state; yet because it was so short and unpermanent, the Prophecy seems to take no express notice of it, but to begin the Inauguration of the Son of man into his Kingdome upon the destruction of the little Horn, which destruction is not yet complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. When,<note place="margin">Dan. 7.21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>because of the great words the Horn spake, the Beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame,</hi> namely, <hi>the Beast with this little Horn with eyes in it,</hi> (which little Horn is more fully and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represented in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the figure of the Two-horned Beast,) then <hi>Daniel saw in the night-Vision,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106935:43"/>
and behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of Heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him: And there was given him Dominion and Glory and a Kingdome, that all people and Nations and languages should serve him. His Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, which shall not pass away, and his Kingdome that which shall not be destroyed</hi>; which therefore is not so properly the Kingdome of God under the Seventh King, but that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Saints which emerges upon the Beast that is not, and yet is, his going into perdition.

                  <p>And there is good reason to conclude so: both because the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the Externall Kingdome
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106935:46"/>
of God above given agrees to them, namely, that <hi>they worship the One and onely-true God, and have purified his Worship from all Idolatrous practices and corruptions,</hi> and have so far cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be that murtherous City that stoned the Prophets, that they use no other sword then that of the Spirit against Idolaters themselves, whom they never kill, but either in the open field in battel, or upon the account of Treason against their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince; and also because (God be thanked) they are free from any yoke but that of <hi>Christ</hi> and their own Reformed Princes. And therefore being a self-sufficient Power, able to maintain themselves against all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous and Idolatrous Powers, these of them that are in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition seem to me to be an hopefull Inchoation of that promised King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Son of man which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> foretells of, and to be the first Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi>; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they arise out of the ruine of the little Horn <hi>with the eyes of a</hi>

For the way to Salvation was now discovered not to be those manifold formal postures which the <hi>Roman</hi> Tutours put their Novices into, nor hard Penances, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Penances (the main scope of the Discipline of that Church) into pecuniary Mulcts, for the amassing and heaping together an immense treasure of money: but every one was admonished with sad and solemn preparation to frequent the Divine Ordinance, the powerful preaching of the Gospel, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the stupendious <hi>Arcana</hi> of God's free Election and eternall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and not to reckon upon the Certainty of Salvation from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the devised Institutes of the Church, which drove mainly at the dominion of the Priest, and the suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the purses of the people; but to make their Calling and Election sure, that is to say, to discover the certainty thereof by the inward fruits of the Spirit, by Faith especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, (whereby they firmly believed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106935:53"/>
that they were of the number of God's Elect) and from thence by Love also to God and to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; all which they conceived wrought in them, not for any thing that they could doe or had done by way of Merit, but merely by the free Spirit of Grace effectually ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in their hearts.

For indeed I have a great suspicion of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> whose names are most illustrious in the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they were abettors or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citers of Sedition and Rebellion.</p>

                  <p>I shall declare the truth freely and impartially to you, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phophron,</hi> touching these persons, and by the manifest injuries done to them you may judge of the rest. As
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106935:55"/>
for <hi>Luther,</hi> he was so far from being an exciter or abettor of Rebellion against Secular Princes, that he wrote a Treatise to exhort every Soul to be subject to the higher Powers, and was himself a very severe and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practiser of his own Doctrine. For at that Confederacy of defensive arms at <hi>Smalcald,</hi> which the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> declaim against as such an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rebellion, (though it was not,) <hi>Luther</hi> was very shy and averse from giving his Assent thereto, till he was throughly instructed by the learned in the Law touching the Constitution of the Empire of <hi>Germany.</hi> For by the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> as I may so call it, of the Empire, the Princes of the Empire are invested in such Rights, as, if they be violated by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, it is lawfull for them to take arms and resist <hi>sine Rebellionis aut In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitatis crimine.</hi> And the skilfull in the Law abundantly satisfied <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> that the Emperour had violated these Rights.</p>

                  <p>The truth is, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:106935:56"/>
since the Empire was made Elective, and a perpetuall Power established in the Seven Electours, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Authority in many parts of <hi>Germany</hi> became little more then ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular, and an empty Honour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Power; they that elect him ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a right also to depose him for Mal-administration of the Affairs of the Empire. The Electours and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes of the Empire govern their own Principalities without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to the Emperour but Homage; and the Imperial Cities are most free from the Imperial Laws. Must every appearing in arms then against the Emperour be presently Rebellion?</p>

                  <p>And now for <hi>Calvin</hi>; the Charge of Rebellion upon him is, that he expelled the Bishop of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> who was the chief Magistrate of that City, and changed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into an <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> and so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106935:56"/>
on Reformation and Rebellion at once. Is not this that which you mean, <hi>Cuphophron?</hi>

                  <speaker>Euist.</speaker>
                  <p>But this is a mere Calumnie against <hi>Iohn Calvin,</hi> and without all ground. For not so much as that is true, that <hi>Calvin</hi> was one of the first Planters of the Reformation at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> and much less, that he or any other Reformers expelled the Bishop out of the City. It was <hi>Farrell, Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Viret,</hi> that by their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted <hi>Geneva</hi> in the Bishop's absence, who fled away eight months before, being hated by the Citizens for the Rape of a Virgin and many Adulteries with their Wives: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also in fear of his life for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to oppress the Liberties of the City, for which his Secretary was hang'd. But those that changed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were strong Papists, and after main opposers of the Reformation.</p>

                  <speaker>Euist.</speaker>
                  <p>That's another gross mistake, <hi>Cuphophron.</hi> For the Reformation was establish'd in <hi>Zurick</hi> at least ten years sooner by Edict of the Senate upon the peaceable preaching of the Gospel there; and the <hi>Switzers</hi> had shaken off the yoke of the Empire two hundred years before. So little ground is there of accusing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation there of Rebellion.</p>

                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>But as loud a noise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion as ever sounded in my ears, begun in reference to Reformation, is that of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> shaking off the yoke of the King of <hi>Spain:</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:106935:57"/>
this sounds as high as that of <hi>Luther.</hi>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Euist.</speaker>
                  <p>And is as loud a Falshood. For the Reformed Religion was spred over the Seventeen Provinces many years before their union against the <hi>Spaniard</hi>; nor did they unite upon the account of Religion, but of State, for the maintaining their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties against the Oppression of <hi>Spain.</hi> And therefore they chose for their Prince <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Alenzon</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, which they had not done if the Protestants had been the greater part. Nor was the King of <hi>Spain</hi> their <hi>absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> but their <hi>Count.</hi> So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Reformation was the Brat of this Union, nor this Union more by the Protestants then by the Papists, nor less justifiable afterwards, in that they held it in the behalf of the true Religion also as well as of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and would not submit to one that was not their absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, to have their Souls murthered by a false Religion, or else their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by adhering to the true.</p>

                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>I did not think, <hi>Euistor,</hi> that these Aspersions could have been so easily wiped out. There's but one Instance more occurrs to my mind, and that is of the Boisterousness and Rebelliousness of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Reformation. If i be not mistaken, I have heard a very ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that Nation in this point.</p>

                  <p>That's very likely, <hi>Cupho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron,</hi> nor are they any way to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, nor the Reformation to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of what appertains not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to its spirit, but is peculiar to the spirit of that Nation. For before the Reformed Religion, the <hi>Scots</hi> of an hundred and five Kings (which they reckon till Queen <hi>Mary</hi>) had killed thirty five, besides five which they had expelled, and three which they had deposed.</p>

                  <p>And the like consideration is to be had of whatever unlawfull Risings of the Protestants there may have been in <hi>France.</hi> It is not to be

imputed to their Religion, but to the <hi>Genius</hi> of that Nation, who are so easily and so often drawn into Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and where that crime is look'd so slightly upon, as a Country-man of their own has ingeniously noted of them, and has impartially drawn into view such things and circumstances as give good light how to estimate the measure of their transgression in this matter. Which I would recommend to your reading, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to be so great a lover of Truth and Vertue. For the Authour has wrote very pertinently to satisfie you that the Reformation no-where owes its birth to Rebellion, and that the doctrine of Rebellion upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense of Religion is universally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded by the publick Confessions of all the Protestant Churches, but both professed and practised by the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Title of the Book is, <hi>A vindication of the Sincerity of the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the point of Obedience to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.</hi>

                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>Very good, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> I thank you for your information. I shall enquire for the Book, and at first leisure from my Philosophicall Speculations I shall give my self the satisfaction of perusing it. In the mean time therefore I shall give you onely this one trouble touching a point which cannot be denied by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istor,</hi> nor any Historian of them all. Did not the first Reformers rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Sovereignty of the Pope?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>O no, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted or cast off the pretended Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the Pope; but that was not to rebell, but to repell a wicked Usurpation. For first, that <hi>Christ</hi> never constituted the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> the Successour of <hi>Peter</hi> and his infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Vicar-general of Christendome appears, in that there is no such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the ancient Fathers, nor any such timely appeal to this Bishop's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, nor any such thing recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Scripture; which had been such an high Point, that, if it had been true, it could never have been left
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106935:59"/>
out. Nay, on the contrary, it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth against this pretense: for <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> doth plainly declare himself inferiour to none of the Apostles.<note place="margin">Chap. 1. and 2.</note> And though <hi>Peter</hi> was present, yet <hi>Iames</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly preside in the Council at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> Besides that the Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision was the Diocese of <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi>'s the Circumcision, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was the less Circuit of the two. Not to adde how <hi>Paul</hi> withstood <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi>; which suits ill with <hi>Peter</hi>'s Superiority, as <hi>Peter</hi>'s being at <hi>Antioch</hi> as well as at <hi>Rome</hi> with the Superiority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him of <hi>Antioch.</hi> For that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Antioch</hi> is out of question; but whether <hi>Peter</hi> was ever at <hi>Rome</hi> is still questionable among the Learned. And lastly, if <hi>Peter</hi> was so much taller by the head and shoulders then the rest of the Apostles, why did he <hi>give the right hand of fellowship</hi> to <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then again in the second place, No secular Sovereign can forfeit his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106935:60"/>
Sovereignty to any Spiritual preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Superiority or Superintendency, unless we admit that Principle of <hi>Wickleffianism, Dominium fundatur in gratia,</hi> which the <hi>Iesuites</hi> themselves so loudly hoot at when they please, and is unfeignedly to be hooted at by every one that has an honest and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart.</p>

                  <p>You say right, <hi>Bathynous:</hi> But so be it protect but my Sovereign safe from all injuries, I am none of them that shall envy the overplus of good it may doe in behalf of Subjects, that any-where may be thought to fall short of that grace of Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that others pretend to have, when indeed they are wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with gross Errours, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions, and Idolatries.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly and lastly, Suppose his Holiness of <hi>Rome</hi> had once a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106935:60"/>
over all the Churches of Christendome <hi>in ordine ad Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> (which is the onely plea that can with any colour be pretended) when his spiritual wares are so infinitely poisoned and corupted, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he requires obedience to is as gross as any Pagan-Idolatry, (as most certainly <hi>Romanism</hi> is) he does most assuredly lose his right of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Command in Spirituals, unless he has a right to command us to disobey God and <hi>Christ,</hi> whose Vicar he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be; and losing his right of Spiritual Sovereignty, the Temporal Appendages thereto appertaining must likewise fall with it. This, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, must seem very clear to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial eye.</p>

                  <p>It must so, <hi>Philopolis</hi>; and yet I will cast in a fourth Argument of undeniable evidence to them that understand it.

whom it is said,<note place="margin">Apoc. 18.4.</note> 
                     <hi>And I heard another voice from Heaven saying, Come out of her, my people, that you partake not of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues.</hi>

                  <p>I am so far from desiring that, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> that I am rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of it, and therefore debarr it; as also the troubling your self much with setting out the success of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Affairs while their Polity

held. For these things are to be seen orderly in the Bible, and are so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, that we should lose our main design by entring into them. That their Captivities were fore-threatned by reason of their sins at good distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and their Return predicted, is ordinarily known. For fear time fail us, let us intreat you, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> to confine your discourse to such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and Observations onely as concern the Kingdome of God set on foot by the Son of God, the Lord <hi>Christ.</hi>

                  <p>Such as the Prophecie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which I last mentioned: In which that long Captivity of the Ten Tribes seems to be involved. For <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Prophecie pitches upon that Tribe that was to continue till the coming of the <hi>Messias.</hi>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>That's a plain Indication that <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Prophecies touching his sons were not uttered at randome.</p>

                  <p>I know they do.

                  <p>Take that upon my credit, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> the Application is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous easie and natural, and such as can have no corrival, as I understand from <note n="*" place="margin">See Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>More</hi>'s Mystery of Godliness, Book 7. chap. 4.</note> a late Explication of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>

was the presence of the Emperours at <hi>Rome</hi> that hindred the Bishop from discovering his <hi>Luciferian</hi> Ambition, and from shewing himself to be the first-born of all the sons of Pride.</p>

                  <p>This is very consonant to the sense of the Fathers, who took the <gap reason="foreign">

But this receding of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> to <hi>Byzantium</hi> is but the first beginning of the completion of this passage of the Prediction touching the removall of that out of the way that hindred the visible growth of Antichrist, supposing the Pope to be him. It was the Inundation of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> that did more effectually second his design. For <hi>Italy</hi> being overrun by these, though there were for a time also Western Emperours, yet they ended in <hi>Augustulus,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> became the sole Seat of the Imperial Majesty: Which being
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106935:79"/>
raised to an extraordinary magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, was so agreeable to them, that after, when the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Emperours ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cared to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> but ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Exarchs</hi> placed at <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who sent meaner Governours under the title of <hi>Dukes</hi> to reside at <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore the meanness of this <hi>Secular Power</hi> there made the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> shine forth with the more uncheck'd luster, and gain an awe and reverence from the people to the Episcopal See, and so the more easily prepare them for future Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Things standing in this case, in come the <hi>Lombards</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> whose design being wholly to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess themselves of the Countrey, they destroy'd the Emperour's power as much as they could. In which jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Affairs the Pope had a fine opportunity to play his Cards to his own advantage. For the Emperour having so potent an Enemie in <hi>Italy,</hi> the cunning Bishop knew how to serve his own turn of them both.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106935:80"/>
For he would fence himself from any due chastisements from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for what-ever Insolency he might commit, by help of the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi>; and defend himself and the City of <hi>Rome</hi> from any violence of the <hi>Lombard,</hi> if he ever assaulted it, by the Aids of the Emperour. So that while he abused both their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to his own advantage, by the help of the <hi>French</hi> he at last made himself Master of both as to the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Territories, he by this means emerging there into a higher power then either. And lastly, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the Emperour (when once that bone of Contention was cast betwixt them) being ever the strengthening of the Pope, it is manifest that the Incursion and overflowing of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> on the East part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as well as of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> on the West, was a farther help towards his unjust Usurpations. For the Eastern Empire being so weakened, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> could the more secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly settle themselves in the West:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106935:80"/>
who, being a rude and unlearned peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were the more pliable to the Pope's Instructions, whose Renown, by reason of the City, being far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any other, as also his Power and Interest in Western Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, these raw Proselytes were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu'd with such Principles in their Conversion to Christianity as were most conducive to the advancement of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that we see every way how that the <hi>discerption</hi> and <hi>dissipation</hi> of the Power of the Empire by the Invasion of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made for the Pope's lifting up himself into that conspicuous Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and more visible Insolency af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards over Kings and Emperours, opposing himself against and <hi>exalting himself above all that is called God,</hi> or is worshipped; as Interpreters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that Prophecy.</p>

                  <p>O, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> a very good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretence. <hi>Leo Isaurus</hi> was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope as an <hi>Heretick,</hi> foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he was against the <hi>Adoration of Images.</hi> The losse therefore of the <hi>Roman Dutchy</hi> was his imposed Mulct or Penalty for that hainous Crime.</p>

                  <p>You mean, whether he that is fit to rule, or he that is lawful Heir and actually possest of the Crown, is to be King.</p>

                  <p>The case is much like that propounded to <hi>Cyrus</hi> (when he was a little boy) by his Master, who taking two Coats from two Lads, the lesser of whom had the longer, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the shorter coat, gave them both to <hi>Cyrus</hi> to dispose of to them again,

                  <p>Just thus did Pope <hi>Zacharie</hi> solve the Probleme proposed to him, giving the Crown to him that was accounted more fit to wear it, not to him whose due it was by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

corner-stone upon which the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Sovereignty of the Pope was afterward so highly raised.

                  <p>Very strange ones, <hi>Cupho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron,</hi> and so many, that, if I should discourse till Cock-crowing, the time would not suffice to declare the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold odd exploits of these pretended Successours of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter. Gregory</hi> the fifth, with the Emperour his Kinsman <hi>Otho</hi> the third, contrived away the Right of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their own Prince, by settling the perpetual power of electing the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in seven <hi>German</hi> Electours; provided onely, that he that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by these <hi>German</hi> Electours should not be called Emperour or <hi>Augustus,</hi> but <hi>Caesar</hi> or <hi>King of the Romans,</hi> till he was crowned by the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>: so that the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Pope by this device both depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the City of <hi>Rome</hi> of their right of chusing their own Sovereign, and also transferr'd it partly upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and partly on the <hi>German</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in such a way as was mainly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106935:85"/>
intended for his own Interest, the Power of the Emperour being thus weakened, that himself at any time might the easilier make head against and insult over him. Some impute this contrivance to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth, or <hi>Alexander</hi> the third his Successour. But be it whose it will, the Policy of it is conspicuous.</p>

                  <p>I, and very roaring and rampant creatures too. For such the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth found Pope <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> alias <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh; who having deposed the Emperour, and excommunicated him, conferr'd the Empire upon <hi>Rudolphus</hi> Duke of <hi>Suevia:</hi> but he being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Emperour in battel, at his seeing his hand cut off his heart was also smitten with the sense of his Disloyaltie against his Sovereign, and rebuked the Bishops for their wicked Instigation of him to take arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him to whom with an Oath of Fidelity he had lift up his hand to God.</p>

                  <p>But to satisfie <hi>Cuphophron</hi>'s curiosity a little more palpably. If the Pope exalt his own throne above the Throne of <hi>Christ,</hi> does he not manifestly exalt himself above God in the grossest manner one can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine or expect?</p>

I am so little versed in History my self, that I desire to hear you farther on that Subject. For these things seem of that hideous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence in setting all Christendome on broils, that methinks the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> should very rarely venture on such exploits.</p>

                  <p>How the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are minded in this point, that one Clause in the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi> will inform you at once, viz. <hi>That God hath made the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>Prince over all people and all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106935:89"/>
to pluck up, destroy, scatter, consume, plant, and build.</hi> He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this Charter from God: And I'll assure you, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> he has not spared to make use of the Privilege as often as he had but any hopes that it would serve his worldly Interest. For after Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> had given that outragious example upon the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, both <hi>Vrban</hi> and <hi>Paschal</hi> followed that wicked Precedent against the same person, and with such hideous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances as I above intimated. And after this, many examples of like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency succeeded. <hi>Calixtus</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond excommunicated <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth; <hi>Alexander</hi> the third <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the first, as I told you before. <hi>Innocent</hi> the third excommunicated and deposed <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and gave his Kingdome to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi>: as <hi>Celestine</hi> the third gave the Kingdome of both the <hi>Sicilies</hi> from <hi>Tancred</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the sixth. But for <hi>Henry</hi> the third King of <hi>England,</hi> never was any

man's Superstition so basely abused as his. His fear and Superstition kept him indeed from incurring Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; but his Submission was such as was below the condition of the vilest person, or the pettiest and most contemptible School-boy.</p>

                  <p>You shall judge of it, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phophron,</hi> your self. The fear of the Pope and the awe of Superstition debased the King so far, as that so soon as he was within the sight of the Cathedral of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where that Martyr and Saint <hi>Thomas a Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kett</hi> lay, whom the King was accused to have slain by an angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he put off his shoes, as if all the ground at that distance had been holy, and in the form of a poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, bare-foot and bare-legged, and bare-bodied too, (saving a vile Coat cast about him) passed through the City in the sight of the people in this
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106935:90"/>

                  <p>The same Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third excommunicated also the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Otho</hi> the fourth, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him of the Titles of the Empire.

For the Emperour being gone into <hi>Palaestine</hi> upon the Pope's own errand, yet he takes this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of anathematizing of him, and, by his Preaching Friars, of raising him enemies in <hi>Germany,</hi> that, taking the advantage of the Emperour's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and those Combustions, he might with better success send an Armie into <hi>Apulia,</hi> and seize there on his Land.

                  <p>I believe the King spoke truth, and declared but the Right of all the Secular Princes of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> as well as his own. But did not that <hi>Vejovis</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> shatter him all a-pieces with his Thunderbolts?</p>

                  <p>No such matter, <hi>Cuphophron; Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you. Philip the Fair</hi> held his own, and made such friends in <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Pope was surprised at <hi>Anagnia,</hi> and disgracefully mounted on a poor Jade was brought Prisoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> no man rescuing this terrible Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, either out of fear or love: but Pride and Regret taking vengeance
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106935:92"/>
of him burst his swollen heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few daies, and thus ingloriously he died; his Successour <hi>Benedict</hi> the eleventh not onely absolving <hi>Philip,</hi> but highly complementing him. For the Popes use to fawn on those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whom they cannot bite without manifest danger of breaking their Fangs. But to proceed: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Ludovicus Bavarus</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the twenty third, and deprived of his Empire: which Sentence was also renew'd by his Successour <hi>Benedict</hi> the twelfth; but so vehemently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by <hi>Clement</hi> the sixth, that the Electours were at last prevail'd with to chuse a new Emperour.</p>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>That was <hi>Charles,</hi> Son to <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; which was the occasion of great and bloudy Wars. But what is most observable, the Election of this Emperour was the very breaking of the back of the Empire, <hi>Charles</hi> pawning the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the Empire to the Electours, and swearing also that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106935:93"/>
disengage that Pawn. Moreover he made that authentick Capitulation with them, whereby, without the crime of Rebellion or Disloyalty, they were enabled to take up Arms against the Emperour and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours in defence of their own Rights. This huge weakning of the Empire had the strong working Policy of the Popes at length brought about, they ever phansying that the bringing down of the Power of the Emperour was an exaltation of their own. But <hi>the wicked were here taken in their own Nets.</hi> For the Power thus invested in the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> proved at last mainly serviceable for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation there, and the Humiliation of the Pope; it being not in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's power to succour him against that noble and Heroical Champion for the Truth, <hi>Martin Luther.</hi> But let me not interrupt you in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, <hi>Euistor.</hi>

                  <p>That I will not promise.

For the Emperour and the King of <hi>France</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:106935:94"/>
having called a General Council at <hi>Lions,</hi> which yet presently removed to <hi>Pisa, Iulius</hi> was there condemn'd for an Incendiarie, and deprived of his Papal Chair.</p>

But in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's time King of <hi>England</hi> it was but as yet a dim Twylight in comparison of after-years. And yet that King could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that the Pope's Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were but a flash without a bolt; and therefore contemned the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings of both <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh and <hi>Paul</hi> the third. How <hi>Pius Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> excommunicated Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and deprived her of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, I intimated before.

                  <p>Therefore that is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in History, that the Pope's Thunderings were usually accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with great showrs of bloud. For how can it possibly be otherwise, when the Excommunicated Princes Territories are <hi>ipso facto</hi> given up by
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106935:95"/>
the Pope to the Invasion of others, or to the Insurrection of their own Subjects, as being absolved from their Oaths of Fidelity thereby? At least he does what in him lies to set all together by the ears. <hi>Iulius</hi> the second by his pragmatical plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and plucking up and transplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is said to have been the occasion of the slaughter of two hundred thousand Christians in the space of seven years.

From that time to the Reformation no small number was made away by Sword, by Fire, and other Tortures. From the beginning of the Order of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> till the year 1580, <hi>Balduinus</hi> reports there were about nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand of the Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians murthered, that is, within the space of thirty or forty years.

                  <p>I think it is much that a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer</hi> should prove so subtile a <hi>Divine.</hi> I must confess, supposing it clear that God has made no such donation to the Saints departed, if there be such a thing as Idolatry, the Invocation of Saints would be one part thereof.</p>

                  <p>The silence in Scripture touching this Gift, in my judgement, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> is a sufficient argument against the lawfulness of Invocation. For if God has given them such a Gift, he keeping the knowledge thereof from us, it's a sign it was with a reservation of the right of Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himself. But if he has not so much as given them any such share of his Omniscience, as I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he has not, 'tis still more firm that they have no right of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.</p>

                  <p>For my part, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> I think that passage in <hi>Isay</hi> has no contemptible weight with it, to assure us that God does not communicate any such share of his Omniscience to the holiest Souls departed: <hi>Though

For that this is the sense, the verse immediately preceding doth plainly insinuate; <hi>Look down from Heaven, and behold from the Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy Holiness and of thy Glory,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Besides, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> our mere having no commission to give away or communicate a known pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Right of God to the Creature on our own heads, without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or declaration from him, (for this power of Invocation he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted us with as his <hi>Depositum</hi> for his own use) for us, I say, to give this to any other invisible Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himself, the very Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and common Reason will tell us it is Injustice against God. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is the giving away part of his rights of Worship without his leave, it is that piece of Injustice against
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106935:103"/>
him which is Idolatry. And how gross a piece of Idolatry then is this Invocation, when it is set out with those Pagan Circumstances of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Altars, Images and Temples, to the Saint they invoke!

This is the genuine effect of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture of the Priests: They bring ruine upon Religion, and shame and destruction upon themselves, cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and couzening being so vile, so base, and so hatefull a thing in the sight of all men. <hi>Nothing ought to be more pure, nothing more holy, nothing more sincere then a Priest.</hi> If these Fountains will not run clear, all mens mouths must be filled with either poison or mud.<note place="margin">Matt. 5.13.</note>

                     </note>A very good Interpretation. But in the mean time, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> let us take notice whereabout we are in our Discourse. You have shewed us that the Kingdome of God after <hi>Christ</hi>'s coming was the same that the Kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> which Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> continued so till, after <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>'s time, by a wicked Apostasie into Pagan-like Superstitions, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

and Persecutions, it became the Kingdome of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> and that then, after this long Papal Tyranny, by the special assistence of God and the courage and conduct of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed Reformers, the Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> again, in the most proper sense, emerged from under the bondage of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Now as you have noted some Predictions of the Apostasy of the Church, so I desire you would briefly produce some Prophecies touching the Reformation.

                  <p>They do so, <hi>Philopolis</hi>; and the Spirit of Prophecy could not be silent in this point neither, unless he would quite have left us in the dark. But I will give you but an Instance or two; and shall rather point to them, then pursue them. The first is that in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Prediction of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the little Horn with eyes, that <hi>wore out the Saints of the most High,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 7.25.</note>

                     <hi>But the Iudgement shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and destroy it unto the end</hi>; the Beginning of this Judgement is the Reformation which happened in the last <hi>Semitime,</hi> as it is also set out in the reviving of the Witnesses in the last <hi>half-day</hi> of the three days and half.<note place="margin">Apoc. 11.11.</note>

                  <p>It is the thing I drive at, <hi>Philopolis.</hi> I say therefore, that that inward and still Instruction which this whole Vision of the Vials aims at seems to me to be no more then this, That God will at last destroy and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rout all that Antichristian Power that has hitherto, <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like, held the People of God in so great a Bondage. For the alluding to the Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Vials intimates no more then so, that these Plagues are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for that City that is <hi>spiritually called Egypt,</hi> the Antichristian Church, wherein <hi>Christ</hi> in his Members is crucified again, and grievously perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Now in interpreting the meaning of these seven Plagues, wherewith God will afflict and finally destroy this Mystical <hi>Egypt,</hi> we may erre as well in learning too much to a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106935:115"/>
more gross <hi>Political</hi> sense as to a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical</hi>; and it may be Swords and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are no more made use of in this Contest with <hi>Egypt</hi> then Thunder and Lightening and Hailstones of a talent weight.</p>

                  <p>What then, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> would you make the Vision of the seven Vials onely a pompous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Parable signifying that <hi>Christ</hi> will slay the <hi>Man of sin by the breath of his mouth and by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his appearing?</hi>

                  <p>Nay, I can scarce abstain from telling you, O <hi>Philopolis,</hi> that the whole Book, in a manner, of the Apocalyptical Visions, in reference to the Church, seems such as if the Penman thereof did not industriously aim at any thing more then at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though aenigmaticall, prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and prediction of the Apostasy thereof into Antichristianism by the misguidance of the Church-men, with an Indication of the time no precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106935:115"/>
then was useful; and that this Antichristianism will be again chased out of Christendom, and pure and Apostolical times return again. These things are most certainly, punctually and manifestly set out in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse.</hi> (So that to me it is a very great wonder, that any one that has parts and patience to consider things can doubt of the truth of that which is at least the main, if not the sole, scope of that Book of Prophecies.) But that every pompous Prophetical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is to have its distinct Event answering to it, it may be is no more necessary, then that every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a Parable should have a moral meaning in it.</p>

                  <p>What Event therefore, I pray you, answers to the first Vial, which was poured on the Earth, from whence <hi>there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the Mark of the Beast,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 16.2.</note>

                  <p>That Vial was not poured on the Earth, but in a general sense, as in the preceding Verse, where it is said to all the Angels, <hi>Go your ways, and pour out the Vials of the wrath of God on the Earth:</hi> and it follows, <hi>And the first went out, and poured out his Vial on the Earth,</hi> according to the sense of that general command.

                  <p>If Earth here be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood but in that general sense, it had been needless to repeat it.</p>

                  <p>The Repetition is very ornamental to the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, because it bears a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with other Subjects the Vials are said to be poured upon, as the

                  <p>You know, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> the pouring out of the first Vial immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows the ascension of the Witnesses into Heaven, whom, you may be sure, these marked Slaves of the Beast look'd upon with a very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious eye,<note place="margin">Apoc. 15.2.</note> and must needs gnash their teeth at the Triumphal Song of those Harpers harping on the brinks of the <hi>Sea of Glass mingled with Fire.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Envy, Malice, bitter Zeal and mad Rage of the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Party against the Reformed, who were now got into power Politicall both in Church and State,<note place="margin">Apoc. 16.2.</note> this was that <hi>noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> and <hi>grievous sore falling upon

them</hi> from the first Vial; this those <hi>Boils</hi> and <hi>Blains</hi> from the scattered ashes of the furnace in this Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And the concomitants of these were grievous Wars raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Witnesses, or horrid Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, whereever their Adversaries were able to effect it.

                  <p>Now when a Kingdome, Province or Principality is but of so little standing in the Reformation, as that it is but like an Animal fallen into a swoon rather then stone-dead, and that the Papal Interest is not so quite extinct, but that they in a short time may be recoverable to the obedience of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> by the mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Activity and zealous and imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Industry of the Pope's Agents and Emissaries, or by what-ever means they can raise to reduce them to their former Superstitions and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries; that Kingdome, State or Principality is under the Influence of the first Vial: I mean, it is the object of that <hi>exulcerated malice</hi> and fierce and implacable Activity of those mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Servants of the Beast. This plague of unquietness and vexation sticks indeed upon themselves; but it is manifest that they will ease their Rage and Virulency upon what-ever part of their adversaries they have any hope to prevail against. But if they hold out so long against all the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106935:118"/>
rancorous attempts of the <hi>Romish</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, as that the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are quite off from any inclination or capacity of receiving the Papal Laws again, and his Interest has in a manner quite expired, no warmth or hopes being left; then are they in such a condition as is figured out by the second Vial,<note place="margin">Apoc. 16.3.</note> 
                     <hi>the Sea becomes as the bloud of a dead man,</hi> and the Fishes therewith die in it.

                  <p>The condition then of the Reformation in <hi>Germany</hi> before the <hi>Smalcaldick</hi> War, and of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth's time, before the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> seems to be such as is denoted by the first Vial.

                     <hi>Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the bloud of Saints and Prophets, and thou hast given them bloud to drink; for they are worthy.</hi>

                  <p>And so you may well be from the very Text it self.

To leave off would be such a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my desire of seeing to the end of this great Theorie, and a loss so

irreparable, that I have not the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to think of it.</p>

                  <p>What you say touching the destruction of the Kingdome of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi> I am abundantly satisfied therein, both from the consuming of the little Horn by fire in <hi>Daniel</hi>;<note place="margin">Dan. 7.11.</note> and also in that it is said in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,</hi>

need enter no farther into that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before you orderly come at it.

                  <p>I doubt not but it is.

                  <p>This is something high and Poeticall, <hi>Philotheus.</hi> But that which you would have, I suppose, is this, namely, That as the Moon and Sun in the Vision of the Woman, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to an intimation of <hi>Hugo Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> may signifie the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; so the Sun here may also signifie the Law of <hi>Christ</hi> comprehended in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rather, more at large, the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106935:127"/>
Word of God (which we call <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>) comprising the New Testament, and the Old so far forth as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Old is ratified by the New. Is this the body of the Sun you mean?</p>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>Some such thing I drive at; you understand me very well. Now I say the pouring out the Vial upon this Sun is the enlightning it with clear and convictive Expositions by Holy men assisted by the Spirit of God, or rather the removing the clouds of Obscurity from before it, that it may shine in its full strength, to discover plainly the unrighteous mysteries of the Kingdome of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> and shew to all the World in what a foul and horrid condition they are, how apostatized from God and <hi>Christ,</hi> and how plainly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfully their abominable doings are characterized by the finger of God in the Scripture, and how lively their most direfull and diabolicall Image is there described. This is the pouring out the Vial upon the Sun,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:106935:127"/>
whereby <hi>power is given him to scorch men with fire,</hi> and so vex them that they <hi>blaspheme the Name of God</hi> by reason of these Plagues, and rather vilifie and reproch the Scriptures and the Spirit that writ them, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them of their sins, and give glory to God by acknowledging the Truth. This, I conceive, may be one sense of the fourth Vial.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>But this is a more <hi>Mystical</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> sense. Is there not also, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> a <hi>Politicall</hi> one?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes there is, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> and it is a very obvious one. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more confessed then that in the Prophetick style the <hi>Sun</hi> signifies the greatest person in the Politicall Universe, as he is the most glorious Luminarie in the Natural. Now who do you think is the greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the World the Pope rules in?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>He and the Pope has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it a great while, and I think it is hard to say whether is at this very day.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>Wherefore the next Vial
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106935:128"/>
seeming more peculiarly to concern the <hi>Pope,</hi> this is likely to appertain to the <hi>Emperour.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>What therefore do you think the pouring of the fourth Vial upon the <hi>Sun</hi> to signifie in this <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> sense?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope it signifies the Conversion of some Emperour illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with the true knowledge of the Gospel. For thus the general Reformation which he will introduce in his Empire, through the Light and Zeal he has conceived for the Truth, will scorch and burn and vex the Vassals of the <hi>two-horned Beast</hi> to the very heart. This is a sense natural enough, I think; but whether it or the former be more natural, I leave to you to judge.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>There is abundant Concin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in them both. Nor do I think it is at all necessary that that Subject on which the Vial is said to be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red should always suffer Mischief, but that at least Mischief should be thence reflected upon the Beast. But is there
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106935:128"/>
no other possible sense of the fourth Vial, <hi>Philotheus?</hi>

                  <p>That intimation sufficeth.

                  <p>It is that which I suppose is most to your tooth, <hi>Philopolis:</hi> But sometimes another occurrs to my minde. What if we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Chair</hi> here perstrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by this Throne of the Beast? I mean that Chair of <hi>Infallibility</hi> that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106935:129"/>
he and his <hi>Pseudoprophetick</hi> Body boast they sit in, and so dictate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Oracles to the world for their own Profit and Interest, facing down the people, whatsoever they finde gainfull to the Church, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally true, be it a Figment never so foolish or incredible, never so blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous or impossible: but it cannot seem so to the <hi>people,</hi> while they take the Church to be <hi>infallible.</hi> Now I say, as the present Vial in the <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> sense may be in some kinde a consequent of the former <hi>politically</hi> understood; so the Efficacy of the former more <hi>spiritually</hi> understood may introduce in time the Effect of this present Vial in the more <hi>Spiritual</hi> meaning also; and the pouring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of on the Throne of the Beast may be the abolishing of that false Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Pope's and his Churche's Infallibility out of the generality of mens mindes: which false Light once removed, they must needs finde themselves much in the dark, their Religion being such as neither Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

Reason, nor any thing else that has any Autority with it, can afford any light to, or the least co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for; wherefore his Kingdome must needs be overwhelmed with more then <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkness: and the Sticklers for the Papacy seeing so general a dissatisfaction in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that they, through the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrancy of the Light of the Gospel, have lost this great hold on them, it will make them gnaw their tongues for very anguish and pain.</p>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, I know not but this may be one sense too. But, I pray you, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> proceed to the sixth Vial.</p>

                  <p>The sixth Vial, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> seems to touch upon the Conversion of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Comment. Apocalypt. ad cap. 16.</note> as that late excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter has with great judgement and credibility made the discovery. And the comparing of the Vision of the <hi>treading of the Wine-press without the City,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 14.18.</note> and the Battel and Victory of that illustrious <hi>Heros</hi> riding on the <hi>white Horse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 19.11.</note> with the last Vial, does,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106935:130"/>
as he also suggests, make much for the probability of this Exposition. For that there is an Identity or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidency of Events signified by the <hi>treading of the Wine-press</hi> and the <hi>battel of that great Heros</hi> seems to be clearly enough intimated in those Visions, in that the Rider of the white Horse is said also to <hi>tread the Wine-press of the Wrath of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 19.15, &amp; 13.</note> and to have <hi>his garments dipt in bloud.</hi> Which correspondeth excellently with that in the Vision of the <hi>Wine-press,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 14.20.</note> that <hi>there came out bloud up to the horse bridles:</hi> Which implies therefore that the Wine-press was trode by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the white Horse: And then you see how naturally it will follow that his Vesture will be dipt in bloud.</p>

                  <p>The Congruity is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, <hi>Philotheus.</hi> I do not doubt but these two Visions signifie much-what the same thing.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then.<note place="margin">Apoc. 19.20.</note> But in that <hi>the Beast and false Prophet</hi> are <hi>taken</hi> in the Victory of the Rider of the white Horse, and cast <hi>alive into the lake of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106935:131"/>
fire and brimstone,</hi> it is plain that this is the last effusion of the wrath of God upon them, as most certainly the last Vial is. So that these two Visions also signifie the same. I mean the <hi>Vision of the last Vial,</hi> and of <hi>the Rider of the white Horse.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>That's very clear again, <hi>Philotheus.</hi> But what of all this? I know not what you would be at.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>I would infer, that as the <hi>treading of the Wine-press,</hi> the <hi>Battel of the Rider of the white Horse</hi> and the <hi>seventh Vial</hi> are all one, so the <hi>Harvest</hi> immediately preceding the treading of the Wine-press,<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.15.</note> and the <hi>Marriage of the Lamb</hi> immediately preceding the Battel of the Rider of the white Horse,<note place="margin">Apoc. 19.7</note> and the <hi>sixth Vial</hi> immediately preceding the seventh, are also all one.</p>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>There is a very specious probability of it.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:106935:131"/>
of the Lamb the espousing some people to <hi>Christ</hi>; the sixth Vial must also have some such signification. <hi>For the notable Artifice of security of Concealment and certainty of Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Visions in the</hi> Apocalypse <hi>consists most-what in this, The one in the Defectuousness and Scatteredness of the Prophecies in several, the other in their accurate Correspondency and Synchronism.</hi>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>That's very remarkable. But what do you think is meant by those three Visions you compare?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>It may be not onely the Conversion of the distinct and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but, as it is said in the general,<note place="margin">Apoc. 16.12.</note> 
                     <hi>that the way of the Kings of the East might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</hi> so it may at large signifie some Harvest or fruits of the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Turks</hi> and those Eastern Countreys. It may be some great Bashaws may revolt from <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi> to Christianity by this time, and that jointly with the Conversion of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Which state of the <hi>Turkish</hi>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:106935:132"/>
Empire is signified here by <hi>Euphrates</hi> being dried up.

                  <p>I shall, <hi>Philopolis.</hi> To the understanding whereof more easily it will be requisite to make a Remark or two upon the Vision of the <hi>Rider of the white Horse.</hi> As that his Equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page is such, that it seems very harsh to conceive that the War is gross and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106935:133"/>
carnal, but spiritual. For to be <hi>clothed in fine Linen white and clean</hi> is not the armature of a carnal war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,<note place="margin">Apoc. 19.14.</note> as neither the <hi>Sword coming out of his mouth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 15.</note> It is plainly the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Word of God, as his Name also implies, proceeding out of the mouth of his Saints, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing mens Consciences of the Truth. Whence also we have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of security that the Vision of the Wine-press (trodden by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the white Horse) does not signifie so grosly and bloudily as the words externally sound; which seem to be framed so Hyperbolically on purpose to bear off the cautious from any such rude conceit. And in that the <hi>Angel standing in the Sun</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites the <hi>Fowls of Heaven to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the great God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 19.17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>to eat the flesh of Kings and Captains, and the flesh of mighty Men, and the flesh of Horses,</hi> in that other Vision, I must confess I look upon it as but a Propheticall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>The Egyptians are men,</hi>

spirit.</hi> But it would be too long to insist on these things. That such an Angel of light should be so meanly employed as to invite Birds of prey to a Feast of dead mens Carkasses, is a <hi>Decorum</hi> I understand not. But we cannot stay here. That which I would have you most of all take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in that Vision is, the different Event of the War upon two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sorts of Enemies the Rider of the white Horse wages war with.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:106935:134"/>
Conflux of men, or entire Aggregate of the two opposite Armies before the Fight, and dividing them, they naturally fall into this Tripartition; The true Christian and Apostolicall Party, the Infidel Party, (distinct from the Beast and false Prophet) and the Party Antichristian.</p>

                     <hi>Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his Garments, lest he walk naked, and men see his shame.</hi> This is the time that God will <hi>pluck off the Covering from off all Nations,</hi>

                  <p>More comes to my minde then is needfull. I will omit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those passages which import but the same things you observed out of the old Prophets; The Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Purity of that Holy City there described, implied in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of every thing that defileth, and figured out by those precious Stones and pure transparent Gold; and in that <hi>all tears</hi> are said to be <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from their eyes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 21.4.</note> it is an intimation of Peace and security from Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And all the whole description

of it is so full of Glory and Light and Joy, that no man can miss of that character. But I would ask you, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> the meaning of other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages: as, Why this Holy City is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>new Ierusalem:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> Why said to <hi>come from Heaven:</hi> Why said to have <hi>twelve Gates with the names of the twelve Tribes of Israel thereon</hi>;<note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> and why the Wall of the City to have <hi>twelve Foundations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>and in them the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb:</hi> Why the City is said to be <hi>measured with a golden Reed</hi>;<note place="margin">Ver. 15.</note> and why found to be <hi>twelve thousand Furlongs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 16, 17</note> and the Wall <hi>an hundred forty four Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits:</hi> What also is the meaning of that saying,<note place="margin">Ver. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men</hi>; and yet that there was <hi>seen no Temple</hi> there,<note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> because the <hi>Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the Temple of it:</hi> and again, What the genuine sense of that sixth verse, <hi>And he that sate upon the Throne said, It is done.

                  <p>You have congested a number of things together, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi>; but however I shall return an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to them as orderly and as brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can. I conceive therefore, to begin with the first, that the City which <hi>Iohn</hi> saw is called the <hi>new Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> in counterdistinction to that <hi>old Ierusalem where our Lord was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 11.8.</note> whether understood literally or typically; as also because its Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens have <hi>put on the new man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note> 
                     <hi>which is framed according to Righteousness and true Holiness,</hi> because they are the sons of the <hi>new Birth,</hi> or <hi>new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of God. But it is said to <hi>come down from Heaven</hi> in such a sense as the Doctrine of <hi>Iohn</hi> is said to be <hi>from Heaven</hi>:<note place="margin">Matt. 21.25.</note> and agreeably to that passage in the Apostle, that <hi>the Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem that is above is free,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4.26.</note> 
                     <hi>which is the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:106935:149"/>
Mother of us all.</hi> That actual City of God consisting of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven, this <hi>new Ierusalem</hi> which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> describes being so like to them in Purity and Holiness, it is therefore said to descend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as being a Copy or Transcript of that Heavenly Perfection. To all which you may adde, that what the Prophets have seen in Heavenly Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching this City, it being thus at last accomplished upon Earth, it is therefore said to be a City <hi>descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is that very City <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw,<note place="margin">Ezek. 48.31.</note> of which he says, <hi>And the Gates of the City shall be after the names of the Tribes of Israel; three gates North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, one gate of Reuben, one gate of Iudah, one gate of Levi</hi>; and so of the rest, three gates of a side, in all twelve gates; as it is said in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Vision, that <hi>the City had twelve Gates, and the names of the twelve Tribes of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel written thereon.</hi> This among other things intimates, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s City and this of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:106935:149"/>
is all one City. And in that the Apostles Names are said to be writ on the twelve Foundations of the Wall, that shews, jointly considered with the other, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Prophecy must have its completion in the <hi>Iews</hi> Conversion to Christianity, viz. when <hi>Iew</hi> and Gentile are gathered together under one Head, <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> and become of one Faith and one Church, which is this <hi>Holy City.</hi> But the Apostles Names are said to be in the Foundations of the Wall, because their Doctrine is the Foundation of the Church into which the <hi>Iews</hi> are to be graffed, and through that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that is communicated to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians may also finde mercy at that day.</p>
                  <p>This comparing the Church to a Building is very usual in Scripture. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the Believers,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.5.</note> that they <hi>as living stones are built up a spiritual House.</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians, Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreiners,</hi>

                     <hi>but fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of God;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:106935:150"/>
and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being the chief corner stone: In whom all the building fitly framed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groweth into an holy Temple in the Lord; In whom you are also builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> And in this is that expression fulfilled, <hi>Behold, the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of God is with men.</hi> And the name of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s City is also <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah shammah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 48.35.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord is there.</hi> And yet there is no material Tabernacle nor Temple where he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to rest him, and toward which the people should worship; <hi>But the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the Temple thereof:</hi> that is to say, In this <hi>new Ierusalem</hi> there will be no visible Fabrick toward which men will affect to worship, but with bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knees and pure hearts, and hands and eyes lift up to Heaven, where <hi>Christ</hi> sits at the right hand of God, shall men <hi>worship the Father in spirit and in truth.</hi>

                  <p>The summarie sense of that accurate description of the <hi>Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Oeconomie in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is onely this, (interpreted plainly by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi>) That when all the glory and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Iudaicall</hi> Dispensation is set off to the utmost, <hi>the measuring of the Pattern,</hi> the matching and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of it is that state of Christianity which will appear after the effusion of the seven Vials, when <hi>Iew</hi> and Gentile become one Church, one holy Temple and City of God.

                  <p>As for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Vision, methinks it is a marvellous childish conceit to expound it literally: as if there should be a City made of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous Gold, the Wall of precious Stones, and the Gates of Pearl.</p>

                  <p>And yet methinks this is more marvellous, That the City should be as a Cube,<note place="margin">Apoc. 21.16.</note> as high as it is broad or long. And yet it is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; and <hi>twelve thousand furlongs</hi> is the Cubical measure thereof.</p>

                  <p>I think two things are hinted thereby. The one I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted already, That this City cannot be understood literally. The other is what was intimated before by the names of the Apostles. This solid Cube <hi>twelve thousand</hi> signifies that this City will be wholly and entirely A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall in Life and Doctrine and Discipline: The square Root also of the measure of the Wall 144 Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits intimating the same Apostolical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Dispensation. For the saying <hi>a hundred forty four Cubits</hi> is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the <hi>Wall,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 21.17.</note> implies that it is 12 cubits high and 12 cubits broad; nor could the intimation reach any farther, speaking suitably to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a City wall. For what kinde
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106935:152"/>
of City must that be the compass of whose Wall is but 144 Cubits?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>Some say, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> that the Root of that Cube you mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned being extracted, and so the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimeter of this City S. <hi>Iohn</hi> describes discovered, it is found to be the same in a manner with the Perimeter of that City <hi>Ezekiel</hi> describes.<note place="margin">Ezek. 48.35.</note> What does that signifie; think you?</p>

                  <p>I know not what else it should signifie, but that these two Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions aim at the same thing, and that the meaning of that also in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is spiritual: and that those Prophetick Figures that strike the <hi>phancy</hi> and the <hi>flesh</hi> are to be fulfilled in the <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Spirit,</hi> which the whole <hi>Iudaicall</hi> Oeconomy seals to as a Type to the thing typified.

                  <p>Pure Gold certainly, (though as transparent as Amber) and such as has lost all its Dross. They must be of a pure Angelicall nature indeed:

                     <hi>And they went every one straight forward; whither the Spirit was to goe, they went.</hi> And in that it is said, <hi>they went straight forward,</hi> and that <hi>they returned not when they went,</hi> this signifies the peremptory and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible progress of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence administred by his Angelicall forces.<note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> For in that the <hi>wheels</hi> of his Cherubick Chariot are said to be <hi>full of eyes,</hi> I conceive this is meant thereby, That the Circuits and Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of times and Ages are carried by a special Providence of God, who oversees all things.

                  <p>The main thing to be urged against <hi>Ben Vzziel</hi>'s exposition of the Wheels is, that it implies a false systeme of the World.

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:106935:160"/>
your Interpretation, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> in that sense, and give us some more Remarks upon this Vision. What say you to the number and form of the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and the Man enthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on this <hi>Cherubick</hi> Chariot?</p>

                  <p>As for the number of the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> which is four, I conceive it intimates the universal Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the <hi>Angelicall Orders,</hi> or of those at least that are ministring Spirits. For the <hi>Pythagorick</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is comprehended in the <hi>Tetractys.</hi> And in that their <hi>faces</hi> are said to be <hi>four,</hi> it seems to signifie so many sorts of natures or offices in this <hi>Angelicall Polity</hi>; which it may be are more grossly distinguishable in the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, and with an eye where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto this <hi>Angelicall Type</hi> perhaps has been exhibited to Prophets and holy men of God. I conceive therefore that the four distinct Faces of a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Man, Oxe</hi> and <hi>Eagle,</hi> signifie those four main parts that make up their Polity, the <hi>Lion</hi> the <hi>Military</hi> part, the <hi>Man</hi> all that part employ'd about
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:106935:160"/>
the <hi>hearing of Causes</hi> and <hi>peaceable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Iustice,</hi> the <hi>Oxe</hi> the <hi>Labouring part,</hi> whether in <hi>Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or what other <hi>usefull employment in things done by the hand,</hi> and the <hi>Eagle</hi> the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> and <hi>Philosophicall part,</hi> the <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Devotionall.</hi> This general Quadripartition of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's or Employments may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly be conceived some way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to both <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Angels.</hi> But <hi>every</hi> Beast is said to have all these four Faces, because every Beast is a fourth part of the whole Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the <hi>Angelicall Host,</hi> and these sorts are mingled one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Moreover, in that their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings were <hi>full of eyes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 10.13.</note> it signifies that all their strength and activity is guided by Knowledg, and that they see whither they goe and whence, and act not out of <hi>blinde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> but out of <hi>the light of Life.</hi> And in that <hi>their faces are set all one way,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 1.9.</note> it notes that they are without distraction, all of one mind and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

But in that they are said to be <hi>Oxe-feet,</hi> it signifies they neither affect nor travel for that which is useless and unprofitable.<note place="margin">Isa. 55.2.</note> 
                     <hi>They do not labour for that which satisfieth not, nor expend their pains for that which is not bread.</hi> Though each Cherub be said to have the face of an Eagle, yet none have any other feet but those of an Oxe.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:106935:162"/>

                  <p>I deny it not. Onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> that outward washings profit little, but that it is the Spirit that cleanseth.

That <hi>Sea signifies an immense multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> So that, so far as I see, this Type may bear a double Allusion; one to the use of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Sea, the other to the signification of the name in the Prophetick style.</p>

                  <p>To omit all conjectures touching the seven last <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> I shall onely return this answer for the present, That the number <hi>Seven</hi> need not here signifie <hi>Numerically,</hi> but <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically,</hi> denoting the Purity and Immateriality of those Angels or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that watch over the Church and minister to it, when that shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in that glorious degree that is
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106935:167"/>
foretold,<note place="margin">Apoc. 21.3.</note> 
                     <hi>The Tabernacle of God is with men.</hi> Here the Lamps are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable from the four Beasts: but in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Cherub-Chariot the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures themselves are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to <hi>Lamps,</hi>

But yet the Beasts here are described almost just in the same manner the Cherubims are in <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s Vision, which denotes the <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licalness</hi> of this last and best state of the Church. The quadriform <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of those of the <hi>Angelicall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> I need not here repeat, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is easie. I will onely pick out some of the most useful Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vables in this present description, and then goe on.</p>
                  <p>As first,<note place="margin">Apoc. 4.6.</note> That <hi>the Beasts are said all of them to be full of eyes before and behinde.</hi> Which implies that they look backward and forward, into the History of times past, and into the Prophecies and Predictions of things to come, and compute in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell all possible futurities, the better
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:106935:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to manage the present affairs of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Kingdome, and be provided against every Emergency. For in this consists all useful and practicall wisedome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 4.8.</note>Secondly, They are said <hi>to have six wings:</hi> Undoubtedly for that use the <hi>Seraphims</hi> are said to make of them in the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isay 6.2.</note> 
                     <hi>With twain to cover their faces, with twain to cover their feet, and with twain to flie.</hi> Which implies a reverence of the Divine Majesty, an activity and readiness in his Service, and a carefulness over our Affections, that we walk in clean paths. For upon the mention of the six wings, all the four Beasts are said to be <hi>full of eyes</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (as <hi>Grotius</hi> well and skilfully draws those two together) <hi>without and within.</hi> And therefore they with one eye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the outward Objects, and with another eye their own Nature, and so comparing them together, they will ever behave themselves deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously and becomingly, with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to what is above them in
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:106935:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Dignity and Excellency, and at a due distance from those things that are unworthy of them and beneath them. They will not commit any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the excellencie of their own nature, nor admit of any thing repugnant to the innate Light and immutable Principles of an Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Creature. And therefore, if any such thing be offered them <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> their <hi>eyes within</hi> will easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Proposer to be either a Fool or an Impostour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the <hi>Sea of glass like unto crystall</hi> signifies our being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into one holy Community; so the <hi>Lightnings</hi> and <hi>Thunders</hi> and <hi>Voices</hi> over this collected Body of the Church, the <hi>four Beasts,</hi> and the <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four Elders,</hi> signifie their joint-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and Guidance by the <hi>fiery Law of the Spirit,</hi> in which Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation they live. According to that promise of the second Covenant,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.33.</note> 
                     <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they shall be my

people.</hi> This is the City which <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> calls <hi>Iehovah shammah</hi>;<note place="margin">Ezek. 48.35.</note> not for any visible symbolicall Residence of God there, but for the abode of him in the <hi>hearts</hi> of men by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> by which they have one common mind and one motion: as it is in the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Kingdome in the <hi>Cherubims</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 1.11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Their wings touched one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and whither the Spirit was to goe, thither they went.</hi> And the twenty four Elders and the four Beasts be thus of one spirit. For when the <hi>Beasts worship God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 4.9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>the twenty four Elders</hi> also <hi>cast down their Crowns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne,</hi> acknowledging from whom and for whom they reign, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the manifesting of the glory and honour and power of God in the Kingdome of his Saints.</p>

                  <p>But, I pray you, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> how can the Beasts be said <hi>never to rest day nor night,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>saying, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty</hi>; and yet the twenty four Elders, as oft as they doe thus, to <hi>cast their Crowns before the Throne?</hi> For one casting would serve
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:106935:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for all, and their Crowns would ever lie before the Throne of their own heads.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>These things, O <hi>Cupho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron,</hi> are by no means to be so gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood. For their <hi>never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing day nor night</hi> from <hi>saying, Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> signifies nothing else but a perpetuall declaring the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, in whose presence they walk, by the constant purity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of their own Conversations. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And as there is this one continued tenour of Holiness in the people, so likewise is there one continued corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of humble Devoutness in their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who live in a perpetual sense of their Office and Duty, casting down their Crowns before the Throne of God; acknowledging thereby, that the measure of their Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ought not to be their own Interest, but merely the Interest of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Kingdome; that they reign wholly through him and for him, and therefore are not to seek
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:106935:170"/>
themselves. This is the inward mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that externall Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their worship, which reaches the inmost life and spirit, and is not a shadow of a shadow.</p>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>This is a sufficient solution of <hi>Cuphophron</hi>'s Quere, <hi>Philotheus.</hi> But, I pray you, why are those crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Elders (being that they wear <hi>golden Crowns</hi> like Kings) said to be <hi>clothed in white</hi> like Priests,<note place="margin">Apoc. 4.4.</note> and why placed next to the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, and why <hi>four and twenty?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>By their <hi>golden Crowns</hi> and <hi>white Raiment</hi> joyntly considered, it is signified, that in their respective Kingdoms all <hi>power</hi> is in them, as well <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> as <hi>Secular</hi>; that is to say, <hi>In all causes, as well Ecclesiasticall as Civil, they, next to Christ, are supreme Heads in their own Principalities.</hi> And therefore their <hi>Thrones</hi> (for so they are called in the Original) are placed next to the <hi>Throne</hi> of God. That is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a farther Intimation of their <hi>Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotality,</hi> in that they are thus placed <hi>about the Throne,</hi> it seeming to allude
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:106935:170"/>
to the <hi>Levites</hi> pitching their Tents <hi>about the Tabernacle.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 1.50.</note> But in that they wear <hi>white Raiment,</hi> it signifies also their Innocency, Uprightness and Sanctity, their Sacerdotal Piety and Devotion in their solicitous Addresses to the Throne of Grace in the behalf of themselves as Rulers, and of the people committed to their charge. And lastly, they are said to be <hi>four and twenty,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Chron. 24.4, 18.</note> it's likely, in some allusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the distribution of the Courses of the Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> into that number: which again shews the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of these Kings in Sacerdotal affairs, as if they were the Princes of these Divisions. But I must confess, I think that which is mainly aimed at is this, viz. An intimation that this glorious state of the Church will be then when <hi>Iews</hi> and Gentiles are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one Sheepfold; That this is the state of the <hi>new Ierusalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 21.12, 14.</note> that has the names of the <hi>twelve Patriarchs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed on her as well as of the <hi>twelve Apostles.</hi> This I conceive may be the account of the four and twenty El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:106935:171"/>
For I doubt not but the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber here signifies <hi>Symbolically,</hi> not <hi>Numerically.</hi>

                  <p>This Interpretation indeed seems to be of more importance, it implying both the <hi>Conversion of the Iews</hi> and the <hi>Apostolicalness</hi> of these Times of the Church at once.</p>
                  <p>Well, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> you have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed out of the Prophets an excellent state of things; which being so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent that it transcends the power of speech, nor can be set out according to its due worth by all the words and phrases I am master of, I will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to contract it for my memory sake into as few as I can: which brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are these; <hi>Apostolicalness</hi> of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worship, <hi>Integrity</hi> of Life, and <hi>Security</hi> from Persecution for Conscience sake, and from intestine Wars and Troubles. For thus it will truely become the Kingdome of the <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 7.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Son of man,</hi> whenas the four King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms hitherto have been justly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>four ravening and devouring Beasts,</hi>

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:106935:171"/>
as to tear their own flesh. But this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall</hi> Kingdome, as you call it, wherein God's will is done on Earth as it is in Heaven, is a Kingdome of Righteousness and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost. O how am I trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the view of so glorious a prospect! I shall pray, <hi>Thy Kingdome come,</hi> with a more peculiar Emphasis, for this day's Instruction, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> then ever I have done hitherto in all my life. But that I may doe it with the greater Plerophorie, I pray you proceed to the next Point, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Grounds of this your so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hope.</p>

But are there not also Arguments of a lower allay that Reason and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Sagacity may suggest?</p>

                     </note>I will tell you rather, O <hi>Philopolis,</hi> what Life and Experience doth suggest. To me, I must confess, it is a wonder the World is no better then it is, Vice and Wickedness to my sense seeming so harshly repugnant to humane Nature, and Vertue and Righteousness so harmoniously agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto. For this Rectitude
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:106935:178"/>
of spirit that belongs to the true <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of God is the possession of so perfect Pleasure and Happiness, that the Soul of man feels it to be her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Satisfaction; and that the state of Vice and Sin is a state of Disease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Unnaturalness, not onely plainly and demonstratively repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to right Reason, but most hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and harshly grating against that inmost, and most Divine and delicious sense of the Soul, which is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pullulation of the pure Love, and is the Excitation of the Life of God in the humane Nature, whereby we have a natural delight in all the ways of Goodness, Purity and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This is the natural <hi>Sanity</hi> of the Soul; the contrary her <hi>Disease:</hi> this her state of <hi>Sobriety</hi>; the other a mere fit of <hi>Drunkenness:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore methinks the World should not continue in it for ever, but that even the Misery and Confusion of this <hi>drunken state</hi> should forcibly awaken them at length to follow Peace and Righteousness. Which time, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:106935:179"/>
the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> may seem to point at,<note place="margin">Isa. 24.18, &amp;c.</note> where he saith, <hi>The windows from on high are opened, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth do shake. The Earth is utterly broken down, the Earth is clean dissolved, the Earth is moved exceedingly. The Earth shall move to and fro like a Drunkard, and shall be removed like a Cottage, and the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the Host of the high ones that are on high, and the Kings of the Earth upon the Earth.</hi> (This, I conceive, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> is under the effusion of the last Vial.) <hi>Then the Moon shall be confounded and the Sun ashamed, when the Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Sion and in Ierusalem and before his Ancients gloriously:</hi> that is to say,<note place="margin">Apoc. 4.4.</note> in the <hi>new Ierusalem,</hi> before the <hi>four and twenty Elders in white Raiment, and</hi> with <hi>golden Crowns on their heads.</hi> And in this Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth will be, not onely upon the account of their <hi>Wickedness,</hi> but
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:106935:179"/>
                     <hi>Ignorance</hi> also and gross Errours in Religion. For mankinde are held down in these things by an hard vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to their own Reason and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well in <hi>Popery</hi> as <hi>Turcism</hi> and <hi>Paganism,</hi> those Religions being not onely groundless, but foolishly fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and contradictious to all sound Reason. But when <hi>the windows from on high shall be opened upon them,</hi> and the heavenly Grace and Truth show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down, and the pure Light of the Gospel let in upon them, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth shall shake under them, and they will finde the falseness and unstableness of the Fundamental Frauds and Lies of men, which shall utterly perish, and all those that cleave to them.</p>
                  <p>This therefore, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> by way of Prudence and Sagacity may be presumed, That those days having shone upon us that <hi>Daniel</hi> has fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, when <hi>many shall run to and fro,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 12.4.</note> 
                     <hi>and Knowledge shall be increased,</hi> this liberty of searching after Truth, and the success of finding it, will contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:106935:180"/>
very much to the ruine and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of those stately Structures of Lies which Superstition or false Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy has so magnificently built up, and would have all men to bow to as to the golden Image <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had set up.

                     <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and right Reason, will trample this Image under foot. And the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture, even in the Propheticall passages thereof, will be so plainly understood, against <hi>Turcism, Papism, Paganism,</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism,</hi> or what-ever Religion in the world or Irreligion, even against <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism</hi> it self, that I am persuaded this very Advantage alone will be of infinite consequence for the convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Souls to <hi>Christ.</hi> There will be such an assured sense of all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> besides those of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that this one peculiar Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Christianity, (in having the whole Scene of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and of all the Affairs of the Church of God, and indeed of

all the World, (so far forth as they respect the Church) so lively set off and prefigured for so many hundreds of years, nay for some thousands) this, I say, alone must of necessity drive all the world to a firm belief that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Saviour of the World; and that there is a God whose Providence watches over the Affairs of mankinde; and that there is a Life to come and a blessed Immortality for all true Believers. I tell you succinctly, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> the clear Completion of so many, so weighty Prophecies, and so many hundred years distant from the Event, seems to me to be a more convictive ground of the truth of Christianity, then all the Miracles done by <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles to those that liv'd in those days, especially to as many as did not see them themselves, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Circumstances of them.</p>

would be so vulgarly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally understood by Christians.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:106935:181"/>
                     <hi>Philotheus,</hi> in my judgement, is not at all extravagant as to the unhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the World from the false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions they have been so long held captive under. But when I have been thinking with my self on these things, I have been often cast into a fear that the <hi>pure Apostolick Christianity</hi> may not then take place for all that, but some other mode of Christianity, which some pretend to be the <hi>Reign of the Spirit,</hi> but is as errant a Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that <hi>Christianity</hi> which was taught by the Apostles, as that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> was of <hi>Iudaism,</hi> if not more, or as <hi>Mahometism</hi> is of both.</p>

                  <p>I believe <hi>Sophron</hi> has in his eye the <hi>Love-service</hi> of the Modern <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> with their more visible Off-spring the <hi>Quakers.</hi> For indeed their Prophet, in his <hi>Prophecy of the spirit of Love,</hi> does expresly promise his Followers the possession of the whole Earth, that all Nations will submit unto them. For though they will admit that the Service of <hi>Christ</hi> in the Belief is the <hi>Holy</hi> of the true
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:106935:182"/>
Tabernacle; yet they boast that the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> is their <hi>Service of the Love,</hi> which therefore ought to take place above all.</p>

                  <p>In my judgement, <hi>Euistor,</hi> this fear of <hi>Sophron</hi>'s is but a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less fear. For besides the many gross, impossible and ridiculous Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Scripture, upon which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this Prophet would build himself; the obvious Evidence from his Writings that he was a mere <hi>Sadducee,</hi> and held <hi>neither Angel nor Spirit</hi> nor the Immortality of the Soul, is a palpable assurance that in so great a Light as God has and is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the World this man's Dictates and Doctrines will never pass into any National Religion, but it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all that he was a mistaken En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast. Methinks it is <hi>infinitely</hi> more improbable that the World should take him for a true Prophet, then that the plain Apostolicall Faith and Doctrine, which has such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and miraculous Attestations to it, and is so suitable to moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:106935:182"/>

                  <p>This gross Errour of <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism</hi> might indeed disenable this Prophet from doing any great injurie to the Personal Offices of <hi>Christ,</hi> which he seems to undermine and beat down. But the <hi>Reign of the Spirit,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>personal Sceptre</hi> of the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> has fallen into more refined hands, that do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly acknowledge the Immortality of the Soul, and consequently the present Subsistency of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Personality, and yet are altogether for the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Christ within them,</hi> as if that part of Christianity that respects <hi>Christ without</hi> us were quite antiquated.

                  <p>Is it possible, <hi>Bathynous?</hi> I had alwaies thought that the Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Names of the Days of the Week had proceeded from the orderly reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of the Planets from <hi>Saturn</hi> downward; and so giving every one of them the dominion of an hour one after another through the four and twenty, every first hour of the day will have a new Planet, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily in such an order as the Names of the Days of the Week im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. As, suppose, let <hi>Saturn</hi> have the first hour of the Day: From <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> to <hi>Luna</hi> thrice inclusively there is twenty one hours: Then say, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> twenty two, <hi>Iupiter</hi> twenty three, <hi>Mars</hi> twenty four; the next hour, which is the first of the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, is <hi>Sol.</hi> Then again, from <hi>Sol</hi> to <hi>Mars</hi> thrice is twenty one: Then say, <hi>Sol</hi> twenty two, <hi>Venus</hi> twenty
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:106935:185"/>
three, <hi>Mercurie</hi> twenty four; and the next hour, which is the first of the day following, is <hi>Luna.</hi> And so quite through the Week you shall finde this orderly reckoning necessarily give such Names to all the Days of the Week as they bear.</p>

                  <p>I must confess this Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, O <hi>Sophron,</hi> made me smile, when I observed how nimble the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired Philosopher was in his <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium magnum,</hi> to communicate some of his own skill in the Language of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (discovered in the Names of the Planets) unto the Ancients, as if they had been acquainted with the <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Mystery of the Creation, from affixing the names of the Planets to such days of the week: when, God wot, they dreamed of nothing more then this orderly piece of Astrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Superstition which you have so
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:106935:186"/>
judiciously taken notice of. But there are also several other palpable Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the impartial and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader, that what the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Philosopher writ was not by an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible spirit.</p>

                  <p>I will give you one Instance for all, O <hi>Sophron.</hi> He did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the true <hi>Systeme</hi> of the World; as appears by his Story of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> in whose place he substitutes the Sun, and declares that all the Stars take light and power from him: Denies that there is any Morning or Evening above the Moon, though the four Moons moving about <hi>Iupiter</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witness against it: Tells us how the six other Planets are <hi>Sol</hi>'s six Counsellers; wherein he does not dream of <hi>Tellus</hi>'s being as good a Planet, and consequently as good a
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:106935:186"/>
Counseller, as the rest, especially as the Moon, which will make seven; and those four about <hi>Iupiter</hi> four more, and as good Wives for the Sun and Stars as our Moon is. Which considerations break a pieces all his fine Conceits touching the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and Analogie betwixt the seven Planets and his seven Properties of Nature. Whence I profess I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well assured he is not divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired.</p>

                  <p>How then, <hi>Bathynous,</hi> should he come by such unheard-of Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? As one especially that does most of all astonish me, because I find some profess they know the truth thereof by experience; I mean, the distribution of all into three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or Worlds, The <hi>dark-Fire-World,</hi> the holy <hi>Light-World,</hi> and this mixt <hi>Out-World.</hi>

                  <p>Yes, <hi>Euistor:</hi> and that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery is the more strange to me, in that he declares in a Physicall sense, <hi>That all these lie in one another</hi>; That <hi>Heaven</hi> is in <hi>Hell,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> is in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>

as to place. Which he would illustrate from Darkness and Light being in the same place together; Darkness presently discovering it self at the removal of the Light.</p>

                  <p>One would think so, <hi>Sophron.</hi> Besides, his dark and light Kingdoms must be purely spiritual, if they lie in the same space with this Out-world, as the Inhabitants also of them, who yet he admits can see one another, I mean those of the same Kingdome, though those of different Kingdoms cannot.</p>

                  <p>That in the Parable is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard to salve.

But admitting they have a Capacity for a time of uniting with the Spirit of this mix'd <hi>Out-world,</hi> in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture they may see one another and discourse with one another.

                  <p>And yet that which is stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>Bathynous,</hi> there are some that profess, (which were a great Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:106935:188"/>
to the truth of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Philosophy if it were certain,) that they have such openings of their brains or eyes that they can see into both those <hi>internall</hi> Kingdoms, and view the marvellous shapes of the Inhabitants of them both.</p>

                  <speaker>Bath.</speaker>
                  <p>That I must confess, <hi>Euistor,</hi> is still more wonderfull, though, upon the Hypothesis I even now hinted, not simply impossible. But we must take heed how we become over-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous in such things. He that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr he has discovered those <hi>internall Worlds</hi> by Sense, must first assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that he is not imposed upon by his Imagination. For Phancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes sometimes <hi>presentificall,</hi> as in Mad-men and those in high Fevers, whose Phantasms seem real externall Objects to them. Nay, it is sometimes so in them that are well and in their wits, either arbitrariously, as in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> or surprisingly, as in severall others I have conversed with, but are so wise as to know it is a phancy, and give it the stop. But if they did
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:106935:188"/>
believe there were such an <hi>internall</hi> World, and did vehemently desire to converse there, how exceeding credible is it that these people would take their inward Phantasms for externall Objects in that <hi>Inward</hi> World!</p>

                  <p>If some number of them that conceive they have recovered the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eye, (which was put out by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall) whereby they can see through the outward eye into the <hi>internall</hi> Worlds, would experiment the seeing of the same Object toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For if they do not see it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the same place and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, it is a shrewd presumption all is but internall phancy.</p>

                  <p>Yet they are not secure but they may be imposed upon by false Reason. For it does not follow for all this they see the Inhabitants of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:106935:189"/>
such an <hi>Internall World</hi> as the <hi>Teuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Philosophy declares for, but the more subtil Inhabitants of the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: For both Air and Aether are the Elements of this Externall world, not of the Internall. And fallen Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits purely Immaterial are to me, I must confess, a great Paradox; or that having material Vehicles they should not have their abode in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Element. Which Element be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Dark world,</hi> it is evident that the <hi>Dark world</hi> cannot be in one place with this <hi>Out-world</hi> but as part of it.

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:106935:189"/>
Heaven and Hell may be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in particular Creatures, what is common administring to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; as the <hi>Seminal Soul</hi> of the World is as busie in forming Toads and poisonous Serpents as in the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most harmless Creatures.</p>

                  <p>I do not deny, <hi>Euistor,</hi> but that both <hi>H. N.</hi> and <hi>I.

                  <p>If this way were taken, my fears and jealousies, O <hi>Philotheus,</hi> were all hush'd, nor could I doubt but the pure Apostolick Religion would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all before it.</p>

For at present, by a kinde of oblique stroke, God does notable execution upon the dead For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality and Carnality of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by these zealous Evangelists of an <hi>internall</hi> Saviour: and if any of them out of mistake and errour should in a manner antiquate that part of Religion that respects the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,</hi> which I hope are not many, nor will be, yet (and mark what I say) if they continue sincere, I do not doubt but they will be fetched in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,

                  <p>That the Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> will neither abrogate what is authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, nor introduce what is new, but be a Restorer onely of what useful Truths or Practices may seem to have been lost in the long delapse of Ages.

                  <p>That's very obvious, O <hi>Philopolis,</hi> to spell out.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:106935:201"/>

                  <speaker>Bath.</speaker>
                  <p>O <hi>Cuphophron</hi> light of belief! Does your Philosophicall Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness permit you to give any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to such things? As if either <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> had any real Conference with the Devil about the Mass; or, if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil did dispute against it, that it was in the behalf of the Reformation. It is true, <hi>Luther</hi> himself, a person of great plainness of heart, and no great <hi>Naturalist,</hi> saies that at midnight he awakening was presently in a Dispute with the Devil, whom he describes speaking with a strong and deep voice to him. But thus has many a man awakened into the perception of a struggling with the Night-mare, or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialtes,</hi> as with some real person, which, when they have been more perfectly awaked, they have found to be nothing else but a Colluctation with their own phancy; the more knowing especially. But the more ignorant and superstitious (and you know, <hi>Luther</hi> had been a long time a
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:106935:201"/>
very devout Monk, whose Cells are full of the stories and phancies of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions and Devils) do ordinarily take such passages for externall Realities. Which I must confess I conceive to be <hi>Luther</hi>'s case: For he had a body and complexion obnoxious to such Illusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But suppose it was not an Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of phancy: It does not presently follow that that invisible <hi>Disputant</hi> was a bad Angel or a Devil. That may be imputed onely to the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of <hi>Luther,</hi> that he thought so, who professes himself no affecter of Dreams nor Visions of Angels. And therefore the good man in an humble ignorance took this Dispute to be an Exagitation of the Devil; but was so sincere a lover of the Truth, that when he was convinced thereof he would not disown it or refuse it, though it had been blown upon by the breath of <hi>Beelzebub:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 16.16.</note> As the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonissa</hi>'s witnessing to the truth of the Gospel in the <hi>Acts</hi> does not put <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of <hi>Christ</hi>'s followers out of conceit with the Christian
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:106935:202"/>
Faith. Nor did the Devil's confessing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 3.11.</note> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> make the Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> less passable with the Apostles or any other Disciples. And therefore last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, admit that it was not a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, but a Devil; it does not follow that the Truth is less Truth, or that it is any Argument against the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or that the Devil began this Dispute with <hi>Luther</hi> in favour of it, but rather of Papism. For he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing how obvious and usefull those Arguments were for the abrogating of the Mass, and that <hi>Luther</hi> could not but hit on them in the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he, like a cunning Sophister, to prevent the ruine of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, suggests these Reasonings to <hi>Luther</hi> betime, that they, being thus disparaged by the first Inventour of them, might doe the less execution against the Mass, and, therewithall, against the whole Lurry of Popish Idolatry and Superstition. For this was a device worthy that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:106935:204"/>
according to the truth of History, the Instruments God made use of in the first Reformation of the Church were not altogether of so unexcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable demeanour and tenour in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice, as that we should much build our faith upon the worth of their persons. But I must confess that <hi>Luther</hi> was one that made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the most obnoxious.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>What you say, <hi>Euistor,</hi> admit it were true, it does not one whit prejudice the cause of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the Reformation is not into the Opinion of any weak and fallible man, but into the knowledge and belief of the infallible Word of God. And therefore it is vainly and to no purpose alledged by the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> That <hi>Luther</hi> was of so big and boisterous a spirit; That he was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of a single life; That he was mistaken in his judgement in severall things, in some things inconstant to himself, vehement and uncontroula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all, and opposing all gainsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with rudeness and bitterness of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:106935:204"/>
speech. For notwithstanding all these Complexionall Infirmities, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but believe that he had a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Sincerity underneath, a firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in God and <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and a lusty Indignation against the bloudy Tyranny, the gross Idolatry and base and unworthy Cheats and Impostures of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whenas, on the contrary, his Antagonist, Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> was not onely an open abettour of these, but a close Infidel or Atheist; as appears by that wicked saying of his to Cardinall <hi>Bembo,</hi> wherein he did insinuate that the whole History of <hi>Christ</hi> is but a mere Fable. Was not <hi>Luther,</hi> think you, holy enough to grapple with such an <hi>Holiness</hi> as this <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth? I must confess I cannot think so very highly of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> as some do, and yet I think him to have been a very happy Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hand of God for the good of Christendome against the horrid Enormities of the Papal Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie. And though he might not be allowed to be the <hi>Elias, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:106935:205"/>
and Chariot of Israel,</hi> as some have styled him; yet I think at least he might be accounted a faithful Postilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that Chariot, who was wel accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with his wax Boots, oiled Coat and Hood, and who turned the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses noses into a direct way from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> toward the City of God, and held on in a good round trot through thick and thin, not caring to bespatter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this high jogg, as he himself was finely bespattered from others.</p>
                  <p>The meaner the <hi>Romanists</hi> make our first Reformers, <hi>Euistor,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter disgrace returns upon themselves, That the Corruptions of their Church were so gross, that even men but of an ordinary life and judgement could both discern them and detest them at once. If God by ordinary Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wrought extraordinary things, the more was his Glory, and the less hazard of eclipsing the luster of the Sacred Apostolicall Foundation, or of disturbing that Number that is so holy and celebrious in both Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Prophecy throughout the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:106935:205"/>
Scripture. <hi>Vnexceptionable Reformers</hi> had been a means rather to captivate us again to <hi>the flesh,</hi> to carnal respects and personal Dotages, then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the <hi>Dispensation of the Spirit,</hi> which must be the upshot of all. The Ministry of <hi>Luther</hi> and the Reformers was rather to recover to us the use of the Scripture, then to dictate a Law to us from their own infallible and unexceptionable worth; to break off the Papal Yoke, rather then to put us into new Fetters. The Word of God then it was, hid like a precious Cabinet, and sunk in that <hi>Augeae stabulum,</hi> the overflowing Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and down-bearing Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which that noble Heros <hi>Luther,</hi> like another <hi>Hercules,</hi> by removing the filth, was to bring into the sight of the world again. And would you then have had him and his Fellow-labourers (not such as they were, but) such pure, spruce Gentlemen, in white <hi>Spanish</hi>-leather Pumps, in clean Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Stockins and Holland Doublets,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:106935:206"/>
with all other correspondent Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy and unexceptionable Neatness? and in this pure and splendid plight to have taken into hand their Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells, Wheel-barrows and Muck-forks, to rid away this stinking Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill? <hi>Christ</hi> did not owe his wicked Corrivall for the Government of the World so much respect. And for such course work, there was more need of a resolute robustuous courage, such as <hi>Luther</hi> had, then of any such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Sanctimony or accuracy of Wit and Judgement, as not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken tripping any-where in either Reason or Conversation.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all Arguments against the Reformation from the quality of the Reformers are very weak, both because they were substantial good men in the main, notwithstanding what oversights soever they may be pretended to have committed through humour or passion or una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable surprize; and also because it is not their Authority we stand to in matters of Religion, but to the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:106935:206"/>
Scripture, in the Recovery of the use and enjoyment whereof they were gloriously instrumental; and lastly, because all their particular judgements are swallowed up, not to be seen nor look'd upon any farther then they appear in the common judgement of Reformed Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome represented in the Harmonie of their publick Confessions. But for God's carrying on the Reformation in particular Circumstances, in his taking the Kingdome to himself and judging the little Horn, if all be not so plain and pervious to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings; yet let us the rather take up the Psalmist's form of Devotion, and say,<note place="margin">Psalm 97<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1, 2.</note>

I am very well assured that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Genius</hi> of that Church, they do in many things most wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calumniate; and that those that are not Calumnies as concerning Fact, are no such horrid Crimes as theirs that accuse them, but more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Infirmities or less commendable Humours.

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:106935:207"/>
consequence to be known, believed, and declared in the Kingdome of <hi>Christ,</hi> to settle them and establish them in the Profession they are in. For it is not at all beyond the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the meanest to be fully ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of this Truth.

For if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>Babylon,</hi> as most certainly it is, then think you with your self, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolis,</hi> what mighty force that voice of the Angel will have in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse, Come out of her,</hi>

upon the multifarious gross Idolatries and bloudy Cruelties of the Papacy, and compare them with the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (whose very Whoredome signifies her Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, <hi>upon whose forehead is written,</hi>

a great deal of either Unskilfulness, or Unfaithfulness to the Interest of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Kingdome, that any should persuade us in our Oppositions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Rome</hi> to lay aside this weapon, whenas indeed, as <hi>David</hi> said to <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melek</hi> concerning the sword of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah, there is none like unto it.</hi>

For we have more strings to our bow then one. For none of those Titles that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be perstringed by in the Propheticall parts of Scripture, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the Seat of Antichrist, that Man of sin, or the like, do necessarily infer they are not a true Church, but an extremely-faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Church, and such, as God would have his people forsake their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, if they will not reform, as forfeiting their Salvation by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:106935:209"/>
of such sins as have passed among them into a Law. A Wife that is an Adulteress is a true Wife, till she be divorced, though a faithless one; and a Ship with an hole at the bottom is a true Ship; and an House whose Walls are besmeared with the Plague or Leprosie, or infested with murtherous Goblins, is a true House; but that not to be sailed in, nor this to be inhabited, before they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to an useful and safe condition. The Form of a thing makes it to be true; but the Sincerity or Integrity of it makes it to reach its end, and become useful. Wine is still Wine, though some drops of Poison be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd into it; but it's such as no man that knows thereof will adventure to drink. We will therefore grant that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church, but in such a sense as a Ship that will sink a man to the bottome of the Sea is a true Ship, or such an House as I described a true House. Nay, we will concede that it is the House or Temple of God, but such
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:106935:210"/>
as wherein the Man of sin sits, <hi>that son of Perdition,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Thess. 2.3, 4.</note> that <hi>exalts himself above all that is called God or worshipped.</hi> Wherefore I say, those reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and reprochful expressions of Scripture against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do not imply her to be no true Church, but a very impure and faulty one, and grown not onely not useful to them that adhere to her, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely mischievous. She is a Cup of Wine mixt with deadly Poison in it, an House infected with the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or infested with wicked Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Wherefore if we succeed in the true pattern of the House or Ship, in the sincere nature of the Wine, in the due Offices of a Wife, and leave out the Adultery, the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the Plague, the Leprosie, and the Devil himself, is our Succession the less perfect? If a Family were once sound, and then diseased for some Ages, and then some of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily by skill in Physick or more then ordinary Temperance should grow sound again; are these sound branches
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:106935:210"/>

                  <p>I think the sounder the better Family, as being of a nearer affinity or consanguinity with the most ancient Progenitours of them all. And therefore, questionless, we are not the less of the Succession of the Apostles for cleansing our selves from After-corruptions, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our selves to their ancient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Purity. The Succession in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is continued in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a diseased Family is the Continuation of the Family of their Ancestours; but the Apostolicall Succession is not onely continued, but rectified again and perfected in the Reformation. So that I conceive there is no hazard at all to Succession in admitting those due, but sharp, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> and other places of Scripture to belong to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they all not amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the making her no true Church, or no Church, but an Idolatrous one,

a Murtherous one, and an Impostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous one. As an adulterous, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous and cheating Wife is a Wife, and therefore a true Wife, till she be dead or divorced.</p>

                  <p>Surely he is, <hi>Bathynous,</hi> or else he is not absolute Sovereign. For I conceive that to be the Supreme to which is committed both the trust and power of ordering all for the welfare of the Subject, which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently must needs include Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which therefore of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Supremacy is Judge. Whence
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:106935:212"/>
every supreme Magistrate is, if not formally, yet eminently, as well Priest as King; else he were not King, or the King not supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, as being bound to be ruled by the judgement of the Priest in matters of Religion; which unquestionably all Mundane Affairs ought to stoop to. Whence it will follow, that all Power that does not include the Priesthood in it, at least eminently or virtually, must stoop to that Judicature. But being the Supremacy of any Nation is to stoop to none but God, it is plain that he that is Supreme has at least virtually the Sacerdotal Power in himself.</p>

                  <p>This is an excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple indeed, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> and has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it a comfortable Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for all those that live under Princes that as yet are not converted to the <hi>pure</hi> Faith of the Gospell, but are still captivated to the Religion of <hi>Rome.</hi> But as for your Politicall Principle of alwaies running coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to that Church in what-ever they seem so notorious, I doubt how that will alwaies hold.

                  <p>Alas, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was not that we should run counter to them in any good things they boast of, but in those bad things they have. They are divided into
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:106935:220"/>
multitudes of Opinions amongst themselves as well as others are: And in those things they seem uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally united in, they are rather forcibly held together by externall awe, and fear of being burnt, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their throats cut, then out of plain Conviction of Conscience that the Points they universally profess are true. This is not <hi>Vnion of Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> but the cramming and crouding disunited dust, feathers and straws, and tying them up close in one bag. This is all the union they have in their universal Profession. But why this should be called <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Vnion,</hi> thus by a barbarous force and compulsion to make a company of men profess and practise the same things, be they never so Idolatrous or wicked, I understand not. Nor know I what is, if this be not, an <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> or <hi>Communion Antichristian.</hi> Wherefore we run opposite enough to them, if we set up against their <hi>Antichristian Vnion</hi> an <hi>Vnion</hi> which is truely and really <hi>Christian.</hi> Which
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:106935:221"/>

                  <p>This I conceive would confer much thereto, if all Opinions and Practices in Religion that either hinder or do not promote the <hi>Life of God</hi> in the world were universally undervalued by the Church of God. For in this <hi>Life of God</hi> is his <hi>Spirit.</hi> And by this means all opportunity and pretense of any one's shewing himself to be religious, but wherein true Religion doth consist, being quite cut off, men that would be thought at all religious must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the imitation of that <hi>Life</hi> we speak of, to approve themselves such.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:106935:221"/>
Which they will do very lamely without the presence of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And all occasions of squabbling and contention about the Shadows and Coverings of Opinions and Forms being thus removed and taken out of the way, it will be far easier to perform what the Apostle exhorts to,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.3.</note> namely, <hi>To keep the Vnity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> For no man then shall be able to bustle with any credit, unless it be in the behalf of what tends to the good of the people of God and of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
                  <p>But of those externall Coverings hear what the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth: <hi>Wo to the rebellious children,</hi>

                     <hi>saith the Lord, that take counsell, but not of me, and that cover with a Covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin.</hi> This is the false Covering of Opinions and Formalities heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Ignorance or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie of men, whereby they would hide themselves, as <hi>Adam,</hi> from the eyes of their Maker. But God has
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:106935:222"/>
foretold that those of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the Souldiers of the Lamb,<note place="margin">Isa. 25.7.</note> 
                     <hi>shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the face of the Covering cast over all people, and the Veil that is spread over all Nations.</hi> And then they must either be cloathed with the <hi>Covering of the Spirit,</hi>

Thus should we approch nearer to that Type of the best state of the Church figured out in the form of the Cherubims or the four Beasts, where the <hi>Eagle</hi> is conceived to have the <hi>foot of an Oxe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 55.2.</note> none of them <hi>labour for that which is not bread.</hi> Wherefore the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Formalities and Opinions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lessened according to their useles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and consequently being but few and profitable, all the Church will easily understand their importance and truth: As all the four Beasts are said to be <hi>full of eyes,</hi> (in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to that blinde Obedience cried up in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church;) and so throughly discerning the same Object, and therewithall passing the same

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:106935:227"/>

                  <p>I acknowledge, O <hi>Sophron,</hi> that Divine Providence might permit such misinterpretable Expressions in some of the first Reformers. But you know, <hi>Luther</hi> himself, who is most suspected, yet wrote against the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi>: and the Harmonie of Confessions of all the Protestant Churches adjoyns the Doctrine of Sanctification or a Good life to that of Justification by Faith. But that such a pitch of Holiness as we now treat of should have been exacted so zealously by the first Reformers from their Followers, seems not congruous nor seasonable for those Times. The over-severe Inculcation of such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in opposition to the false Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of <hi>Romanism</hi> would have drawn away but few Auditours from that Church, whose Sanctity was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carnal. They would have thought they had been to be led out of a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Bondage or Captivity into a
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:106935:228"/>
greater; and so that small distinct Number of the immaculate Lambs of <hi>Christ</hi> had been a more certain, as well as a more delicious, Morsell for that devouring Wolf of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>After this I looked up, and behold in the East a large white Cloud, which came sailing as it were with a cool and refreshing gale of wind toward an exceeding high Mountain, at a certain distance from which the second <hi>Coruscation</hi> discharged it self from this Cloud. Whereupon I heard a more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Thunderclap re-echoing through the Air, and the Cloud breaking a-pieces, I saw a most glorious City lightly descending, carried in the stream of this cool breeze obliquely downward, and so settling at last on the Top of this high Mountain.</p>
                  <p>But I had not long fed mine eyes with so beautifull a Sight, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:106935:236"/>
from over the City a bright <hi>Coruscation</hi> broke forth, so great and so glorious, from the pure Sky, that the light of the Heavens was sevenfold more clear then the light of the Sun. Upon which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately I heard from thence the voice of the third Thunder, and thereupon as it were the voice of a Man, tunable and articulate, saying, <hi>Hallelujah.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 19.6.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord reigneth.</hi> And suddenly after a whole Quire of voices seconded this first Voice, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Hallelujah.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm 87.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Glorious things are spoken of thee, O thou City of God. The Mountain of the Lord's House is established on the top of the Mountains,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 2.2.</note> 
                     <hi>and all Nations flow unto it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 21.24.</note> 
                     <hi>The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them that are saved walk in the light of it, and the Kings of the Earth do bring their glory and honour unto it. Hallelujah.</hi> Which Heavenly and enravishing Melodie was heard from the Holy City for the space of four hours.</p>
                  <p>After this I cast mine eyes toward the West, and I saw a large Cloud of
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:106935:236"/>
two colours, black and pitchy on the West part thereof, and of a bright shining colour toward the East. And lo, of a sudden the fourth Thunder uttered its voice from the West-side of the Cloud, and discharged it self upon certain hollow Rocks and Mountains, tearing them a-pieces, and rending open their infernall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns. While in the mean time there issued out on the East-side a strong Wind, but pure and refreshing, which dividing into severall parts that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned round became so many innocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Whirl-winds of sincere Air, tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured onely with a cool refreshing smell, as if it had passed over some large field of Lilies and Roses. Which Whirl-winds moved from man to man, lifting them somewhat from the Earth, and so letting them easily down again; but left a Mark upon the Bodies of every one they thus lifted, and a sweet Savour on themselves and on their Garments. And the number of them thus lifted and marked is the number of the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:106935:237"/>
Companies of the Lamb, and their number was 1728. But in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern part of Heaven the Air was ill-sented by reason of the Fumes from those dark Caves, out of which were seen to come many direfull and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Forms, with part of their melted Chains (which the Thunder-clap had broke a-pieces) hanging upon their bodies. Which Hellish Shapes ran up and down after men upon the face of the Earth, catching them and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon them a poisonous breath that corrupted their bodies, and made them look black and deformed like Devils. But the lifted Companies were too light-footed for them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they any power over them, because they bore the Mark of the Lamb upon their bodies.</p>
                  <p>These things I saw under the voice of the fourth Thunder. After which I beheld, and lo, the whole Heaven was overcast with Clouds, especially toward the bottom: And immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fifth Thunder uttered its voice. And there was a re-echoing noise
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:106935:237"/>
round about the Heavens, like the beating of Drums. Whereupon I saw innumerable Armies of men from the four Quarters of the Earth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching up toward the Holy City, to lay close Siege unto it.<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.9.</note> And they <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed the Camp of the Saints round about.</hi> And I was in an exceeding great fear and trembling.</p>
                  <p>But in the midst of this solicitude there came a large flash of Lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the East, which shone unto the West, and the sixth Thunder ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered its voice. And I saw the Clouds rent from the Horizon upwards, and they were parted toward the North and toward the South like the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of an opened Tent or Canopie. Whereupon a marvellous Light sprung up very fast from that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the voice of the Thunder was immediately drowned with a terrible sound of a Trumpet which filled the whole Concave of the Heavens, and made the Ground tremble under mens feet.<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.11.</note> And lo, there suddenly appeared <hi>a great white Throne</hi> arched
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:106935:238"/>
like a Rain-bow, with the Son of man <hi>sitting upon it</hi> with glory and great majesty, <hi>from whose face the Earth and Heavens fled away, and there was found no place for them.</hi> And the dead all appeared before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of God, and <hi>the Books were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And they whose names were written in <hi>the Book of Life,</hi> their strength was renew'd unto them, and they mounted up with wings like Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and associated themselves with the Angels of God. But the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and Prophane were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whose hearts grew more heavy then lead, and became the dregs and sediment of the World, Fear and Despair sinking them down; while Joy and Assurance lifted up the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere into those more defecate Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the whole Sky was filled with Myriads of myriads of Shapes in this great Compearance; where the purer Spirits ascended upwards, and the more gross were precipitated downwards, by the stupendious ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the great Refiner of the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:106935:238"/>
Universe. And I saw the Good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly separated from the Wicked, and the King of Glory rise from his Throne. And this general Assises was turned suddenly into a Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Pomp to the Godly, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching orderly in the open Sky with the rest of the Army of the great King, with such splendour and luster as is ineffable; their Mouths also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with Songs of Victory, and their Ears with the Echo of their own Melodie. For the Air was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously tuned into Musicall Accents to their Divine Ditties, as if some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible hand had play'd upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave of the Heavens as upon some well-strung Harpsicall or Theorbo. So that my Soul was so enravished with the sight and with the Musick, that my Heart melted, mine Eyes flowed over with tears, and my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits failed within me, for very excess of Joy.</p>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly <hi>Theomanes</hi> was in a very great Rapture when he was thus affected.</p>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>And he was thus really af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> as he told me; and I dare believe him: for he is a man of the greatest Simplicity imaginable.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>But I have interrupted you again, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> before I was aware. I pray you go on.</p>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>But part of this pleasure was quickly intercepted by a sudden overcasting of the Heavens as it were with an universal thick Cloud of a rusty hue. But I heard the Musick still, whereby I might discern the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that Triumphal Pomp. But a more dreadfull noise presently put an end to that Rapture also. For this Cloud of Night broke into a Chasm near the celestial Army, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly filled with a most glorious Light, and through that lucid passage I heard a mighty voice like the sound of a Trumpet saying, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner and Continuer and Ender of Ages. I am he that lived and was dead, and behold I am alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and have the Keys of Hell and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:106935:239"/>
Death.</hi> Whereupon the Chasm clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed again, and the Souls of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken were filled with horrour. For they presently expected the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that dreadful Sentence,<note place="margin">Matt. 25.41.</note> 
                     <hi>Go ye accursed into everlasting Fire.</hi> And indeed after some pause and silence, (wherein I again heard that Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Melodie, but a little farther off, that Triumphant Company ascending higher and higher through the bright azure fields of peacefull Bliss) the arched roof of this hollow Dungeon seemed all on fire with cross Flashings and Lightenings running all over. Which had no sooner ceased, but the seventh Thunder uttered its voice, which was accompanied with a rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tearing noise every way over the whole Sky. Whereupon the Clouds set a-raining one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall sad and direful showr of Fire and Brimstone upon this forlorn Crew, till the whole Earth became but as one round Lake or Pond of burning Sulphur.<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.15.</note> And <hi>whosoever had not his name found in the Book of Life,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:106935:240"/>
his portion was in this Lake of fire burning with Brimstone;</hi>

                  <p>This is <hi>Theomanes</hi> his Vision, O <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolis,</hi> of the seven Thunders. Which contains in it the most distinct order and succession of Affairs in the Church, from the beginning of the seventh Trumpet to the end of all things, that I ever met with. I must confess the Distinctions are but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: but if I had had any thing more precise and particular, that great sincerity and nobleness of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and hearty love and zeal for the Interest of the Kingdome of God, which I persuade my self I discern in you, would have obliged me to have imparted it to you with a very good will.</p>

                  <p>I give you many thanks, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> for your good opinion and bountiful intention.

                  <p>I thought there was some such meaning of this Vision, and plainly see, through the <hi>Symbols</hi> and <hi>Iconisms</hi> of it, that there is nothing contained in it that is at all dangerous or Heterodox.

himself well pleased with the Reasonableness and Usefulness of the Vision. For he professes it conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to both Scripture and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and has taken notice severall times in my hearing how useful it is, both for the digesting all those Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> that appertain to the last Trumpet into their right Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der according to Synchronism; and also to discover the Ignorance of some that have pretended to Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who guessing that the last Trumpet is the Trumpet of the last Judgement in a <hi>Politicall</hi> sense, but not discerning these distinct parts of it, (I mean the distribution thereof into the seven Thunders) have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to conclude, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Apostolick Faith, that there is no other Judgement but this, nor any other Trumpet to raise the Dead, and to summon them before the Tribunal of <hi>Christ,</hi> then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelization of a certain Doctrine of their own broaching. But assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> that Resurrection
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:106935:242"/>
which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> treats of in his first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is not a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> nor <hi>Politicall</hi> Resurrection, (as cannot but be palpably manifest to any one that impartially peruses his Discourse;) and therefore the last Trumpet there mentioned cannot bear a mere <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Politicall</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: As it is manifest that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in his first to the <hi>Thessalonians, For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout,</hi>

to be afraid to admit of such Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as did onely seal his Imagination but with such Truths as Scripture and Reason had assured him of before. Besides, that he does not pretend that this Vision of the seven Thunders is the disclosing those seven <hi>Oracles</hi> or <hi>Voices</hi> then uttered so S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> which he was prohibited to write, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven distinctions of Affairs succeeding in the seventh Trumpet, which this Impression bore him into a belief of being <hi>synchronall</hi> to the seven Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And there being just seven ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Successions of Affairs typified by those Visions in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> appertaining to the seventh Trumpet, to which all other may be reduced as synchronall, it seems to be a great Ratification of the purport of this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But it would be too tedious to make out all this to you, <hi>Philopolis,</hi> at this time.</p>

            <head>A brief DISCOURSE Of the <hi>true</hi> Grounds of The <hi>Certainty</hi> of FAITH IN Points of Religion.</head>
            <p>FAith and Belief, though they be usually appropriated to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, yet those words in themselves signifie nothing else but a Persuasion touching the Truth of a thing arising from some Ground or other. Which Persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be undoubted or certain to <hi>us,</hi> that is to say, <hi>We</hi> may be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persuaded without any staggering, though the Grounds be false, and the Thing it self false that we are thus firmly persuaded of. So that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly persuaded is no sure sign
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:106935:249"/>
to others, nor ought to be to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that either the Grounds or the Belief it self is true. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may very well arise from an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Peculiarity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion or the Besottedness of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may be so prevalent, as very forcibly to urge Falshood upon our belief, as well in things Natural as Religious, either upon very weak and false Grounds, or no other Grounds at all but that of <hi>Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Education, Passion,</hi> or <hi>Interest,</hi> or the like.</p>
            <p>But the true Grounds of the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Faith are such as do not onely beget a certain and firm Faith, but a true one, and this in virtue of their own Truth and Solidity, as being such as will appear true and solid to all impartial and unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Examiners, that is to say, to all such as neither <hi>Complexion,</hi> nor <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> nor <hi>Passion,</hi> nor <hi>Interest</hi> does pervert their Judgement, but have their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> clear as the Eye to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:106935:249"/>
Colours. Whence it is plain that the first and most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Preparation to the Discovery of the true Grounds of the Certainty of Faith is <hi>Moral Prudence,</hi> in such a sense as the nature of it is described in a late Moral Discourse entitled <hi>Enchiridion Ethicum, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. This ought to be antecedaneous to our judgement touching either <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority</hi> or <hi>Reason.</hi> But for a man of a polluted spirit to take upon him to dissent from the Constitutions of the Church he is born under, is a very rash and insolent Attempt. As if God were more bound to assist a single <hi>Wicked</hi> man for the finding out of Truth, then a multitude; or as if a man could more safely or more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditably err alone, then with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that has the stamp of Autority upon them. But if thy endeavour be to perfect Holiness in the fear of God, and to walk in all Humility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him and before men, thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est by such rational Grounds as these examine the Fidelity of thy Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:106935:250"/>
and the truth of their Doctrines of Religion.</p>
            <p>First then, It is plain that <hi>Certainty of Faith</hi> presupposeth <hi>Certainty</hi> of both <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi> rightly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiated. For, forasmuch as <hi>Faith</hi> properly so called is nothing but an unwavering Assent to some Doctrine proposed upon the ground of infallible Testimonie, there must be some <hi>Reason</hi> to persuade us that that Testimony is infallible; that is to say, that they that testifie are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obnoxious to Errour in the things they witness of, nor have a mind to make others to erre or to think what is false, or else that they never had any opportunity of falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying in the Points they propound to our Belief. <hi>Certainty of Sense</hi> is also required. For if the Sense be not certain, there could be no infallible Testimony of matter of Fact, and <hi>Moses</hi>'s conversing with God in the Mount may be but a Dream; nor could there be any certain Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of our Saviour's Resurrection
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:106935:250"/>
and Ascension, if God will delude our Senses. Wherefore to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>Certainty of Sense</hi> rightly circumstantiated, is to take away all Certainty of Belief in the main Points of our Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sense and Reason are rightly circumstantiated, the one, when the Organ is sound, the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> fitly qualified, and the distance of the Object duely proportionated, and the like; the other, when it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Moral Prudence</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called, such as it is defined in the above-said <hi>Enchiridion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> that is to say, That this Reason be lodged either in a perfectly-unprejudiced Mind, or at least unprejudiced touching the Point propounded. For there are some Truths so clear, that Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it self (provided it do not besot a man or make him quite mad) puts no bar to the assenting to them, that is, puts no bar to their appearing to be true, no more then it does to the Eye unhurt to the discerning of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; which the Wicked and Godly
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:106935:251"/>
do alike upon this Supposition. Wherefore</p>
            <p>The third Conclusion shall be, That there be Natural Truths, whether <hi>Logicall, Physicall,</hi> or <hi>Mathematicall,</hi> that are so palpably true, that they constantly and perpetually appear so as well to the Wicked as the Good, if they be <hi>Compotes mentis,</hi> and do not manifest violence to their Faculties.</p>
            <p>The fourth, That these Natural Truths, whether Common Notions or Scientificall Conclusions, that are so palpably true that they perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appear so as well to the evil as the good, are at least as certain and indubitable as any thing that the Reason and Understanding of a man can give assent to, that is to say, There is at least as great a Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of these Axiomes that they are true, as there can be of any. And therefore, because there is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a Certainty in some Points that our Understanding and Reason closeth with, let us set down for</p>
            <p>The fifth Conclusion, That these
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:106935:251"/>
Natural Truths that constantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear such as well to the evil as the good (if they be not crack'd-brained nor do violence to their Faculties) are in themselves most certainly true.</p>
            <p>The sixth, That what is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to a certain Truth is not onely uncertain, but necessarily false: forasmuch as both the parts of a Contradiction cannot be true.</p>
            <p>The seventh, That no Revelation which either it self, or the Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, or its manner of Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is repugnant to the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, can be from God.</p>
            <p>The eighth, That no Tradition of any such Revelation can be true, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the Revelation it self is impossible.</p>
            <p>The ninth, That no Revelation is from God that is repugnant to Sense rightly circumstantiated. This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest from the first Ground, That Certainty of Faith presupposeth Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Sense duly circumstantiated. For if our Senses may be mistaken
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:106935:252"/>
when they act in due Circumstances, we cannot be assured that they are at any time true. Which necessarily destroys the Certainty of all Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>ab extra</hi> and of all Tradition, and consequently of our Christian Religion. Wherefore God cannot be the Authour of any such Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, by Conclusion the seventh: For it were repugnant to his Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodness.</p>
            <p>The tenth, That no Revelation is from God that contradicts plain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Truths, such as were above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. This is abundantly clear from Conclusion the 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. For if Reason where it is clearest is false, we have no assurance it is ever true, and therefore no Certainty of Faith, which presupposes Reason, by Conclusion the first. Besides, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion the sixth, That which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to a certain Truth is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly false: But Divine Revelation is true: Therefore there can be no Revelation from God that bears with it such a Contradiction. Nay we may
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:106935:252"/>
adde, That if there were any Divine Truth that would constantly appear to Reason rightly circumstantiated contradictory to any constant Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Truth, God would not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any such Truth to men, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion the seventh. For the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such a Truth were repugnant to his Attribute of Wisedome, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereby true Religion as obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to suspicion and exception as false. For there is no greater exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption against the Truth of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then that it proposes Articles that are repugnant to Common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or indubitable Science. Besides that one such pretense of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation would enable a false Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to fill the World with Figments and Lies. Wherefore God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the Authour of so much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to mankind. And lastly, since the first Revelation must be handed down by Tradition, and Tradition being but humane Testimony, and infinitely more lubricous and fallible then the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or natural Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:106935:253"/>
how will it be possible for any but Sots or Fools to believe Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against solid Science or a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notion? So that the Result must needs be either blinde Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gross Irreligion, or universal Scepticism.</p>
            <p>The eleventh, That no Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that enforces, countenances, or abetts Immorality or Dishonesty can be from God. This is manifested from the seventh Conclusion. For it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to God's Attributes, his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Fidelity, Goodness, and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Sanctity. The Image of God is Righteousness and true Holiness: Wherefore no Doctrine that tends to Injustice, Unrighteousness and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can be a Revelation from God.</p>
            <p>The twelfth, That no Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Divine Revelation that is repugnant to <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumstantiated, or to plain and indubitable <hi>Morality,</hi> whether it be made by a private or publick hand, can be any Inspiration from God. There needs no new Confirmation of
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:106935:253"/>
this Conclusion. For the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that prove that no Divine Revelation can be in this sort repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, do prove also that no Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any Revelation in this sort repugnant to <hi>Sense, Reason</hi> or sound <hi>Morality,</hi> can be Divine.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth, That no Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Divine Writ that justifies Sedition, Rebellion, or Tyranny, can be any Inspiration from God. This is easily evinced from the foregoing Conclusion. For Sedition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion are gross and ponderous <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of <hi>Injustice</hi> against the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, as Tyranny is also against the People; both such high strains of <hi>Immorality,</hi> that no Interpretation of Scripture that justifies these can be true, much less Divinely inspired.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth, No Church that propounds as Articles of Belief such things as are repugnant to rightly-circumstantiated <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> or sound <hi>Morality,</hi> can rightly be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Infallible. The reason is plain: For it appears out of what has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:106935:254"/>
been said, that they are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy actually deceived, or at least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deceive others.</p>
            <p>The fifteenth, That the Certainty of Faith cannot be grounded upon the Infallibility of any Church, <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> or <hi>universal,</hi> as infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired, that is deprehended to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deceived in any Points she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses to be believed as necessary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith. This is so plain, that it wants no farther proof.</p>
            <p>The sixteenth, That the <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Humane Certainty</hi> of Faith is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Certainty of <hi>Vniversal Tradition, Prophecy, History,</hi> and <hi>the Nature of the things delivered,</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Sense assisting the Minde in her Disquisitions touching these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. That <hi>Certainty of Faith</hi> I call <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> that is competible even to a carnal man or a man unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; as it is said of the Devils, that they believe and tremble. By <hi>Vniversal Tradition</hi> I understand such a Tradition as has been from the Apostles, that is to say, has been <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi>
               <pb n="479" facs="tcp:106935:254"/>
(since the completion of their Apostleships,) as well as in <hi>every place</hi> of the Church. For since there was to be so general and so early a Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of the Church as is witnessed of in the Holy Scriptures, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Votes of the Church was not alwaies a sufficient warrant of the truth of Tradition. But those Truths that have been constantly held and unalterably from the Apostles times til now, it is a sign that they were very Sacred, unquestionable and assured Truths, and so vulgarly and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally known and acknowledged, that it was not in man's power to alter them. By <hi>Prophecy</hi> I understand as well those Divine Predictions of the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> as those touching the Church after he had come. By <hi>History</hi> I mean not onely that of the Bible, and particularly the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, but other History as well Ecclesiastick as Prophane. And what I mean by the <hi>Nature of the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered</hi> is best to be understood out of such Treatises as write of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:106935:255"/>
of Christianity, such as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s late Book. See also Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> where the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Christian Faith is more fully represented, and plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, <note n="*" place="margin">Book 7. chap. 9, 10, 11.</note> that it has not been in the power of the Church to deceive us as touching the main Points of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, though they would.</p>
            <p>The seventeenth, That no Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more universal and certain then the Tradition of the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickness of such Books of the Bible as all Churches are agreed upon to be Canonicall. There can be no more certain nor universal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then this; in that it has the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the whole Church and all the parts thereof with one Consent, though in other things they do so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently disagree. Wherefore no Tradition can be of any comparable Autority to this. And therefore we may set down for Conclusion</p>
            <p>The eighteenth, That the Bible is the truest Ground of the Certainty
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:106935:255"/>
of Faith that can be offered to our Understanding to rest in. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because it is the most univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal both for time and place, the most unexceptionable and universally-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Tradition that is.</p>
            <p>The nineteenth, That the Bible or Holy Writ dictated by the Spirit of God, that is, written by Holy and Inspired men, is sufficiently plain to an unprejudiced Capacity in all Points necessary to Salvation. This must of necessity be true by Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the seventh. Otherwise the manner of Gods's revealing his Truth in the Holy Scriptures would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Divine Attributes, and, which were Blasphemy to utter, he would seem unskilfully to have inspired the Holy Pen-men, that is to say, in such a way as were not at all accommodate to the end of the Scriptures, which is the Salvation of mens Souls; nor to have provided for the Recovering of the Church out of those gross Errours he both fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw and foretold she would fall into.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="482" facs="tcp:106935:256"/>The twentieth, That the true and primarie Sense of Holy Scripture is <hi>Literal</hi> or <hi>Historicall,</hi> unless in such Parts or Passages thereof as are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to be <hi>Parables</hi> or <hi>Visions</hi> writ in the <hi>Prophetick</hi> style, or the <hi>literal</hi> Meaning be repugnant to rightly-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiated Sense or natural Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For then it is a sign that the Place is to be understood <hi>Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> or <hi>Parabolically,</hi> not <hi>Literally.</hi> The truth of this appears out of the immediately-foregoing Conclusion. For else the Scripture would not be sufficiently plain in all Points neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation: Indeed in no Points at all: but all the Articles of our Faith that respect the History of <hi>Christ</hi> might be most frivolously and whifflingly allegorized into a mere Romance or Fable. But that the History of <hi>Christ</hi> is literally to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, is manifest both from the Text it self, and from perpetuall and universal Tradition. Which if it were not the right Sense, it were a sign that it is writ exceedingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:106935:256"/>
even in the chief Points: which is contrary to the foregoing Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But that those Places or Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages that are repugnant to rightly-circumstantiated Sense or natural Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are to be interpreted <hi>figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> is plain from the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all men, in that they univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally agree, when <hi>Christ</hi> says, <hi>I am the Door, I am the true Vine,</hi> &amp;c. That these things cannot be literally true. And there is the same reason of <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum,</hi> This is my Body.</p>
            <p>The twenty first, That no Point of Faith professed from the Apostles time to this very day, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all Churches in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but is plainly revealed in the Scripture. This may be partly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued out of the nineteenth and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Conclusions, and also farther proved by comparing these Points of Faith with Texts of Scripture touching the same matter.</p>
            <p>The twenty second, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of these Points of Faith
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:106935:257"/>
               <hi>always</hi> and <hi>every-where</hi> held by all Christian Churches from the Apostles time till now, and so plain by Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scripture, is most rightfully termed the <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The twenty third, That there is a <hi>Divine Certainty</hi> of Faith, which, besides the Grounds that the <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Humane Certainty</hi> hath, is support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and corroborated by the <hi>Spirit of Life in the new Birth,</hi> and by <hi>illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Reason.</hi> This is not to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, but to be felt. In the mean time no more is asserted then this, That this <hi>Divine Certainty</hi> has an higher Degree of Firmness and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the truth of the Holy Scriptures, as having partaken of the same Spirit with our Saviour and the Apostles, but does not vary in the Truths held in the common Faith.</p>
            <p>The twenty fourth, What-ever pretended Inspiration or Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Oracles is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the above-described <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick</hi> Faith is
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:106935:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Imposture or Falshood, be it from a private hand or publick. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is apparent, because the Articles of this Common Faith were the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men truely inspired from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and the Spirit of God cannot contradict it self.</p>
            <p>The twenty fifth, None of the Holy Writ is of it self unintelligible, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as mens spirits shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and the time sutable; as God has already, so he may (as Seasons shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) still impart farther and farther Light to the Souls of the Faithfull, for a fuller and a more general under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the obscurest Passages in the Divine Oracles. The truth of this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion is so clear, that it seems little better then Blasphemie to contradict it. For to say the Holy Writ is in it self unintelligible, is equivalent to the pronouncing it Non-sense: or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre that such and such Books or Passages of it were never to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by <hi>men,</hi> is to insinuate as if the Wisedome of God did not onely play with the children of men, but even
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:106935:258"/>
fool with them. This is but a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge of that conscious Church that is afraid of the fulgour of that Light that shines against her out of such places of Scripture as have for a long time seemed obscure.</p>
            <p>The twenty sixth, That there are innumerable Passages of Scripture, as well <hi>Preceptive</hi> as <hi>Historicall,</hi> that are as plainly to be understood as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Articles of the <hi>common Faith,</hi> and which therefore may be very usefull for the clearing those that may seem more obscure. This wants no proof but Appeal to Experience and the twentieth Conclusion.</p>
            <p>The twenty seventh, That no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, though done by such as may seem of an unexceptionable Life and of more singular Sanctity, can in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ratifie any Doctrine or Practice that is repugnant to rightly-circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated Sense, or Natural Truths or Science, or the common Christian Faith, or any plain Doctrine or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion in Scripture. The Truth of this is manifest from hence, That no
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:106935:258" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man can be so certain that such a man is not a crafty and cautious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and his Miracle either a Juggle or Delusion of the Devil, or (if he was not an eye-witness of it) a false report of a Miracle, as he is certain of the truth of rightly-circumstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sense, of Common Notions and Natural Science, of the Articles of the Apostolick Faith, or of any plain As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion in the Scripture. And therefore that which is most certain in this case ought in all reason to be our Guide.</p>
            <p>The twenty eighth, That it is not onely the <hi>Right</hi> but the <hi>Duty</hi> of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men to converse with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, being once but precautioned not to presume to interpret any thing against rightly-circumstantiated Sense, Natural Truth, common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, the Analogie of the Catholick Faith, or against other plain Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Holy Writ. The truth of this appears from the Conclusion immediately preceding. For why should they be kept from having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to so many and so profitable
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:106935:259"/>
and powerful Instructions from an infallible Spirit, when they are so well fore-armed against all Mistake, and are so laid-at by so many not onely fallible but fallacious and deceitful persons to seduce them? And why is there not more danger of being led into Errour by such as are not onely fallible, but false and deceitfull, then by those Inspired men that wrote the Scripture, who were neither fallible in what they wrote, nor had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to deceive any man? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there being no such safe Guide as the Scripture it self, which speaks without any Passion, Fraud or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, it is not onely the <hi>Right</hi> but the <hi>Duty</hi> of every one to consult with the Scripture, and observe his times of conversing with it, as he tenders the Salvation of his own Soul.</p>
            <p>The twenty ninth, That even a private man assisted by the <hi>Spirit of Life in the new Birth,</hi> and rightly-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiated Reason, being also suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently furnish'd with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Tongues, Historie, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:106935:259"/>
and sound Philosophy, may by the help of these, and the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God upon his industry, clear up some of the more obscure Places of Scripture to full satisfaction and certainty both to himself, and any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Peruser of his Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That this Assertion is true may be proved by manifold Experience, there having been sundry persons that have cleared such Places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as had for a time seemed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and intricate, with abundant satisfaction and conviction. But it is to be evinced also <hi>à priori,</hi> viz. from the seventeenth and eighteenth Conclusions, which avouch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be the most Authentick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that is; as also from the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifth, that concludes it not unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible in it self nor to mankinde; and lastly out of the first, that asserts that Certainty of Faith presupposes Certainty of Reason. For thus the Object of our Understanding being here certain, and we not spending our labour upon a Fiction or Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:106935:260"/>
and our Reason rightly-circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated, not blinded by Prejudice, nor precipitated into Assent before due deliberation and clear compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the matter; if after so cautious a Disquisition she be fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, she is certainly satisfied, or else there is no certainty in rightly-circumstantiated Reason, which yet is presupposed in the Certainty of Faith, by the first Conclusion. So that the Certainty of Faith it self seems rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, if no private man have any Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of any Interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that has once been reputed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure. Not to add, that all the Scripture that has been once obscure, and the Interpretation thereof not yet decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Church universal, has been hitherto, and will be God knows how long, utterly useless. Which is a very wilde Supposition, and such as none would willingly admit, unless those that would rather admit any thing then that Light of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that discovers who they are and what unworthy Impostures they use

in their dealings with the children of men.</p>
            <p>The thirtieth, That no Tradition can be true that is repugnant to any plain Text of Scripture. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because the Scripture is the most true and the most Authentick Tradition that is, and such as the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church is agreed in.</p>
            <p>The thirty first, That if any one Point grounded upon the Autority of Tradition, that has been held by the Church time out of minde, prove false, there is no Certainty that any Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is true, unless such as it has not been in the power of the Church to forge, corrupt, deprave, or else their Interest not at all concerned so to doe. The Reason is, because the Certainty of Tradition as Tradition is placed in this by those that contend so much for it, that nothing can be brought into the Church as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Practice or Doctrine but what ever was so from the Apostles. Wherefore if once a Point be brought into the Church, and profest and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:106935:261"/>
practised as Apostolicall, that may be clearly proved not to be so, this Ground for Tradition as Tradition is utterly ruined, and, considering the Falseness and Imposture that has been so long practised in Christendome, can be held no Ground of Certainty at all. As not Reason <hi>quà</hi> Reason, nor Sense <hi>quà</hi> Sense, but <hi>quatenus</hi> rightly-circumstantiated, can be any Ground of Certainty of Knowledge; so not Tradition <hi>quà</hi> Tradition can be the Ground of the Certainty of Faith, but onely such a Tradition as it was not in the power of the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Church to either forge or adulterate. And such were the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Holy Bible onely.</p>
            <p>The thirty second, That rightly-circumstantiated Sense and Reason and Holy Writ are the truest Grounds of the Certainty of Faith. This is the common Protestant Doctrine, and a great and undeniable Truth, and will amount to the greatest Certainty desirable, if the Spirit of Life and of God assist. For that will seal all
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:106935:261"/>
firm and close, and shut out all Doubts and Waverings. In the mean time, even in mere Moral men, but yet such as use their Sense and Reason rightly-circumstantiated in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judications touching the truth of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ and Religion, it is plain they are upon the truest Grounds of Faith they can goe or apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to, forasmuch as the Holy Writ is the truest and most certain Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no Tradition to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned true but upon the Certainty of rightly-circumstantiated Sense and Reason, as appears by the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
            <p>These Advertisements, though something numerous, are yet brief enough, but very effectual, I hope, if strictly followed, to make thee so wise as neither to impose upon thy self, nor be imposed upon by others, in matters of Religion; and so Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, as to become neither <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast</hi> nor <hi>Romanist,</hi> but a true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Primitive Apostolick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
