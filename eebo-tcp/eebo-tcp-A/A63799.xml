            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with their improper Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and unatural Applycations, which
do not only Ruin and Undo many poor
necessitous People, but to the losing of
their Limbs and sometimes their Lives
too; therefore I think it no worthless
Service to recommend unto the World,
especially to the Poor, the use of the
following Remedies, which are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cheap and easily Come-at-able, but
certain in their Operation, far beyond
any things hitherto known or publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>These are noble Poultices, and all
the Ingredients do cast a friendly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

mild Balsamick Nature and Operation,
and therefore they do by their active
penetrating Power, strengthen and raise
up the dismayed Oyl or wounded Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

their long lying of them on the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

            <p>Also Note, that during the time

that you keep them stirring, by which
you keep the fine Spirits and Qualities

Powers and thin Spirits of the Air
do penitrate the whole Mass or Body,
which incorporate and assist the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

from being Stagnated and Suffocated,
the Air being the Life of all things
and where its Friendly influences and
circulations are prevented, the Life

gross; for these Reasons, all Spoon-Meats
made thin, are sweeter and of

Spirit and <hi>Balsamick Body,</hi> is as it

take the best <hi>Sack</hi> (which is the
Richest and most Cordial of all Wines,
and hath the greatest Body) put it into

Balsamick the Body of any thing is, the
stronger and fiercer is its Spirit, when
that Balsamick Body, and the pure <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile</hi>

also in the <hi>Sugar,</hi> are destroved, and

               <p>Therefore all such Spirits so drawn,
do lose their Balsamick Body with all

the Consumption of the <hi>Radical Moisture,</hi>
and the pure Spirits and lively Tinctures
become Suffocated, wherein consists the
Essential Life of Nature. And as in the
before-mentioned Example, the pure
Spirit and Balsamick Body in <hi>Sack</hi> will
not endure these cruel harsh Sulphurous

Flames, and fierce Spirits, without su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
the like prejudice; for that pure
Vertue or Essential Principle, which the
Lord in the Creation endued every
thing with (which is the true Life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,)
will not endure any violent Motion
or harsh Fire to touch them; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if the circulation of the Air be
wanting, as it is in all such Distillations,
for these Spirits are are so pure and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that when any Injury is offered to
them, they either evaporate or become
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36787:23"/>
suffocated; for this Essential Powder or
pure Life, is the Moderator or Friendly
Quality in all Minerals, Vegetables and
Animals, which doth mix and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the harsh Fiery <hi>dark Principal,</hi> and
does allay and moderate the cruel harsh
Nature of the <hi>dark Fire,</hi> as does plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear in all the fore-mentioned Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
and also in <hi>Charcoal,</hi> for before

put in the Still and drawn off, those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same fiery harsh Sulphurous Spirits
were essentially in the Wine, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else it be, for it is the Root of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Original to every Life,
but being mixed or incorporated with
the Balsamick Body and pure Spirit, the
fiery fierce Sulphurous Spirit is thereby
swallowed up, and as it were hid and
moderated; for in what thing soever
the pure Balsamick Body is predominant,
there this dark furious Spirit is hid or
captivated; an Example whereof we
have in Sugar, where when the sweet
Balsamick Body is potent, there also
this fiery Sulphurus Spirit is strong,
but not manifest; but as soon as this Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Spirit and Balsamick Body are
separated or destroyed, this dark fiery
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36787:23"/>
                  <hi>Brimstony Spirit</hi> appears in its own form,
and becomes like a mad furious Devil
in Nature, its cloathing being the <hi>dark
Fire;</hi> for this Spirit hath lost its <hi>Sweet
Water</hi> or Friendly Life in its Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which before did qualifie its harsh
fierce Fire, it also loseth its pure <hi>Colour,</hi>
or bright native <hi>Shine,</hi> because the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Oyl is consumed, in that Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
so that there doth remain no
true Life nor Light in it, but being set
on Fire, its Flame is of a <hi>dim Brimstony
colour,</hi> which demonstrates that the
dark wrathful Properties of <hi>Saturn</hi> and
<hi>Mars,</hi> and their fierce Fires are predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in all such Liquors or Spirits.</p>
               <p>This is further manifest in <hi>Charcoal</hi>
(as war hinted before) which is made
of Wood, but in the making thereof
the pure Oyl or sweet Water, which

               <p>Nor is it otherwise in all sorts of

separated from the good Properties
and Friendly Principle, this dark fiery
sulphurous Spirit, becomes of a furious
Nature and Operation, endeavouring to
bring all in Subjection to it self; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such Liquors or Spirits frequently
taken, burn up the Radical Moisture
and Natural Heat, and are grreedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of the <hi>sweet Oyl</hi> in the Body,
whence proceeds <hi>General Obstructions,
Crude Windy Humours, Consumptions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural

Reachings to Vomit,</hi> and many other
Disorders; and if those of the <hi>Female
Sex</hi> take to drink such Spirits, as of late
years they do too frequently, the Evils
are doubled unto them.</p>
               <p>2. In all the before-mentioned Spirits
that have passed through those cruel
harsh Fires where the Air hath not its
free Egress and Regress, the pure Spirit
and sweet Body is totally destroyed,
which is the Root of <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;</hi>
therefore such Spirits will
not Work or Ferment as all other
Drinks and Liquors will, even water it
self; but you may put what quantity of

                  <hi>Sugar</hi> you will to <hi>Brandy, Ramm,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Fermentation; this doth further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that all the good Principles and
Vertues are destroyed by the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that there remains only a
strong fixed Fire, which has its Uses in
Physick, as is mentioned before, but not
otherwise.</p>
               <p>3. Such Spirits being frequently
drunk, do generate various Diseases,
according to each Mans Nature and
Constitution, and the Climate whether
hot or cold, for they do powerfully
Prey upon the Natural Heat, consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sweet Oyl and pure Spirits, for
the Balsamick Body and pure Spirits of
all such Liquors being destroyed, in the
Preparation, they become an <hi>Extream,</hi>
which Nature in her simplicity hates,
and for this Cause such Liquors cannot
Administer any <hi>Proper</hi> or <hi>Agreeable</hi> Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
to the Body, or to the pure
Spirits; it cannot give what it hath not,
it hath only Power to awaken the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Heat</hi> or <hi>Fire,</hi> which ought not to
have been kindled; and this it doth by
a Sympathetical Operation, for all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36787:26"/>
Meats and Drinks have power in the
Body to awaken and strengthen their
likeness; for this reason all Wise Men
Skilled in the Mysteries of Nature, have
commended simple Meats and Drinks,
because most such things are as it were
equal in their Parts, having no manifest
Quality that does predominate violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
over the other, but yet contains a
sufficient Noarishment for the Body,
and also for the Spirit; for Meats and
Drinks ought to be equal in their parts,
the Spirit ought not to be separated
from the Body, nor the Body from the
Spirit, but both ought to be Administred
together; for the Body without the
Spirit is of a gross heavy dull or dead
Nature, and the Spirit without the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is too violent and fiery, but the
Health of Mans Body and Mind, doth
chiefly consist in the equality of both;
do not all Meats and Drinks wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Quality or Property of Nature is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Harmfulness) if not sparingly taken,
certainly discompose the Harmony both
of the Body and Mind? For every Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
begets its likeness, and so on the
contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Concord and Harmony are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36787:26"/>
tain'd by their likenesses; if there be not
a Sympathetical agreement between the
Stomach and the Meats and Drinks,
both in Quality and Quantity, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Concord of the Properties of
Nature are immediately broken, whence
proceeds various Diseases according to
the degrees of the Disorder.</p>
               <p>This every one ought to understand,
or else they may unadvisedly lay heavier
Burdens than Nature can bear; for
most Diseases are generated through
surplusage of Nourishment. For unto
weak Heats there ought to be Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
a proportionable Food, but stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Heats will admit of stronger Foods
and greater quantity, which all Persons
might know, if they would but observe
the Operation of their own Natures;
for no Health nor Harmony can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
where the parts do disagree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niong
themselves. What Harmony can
the most skilful Master of Musick make,
if the strings of his Instruments be some
too sharp, and others too flat; even so
it is in the Elements of the Body, and
also in the Mind.</p>

else he suffers his Will or Desires to

respectively to awaken their Similes,
therefore all extreams are perilous to
the Health: If Men and women were

Diseases that are contracted by the
frequent eating and drinking of those
things that are unequal in themselves, as
<hi>Brandy, Rumm</hi> and other Spirituous
Drinks and high prepared Foods, they
would not so eagerly desire them. Do
not all or most that do accustome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to such things, quickly spoil their
their Healths? Nature is Simple and
Innocent, and the Simplicity thereof
cannot be continued, but by Sobriety
and Temperance in Meats and Drinks
that are simple and harmless, which will

I know this is contrary to the Vulgar

the Natural Heat is not so strong
by reason of the forcible Influences of
the Sun, which do powerfully exhale
the Radical Moistrue, open the Pores,
and too violently evaporate the Spirits

whereby the inclination to drink is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
for which reason many desire
hot Spiritual Drinks, because they find
a present Refreshment, for all such
Drinks do powerfully awaken the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Spirit by simile, and make Men
quick, lively and brisk, during the time
of their Operation; which is but for a
moment, but after wards they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
heavy, dull, and indispesed, and
their Stomach seeble, cold, and raw,

themselves to such Drinks, <hi>To take a
Hare of the same Dog,</hi> (as their Phrase
is) and so they drink more, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
the more weakened, for all
such fiery strong Drinks do not only
Prey on the Natural Spirits, but also
too violently do evaporate them. The
very same Operation have all strong
Drinks, as Wine and the like, if Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
be wanting, but not so violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the former. Therefore in hot
Climates there ought to be double the
Care and Temperance in Meats, Drinks
and Exercises, as in Cold, of which the
Natives of most hot Countries might be
our Examples; for they do for the most
part live very temperately, their Drink
being generally Water, or Wineallay'd
with Water, their Food mean, or more
simple than ours, whereby they are
better preserv'd in Health; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of all People in hot Climates
are weaker, or at leastwise not so able
to endure great Meals of Food, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
drinking of strong Drinks,
as they are in cold. For cold Countries
make Men hardy, strong, and able to
endure Intemperance, for which cause
it is observed that most of the <hi>Northern</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:36787:29"/>
Climates are very Intemperate in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and eating, and in hot they are the
contrary. And therefore our <hi>English</hi>
are much Distemper'd, and many die
when they Travel into the <hi>West</hi> and
<hi>East Indies,</hi> because they take wrong
measures, continuing the same disorder
and intemperance as they did in their
own Country, or rather encreasing it,
which Nature cannot bear without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisest
prejudice.</p>
               <p>6. It is to be noted, that those that

drinking of the forementioned
fiery Spiritual Drinks in all the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations

Heat and Moisture, the Excrement in
the Bowels is contracted into so hard a
Substance, that it cannot pass, and there
is hardly a Medicine found that will
cure it, this is that which the Learned
call the <hi>Illiacal Passion,</hi> and the Vulgar,
<hi>The Plague in the Guts,</hi> being one of the
most tormenting Diseases in the World.
And in other Bodies the <hi>Central Heat</hi>
being wasted by such unfit Meats and
Drinks, so that great part of the Food
turns into a Flux of Humours, both
Windy and Watry, which swell the
lower parts of the Body, and this is the
Generation of your <hi>Dropsies;</hi> but as
God is always good, and his Hand-Maid
Nature, an indulgent Mother, so
they have as it were, chalk'd out the
Means, and prescribed a Diet whereby
these Diseases may be prevented, would
Men but be so wise as to observe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it; for all hot Climates do furnish

the Natives with wonderful Variety
and Plenty of <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
cold Countries therein, both
in quantity and quality; for in those
hot Regions, the Sun hath greater power
to prepare all such things: And if our
<hi>English</hi> would but accustom themselves
to such harmless natural simple Foods
and moderate Drinks, the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Distempers would hardly be
known.</p>
               <p>7. It is also to be noted, and much to
be pitied, that of late years many <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Women have betaken themselves to
the drinking of <hi>Brandy</hi> and other Spirits,
and have invented the <hi>Black-Cherry-Brandy</hi>
which is in great esteem, so that
she is no body that hath not a Bottle of
it stand at her Elbow, or if ever so
little Qualm or Disorder be on the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
or perhaps meerly fancied, then
away to the <hi>Brandy-Bottle;</hi> so that
when such People come to be sick, which
most of them are very subject unto, the
Physiciaus do not know what to Adni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
they having in their Health used
themselves to such high fiery drinks, that
their Cordials seem like Water to
them: Besides, there are many fatal
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36787:30"/>
inconveniencies attend the Female Sex,
more than than the Male, in drinking
such Drinks; most of which are not so
proper to be publickly mentioned in
this place, and therefore I shall forbear,
but some I cannot but instance in; and
though perhaps some Women too much
addicted to the <hi>Delights of the Bottle,</hi>
may be offended with me for telling
them the Truth, and endeavouring to
wean them from the <hi>Beloved Dram,</hi> yet
to do them good, I shall venter the
Hail-shot of their Tongues, and hope
they will in time grow so wise, as not
to indulge a foolish sottish humour,
when it tends apparently to destroy,
not only their own Healths, and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their Lives, but likewise entails
Diseases and Destruction on their poor
Innocent Children; for it is not only
against the Feminine Nature to drink
strong Drinks, but also Destructive to
the Generation of Mankind; it makes
them Masculine and Robustick, filling
them with Fury and Madness, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Indecencies, which are no less
pernicious than shameful in a Woman. lt
also Distempers them by causing Fumes
and Vapours to fly into the Head, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36787:31"/>
Wind in abundance. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Wise Antients did account it a
Crime for Women to drink strong
Drink or Wine, tho' their Countries did
afford Wine in abundance; and good
reason they had, for the whole preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Mankind resides chiefly in the
Temperance and Government of the
Women; if they are Intemperate, the
Radix of Men is corrupted; are we not
like to have very <hi>Fine, Hopeful, Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Children,</hi> when the <hi>Mother</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Pampering her unweildy Carcass,
has contracted more Diseases than an
<hi>Hospital?</hi> Or when they are put out to
some Drunken Nurse, that instead of
affording them wholsome Natural Milk,
Suckles them up with the unconcocted
Dregs of that <hi>Brandy</hi> with which she
daily overcharges her filthy Stomach?</p>
               <p>The Nature of Women will not bear
Excess in Meats and Drinks, as Mens
will, without manifest danger to their
Healths, and also to the Health of their
Children; most Windy Diseases both in
Women and Children, being caused by
their Intemperance both in quantity and
quality, They overcharging their Nature
with Food containing too much Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36787:31"/>
and Drinks that are too strong.
This is chiefly observable amongst Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Citizens and the Richer sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who pay dearly for the Lickerishness
of their Palats, by the Diseases that thence
arise, they being much more Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
than the Ordinary pains-taking
People. I confess their are hardly any
Women in the World so Intemperate
and such great Lovers of there Bellies
as the <hi>English,</hi> nor is there any Nation
more subject to Variety of Diseases;
and therefore they are afflicted with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Distempers, which Women in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries know nothing of. And
as our Children are generally weak,
Peuling, Rickety, and Sickly, so the
occasion thereof is too evident, since
they are almost made Gluttons from the
very Cradle, their Mothers gorging
and feeding them till they loath their
Victuals, and often cast it up again;
and when they have been Cramming all
day, the good Woman entertains her
Gossips with Stories, what a little Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach her
Child has, and that she can get
it to eat nothing, and <hi>She wonders how it
lives,</hi> and indeed so she may, but for a
quite contrary reason, for this oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36787:32"/>
Nature with Excess in Youth, is not
only the cause of the Death of many,
but in others it sows such Seeds, and
lays foundations for Distempers, that
they can scarce out-grow them, also
many Women out of the like foolish
fondness, give their Children strong
Drink, which is very destructive to their
Health.</p>
               <p>Nor is it become unfrequent, for
Women not only to drink <hi>Brandy,</hi> but
also to smoak <hi>Tobacco;</hi> which two things
have a great affinity, <hi>Tobacco</hi> being an
Herb of <hi>Mars,</hi> and its Poysonous ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
attractive Nature from <hi>Saturn;</hi>
the common use of it in Pipes is very
injurious to all sorts of People, but
more especially to the Female bex, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be taken very sparingly in a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
way, for some watery and windy
Diseases, but the usual taking of it
destroys the Physical Vertues and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
thereof; only the daily Smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it may be profitable to Gluttons,

                  <hi>Tobacco</hi> and <hi>Brandy</hi> are certainly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Enemies to Women, and also to
their Children, for their Spirits and
Balsamick Body, whence their true Life
shines, is more volatile and tender than
Mens, and their Natural Heat is not so
strong, for this cause Women cannot
bear or endure any extreams, either in
Meats, Drinks, or Exercises, without
manifest danger to their Healths, they
being generally more sanguine than Men,
and their Central Heat weaker, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
all kind of inequality makes deeper
Impression on them, and they are sooner
moved to all kinds of Passions: for
Women in their Radix are compounded
more of the sweet Friendly Sanguine
Nature, their Dignifica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the Element of Water, but the
Root of Mens Nature is from the strong

cause Women are more Chaste than
Men, and of colder Natures, tho' ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Men do believe the contrary, but
they are greatly mistaken in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
having no true understanding of
Nature; they have judged thus hardly
of Women, because many of them are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36787:33"/>
so easily drawn into inconveniencies
by the pretended Friendship of Men,
but I do affirm, that their being so easily
overcome, is not from their unchaste
desires, but chiefly from their Friendly
Courteous Efleminate Natures, being
of a yielding Temper, which is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
in the Root of their Lives, and
when a Man has once awakened in
them the <hi>Love-string,</hi> which is quickly
done, he may command them as he
pleases; now finding them comply, they
imagine that of them which they find in
themselves: Not but that some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are as unchaste as Men; but then
such, through the Power of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
Free-Wills and Wanton Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
have forced Nature out of her
simple Innocent ways, compelling her
often to do that which she perfectly
loaths.</p>
               <p>The wise Antients understanding this
Nature and Constitution of Women,
and considering that the whole welfare
and health of Mankind depended chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on their Temperance and Discreet
Conduct, did therefore direct them to
an higher degree of Temperance, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36787:33"/>
thought it requisite, and so absolutely
necessary, that both the drink alotted
for Women in most Countries, was,
and is to this day <hi>pure Water,</hi> and their
Food as Innocent and Natural; they
eat Flesh sparingly, living much on
raw and boiled Herbs, Fruits and
Greens, which is a most sublime Diet.
And by this means their Women and
Children are not afflicted with such a
number of cruel Diseases. There is no
Country in the World where their
Children and young People are so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
subject to the Small Pox, Kings-Evil,
Joynt-Aches, and many Leperous
and languishing Diseases; how many
of them yearly die with Convulsions
and Windy Distempers, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
they receive from their Mothers?
How many Miseries and aking Hearts
do Women endure with their sickly
Children? And what Women are free
from Vapors and Windy Diseases, Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fits, weak Joynts and Backs, their
Blood corrupted, breaking out in small
spots in the Flesh of several colours,
their Stomach cold, and their Natural
heat not able to digest their Food with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36787:34"/>
a Dram, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> For all which Evils, there
is no Remedy so long as our Women do
continue the frequent Eating of fat gross
Flesh (without Herbs) and other sweet
high prepared Food, and drinking strong
Liquors, as <hi>Brandy,</hi> &amp;c. and taking <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco;</hi>
for these things do continually
heat the whole Body, thereby awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Central heat, which is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to Women, for it presently
sends Fumes and Vapours into the Head,
and the fierce Fires with venemous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
do penetrate the whole Body,
drying up, and consuming the pleasant,
moist, cool, airy Vapours, suffocating
the pure Spirits, which otherwise would
replenish the whole Body and sharpen
the Appetite; it also dulls the Senses,
and possesses the Blood with a sharp fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
humour, and hinders its free Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
causing the pure natural Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
whose habitation is in the Blood,
to become impure, whence arises a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
indisposition over the whole Body.
Therefore all that love their own
Health, or the good of their Children,
ought to refrain such hurtful Food, and
learn to know, that <hi>Brandy, Tobacco,</hi>
and all such things, are to be taken
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36787:34"/>
sparingly, and no otherwise than as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
take Physick.</p>

               <p>THE eating of Flesh was not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or practised in the first and
purer Ages, when Men gave themselves
to the Study of Wisdom, <hi>viz.</hi> To the
Knowledge of themselves, and were
partakers of God's Secrets in Divine
and Humane things, and enjoy'd
Health and long Life, drawn out to the
Age of many hundred years. For thus
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36787:35"/>
the Holy Scripiure tells us, <hi>Gen. 1. The
Lord said, Behold! I have given to you every
Herb bearing Seed, which is upon the Face of
all the Earth, and every Tree in which it
the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed, to you
it shall be for Meat.</hi> And in another
place it is said, <hi>Flesh with the Blood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
you shall not eat.</hi> It is not said, That
the Lord made all Creatures for Man to
eat, as I have heard many affirm, but
he made them for his own Glory and
Eternal Honour, and for the manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Wonders, and that Men should
have Dominion over all Creatures and
Created things, which Man hath lost
by suffering his desires and imaginations
to enter into the <hi>Bestial Nature,</hi> which
does by degrees captivate the Noble
parts in Men. But the Wise Ancients for
divers Ages of the World, did know
but little of the variety of Flesh and
strong Drinks, or of compounded
Dishes of twenty sorts of things, most
of them of disagreeing Natures: No,
their Food was simple and natural, easie
to be procured without oppression to
themselves, or to any of God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as Herbs, Fruits and Grains, and
pure Water for drink, which things are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36787:35"/>
endued with a most simple Nature and
Operation, which neither dulleth the
Head by Fumes, nor stupifies the Senses
by Surplusage of Nourishment, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well prepared, and eaten moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
do nourish by way of Simile its like
qualities in the Body, being of lighter
digestion, and of a more Airy Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than Flesh, being also void of all
Inclinations, Senses, or Passions of
Love or Hate, whose Original is more
clean and nearer the Unity in Nature;
therefore the Philosophical Antients in
former Ages, incouraged the eating of
Herbs, Fruits and Grains, but on the
contrary, made Laws against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
eating of Flesh without distinction.
The Great and most Illuminated Prophet
<hi>Moses</hi> did not admit the <hi>Children of Israel</hi>
to eat any Flesh during their forty years
March through the Wilderness: 'Tis
true, when the People did Murmur,
the Lord being provoked, gave them
Flesh in his Wrath, and afterwards
when they were admitted to eat Flesh,
it was with such distinctions, and with
so many circumstances as could not be
performed, but by abundance of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and trouble, and other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36787:36"/>
by which Laws and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
many of God's Creatures became
of little or no use in the Creation, as
Swine and the like, if indeed they had
only been made for Men to eat. But
the Lord never commanded his People
in any Age to abstain from any thing,
but it was always for their preservation;
for Abstinence, Cleanness, and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Meats, Drinks, Exercises, and
Communications, do work wonderful
Effects, and have a Sympathetical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
both in the Body and Senses,
rendering the Observers thereof Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
with brisk powerful Spirits, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
prndent, of good forecast, able
to give Council, and for matters of
Learning, they do easily grow to an
Excellency in the knowledge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and in all other things whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they do apply themselves. And as
for Prayers, Meditations and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations,
they do perform them with
great Facility, Pleasure and Spiritual
delight, being always fresh in their
Minds, and free from Diseases in their
Bodies.</p>
               <p>By this way of Sobriety, Cleanness
and Temeperance, many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36787:36"/>
became admirable both in Divine
and Humane Wisdom; 'tis well known
how Scrupulously the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> (one
of the most Learned and Mysterious of
all the Sects of Gentile Philosophers)
abstained from Flesh. The Divine
Writer and great Prophet <hi>Moses,</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
that God made Man in his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
and that he should have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over all things or Creatures, not
that he should eat all things, or hurt
himself by devouring them, nor suffer
his desires to enter into them, nor theirs
into him, for Man is a Prince in this
World, and in him is contained the
true Nature of all the inferior Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
for it it were not so, he could
not be their Prince, nor be sustained by
them. And tho' Man was made grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than other Creature that is visible,
and to be Lord over all, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he having a Simile with the Nature
of all things, is thereby rendered capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be wrought on by every inferior
thing he shall suffer his desires to enter
into, and by degrees he is liable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
captivated unto that thing, be it
either good or or evil; for every like
(as I told you before) works on and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36787:37"/>
awakens its likeness; This was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why <hi>Moses</hi> commanded that unclean
Beasts should not be eaten, that the
Humane Nature might not mix or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate
in it self the Beastial quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
for every indvidual Man has essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
in him the true Natures and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences
of all the Beasts of the
Field, and Fishes of the Sea, as also
of all Herbs and Fruits, Stones and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
and whasoever else can be
thought of; for it this were not so,
then Man would not be subject to be
wrought on by all, neitheir would the
various sorts of food agree with him or
nourish him.</p>
               <p>The wise Antients understanding
this, and that every thing had power
to attract unto it self such matter out of
all things, as is capable to nourish its
own Body, therefore in those days the
eating of Flesh was not in such Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as of late years it hath been;
especially as it is in <hi>England,</hi> who do
make it their chief Food; all Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Fruits being in themselves of
a clean simple Nature and Operation,
which being well prepared and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
eaten, have only power to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36787:37"/>
their Similies in the Body and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as foresaid. But on the contrary,
all Beasts, especially unclean Beasts, are
endu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d with all kind of Beastial Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
as Anger, Revenge, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Love and Hate, which Dispositions
and Passions of the Flesh, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Blood, doth retain after such Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
are killed; and for that reason it
was, that the Blood of all sorts of
Beasts was so strictly forbidden, for the
essential Spirits dwell in the Blood, and
in the Blood and Spirits lie hid all the
Dispositions and Inclinations the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was endued withal, and therefore
all sorts of Flesh that were permitted to
be eaten, were to be well purged from
the Blood. And also this same Blood
was either to be consumed by Fire, or
an hole made in the Earth and the Blood
cast into it and covered, that the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Spirits and Vapours thereof might
not defile the Air, which is continually
breathed into our Bodies; for when any
Creature is killed, the great pain and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony
they endure, does so powerfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
the Center of the wrathful Fire,
and also the internal Poysons which are
the Root of every Life, that the said fierce
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36787:38"/>
Poysonous Spirits seize the Blood on
their right Fountain of Preservation, so
that the Blood does not only contain
all the Natural Dispositions, Passions
and Inclinations, but also the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Poysons and irritated Spirits which
were violently stirred up by Death's
stroke. For when the Natural Life is
in danger (the continuation of which
is so sweet unto all Creatures, and they
do so unwillingly part with it, especially
when the Creature is in perfect health,
and strength) what a strange fear and
dread must needs attend the Creature
in this condition? And how strongly
and violently are all the Centers and
Powers of Nature stirred up? And
then are awakened the revengful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which do contain the Blood, for
that is their Habitation, which in this
Agonous condition does often spread it
self through the whole Body, and makes
the Flesh look red, but this is generally
drawn back again by the drawing away
of the Blood where the wound is made.
Now if this Blood be exposed to the
open Air, these fiery dark wrathful
Spirits do by degrees evaporate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate
themselves with the Air, and
so defiles it, and renders it pernicious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:36787:38"/>
The very same is to be understood
in all other Uncleannesses; and these are
the chief Reasons why the Prophet <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
commanded the Blood either to be
<hi>burnt on the Altar,</hi> or <hi>buried in the Earth,</hi>
tho' there doth remain somewhat more
to be said, why he commanded the
Blood to be consumed on the Altar by
Fire, which I shall forbear, and speak
of it in its proper place; for those fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wrathful Spirits that do evaporate
themselves into the Air, being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
breathed into the Body by such Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as do communicate near such places,
as Slaughter-Houses, and the like, and
more especially those that are of killing
Imployments, those awakened wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Spirits do enter them, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
incorporate themselves with their
Similies; for this cause all Butchers
and others, that do use such Trades,
are more fierce and cruel, sooner mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to Wrath than others; killing is
as easie and familar to them as Plowing
the Land is to the Husbandman; and in
a word, they are far more inclined to
violence than Men of other Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:36787:39"/>
The same is to be understood in all
other Trades, and also in Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as those that are brought up and
have their Conversasions amongst Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
are not most of them Robustick,
Proud, Bold and Surly, like the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
they Communicate with; the same
is likewise to be understood in many
other hard working rough Trades and
Imployments; are not most of them
rash, head-strong, scarce endued with
common Humanity? There is nothing
so good, or so bad, but Man is capable
of being captivated to it; from this
ground it is that weak Inclinations, that
a Man in himself is hardly sensible of,
may either by Imployments or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
be made strong, which is
one Reason why Mens Inclinations and
their Love and Hate alters and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
according to time, place, business,
and communication, as some Men have
declared, that they did not fear being
overcome with Drink, Women, or
the like Evils, becaue at that time
they found no Inclinations to such
things, nevertheless, Time, Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
Communications, and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
concurring, many of them
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36787:39"/>
have been overcome by those Vices they
so little stood in fear of, though also
Astrologick Configurations, and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
have a share in altering and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mens Inclinations, and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when other causes concur: For
this cause the most prudent in all Ages
have advised all Men to avoid evil oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>That Evil Communication corrupts good
Manners,</hi> the truth of which no Man
will or can deny. Now if Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Communications, Labours,
Words, and all kind of outward busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
have so great power of changing
and altering Dispositions and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
increasing them, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
how can we imagine but Meats
and Drinks received into the Body, will
have the same or greater Power and
Operation, as those that feed much on
unclean Elesh, as on Swine, and that
have their Conversation amongst Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
are not many of them much like
those Creatures, of sottish, dull, heavy,
sordid Dispositions, yet subtle and
cunning in a Bestial way? And on the
contrary, those that drink Wine, and
feed on the highest Food, have not they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36787:40"/>
Spirits accordingly? Also those whose
Conversation is amongst Men, as Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
and Merchants; have they not
higher and greater Spirits, being more
tractable and humane, fair and ingenious
in all their Dealings, and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
For all things have sympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
Operation, whether it be Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Meats, Drinks or Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
every thing does secretly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
its like property, which do often
captivate the Spirit of a Man before he
is sensible of it, being ignorant of the
Nature and sympathetical Operation
all things have with his own Nature.
'Tis true, most Men believe that evil
Company corrupts Manner, and will
acknowledge that some sorts of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
do by degrees dispose People
to Inhumanity, Violence and Cruelty;
but if you tell them there is the same
possibility and greater in Meats, to
vary not only Mens Bodies, but also
their Inclinations and Minds, they shall
laugh at it as a ridiculous Dream, though
in Truth it is a most certain Truth, and
daily Experience (if we would but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear her Voice) bears Witness unto it.
Why did <hi>Moses</hi> prohibit his People the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36787:40"/>
eating of Swines Flesh, seeing Swine are
not serviceable unto Mankind any other
way, but by being killed and eaten;
and besides, a Swine is a Creature, that
being well ordered, becomes as whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Nourishment, as some other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
that are counted clean, though
there is somewhat to be said against the
grossness of that sort of Flesh; but the
chief thing the Spirit of God in that
great Prophet regarded, was, no doubt,
the Spirit of that Creature whose ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
and predominant quality stands in
the dark wrath of Nature, which is
manisested by their shapes, cri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and
tones, which Spirit the humane Nature
ought not to joyn it self unto, lest it
partakes of its Nature, Every thing
having power to joyn its self with its
likeness, and to strengthen its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
Doth not Wine and strong Drink
precipitate Men into Fury and Madness
by Simile? That is, the Spirits in Wine
do incorporate themselves with the
natural Spirits, and violently awaken
them, making them burn too fierce,
which sets Nature into a Rage, awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Central Spirits till all parts of
the Body burn like Fire, till the Oyl be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36787:41"/>
consumed, and Nature begins to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
becoming dull, heavy, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid.
The very same Operation have
all Food in the Body, and on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and Senses, but more slowly and
hidden; for great meals of Food makes
dull when first eaten, for all the time
Nature is a digesting, and making se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
(which is four, five, or six
hours a doing) and then Nature begins
to be brisk and lightsome; for what
the Stomach and Natural Heat do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
as to Fermentation and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the Food, is done to Natures
Hand by Art in all sorts of strong
Drinks; therefore all such fermented
strong Drinks have a present Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but let Drink be ever so strong,
if it have not passed through Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Separation, it will lie heavy
on the Stomach, and send dark and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
fumes into the Head, if a quantity
be drunk: Therefore great Meals of
strong rich Food, do endanger the
Health more than proportionable drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of strong Drinks, especially in hot
Countries, and in Summer time in colder
Climates. That Dispositions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
are chang'd and alter'd by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36787:41"/>
Food, may further appear in all or
most unclean Creatures, are they not
made much fiercer, if raw flesh and
blood be given them, their wrathful
unclean Nature being thereby enraged
and made stronger? And is not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
flesh of those Creatures Men feed on,
altered either for the better or worse,
according to the nature of their Food;
what a vast difference shall there be as
to the goodness or badness, wholesom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or unwholesomeness of the Milk
of the very same Cow, when she feeds
upon fresh delicate Grass, Herbs, and
Flowers, and when she is kept on course
Brewers Grains, or the like? The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Man's Body and natural Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are compounded of the same matter
as other Creatures, are, and in respects,
subject to the same or like alterations;
only the Holy Light and Grace of God,
which enlighteneth every Man that
cometh into the World, if obeyed,
is sufficient to subdue most natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
and to keep them within
the bounds of Temperance; indeed
this Gift is the only power by which a
Man may overcome the Evil and deny
himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:36787:42"/>
2. <hi>Flesh</hi> is not so clean a Food as
Herbs, Seeds and Fruits, for all forts
of Animals are subject to various Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
but on the contrary, all or most
Vegetables have a more simple and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Original, therefore their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
on the Body and Senses is as sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
having no power to awaken any
property in the Body, but what is like
themselves. Furthermore we see that
no Creatures that are clean will eat
<hi>Flesh,</hi> except they be taught it, and
brought to it by degrees; on the other
side, all such Animals as naturally will
eat <hi>Flesh,</hi> are by all means counted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
as Dogs, Cats, Bears, Wolves,
Foxes, and many others, both in the Sea
and Land, and most Men will avoid the
eating of such Creatures, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
in the Root of their Natures.
Therefore they desire such Food as hath
affinity with them, for every Creature
rejoyceth in its likeness. The Prophet
<hi>Moses</hi> well understood this, when he
commanded that unclean Creatures and
Blood should not be eaten, because the
Blood (as is mentioned before) doth not
only contain the Spirits, but the very
Humour, Dispositions and Inclinations
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36787:42"/>
of the Creature, therefore it was to be
killed and dressed after such a manner,
by which the Blood and superfluous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was extinguished, and if <hi>Flesh</hi> should
now be prepared after their way, we
should not account it to have half the
Vertue as it hath in our way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Indeed the way of killing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish,</hi> that the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
prescribed to his People, was to
cleanse the <hi>Flesh</hi> from all Blood in which
stand the Spirits, and all the Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Inclinations of the Creature
lie hid. By this means the Uniting of
the Bestial Nature with the Human, was
in a great measure prevented; and for
no other reason all unclean Beasts,
Fowls and Fishes were so severely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.
All Created things have but
one only Ground and Original. Every
particular Creature contains the true
Nature and Properties of the whole,
only the qualities are in several degrees,
one having one quality strong, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
the Center, For in every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
one of the forms or properties do
carry the upward Dominion, and other
qualities lye as it were hid, but some
times do manifest themselves, but that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36787:43"/>
property which is weakest may be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
and made strong by its Simile, as
often comes to pass.</p>
               <p>From this very ground proceeds all
Sympathy and Antipathy, Concord and
Discord in this World. For all those
whose predominate qualities stand near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and have affinity to each other, such
are friendly one to another, but those
whose predominate Properties have
Antipathy each to other, such slight one
another, and if the Grace and Holy
Light of God do not restrain them, they
are very apt to speak Evil and Backbite
one another. The same is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in the Divine Principle of God's
Love, those that through the Blessing
and Favour of the Lord have, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Holy Gifts of the Spirit,
be it more or less, all such People have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
and bear good will each to other;
except the false Prophet's Opinion get
in amongst them, which is a Ravening
Wolf. Every thing rejoyceth in its
likeness, and the contrary in its death,
therefore it is highly convenient, for
every man to consider the Variety and
the Possibility of its own Nature, and
that in himself is contained the true
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36787:43"/>
Nature of every thing in the visible and
invisible World, and that he bears a
Simile with all things, and is both ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
and liable to be drawn either to
Vice or Vertue by every thing he joyns
himself to, whether Meats, Drinks,
Communications, or whatever else a
Man suffers his Will or Desires to run
out after, or enter into, the same
thing hath power to awaken its like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and for this cause all the Wise
Men and Prophets have advised to
Cleanness and Sobriety, and to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Good Mens Books, which do
stir up the good Faculties in the Soul,
for all Books do bear the Image and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of him that wrote them, and so
by Simile do awaken the like Spirit
and Desire; and so on the contrary, if
young or old give themselves to the
reading of Plays or Books of Romances,
they will powerfully awaken by Simile
the vain wanton Nature, which before
lay as it were hid: Therefore it was
said in the <hi>Revelations, Come out from
amongst them, and be ye separated, lest
you partake of their Evils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Reason why most People love
and so much desire Flesh more than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36787:44"/>
Herbs, Fruits or Grains, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it doth afford either better Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
or is pleasanter to the Pallate
or Stomach, but it chiefly is because
Man is departed in his Mind and desires
from the innocent ways of God and
Nature, and through his Free-will
hath awakened the dark wrathful
powers in himself, which have more
Affinity with the Beastial Nature, than
with Herbs or Fruits: For the Beasts are
endued with the very same Passions in all
respects as Men; if it had not been so,
the Commandment had not been so
strict against eating of Flesh; for the
Radix of Beasts and Men have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Affinity: And the more ignorant and
sottish People are, the more they desire
to eat Flesh, and the more Flesh they eat,
the more Sottish, Ignorant, and Brutish
they become. Also, the more the dark
poysonous Wrath of God and Nature
is stir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed up, and the more it does pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate
in Man, the more doth Man
desire Food that hath a proportionable
Nature. From this very ground it is
that some sorts of Creatures esteem'd
Unclean (whose predominant quality
stands in the Wrath of Nature) do so
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36787:44"/>
much desire unclean Food, because it
hath unity with their Natures; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same is to be understood of those
Creatures which we call clean, they do
as much on the contrary desire clean
Food, <hi>viz.</hi> Fruits and Herb, because
such things have the nearest Affinity
with their Natures; and if Men had
not departed from the Innocent ways
of God and Nature, and suffer their
Wills to enter into the Wrath and
Beastial Nature, they would not so
much desire Flesh; for Flesh cannot be
eaten without violence done to Nature,
for the Lives of all Beasts are as sweet
to them, and they as much desire to
continue them, as Men do, and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
part with them. And the
Groanings of these Creatures that suffer
Oppression and Pain, do awaken the
Wrath in them that do it, which is a
certain Retaliation or Reward; for all
kind of Cruelty does stir up and awaken
the Wrath of God in Nature, and so
on the contrary, all Love and Concord
does powerfully beget its likeness.</p>
               <p>Doth not every evil word, which does

of its Principle with it, and awaken
its Simile in those to whom such words
are directed? On the contrary, do not
soft and pleasant words pacifie Wrath
by awakening their Simile? Every Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
and Property in Nature must have
its own Food, or else it loseth its
Power and Strength. Mens coveting
to eat so much Flesh, is too plain a sign,
that they are departed from that Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and Simple Life for which they
were made, and entered into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
for if the Wrath of God in
Nature were not awakened beyond its
proper degree, and did not predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
over the Simple Innocent Life,
then People would no more desire Flesh
than our Holy Ancestors in the first
Ages of the World. It is a token we
are in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> when we hanker so much
after the <hi>Flesh pots.</hi> As long as Men
were partakers of, and followers of
the true knowledge of God's Works,
and lived in the simple path of Nature,
which led to Health and long Life,
Herbs and Fruits were in as great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
as <hi>Flesh</hi> is now: It was a shame
in former Ages; for a Man to be seen
to buy <hi>Flesh,</hi> or to have carried it openly

in the Streets of Cities, but now the
best Citizens count it the contrary, and
make nothing to go openly to the <hi>Flesh-Markets</hi>
in their Plush-Coats, and load
a Porter two or three time a Week,
with the Spoils of their Slaughtered
Fellow-creatures; and if a Man comes
to their Houses after Dinner, there he
may behold a very unpleasant sight, <hi>viz.</hi>
Greasy-Platters, Bloody-Bones, and
pieces of fat flesh lie up and down the
Kitchin, thereby rendered next door
to a Slaughter-House. And this Trade

               <p>WHat is more profitable for all Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Health and Wisdom,
than Food that is Radically Clean? And
as Bread hath deservedly the first place,
together with Herbs, and various sorts
of excellent Fruits; so the next is Milk,
which of it self is a brave, mild, and
most friendly Food to Nature, very fit
and profitable for all Ages and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions;
and if it do not agree with
some People, it is because their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
are made sharp and sowred by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity
of dainty Food, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
use of strong Drink. Also Milk
being altered, it makes many sorts of
wholesom healthy Food. Next to these,
are various sorts of Flesh, which being
killed in their proper Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and when they are free from their
Uncleannesses, Surfeits, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
which most Beasts are
subject to; and if care be taken also
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36787:47"/>
that they be well and moderately sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
with Salt, and boyled in plenty
of River of Spring-water (which is the
best of all Waters, except Rain-water)
they become wholesom Nourish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nt.
For, River-water hath the advantage of
running through various sorts of Earth,
by which it sucks into it self a fat, oyly,
and saline Quality, which the Surface
of the Earth does plentifully afford;
which also is the cause of all Vegitation,
and the lovely Green Colour, which all
Vegetables are cloth'd with, does arise
from this Saline Quality. For these
Reasons, River-water will Brew, Boil,
and Wash, and it is more profitable in
all Uses in Houswifery, than Spring or
Pump-water, and far wholesomer for
Men and Beasts to drink. Also your
Vessel in which your Food is boiled,
ought to be uncovered all the time it
boils; for if the Air have not its free
egress and regress, the pure Spirits in
the Food become as it were suffocated,
and then the Food so prepared becomes
dull and heavy; for the Air is the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Life of the Spirit; and all Food that
hath not plenty of Water, and the free
Influences of the Air, in its Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36787:47"/>
does certainly lose its natural Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
with the pure Smell and Taste:
For if those three Qualities be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in all Preparations of Food, then
the genuine Vertue and lively Tinctutes
are in part lost. The same is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in all Physical Operations. And
if the above-mentioned Order be not
observed, then the Food is not so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to the Palate, nor so easie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction;
it lies heavy in the Stomach,
dulling and stupifying the Senses; it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates
a gross Nourishment, and bad
Blood, whence does proceed many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases:
Whereas if the above-mentioned
Rules be observed, and your Fire quick,
that your Food do not stand still, or
cease from boiling, till it be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, the Effects are contrary. It is
also much better the Food should be a
little under-prepared, than too much:
For when the gross phlegmatick Body
of any Food is by Preparation digested,
then presently the lively spirituous Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is set at liberty, whence does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
a most pleasant Smell and Taste;
which pleasant Quality, before the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
lay hid or captivated in the
Body of Phlegm; but so soon as this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36787:48"/>
Phlegmatick Body is in part d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
the Spirit becomes Volatile; and then,
if the Preparation be continued, those
pure Spirits do either become suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or evaporate; and then the sweet
Balsamick Body turns as it were sowr.
For these Reasons, all sorts of Food,
either over-prepared, or twice prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
are of a strong fulsome taste and
smell; as all Meats heat again, and also
Pottages, and all such things, do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
Nature, and generate many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.
But if the forementioned Rules
be observed, the Food so prepared is
not only more pleasant to the Palate,
but far lighter of Digestion, and breeds
better Blood. For that Universal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
(the <hi>Scurvy)</hi> which reigns so
much in <hi>England,</hi> is chiefly caused by
Food ill prepared, and the eating of too
much Flesh, and Fat things, especially
in the improper Seasons of the Year,
<hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Iuly</hi> to the last of <hi>November.</hi>
In this Season the Sun, which is the
true Life and Power of all things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines;
and all sorts of Herbage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
is the Food of all Beasts that are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
eaten, doth the same: The Grass
all this Season is fraught with a gross
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36787:48"/>
Phlegmatick Matter; besides, it is a
fainty hot time; the Air, which is the
Cherishing Life of all things, is more
gross, and full of Humidity, than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times of the Year; the Spirits of
all sorts of Creatures are also weak, and
on any Accidents are quickly wounded,
or evaporated, more especially those
Beasts that come from remote Parts to
great Cities. Besides, it is then the
principal time of their Generating,
which renders them unclean. Are not
the People tenfold as sickly in this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and double the number die, than
they do at other times? Also you may
observe, That the Rots amongst Sheep,
and Murrains that attend other Beasts,
are all or most of them in this Season:
Therefore all sorts of People ought to
be more careful of their Health, both
in Exercises, Meats, and Drink, that
they do not exceed either in quantity,
nor eat things that are improper in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
This is the time that all Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
and also those that are Drivers
of Horses, and indeed all that have the
Government of Cattel, ought to have
and use double the Prudence in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of them, than at other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36787:49"/>
of the Year, as I have more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discoursed in a small Treatise, of the

                  </gap>servation of Sheep from the Rot,
and Horses from Surfeits.</p>
               <p>There are three Marks by which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one may know whether the Flesh be
good. The first is by its pure White
and brisk Red Colour, when Raw.
The second is by its continuing its firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
being plump or swelled when boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
having a brisk and lively Taste,
and that after eating it feels easie and
pleasant in the Stomach. The third is,
by its taking Salt well; for if your
Flesh be free from Heat and Surfeits,
and not over-fed, which charge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the
body with gross Phlegm; as also, if it
be not kept longer after it is killed (as
indeed it ought not) than it be thought
to be cold, before it is salted; all such
Flesh will take Salt greedily, and it will
not only keep longer from Putrifaction,
but it will eat much sweeter, and breed
better Nourishment. For, if any sort
of Cattel be over-fed, surfeited, or any
other Inconveniency attends them, and
they be killed before they have recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves of those Injuries; or if it
le in <hi>August, September,</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36787:49"/>
Flesh will not take Salt so well as the
former, neither will the Saltpreserve
it half so long from Corruption. Also
as it is before-mentioned, if Flesh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
kept too long after it be killed, such
Flesh will not receive Salt into it, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will, which is salted as soon as it is
cold: For by keeping it does certainly
lose its pure Spirituous Quality, so that
the Body becomes heavy, gross, and
dull. Does not the Life and Spirits of
most sorts of Food waste and evapor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te
by keeping, if there be not a proper
way of Preservation used? If Flesh, by
any Inconveniences, have lost its pure
lively Spirits and Vertue, Salt then hath
no power to preserve such Flesh from
Putrifaction: For Salt cannot preserve
the Body from Corruption, but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the pure subtil Spirits, which are
a pleasant Habitation for the Salt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate
it self with: For Salt will
not preserve Flesh from Putrifaction,
any longer than the Vertue and Power
of the Spirit does continue, as it does
appear by all salted Flesh and Fish: For
through length of time the Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
either suffocated, or evaporated,
and then it presently falls into Purti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36787:50"/>
And yet this same Flesh does
still contine Salt; for Salt does not
destroy and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ge the Flesh from its
Corruption, but incorporates it self
with the Essential Spirits, and those
two do as it were tye or hold the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
part Captive, till the Spirit and
Life of the Flesh be spent or wasted, and
then the Flesh falls into Putrifaction,
which cannot be recovered, either by
salting, or any other Art, to its first
state: But if the Salt had purged or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the Humidity and gross part,
then there would have been no Room
nor Matter for Putrifaction, and then
it would have continued firm and found,
as many other things do, which are
freed from that gross humid Matter
from which Putrifaction does proceed.
Therefore Flesh is naturally the most
unclean of all Food, is being of a gross
Phlegmatick Nature; and if Care be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>2. Cleanness in Houses, especially in
Beds, is a great Preserver of Health.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36787:50"/>
Now Beds for the most part stand in
Corners of Chambers, and being pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
close Substances, the refreshing
Influences of the Air have no power to
penetrate or destroy the gross Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that all such Places contract, where
the Air hath not its free egress and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress.
In these shady dull Places Beds
are continued for many Years, and
hardly see the Sun or Elements. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
Beds suck in and receive all sorts
of pernicious Exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ements that are
breathed forth by the Sweating of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sorts of People, which have Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous
and Languishing Diseases, which
lie and die on them: The Beds, I say,
receive all these several Vapours and
Spirits, and the same Beds are often
continued for several Generations,
without changing the Feathers, until
the Ticks be rotten. Besides, we have
many Feathers that are Imported from
several Countries, which are the Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of old Beds, the Uncleanness
whereof is not considered. As to the
Nature of Feathers, they are of a strong,
hot, fulsom Quality: For, Fowls, of
all Creatures, are for the most part the
hottest; and their Feathers contain the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36787:51"/>
fame Nature: Therefore the constant
lying on soft Feather-beds, does not
only over-heat the Back and Reins,
weakning the Joints and Nerves; but
they have power also not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but retain all evil Vapours and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
that proceed from, and are
breathed forth by various Diseased Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Hence it comes to pass, that sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Distempers are transferred from
one to another, by lying upon or in
such Beds, which Distempers do secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
steal on a Man by Degrees, so that
he cannot imagine whence the disorder
proceeds, or what the Cause thereof
should be. But I would not have the
Reader mistake me; all People are not
subject to get Diseases this way; There
are some whose Constitutions are
strong, and their Natural Heat and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are vigorous and lively, by the
Power and Vertue whereof they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and repel all such evil Vapours
and Scents as do proceed from such Beds
when a Man is hot and sweats in them,
that they have no power to seize the
Spirit: But, on the contrary, when
such People shall lie on such Beds, whose
Natural Heat is weak, their Spirits few,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36787:51"/>
and whose Central Heat is not able to
withstand or repel those Vapours and
Scents which such Beds send forth when
a Man is hot in them, this last sort of
People are subject to receive Injuries,
and contract Diseases: For those evil
Vapours do powerfully penetrate the
whole Body; and if they are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the Central Heat and Power of
the Spirits, then these evil Vapours do
seize the Spirits, and incorporate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their Likenesses: For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular thing does sensibly and
powerfully seek out its Likeness, and
wheresoever it find, its Simile, it hath
power to incorporate, and become es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential.
These are the chief Reasons
why one Man gets Diseases by lying
with Diseased Persons, and in unclean
Beds, and others not. It is a general
Custom, when Men go abroad or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
to desire clean Sheets, imagining
them to be a sufficient Bulwark to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them from the pernicious Fumes
and Vapours of old stale Beds; but it is
too short. For, it is certain, that most
or all Beds do perfectly stink, not only
those in Inns and Houses of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but others: Not but that every
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36787:52"/>

himself; but when he lies in a strange
Bed, let a Man but put his Nose into

and hardly any Common Vault is like
it.</p>
               <p>Now this sort of Uncleanness, which
does proceed from old Beds, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the greatest, but also the most inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to the Health and Preservation of
Mankind, and the least Care is taken to

have not, Experience does shaw, that
the Excrements and Breathings of the
Body will generate Vermin. Also do
not most People take Care that their

But all this while they lie on Beds that

hard days Labour to keep so, and is
dirtied in a Moments time; or to have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36787:52"/>
a clean sweet Bed to lie on. There
is no Comparison to be made, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is so great; the one being es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
either to Health or Sickness, the
other an indifferent thing. If there
was but the tenth part of the Care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to keep Beds clean and sweet, as
there is of Cloathing and Furniture,
then there would be no matter for the
getting of Diseases, nor for the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Bugs. I would have all House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes,
and others, consider the Reasons
of these things. Are not Lice, that
troublesome Vermin, bred from the
breathings of the Body, for want of
often Change both of Linnen and
Woolen? and will not Fleas breed
from the very Dust of Chambers where
People lie? Also any Woollen that
hath been used about Beds, although
the cold Winter hath destroyed them,
yet if these Clothes lie in any close
place, where the Air hath not its free
egress and regress, these very Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will generate Fleas the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
following: But if these Clothes had
been used about Men and Women, they
would never have bred Fleas: for
there is no matter of Element in Wooll
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36787:53"/>
or Cloth for the Generation of such
Creatures; but Wooll, Cloth, Furs,
and Hair, are chiefly the Element of
Moths, and sometimes of small Worms;
that is, if such things are kept in places
where the refreshing Influences of the
Air have not their free egress: For all
such places do contract great store of
Moisture, which, when hot Weather
comes, causeth Putrifaction, whence all
such Vermin do proceed. But if those
things be in daily use, and exposed to
the open Element, they never breed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Vermin: So that the Generation of
those things are generally caused by
Acciden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s; not but that there is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Radixes of such things for
the Generation of such Vermin.</p>
               <p>3. From the pernicous Smells and
putrified Vapours that do proceed from
old Beds, are generated the Vermin
called Bugs, (of which, neither the
Ancients, nor the Modern Writers of
this Age, have taken any Notice) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Degrees of Uncleanness,
Nature of the Excrements, and the
Closeness of places where Beds stand:
for some Peoples Excrements are not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36787:53"/>
so unclean as others: Also in all close
places, especially in Cities and great
Towns, the Spirits and thin Vapours
of the Air are suffocated, which makes
the same Air Sulphurous and Humid,
whence does pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed Putrifaction.
Therefore it is not to be thought a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule, <hi>That all old Beds should breed
Bugs,</hi> as some (who are ignorant of the
Operations of Nature) will be apt to
say, <hi>If one Bed do breed them, why not all?</hi>
No, it is according to the Nature of the
Uncleanness, and other Accidents that
do happen; for where (as is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the thin pure Air, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
Influences of the Sun and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
have their free egress and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
all such Matter is destroyed
whence such Vermin is produced. The
Original of these Creatures called Bugs
is from Putrifaction, occasioned by
stinking Scents and Vapours which do
proceed from the Bodies and Nature of
Men and Women, and the mixing or
incorporating of these Vapours with
moist and sulphurous Airs: For where
there is no Heat nor Humidity, there
can begin no Putrifaction. Therefore
all that have attributed the Generation
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36787:54"/>
of this Vermin to Wood, as Bedsteads,
and the like, are grosly mistaken in the
Productions of Nature; for there is
no Matter in Wood that can generate
such a Vermin, it being productive on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or chiefly of two Creatures in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
viz. of Wood-Lice and a small
Worm. These Wood-Lice, are never
generated but in places where the Sun
and Air have not their free Influences,
so that there is store of Humidity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted;
and when the Sun comes to
such Degrees of the Zodiack, this
Creature is generated, which is of as
different a Nature from Bugs, as sweet
Wood is from a stinking Bed. Also
Wood does breed a certain small
Worm, but never till, the Salts Nature
and Power is decayed through length of
time; then the Air enters it, which
does presently cause it to contract a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
Quality, from whence proceeds
Putrifaction, whereof, when the Sun
is Powerful, this Worm is bred, But
so long as Wood continues sound, and
is kept dry, the Air having its free In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
on it, I affirm, That no sort of
Wood ever breeds any kind of Vermin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:36787:54"/>
4. There are many also that attribute
the Generation of this Creature to Hogs
Hair, which being mixed with Lime,
and Houses Plaistered with it, does
occasion (say they) the Generation of
Bugs. Now it is most certain, that there
is no possibility in Nature for this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction;
for no kind of Hair ever breeds
any living Creature, except it be put into
Water or Mud when the Sun is powerful,
and then this Creature, thus generated,
retains its first <hi>Species,</hi> viz. a Hair, with
a live Head, which was its Element from
whence it proceeded; but if you take
it out of the Water, it presently dies:
so also it doth when the Sun declines in
heat, as most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orts of Vermin that are
bred through Heat and Moisture do.
But Hair being mixed with Lime, all
Matter of Generation is thereby total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroyed: For Lime does chiefly
contain a harsh, fiery, keen, sharp,
coroding quality; it is so sharp, that
it does destroy all Life, and is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it, as Light is to Darkness;
the predominant quality in it is the
Salts Nature, from which no living
Creature can be produced. Besides,
if there were never so much Mater in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36787:55"/>
Hair for the Generation of such Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,
Lime would destroy it; for in
Lime there is only a Sal-nitral fiery
Vertue.</p>
               <p>5. If the Reasons before-mentioned be
not sufficient to convince the Ignorant
of their erroneous Opinions in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
then I hope the following one
will, which is more familiar to every
one. It hath never been krown, that
this troublesome Vermin was ever seen
in Ware-houses, Kitchins, Parlors,
Dining rooms, or any places were Beds
have never been, except they have by
accident been brought into such Rooms
or Ware-houses, by Furniture of Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that have been troubled with them,
though all such places have the same
Funiture as Chambers, except Beds.</p>
               <p>6. From the same Substance or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whence Bugs are bred, is also occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
the Generation of many nasty
Diseases in the Blood; so that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Matter that breeds
them, is of greater consequence than
most People are sensible of; And if
these following Rules be observed, I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36787:55"/>
dare affirm, That the Generation of
Bugs will cease, and also many other
Inconveniencies and Distempers, that
are got by this sort of Uncleanness,
will be avoided.</p>
               <p>First, You are to destroy all Press-Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steads
which stand in corners of Rooms,
being made up with Boards so close,
that the Air cannot penctrate or dry
up and consume the moist sulphurous
Vapours that are contracted. These
sorts of Beds that stand so, are apt to
have them more than others. Also you
are to set your other sorts of Beds as
near as you can in the most Airy places
of your Rooms, exposing them to the
Air the most part of the day, with
your Chamber-Windows open, that
the Air may freely pass, which is the
most excellent Element, that does
sweeten all things, and prevents Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
In the Night also you ought
not to have your Window-Curtains
drawn, nor your Curtains that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
your Beds; for it hinders the
sweet refreshing Influences of the Air,
so that the Air of all close places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of a hot sulphurous Nature and
Operation; the thin pure Vapours,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36787:56"/>
which do wonderfully refesh Nature,
are as it were suffocated: And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the Influences of the Air, is in
an especial manner observable, when
People are sick, or out of order; as
though the sweet pleasant Air had been
the cause of their Disease; such Rooms
being so very close, with great fires in
them, that if a healthy Person do but
continue three or four hours in them,
the fulsom Steams and thick Vapours
will much disorder him, and take away
the edge of his Appetite: And if so,
what will the Operation be on those Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
who are weak and disordered with
Distempers.</p>
               <p>What is more pleasant and healthful
than good Air? It chears and comforts
the Spirits, it opens the Passages of the
Joynts and Nerves; it purifies the Blood,
creates an Appetite, increasing Strength
and Vigour: But, on the contrary, hot,
thick, sulphurous Airs do not only
obstruct the passages of the Spirits, but
suffocate them, loading the Joynts and
Nerves with evil Juices, whereby the
Limbs and Members become full of
pain, causing a general tenderness to
possess the whole Body, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36787:56"/>
the Appetite, and the power of
the Digestive Faculty in the Stomach.
Also, do not all Houses and Places
grow musty, and contract too great
store of Moisture, if the Air be any
way prevented, by Window-shutters,
or the like, that it cannot have its free
egress and regress? Therefore mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Cloathing, hard Beds, Houses that
stand so as that the pleasant B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iezes of
Wind may air and refresh them, and
also Houses that are full of Windows,
are to be preferr'd; for where the Air
hath not its free Influences, the Spirit
becomes dull and heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, this being the
true Life of the Spirit in everything.</p>
               <p>7. Now the certain Means and Way
not only to prevent the Generation of
this Vermin, but also to preserve Health
and Strength, are Straw, or rather
Chaff-Beds, with Ticks of Canvas,
and Quilts made of Wooll or Flocks, to
lay on them; which certainly is the
most easie and pleasant Lodging that
can be invented: and a little Custom
will make it appear friendly to
Nature, and in every respect far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the softest Feather-Beds, on
which, when a Man lies down, he sinks
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36787:57"/>
into them, as into an hole, with Banks
rising on each side of him; especially
if two lie together, when first they go
to Bed they lie close, and after a little
time, when they begin to be hot or
sweat, they are generally willing to lie
a little further off, that they may cool
themselves, but cannot do it without
great difficulty and trouble, by reason
of the softness of the Bed, and those
Banks that rise on each side. Besides,
such soft Fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her-Beds do over-heat the
Reins and Back, making all the parts
tender, and causing sweatings and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Inconveniencies to attend the
Body. Feather-Beds also are nothing
so easie as Quil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, after a little time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accustomed to them; they are also
extream fulsom, and by their heat they
do powerfully dry up the Radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
causing a general faintness to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the whole Body. But, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
hard, even Beds that lie smooth,
are not only easie through custom, as is
mentioned before; but a Man may turn
freely, both sleeping and waking: They
harden and strengthen the whole Body,
especially the Back and Reins, make
the Nerves and Sinews strong, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

the immoderate Evacuat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sweating, and keeping the Body in a
temperate Heat. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sides, such Beds
may be often changed, with but little
Trouble, and less Cost, they send forth
no stinking fumes or steams, as Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Beds
do; but are sweet and clean.
Certainly nothing is more healthy,
nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to Temperance in Meat and Drink,
than clean hard Beds.</p>
               <p>8. All sorts of Beds, especially Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Beds,
ought to be changed, driven,
or washed, at the least three or four
times in a Year; or else it is impossible
to keep them sweet and clean, and to
prevent the Generation of Vermin, or
the other Inconveniences before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
Would not every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
a Man, if he should wear a Shirt
a Year, and lie in Sheets seven Years?
Which if any should do, it would not
either endanger his Heal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

stinking Feather-Beds do; which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly

Also Feathers do c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tainly contain an

unclean putrified Matter, that hath a near
Affinity with the Nature of Bugs; and
therefore Feather-Beds are more apt to

                  </gap>d them, than Wool, or Flocks;
though both will do it, if the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Rules be not observed. But if you
are not willing, or so lowly-minded,
to have Straw or Chaff-Beds under
your Quilts, then you may have Flock-
Beds, with Canvas-Tickings, which
may be both aired and washed as often as
you please, with little Trouble and
Charge. If any shall question the Truth
of what I have alledged concerning
Beds, I desire they would please but to
try the Experiment, by filling a Bed
with the freshess and cleanest Straw or
Chas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which will smell very pleasant;
and having so done, let them lie on it
half a year, in a corner of a Room, as
Beds generally stand, and then smell to
it; and instead of sending forth a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
Scent, as it did at first, it will send
sorth a strong, fulsom, musty Steam
or Fume. And if this will do so, what
will Feathers do, that in the Root of
Nature are unclean fulfom Excrements,
of a hot strong quality? Therefore they
have the greater power not only to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36787:58"/>
and suck in to themselves the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
Excrements that are breathed forth
of the Body by Sweatings, and the
like; but they have also power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
such evil Vapours: And when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
come to lie on them, and are
throughly hot, it awakens those p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ing many
Inconveniencies on the Body. Besides,
it is very unpleasant to lie in such Beds;
a Man must always be forced to keep
his Nose above-board. Indeed each
Man's own Bed does not stink or smell
strong to himself, because he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to it; neither does a Tallow-Chandler
smell those horrible Scents
and pernicious Fumes that old Tallow
sends forth when it is melted: But let
any other Person, that is not accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it, be near such things, and it
will be very offensive to him. Even so
it is in all other stinking Trades, and
things of this Nature: so that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Slut in the World does hardly smell
her own House or Bed stin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: For in
Man is contained the true Nature and
Property of all things, both of Good
and Evil; therefore he is both liable
and also apt to receive all Impressio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and to be wrought on by all things he
shall either communicate with, or joyn
himself to, whether it be Cleanness, or
the contrary. Also by Meats, Drinks,
and communication, all things have
power, by a Sympathetical Operation,
to work on Man, because he is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all, bearing a proportionable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
unto all things. If People did
understand this, they would prefer, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and Temperance, with Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
far beyond what they do; and
then Men would not be subject to so
many Diseases as now they are.</p>
               <p>9. Heat and Moisture is the Root of
all Putrifaction; and therefore Bugs are
bred in Summer; but they live all the
Winter, though they are not then so
troublesome. They harbour in Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steads,
Holes, and Hangings, Nitting
and Breeding as Lice do in Clothes:
But all Men know, that Woollen and
Linnen are not the Element of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ice, but
they are bred from the fulsom Scents
and Exrements that are breathed forth
from the Body. The very same Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix
have Bugs; and if there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
they are from a higher Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36787:59"/>
and therefore they are a more
noisom stinking Creature.</p>
               <p>10. The whole Preservation, of
Mens Health and Strength does chiefly
reside in the Wisdom and Temperance
of Women. Therefore the Ancient
Wise Men in former Ages, did direct
and accustom their Women to a higher
degree of Temperance than the Men.
Which Customs of Sobriety the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of several Countries do maintain

and for this reason neither they nor

the frequent and common drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

this place, which their Children often
bring with them into the World. If the
Seed be good, yet if the Ground be bad,
it seldom brings forth good Fruit. Also
Women are our Nurses for fifteen or
sixteen years; and they do not only
suffer us to be Gluttons, by letting us
eat and drink often, of their ill-prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Food, beyond the power of the
Digestive Faculty, and more than the
Stomach can bear; but many of them
will intice us to Gluttony, and some
will force their Children to eat even
against their Stomachs, till they cast it up
again. Now if it be a difficult point
for a Man of Age and Experience to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the necessary Rules of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
how careful then ought Mothers
and Nurses to be in ordering their
Children? A great part of the Children
that die, especially in Towns and Cities,
is occasioned either by the Intemperance
of their Mothers, during the time
they go with Child, or afterwards by
their unnatural and badly prepared
Food, and suffering them to eat to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
also by their keeping of them too
warm, and too close from the Air, and
lapping of them up in several Double
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36787:60"/>
Clothes and Swathes, so tight, that a
Man may write on them, and then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into warm Beds, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
them up close. If a strong Man
was so bound up, he could not endure
it, without great injury unto his Health.
Besides, the Window-Curtains are
drawn, and also the Curtains about the
Bed; by which means the Air becomes
so hot, and sulphurous, that it causes
great Disorders to attend both the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and the Children. This ill Kind
of Management does also cause such a
Tenderness both in the Mother and
the Child, that on every small occasion
they are liable and apt to get Colds, and
divers other Distempers.</p>
               <p>Also Women have the entire Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of all things that concern our
Healths, during the whole time of our
Lives; they prepare and dress our Food,
and order all things in our Houses, both
for Bed and Board. There is not one
Man of a hundred that understands or
takes any notice whether his Food be
well prepared or not; and if his Bed
stinks, he is used to it, and so counts
it all well. Mens Time and Study is
chiefly taken up about getting a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36787:61"/>
and providing things necessary
for themselves and Families; so that
there is not one among a thousand that
understands any thing what belongs to
the Preservation of his Health: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Women do and say touching
the Preparation of Food, and other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of Families for Health, most
Men believe, not making the least scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or question of the truth thereof. And
well they may: For the chiefest Doctors
of our Times do bow before them, and
are altogether as subject to the Rules
and Directions of Women, as other
Men. Where are your Doctors that
teach Men Sobriety in their Lives, or
the proper and natural way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Meats fit for the Stomach? Which
of them adviseth against the evil Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of keeping their Chambers so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hot, when People are sick, and in
the time of Womens lying in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed?
Why do they not advise them
not to have their Curtains so close
drawn, both before their Windows
an<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>  Beds, insomuch that they are often
times in a manner suffocated for want of
the fresh Air? For, I affirm, That all
sorts of People that do keep their Beds,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36787:61"/>
let the occasion be what it will, have
ten-fold more need of the refreshing
Influences of the Air, than others that
are up: For, the Bed being much hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a Man's Garments are when he
is up, the thin, refreshing, moist Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urs,
that do penetrate the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
more powerfully when a Man is up,
are thereby hindered. This is one
chief Reason why a Man cannot digest a
Supper so well in Bed, as if he sits up.
All Men know, that the Bed destroys
App<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tice, If a Man go to Bed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

goes to Bed at the same time, and rises

                  </gap>s
still without Action, yet by Eight he
shall have a good Stomach to eat and
drink; so great is the power of the Air:
For when a Man is up, his Body is cool,
and the pure Spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and thin moist Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
of the Air have power to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the Body; which Element the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
sucks in like a Spunge thorow the
Pores; and this doe not only cool and

                  </gap>he Spirits and the whole Body,
but also powerfully strengthens the
Action of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:36787:62"/>
But I pity the young Children most,
who are so tender, and of so delicate a
Nature, both in their Body and Spirits,
that every Disorder does wound them
to the very Heart. Nothing is more
grateful and refreshing to them, than
the pleasant Air: It comforts their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth a free Circulation of
the Blood and Radical Moisture, begets
Appetite, and makes them grow in
Strength: But, on the contrary, hot
sulphurous Airs, with great Fires, and
warm Clothing, do not only hinder the
Circulation of the Blood, but suffocate
the Spirits, and destroy the Appetite,
causing an unnatural Heat to possess the
whole Body; whence does proceed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Disorders and Diseases, making
them to cry, and be very froward. Also
close Bindings, and over-warm Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
and thick hot Airs, do oft in
weak-spirited Children cause Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Vapours, and Fumes to fly into
the Head, sometimes occasioning Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,
which People call Windy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases.</p>
               <p>Again, the Food of most Children,
of late years, is so enriched with <hi>West</hi>
and <hi>East-India</hi> Ingredients, that is,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36787:62"/>
with Sugar and Spices, that thereby
their Food becomes so hot in Operation,
that it does not only breed too much
Nourishment, which generates Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
and Stoppages, but it heats
the Body, drying up and consuming
the Radical Moisture, and infecting the
Blood with a sharp fretting Humour,
which in some Complexions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
causeth languishing Diseases,
contracting the Breast and Vessels of the
Stomach, and hindering the Passages of
the Spirits, so that the Joynts and
Nerves become weak and feeble; In
others, with the help of bad Diet, and
other Uncleanliness, does cause Botches,
Boils, and various sorts of Leprous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases.
Also many that have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal,
will frequently give their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
Sack, strong Drinks, and fat
Meats, as long as they will eat, which
is abominable, and absolutely contrary
to the Nature of Children.</p>
               <p>There are a hundred other Disorders
and Intemperances that many Mothers
and ignorant Nurses affect their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

this place to discourse of: Therefore I
commend unto the Women Milk that

Also no Children ought to drink

                  </gap> Pain in the

               <p>THE terrible Pains and Diseases of
the Teeth do chiefly proceed from
two Causes. The first is from certain
filthy Phlegmy Matter which the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and Vessels do continually breathe
and send forth, which does lodge or
center in the Mouth, especially b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tween
the Teeth, and on the Gums, and some
People having fouler Stomachs than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
such do breathe forth very sowr,
stinky, phlegmy Matter, which does
not only increase the Pain, but causeth
the Teeth to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>come loose and rotten:
And for what of continual cleansing
and washing, those breathings and this
phlegmy Matter turns to Purifaction,
which does eat away the Gums, as
though Worms had eaten them: And
this De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ect is generally attributed to
the Disease called the <hi>Scurvey:</hi> but it is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:36787:64"/>
a mistake: The Cause is chiefly, as is
mentioned before, from the Stomach, or
for want of Cleansings.</p>
               <p>2. This Distemper of the Teeth and
Gums does also proceed from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sorts of Meats and Drinks, and
more especially from the continual eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Flesh, and fat sweet things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of various things of disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Natures, which do not only obstruct
the Stomach, but fur and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l the
Mouth, part thereof remaining upon
the Gums, and between the Teeth. For
all such things do quickly turn to Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
which does by degrees corrupt
both the Teeth and Gums. Besides, our
Beds take up near half the time of our
Lives, which time the Body is not only
without motion, butt he Bed and Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
do keep it much hotter than the
Day-Garments, especially of those that
draw the Curtains of their Windows &amp;
Beds so close, that the pure Spirits and
thin refreshing Vapours of the Air, are
hindered of having their free egress and
regress, which does dull &amp; flatten the
action of the Stomach; and this is the
chief Cause why suppers lie hard in the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36787:64"/>
Stomach, and require more than double
the time for perfect Concoction, than
the same Food does when a Man is up,
and in the open Air: For this Element,
if it hath its free Influences, is sucked
in, as by Spunges, through all the Pores
of the Body, and does wonderfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,
comfort, open, and cleanse all
the parts, having power to assist and
help Concoction: But hot, dull, thick
Airs do destroy the Action of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and as it were suffocate the pure
Spirits, drying up and consuming the
Radical Moisture. Therefore the Night
does foul the Mouth more than the Day,
furring it with a gross slimy Matter,
especially those that have foul Stomachs,
are in Years, which ought to be well
cleansed every morning.</p>
               <p>3. Whatsoever are the Disorders in
the Body, the Mouth doth always par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of them, besides the Evils that the
variety of Food, and the improper mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Flesh and Fish, and many other
things, which do foul and hurt both the
Teeth and Gums. When any Person is
disordered with inward Diseases, does
not the Mouth quickly complain
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36787:65"/>
of the Evils thereof? This very few do
consider in time.</p>
               <p>4. It is to be noted, that most Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
do attribute the Diseases of the
Teeth to Colds, and Rheumes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
outward Accidents. It is true, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Accidents will further thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Disease,
but then there must be Matter before
hand, otherwise outward Colds can
have no power to cause this pain. The
same is to be understood in all Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages
of the Breast, and other Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as Coughs, and the like. For,
if any part be obstructed, or there be
Matter for Distemper, then, on every
small occasion of outward Colds, or
the like Accidents, Nature complains. If
your Teeth and Gums be sound, and free
from this Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter, take what Colds you
will, and your Teeth will never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
as daily Experience doth shew.
For all outward Colds, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
of the like Nature, have no
power to seise any part of the Body,
except first there be some inward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mity: Suppose the Teeth
be defective, then the Disease falls on
that part; or if it be the Head, Eyes,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36787:65"/>
Breast, Back, or any other Part or
Member of the Body, that is obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Evil is felt in that Part. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the Mouth be kept clean by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Washings, it will prevent all
Matter which may cause Putrifaction;
and then Colds, and the like Accidents,
will have no power to seise this Part,
or cause this terrible pain. Even so it
is in all other parts of the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dy. If
Temperance and Sobriety be observed
in Meats, Drinks, and Exercises, with
other Circumstances belonging to
Health, then Stoppages, Coughs, Colds,
and other Obstructions, would not be
so frequent on every small occasion:
For Temperance has an inward Power
and Operation, and does as it were cut
off Diseases in the very Bud, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Generation of Matter whence
Distempers do proceed, increasing the
Radical Moisture, and making the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
lively, brisk and powerful, able to
withstand all outward Colds, and other
Casualties of the like Nature.</p>
               <p>5. There are many various things,
of divers Natures, prescribed by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
and others, as Washes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36787:66"/>
the Teeth and Gums; but most
of them, if not all, to little or no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as daily Experience teaches: For
all high, sharp Salts, and things of a
sowr or keen Nature, do rather cause
the Teeth to perish, than the contrary;
as do all hot Spirits, be they what they
will: Many have destroyed their Teeth
by the frequent use of such things, and
it hath hardly ever been known that
any such things have ever cured or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the aking Pains of the Teeth,
but Water only. Many Examples I
could mention, if it were convenient.
Physicians, and other, do daily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
such things for the Cure and
Prevention of this Disease of the Teeth,
which most of them do know by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
can do no good, but rather the
contrary: But when People come to
them, they must give them something
for their Money; for Interest and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
have more affinity with this sort
of People, than Virtue and the true
Knowledge of the Nature of things.
Most certain it is, that the Shepherd
and Husbandman do know far better
how to prepare their Meat for their
Cattel, and also how to preserve them
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36787:66"/>
from Disorders, than many Physicians
do their Food or Physick: and a Man
shall understand more by conversing
with some of this sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
than with the Learned: For
the Shepherd and Husbandman under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
something of Nature; but most
of the Learned are departed from the
simple ways of God in Nature, putting
out their own Eyes, and then boasting
what Wonders they can see with other
Mens: They have invented many words
to hide the Truth for the Unearned,
that they may get the greater esteem.
This has chiefly been done to advance
Pride and Interest; so that the Divine
Eye is departed from many of them,
who never make any Inspection into the
true Nature of things, being contented
to take other Mens words, let it be
right or wrong, as long as they have
Authority and Law on their sides,
wherefore should they trouble their
weak Heads?</p>
               <p>6. The best and most sure way to
prevent the Diseases and Pains in the
Teeth and Gums, is every Morning to
wash your Mouth with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the least ten
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36787:67"/>
or twelve Mouthfuls of pure Water,
cold from the Spring or River, and so
again after Dinner and Supper, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
down a Mouthful of Water af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
each Washing: for there is no sort
of Liquor in the World to pure &amp; clean
as Water; and nothing doth cleanse and
free the Teeth and Gums from that foul
Matter which does proceed from the
Breathings and Purgings of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and from the various sorts of
Food, so well as Water: The use of
other Washes is to little or no purpose;
but whosoever do constantly wash their
Mouths wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h Water, as is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
shall find an essential Remedy.
All hard Rubbing and Picking of the
Teeth ought by any means to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for that is injurious to them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
whensoever you find your Mouth
foul, or subject to be slimy, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it will more than an at others,
according to the good or evil state of
the Stomach, though it be not after
eating; at all such times you ought to
wash your Mouth. This Rule all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Nurses ought to observe,
washing the Mouths of their C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ildren
two or three times a day; and also to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36787:67"/>
cause their Children to swallow down
a little Water, which will be very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
to their Stomachs: For Milk
does Naturally foul and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Teeth; and if they be not kept clean
by continual Washing, it causes the
breeding of Childrens Teeth to be
the more painful to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>em.</p>
               <p>7. To keep your Teeth white, one
of the best things is a iece of a <hi>China</hi>
Dish, or a piece of a fine <hi>Dutch</hi> Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Dish, made into fine Power, and
the Teeth rubbed with it.</p>

People will be like <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
when the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> advised

Mysteries they do know; which the
Learned in all Ages have taken notice
of: For, should some People know
what Apothecaries and other give
them, they would depise the Physick,
and have but little respect for their

               <p>All Housewives do know, that no sort
of Liquor, be it what it will, will
cleanse and sweeten their Vessels, but
only Water; all other Liquors leaving
a sowr stinking Quality bekind them,
which will quickly cause Putrifaction:
But Water in its own Nature is clean
and pure, not only for all Uses in House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery,
and the Preservation of Health;
but the Saints and Holy Men of God
have highly esteemed this Element, by
using it in the Exterior Acts of Divine

                  <hi>Livy</hi> in his fifth Book tells us of a

                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:36787:70"/>
was frozen over, a matter very strange in
such a Climate as <hi>Italy.</hi> In the Year

that the <hi>Venetians</hi> went over the <hi>Ice</hi>

that in the Reign of that Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
(who for a nasty Reason in his
Christning, was called <hi>Copronimus</hi>) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Year 750. the <hi>Pontick</hi> Sea was
so Congealed, that People for many
Miles travelled it on foot: And Horses
and Carts loaden, passed over the <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
or narrow part of it; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
he adds, that the Summer following
was so excessive hot and dry, that great
Rivers and most Fountains were wholly
dry'd up, and People and Cattel perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the greatest Rivers of <hi>Europe,</hi> as the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Danubius,</hi> the <hi>Elb,</hi> and the <hi>Sein,</hi>
were so incrusted with Ice, that for the
space of above 30 days, <hi>Carriages</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passed along on them, as on the Land.</p>
               <p>But to look nearer home—In the
Year of our Lord 1365. and 49th year
of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, A <hi>Frost</hi> lasted from
the midst of <hi>September</hi> to the Month of
<hi>April;</hi> but though so tedious, the Cold
was nothing so intense or violent as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36787:71"/>
now. In the 15th Year of the Reign
of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, after great
Rains and Winds, there followed so
sore a Frost, that many <hi>died for cold,</hi>
and some lost <hi>Fingers,</hi> some <hi>Toes,</hi> and
many their <hi>Nails: (I follow the very
words of Sir</hi> R. Baker, fol. 297.) The
same Author tells us. That in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> on the 21.
of <hi>December,</hi> began a Frost so extream,
that on <hi>New-Years-Day</hi> Even, People
passed over the <hi>Thames</hi> on foot, some
plaid at Foot-Ball, some shot at Pricks,
as if it had been firm ground; yet this
great Frost, the third of <hi>Ianuary</hi> at
Night, began to Thaw; and by the
fifth day, there was no Ice to be seen,
but great Inundations followed.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1609. (which 'tis not
impossible, but some living might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
being but 74 Years ago) a
Frost began in <hi>December,</hi> which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till <hi>April</hi> following, with such
violence, that the <hi>Thames</hi> was so fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
that Carts loaden were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
driven over it, most Fowls and Birds
were destroyed. In the Year 1637. was
another <hi>Frost,</hi> which rendred the <hi>Thames</hi>
passable; so in the Year 1664. imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
followed by the <hi>Great Sickness;</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:36787:71"/>
and the like towards the latter end of
the Year, 1676.</p>
               <p>Some of the Consequences of these
Extream Frosts, I have mentioned, more

themselves,; a Man may soon err
in assigning Effects to such or such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Causes, or adapting Events to
Signnificators; <hi>Modesty</hi> is the first Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in Wisdoms School. Therefore as
we have been studious in matter of
Fact, past; but sparing as to Sequels;
so we shall retain the same becoming
tenderness as to Futures; wherein we
shall steer our Course rather by the
Guidance of Nature in her usual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
here below, than by curious
Researches into remoter Influential
Causes above; though not neglecting
them neither, for the Universe is <hi>Intire,
Harmonical,</hi> and <hi>Sympath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that does not competently understand
the right Tone of the whole, and the
true Key of every part, will make but
bad Musick wherever he lays his Clum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
Fingers.</p>
               <p>First then I say, This Extremity of
Cold Presages many Calamities and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
to attend Mankind, and the rest
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36787:72"/>
of their Fellow-Creatures; for as the
Innocent Inhabitants of the Air, or
expanded <hi>Suburbs</hi> of Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> Birds
and Fowls, are endangered by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
denying their usual Benefits and
Provisions (wherein another fourth part
of the Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> Fishes, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
concern'd) so degraded Man, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
advantage of this Cruel Weather,
does for Profit, or Pleasure, or Vanity,
destroy many thousands of them: Now
this great Destruction of them, is but
a Forerunner of Mortality amongst
Creatures of greater value, and even
of Men themselves. Would you know
the reason? I told you but now, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Nature is <hi>Sympathetical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2dly. This Immoderate Cold locks
up the Pores of Mens Bodies, and drives
the Natural Heat more Central, which
occasions great Appetite and Draught,
whence follows much and excessive
Eating and Drinking of Gross, Fat,
Succulent Foods, and strong Drinks;
in all that have wherewithal to procure
them; which the voracious desires do
at present seem able to bear and digest,
yet really Nature is not able to do it, and
so by degrees there are Seeds sown and
Foundations laid for Diseases. On the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36787:72"/>
other hand, amongst the Poor, necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Feeding on unfit and unusual Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands,
for their support at present, or
defect of due Nourishment, must to them
do as much mischief; For want is as
great (though I think not so common)
an Enemy to Nature, as Superfluity;
the way to prevent these mischiefs, is,
for the Rich to observe Sobriety and
Temperance, and for the Poor to use
Discretion in their Diet, for a pint of
Milk with a quarter of a pint of Water,
thickened with one Spoonful of Flower,
and heated just to Boyling, and then
putting into it a few Crums of Bread,
(all which will not cost above a Penny)
shall give any Person as Nourishing a
Meal as the best Surloyn of Beef or
Capon. I mention not this to prevent
Benevolences towards the Poor, which
all that are able are bound to afford, but
only to Advise them how to supply
themselves when they meet not with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Accomodations, but find Rich Mens
Charity more frozen than the <hi>Thames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3dly. This Excessive Frost condenses
the Air, and renders it Sulphurous and
Unhealthy, especially in such Cities as
<hi>London,</hi> where Sea-Coals are generally
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36787:73"/>
used for Firing, and most People (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Women) creep close to those ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
Fires, without using themselves to
proper Exercises, whereby their Blood
stagnates, and becomes thick and foul,
whence are Generated the Scurvey,
stoppages of the Breast, Coughs and
Shortness of Breath; the ill effects
whereof will more manifest themselves
next Spring and Summer.</p>
               <p>4thly. This Disharmony and Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Elements, portends a dry
hot Summer to ensue, for all Extreams
(as before observed) produce their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,
which will not only encrease
Distempers, but I fear some Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Disease, and it is also a Forerunner
of Dearth and Scarcity, and the latter,
is the more to be apprehended, because
we have had several Plentiful and Fruit.

any) have improved them to that end,
for which they were given us by the
Lord, and his Hand-Maid Nature;
but most that abound in Plenty, have
gratified their Lusts and Passions, and
such as have not had wherewith to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

               <p>In this Disquisition my thoughts have

or any other stated <hi>Festivals;</hi> yet since
in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> the like were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by God himself, and since great
Deliverances require expressions of
more than ordinary Gratitude, and
signal Mercies deserve to be Celebrated
with perpetual Commemorations, I

since 'tis requir'd that all things be
done to Edification, and that he that
keepeth <hi>a day, should keep it to the Lord,</hi>
I would wish it might be kept in some
Respect suitable to the Dignity of the
Occasion.</p>
               <p>It is taken for granted by most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing

Now if we would rightly Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
this mighty Mercy and glorious
Work, (so profound and abstruse, that

of Man, whereby he that was made
<hi>little lower than the Angels,</hi> had by
Transgression depressed himself far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the <hi>Beasts that perish?</hi> How better,
than by admiring <hi>Infinite Divine Love</hi> in
sending of Christ, and his exceeding
readiness for the loss of Man, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
that Blessed Work; so as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
from the Regions of Glory, and
Cloath himself in our vile Flesh, and
suffer all kind of Indignities? And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
should not we be affected with
the mean and lowly manner of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
the Meekness, Temperance,
Purity, and Patience of his whole Life
and Death; and heartily endeavour to
imitate him therein. For,</p>
               <p>Tho' he was the Maker, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Owner and Sovereign Lord
of the World, yet he came into it in
the <hi>form of a Servant.</hi> Not according
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36787:77"/>
to the vain Expectations of the <hi>Iews,</hi> or
Fashions of Haughty Princes. His
Blessed Mother and Reputed Father
were Persons but of <hi>mean Condition,</hi> as
to outward Splendor; nor could they,
after a weary Journey, get room in the
Inn. The Grandeur of this Apostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
World did not agree with the
Humble Regenerating Power and Son
of God; for Man had much more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged
himself from his Ancient State,
than the Beasts had done from theirs;
for they continued still under the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of their Original Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
void of Offence; but Man, who
was made to live in and under the Son's
Holy Innocent Power, entered with his
harsh Will into <hi>Wrath, Fierceness, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
Cruelty, Violence,</hi> and all kinds
of <hi>Intemperance</hi> and <hi>Devilishness,</hi> far
beyond any thing of <hi>Beastiality;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Divine Goodness was pleased to be
as it were at first an <hi>Inmate</hi> with, or
<hi>Companion</hi> to the Innocent <hi>Bruits;</hi> and
that the poor Carpenter's Spouse, his
Blessed <hi>Virgin Mother,</hi> should be Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the <hi>King of Glory</hi> in a <hi>Stall</hi> or
<hi>Stable,</hi> where she had no stately Rooms
Hung with <hi>Arras,</hi> or Cloth of <hi>Tissue;</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:36787:78"/>
No Damask Curtains, nor Gaudy Quilts,
nor Down Beds, nor Delicate Fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen;
nor a Confectioners Shop of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Sweet Meats; nor was she Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
with a multitude of Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Rockers, or Tenders; or furnisht
with Wines or costly Cordials, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of <hi>Splendid Luxury,</hi> rather than
Assistants of <hi>Natural Necessity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Blessed amongst Women,</hi> had in
all probability, no better Bed than
might be made of Hay or Straw, since
her <hi>Sacred Babe</hi> was contented with a
<hi>Manger</hi> for his <hi>Cradle;</hi> how mean and
poor and despicable does this appear to
Eyes meerly Humane, when compar'd
with the Gallantry, Magnificence, vast
Preparations, numerous Attendants,
and all kind of Excess, now common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practis'd on such occasions! Yet will
all or most Men confess with their
Mouths, That this <hi>Meek and Humble
President</hi> was used by the Lord to draw
Man back out of Pride, Wrath and
Vanity, into Regeneration, Self denial,
and his Antient Innocent Estate; But
notwithstanding all such <hi>Verbal</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments,
I must, (if we may judge
of Trees by their Fruits) take leave to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36787:78"/>
tell them, That they do utter <hi>Lyes in
Hypocrisy;</hi> and that they do not in their
Hearts believe it, because all their
Practises are Diametrically opposite
thereunto; as was manifest by King
<hi>Herod,</hi> who was a Prince in the Wrath,
and all such ever did, do, and will use
all their utmost Subtilty and Diligence
to destroy and kill the Humble, Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Meek <hi>Child of Love and Light,</hi> which
is the true Regenerating Power of God.</p>
               <p>Again, The Declaration or Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of this <hi>Blessed Birth</hi> was made
by Troops of Angels to certain Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
as they were tending their Flocks
in the Field; who are a sort of People
regarded by the Pride and Grandeur
of the World, as mean, base and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
unmeet for the Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Persons of Quality. And why
to such is the happy News first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated?
Was it not because such
Persons do live nearer to, and more
under the Government of the <hi>Holy
Power and Divine Light?</hi> For have not
all the Great and Wonderful Overt res
and gled Tidings of Salvation been
principally made to, and in poor low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minded Men and Women? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36787:79"/>
our Lord gives his Father thanks,
that he had <hi>hid the Holy Mysteries from
the High and the Learned, and had reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them unto Babes.</hi> And suitable to
such Objects, all the Manifestations of
God, and Teachings of good Men,
have been in an humble Child-like way,
both their Doctrine and Practice being
to lead People into <hi>Humility, Temperance,
Cleanness, Self-denial,</hi> and <hi>Resignation,</hi>
which are true Paths of <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
Consider these things, O all you that
vainly live in the <hi>outward</hi> Observation
of days and times, and yet neglect and
despite the <hi>true Ends</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of such
Celebrations, lest you be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to honour the <hi>Sepulchres</hi> of the <hi>Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,</hi>
but were ready to stone all such
as lived in the Spirit and Practise of
their Virtues.</p>
               <p>For in the second place, Let us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
after what sort this Solemnity is
kept now a days by the generallity of
those that profess themselves Christians:
Is it not become a matter of meer For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality

the most of them? Rather as a Feast to

than as a Sober Religious Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Holy and

Prophaneness, Intemperancies in Meats,

the greater number of People not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

in the beginning, performed with great
<hi>Devotion, Sobriety, Prayer,</hi> and Works
of <hi>Mercy,</hi> not of Riot and Superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Whereas now how few are there

if not down-right Drunkenness? En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36787:80"/>
our selves (like the rich Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
in the Gospel) with Tables not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>full-spread,</hi> but <hi>over-charg'd</hi> with
heaps of high rich compounded Foods,
and variety of strong Cordial Drinks;
whilst multitudes of our poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
want Bread, and almost all the
Necessaries of <hi>Humane Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may flatter our selves with <hi>Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality</hi>
and <hi>Charity,</hi> but generally it is
either misplac'd or ill measur'd; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
on Objects that need it not, or
in such a vast Profusion at once, as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
abates its value, and renders it
much more a Crime than a Virtue, and
rather a Temptation than a Relief.</p>
               <p>Is it not a frequent Custom to Invite
the Rich, and such as can Invite you
again; which <hi>He</hi> for whose sake you
keep this time, does expresly forbid?
And if a Great Man, or one you hope
to get by, comes to your House to trifle
away precious time in vain Discourses,
Play, or lewd Games, will you not
Treat him in a Courteous manner, with
the choifest Foods and Liquors you can
get, and think you have not made him
Welcome, or discharg'd the part of a
free House<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36787:80"/>
him to Eat and Drink beyond the
Power, as well as Necessities of Nature?
But when the Poor Neighbours, (whom
<hi>Christ</hi> came to save as well as the others)
knock at the Door, you either pretend
you have <hi>nothing for them,</hi> or else
assign them the worst and coursest Fare;
(a sorry pittance of <hi>Bull-Beef,</hi> or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Parboil'd Meat,</hi> out of which you
have extracted all the <hi>Nutritive Virtue</hi>
to inrich your <hi>Plum Pottage)</hi> even such
as the Proud Wives and Miniking
Daughters would scarce offer to their
<hi>Negro Nos'd Dogs,</hi> that are their Table
and Lap Companions, tho' one of the
most Ravenous and Uncleanest Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in Nature. And indeed since
Man's Degeneration, he delights much
in the Converse and Company of the
worst and vilest of Animals, especially
of such as are capable of being made,
by his wicked Industry, his Butchers to
hunt, tear, worry and torment the
other Creatures of greater Value and
Innocency; which is accasioned by Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,
because himself is departed from
Innocence into Wrath and Fierceness.</p>
               <p>For the same Reason, the Rich and
Proud cannot endure the Cries, or
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36787:81"/>
Conversation of the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Humble,</hi>
and therefore rarely Visit, or willingly
admit them into their Presence; and
when they crave an <hi>Alms,</hi> will present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
like Churlish <hi>Nabals,</hi> reproach them
as Idle Persons, that spend their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and time in <hi>Ale-Houses</hi> or drinking
of <hi>Brandy;</hi> when in truth this Reproof
is not so much for <hi>Admonishment,</hi> as to
excuse your felves from giving them
Relief, and so at once <hi>saveboth your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and your Credit,</hi> as the Proverb hath
it; tho' at the same time you your selves
set them the worst Examples, by wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all kind of Excess, Intemperance,
and waste of the good Creatures of God;
And what is all this but <hi>vile Hypocrisy?</hi>
If idle expence of time, and unnecessary
<hi>Tippling</hi> be so great a Crime as renders
men unworthy of common Mercies, why
do you practice it? If you Indulge your
selves therein, why do you upbraid
these poor Creatures, that have far
greater Temptations thereunto?</p>
               <p>It may reasonably be supposed, That
scarce less than an Hundred Thousand
Pounds has excused the City of <hi>London</hi>
and <hi>Suburhs,</hi> in unjustifiable Expences
and Superfluity this very <hi>Christmas;</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:36787:81"/>
and if so, what vast Sums may have
been consumed in the Nation? How
common is it at such times, especially,
for a Man to be almost jostled down, or
otherwise abused by Drunken Men and
Boys, and to have his Ears bor'd, and
the Air infected, and the Streets pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
with Vollies of horrid <hi>Oaths
Curses, Execrations</hi> and <hi>Blasphemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O foolish People! Bethink your selves,
&amp; turn from these and the like Ungodly
Vanities and Abominations, and observe
<hi>this time,</hi> and all other the short Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of your fleeting Lives, to the
Ends for which the one was Instituted,
and the other lent you; consider how
uneasie and dreadfully prejudicial these
courses will prove both to Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at the last Audit; how incapable
they render you of Answering the great
Ends for which you were Created and
sent into the World. Let every one
remember that he is but a <hi>Steward</hi> here,
and if God has given him a <hi>Benjamin's
Portion,</hi> more than is needful for himself
and Family (as many thousands have)
then it is his Duty to Improve the same
by shewing Mercy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o all, and to distribute
to the Needy, the Fatherless, and the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36787:82"/>
Widow in special manner, for <hi>with such
Sacrifices is our heavenly Father well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
nothing being capable of rendring
us so like our <hi>Maker</hi> as mercifulness, and
Deeds of Charity; for he makes his Sun
to shine on the Just and Unjust, and
the fructifying Dews of his upper
Chambers to fall with equality; and
affords his great and noble Elements,
<hi>viz,</hi> the Earth, the Water, and the
Air, with all their numberless pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
to all Creatures, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Persons or Things.</p>
               <p>Therefore we are not to think our
selves excused from doing good, and
relieving necessitous Persons, though
pehhaps they have not improved their
Time and Talents to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
but rather from thence reflect
what vain and unprofitable Servants we
have been our selves, and how unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of any of those Mercies we enjoy.</p>
               <p>And the better to accomplish and
render us capable of discharging these
necessary Duties, let all that would
be good Christians in earnest, betake
themselves to the good and wholsome
Rules of <hi>Sobri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Order,</hi> in Meats and Drinks, which
will not only make them more able to

contribute to the necessities of their
Poor Neighbours, but preserve their
Bodies and Spirits sound, vigorous,
healthful, and prompt to all good
actions; a sober, or irregular Diet,
having far greater power, not only on
the corporeal parts, but also on the
Mind it self, to improve or weaken it,
than most in our days imagine. Did
not our Fore-fathers live to wonderful
Ages in perfect Health, whilst their
Foods were simple and innocent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
chiefly (if not wholly, as before
the <hi>Flood</hi>) of <hi>Herbs, Fruits</hi> and <hi>Grains,</hi>
with pure <hi>Water</hi> for Drink, which of
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l other is most natural; those Holy
Patriarchs did not live by Slaughter and
Violence, nor make their Stomachs the
<hi>Burial Places</hi> of dead Bodies; nor did
they ransack the furthest corners of the
Earth for <hi>Dainties.</hi> Their Provision
was Innocent and simple, cheap and
ready at hand, whereby they became
able (as fire is quencht by withdrawing
of Fuel) to check and regulate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
motions of the Mind and
Insurrections of the Flesh. Hence some
of the Antients have delivered it as a
Maxime, That none could understand
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36787:83"/>
God and his wonderful Works, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
Health and long Life, but those that
abstain from <hi>Flesh, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Vices;</hi>
bounding their desires according to the
Ends and Necessities of Nature; not
for insatiate Appetite, or vain Customs;
for were Uncleanness and Intemperance
reigns, the Soul is so subjected to a
gross unweildy and polluted Body, that
it cannot discern things Coelestial; but
Sobriety and Purity renders it the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God,</hi> wherein his blessed Spirit
delights to dwell and communicate his
Gifts and Graces, so that where we see
<hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Abstinence,</hi> we may
justly expect a Concatenation of all
other Virtues; because there no <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous</hi>
matter is bred that may clog the
Organs of the Body, or render them
indisposed for the Operations of the
Soul; nor can the manifold Benefits
and Advantages thereby acrewing, be
conceived or understood by any but
those only, that have abandon'd Riot
and Superfluity; for nothing but Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Practise and Perseverance therein,
can make a Man a competent Judge in
this matter, which I seriously recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to all that would enjoy Health
of Body or Mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:36787:83"/>
For the Power of Temperance and
Sobriety proceeds from an inward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and they endow their Observers
with the Riches both of Time and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
making us truly sensible of God's
Blessings. The <hi>full Stomach loaths Ho-</hi>
(Figuratively put for the choicest and
most delicate Foods) <hi>but to the hungry
every bitter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thing is sweet,</hi> saith the wise
King. How pleasant, how relishing,
how refreshing is every Man's dish of
Food, to the sober Mind, and <hi>well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Stomach!</hi> And how ready are
such Men to give the Lord thanks and
humble acknowledgments for the least
of his Mercies, because they see, feel,
and taste the most pleasant Operation
of the Divine Hand in all things; their
Bodies are both sustained and delighted
with the coursest Fare, their Minds satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
their Beds easie, their Sleep sound;
they are not tortured with <hi>Gouts,</hi> nor
drowned with <hi>Dropsies,</hi> nor burnt up
with <hi>Feavers;</hi> their Heads are not dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Fumes, nor their Stomachs
oppressed with fainting fits, nor windy
griping humours; but they rise fresh
as the <hi>Morning-Sun,</hi> and chearful as
the early Lark, soaring aloft towards
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:36787:84"/>
Heaven; and on the <hi>Wings</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Gratitude,</hi> chaunt forth Anthems of
Praise to their adorable Creator.</p>
               <p>For they are equally fit for Exercises
either Corporeal or Spiritual; their
Fountain of Life, Natures <hi>Balsamick
Oyl,</hi> the <hi>Radical Moisture</hi> flows freely
thro' every part, like a pleasant breeze
of Wind that moderates the <hi>Central
Fires,</hi> that they burn not too violently.
For these reasons the Wise and Prudent
in all Ages have zealously courted Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
Abstinence, and Cleanness, as
their best Guides and Companions;
they abate extravagant desires, because
a small matter will suffice a regular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;
they resist Pride, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Vain-glory, and are the only
Friends or proper Nurses to <hi>Charity.</hi>
They punish not the Body with exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Labour, and at the same time ease
the Mind of distracting Cares; for
what need they scrape, contend, or
take thought for much, when they
know how little will fully and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
supply all their real wants?</p>
               <p>To <hi>do good and Communicate</hi> of those
Gifts which God has intrusted us with,
is one of the most fundamental Precepts
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:36787:84"/>
in the Gospel, since nothing renders
us more like our Maker; for he gives
all things freely, and receives nothing,
And likewise the same does naturally
and by simpathy attract the sweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the <hi>Coelestial Bodies,</hi> the
Vertues all Elements, with the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wishes
and hearty Prayers not only of
the Poor and Needy, but of all good
Men; which have a Secret yet power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Influence on the Souls and Spirits of
People so well disposed, and to obtain
Blessing on their Persons and Families.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore, let all that would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Solemn Times, or Feasts, <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them to the Lord,</hi> viz. with serious
pious Meditations, Holy Conferences,
Humility, Temperance, and Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds;
and at such Seasons especially,
to avoid Gluttony, Riot, Drunkenness,
Excess, Superfluity, and Prophaneness;
and not to sacrifice so many thousands
of innocent Creatures to their inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Lusts, or ravenous Desires, as now
commonly they do; which perhaps
ought the rather to be regarded and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
since God's Manifestation of
his Holy Son of Light, seems to have
been in Love and Mercy to the whole
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:36787:85"/>
World; not only unto Man, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in some respects, to the rest of the
under-graduated Creatures; for the
<hi>Everlasting Gospel</hi> (or Divine Power of
God in his Son) was and is <hi>to be Preached
unto every Creature under Heaven,</hi> as the
Angel has it in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> for this
Act of Grace, though some obtain
greater Priviledges by it than others,
was Universal; and though the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were become <hi>subject unto Vanity</hi> by
Man's Degeneration and Fall, yet they
shall again receive that State of <hi>Vnity</hi>
and Pleasure, which they should have
enjoyed, if Man had continued in his
first Estate; and therefore the Apostle
aith, <hi>The whole Creation groans to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
into the Glorious Liberty of the
Sons of God.</hi> That is, to be freed from
those Oppressions, Violences and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
they now suffer under Man's fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Tyranny; for so far as Man
is truly Redeemed from the wrathful
fierce Spirit, so far he freeth all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
under his Government. And
therefore the Scripture saith, <hi>The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Man is merciful to his Beast.</hi> And
let us flatter our selves as we please,
these Extravagancies and Violences to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36787:85"/>
innocent Creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the spilling of their
Blood, and eating so continually of
their Carcasses; does both awaken and
strengthen the Fountain of Wrath
within us, and will certainly in due
time draw down a Retaliation of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
               <p>This we see every day in part fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
for are not our <hi>Helioga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>alus</hi>'s, our
mighty Devourers, that continually
gorge their Paunches with the Flesh of
their fellow Animals, severely punisht
for their Gluttony and Cruelty, by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of torturing Diseases, as <hi>Gouts,
Dropsies, Consumptions,</hi> &amp;c. And not
only so, but when the Evil grows gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
predominant, it is Chastized by
some <hi>Epidemical</hi> Judgment, or Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
I pretend not to <hi>Prophecy,</hi> nor
would amuse People with vain Threats;
but this I may modestly say, That if
we look back into History, we shall
rarely find but the Plague hath visited
the City of <hi>London,</hi> more or less in the
Circle of every twenty years. And if it
hath now been free twenty two years,
we may perhaps assign the <hi>Nature Causs</hi>
thereof to the great Fire, which purged
its stench and pollutions, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:36787:86"/>
open way of Rebuilding, whereby
the whole City is become much more
sweet and delightsome, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Houses more Airy and Pleasant,
rendring the whole much more whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to the Inhabitants; this may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
but will not I fear, be able altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prevent the returns of sweeping
Sicknesses; and if we regard the Course
of Nature, and especially the Sins and
Provocations of People stirring up the
Divine Wrath, I am very apt to fear
some such terrible Visitation within
these two, three, or four years next at
farthest; but in this I am not positive,
for God draws his destroying Sword at
his own appointed times; however the
Caution can do no hurt, to admonish all
Persons of each Sex, Age, and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to Repent and amend their Lives,
lest they be snatcht away suddenly, and
there be none to deliver.</p>
               <p>Which that they may do, and lay up
<hi>Treasures in Heaven,</hi> by being liberal to
the Poor on Earth; I do again with all
earnestness exhort them to Sobriety,
Temperance, and Works of Mercy:
And that this may be the more regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed, I shall propose an easie
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36787:86"/>
Method, which each Person may encrease
or diminish as to the proportion of
Alms set down, according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Circumstances, provided they
bestow freely, as in the Presence of
God, what they can spare, without any
real Injury to their Family.</p>
               <p>Since 'tis a custom amongst most
Men, especially Traders in Cities and
Towns, at this time to <hi>cast up their
Stocks,</hi> to see how God has blessed them
for the year past, as to their Profits or
Losses, it would be highly convenient,
if for every Pound, it shall upon the
Ballance appear that they have gain'd,
to give at least Six Pence to the Poor, or
other good Uses (as towards the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of poor Children, which is the
Foundation of good Government and
Order) and as for Gentlemen and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of great Estates, whose Revenues
come in without Labour of their own,
to allow, for every Hundred Pounds <hi>per
Annum,</hi> one Shilling in the Pound; and
Farmers or Renters of Land, to give
Three Pence for every Pound they have
gained in the foregoing Year. And
other Men of great Real or Personal
Estates, which have been partly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36787:87"/>
by Oppression or Violence, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
great hazards at Sea, where others
have deeply suffered, but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in cases of Estates acquir'd by
Man-Slaughter (though priviledg'd by
Worldly Custom and Laws) for every
Hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> or its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent
in Money or Goods, to give
Fifteen Pounds <hi>per Cent,</hi> that is, Three
Shillings in the Pound. For though I
cannot allow that uncharitable Proverb,
<hi>That every very Rich Man is either an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Man himself, or the Son of one.</hi> Yet
I must joyn with that other,

               </p>
               <p>And I know no better Conveyance or

the likeliest Expedients to Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Posterity a lasting Title, and obtain a

your Lawful Endeavours, for want of
which, how often do we see vast E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
blasted, and suddenly transferred
to new Owners, and the most moyling

Nor would it be of small Advantage
both to the Health of the Body, and
the good of the Soul, for Persons of
Estates, at least such whose Callings are
not Laborious, to set apart a <hi>Fasting-Day</hi>
once a Weeek, or at least to eat

               <p>WAR is ever at the best, even to
those that are most successful,
a very disastrous Calamity. And what
through the Judgment of God, the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of our Publick Affairs, and
the present Discouragement of Trade,
the Cries of the Poor are exceedingly
raised in this Nation, and are like to be
a great deal more, without the the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition
of some preventing Relief.
I would not say any thing that should
give Offence; but it cannot be unknown
that many hundred of Families in and
about this City, suffer extreamly upon
that account. 'Tis therefore that I
propose this easie and convenient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of raising Fifteen or Twenty
Thousand Pounds <hi>per</hi> Week towards the
supplying those that really want: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
the Luxurious Superstuities
of those that abound: And teaching
those whose Extravagance would carry
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:36787:89"/>
their Inclinations beyond their Ability,
the Art of good Husbandry. Which
things effectually pursued and practised,
would be unconceivably beneficial as
well to the Rich as the Poor, and in a
great measure engage a Blessing from
God Almighty upon our Publick and
Private Undertakings. 'Tis the best
use we can make of Heavens Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and will assuredly stand us instead,
if Providence should be pleas'd to turn
up the Reverse of our Condition. 'Tis
making the Lord of the whole Earth
our Debtor, and laying an Obligation
upon him of seeing us repaid, since he
that gives to the Poor, <hi>lends to the Lord.</hi>
This indeed is laying up for a Wet Day,
and securing a Treasure that no Body
can rob us of. No Man alive is exempt
from accidents and Casualties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it becomes of important Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be prepared for them.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>A Wise Man fits his Mind for every

There are at this time thousands of
very many Trades in and about this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
City, that have little or no
Work at their Callings, whereby to
support themselves, and supply their
perishing Families with Bread. And
can those whom God hath intrusted
with plentiful Estates, gorge themselves
with overcharged Tables, even to a
Surfeit, and Riot in Excess of Wine,
forgetting the Afflictions of <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
whilst their Brethren languish, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
die for want of Necessaries? Do
they not think that God at such a time
calls upon them for his Quit-Rent, out
of those vast Revenues that they hold
meerly by the Tenure of his Bounty?
Shall the Heavenly Magnificence be so
extensive towards them, and theirs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
towards their Brethren? His
Majesty has already shewn us the way,
and as I am informed, given large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of his Charity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.
How Honourable would it be
then for such who would be esteemed
good Christians and Loyal Subjects, to
follow a Generous and Royal Example?
One would think this should Encourage
them to be willing to Contribute freely
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:36787:90"/>
to the Relieving the Common Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Succouring those who labour
under the Burden of insupportable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
and Want. Which they might
do with the greatest Ease and least
Dammage imaginable. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</p>
               <p>Let us resolve, one Day in the Week
at least, during the deadness of Trade,
and dearness of Corn, to refrain from
large Eating, retrench the Superfluous
Exorbitance of our Tables, abstain
from our Customary Excess, of Wine
and strong Drinks (I dare promise it
would be never the worse for our
Health, but much the better, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for our Business) and what we so
save, Employ in Charitable Uses for
the Service of the Poor. By this only
means, within the Bills of Mortality,
might easily be raised Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Pounds <hi>per</hi> Week, and no Man a
Farthing the worse, but infinitely the
better both in his Estate and his Health,
which is more valuable than the greatest
Estate in <hi>Christendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are without Dispute, within
the above-mentioned Circuit, near an
Hundred Thousand Families, whose
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:36787:90"/>
Dinners one with another cost them
Three Shillings a day, I mean extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
in Fish, Flesh, Fowl, strong
Beer, Ale, Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when a little
Pap, Pulp or Grewel would do much
better. Or if they like not that, Bread,
Butter, Cheese, Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am sure
will supply Natures wants in all things
needful, if People would be so wise as
not suffer false Opinion, and that grand
Tyrant Custom, to Enslave both their
Souls and Bodies.</p>
               <p>Now an Hundred Thousand Shillings
is Fifteen Thousand Pounds: And then
it is not to be doubted, but generally
more is spent in Drink than Victuals.
There are more than an Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Persons that lavish away daily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Twelve Pence in Wine, Brandy,
and other strong Liquors; which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
if forborn but one day in a Week,
and bestow'd as aforesaid, would amount
to Five Thousand Pounds more, which
makes in the whole, Twenty Thousand
Pounds <hi>per</hi> Week, and this justly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed,
would supply Eighty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Families at Five Shillings <hi>per</hi> Week
a piece.</p>

                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:36787:91"/>
Or otherwise the one half might be
imploy'd in the Maintenance of Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
Thousand Families, and the other
half to build Schools and Hospitals for
the Education of the poor Children and
Orphans, and other Miserable People,
Thousands being destroyed yearly for
want of Food and other Conveniencies
of Life.</p>
               <p>And can we now suffer such a number
of poor Souls to perish for want, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than abridge and deny our Palates
and insatiate Paunches, some unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nay pernicious Danties, only one
day in a Week? Let us then no longer
make a God of our Bellies, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to deserve our Saviour's Eulogy,
<hi>I was an hungry, and you gave me Meat.</hi>
               </p>

are become very pressing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable:
I count it no worthless Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

               <p>For this is to be noted, that the

is more easie and more nutrimental.
And a Man may live as well, if not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

this Pap will support both Health and
Strength to a higher degree, making a

to mix with, drink up, or
allay the Oyliness of such things, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:36787:92"/>
to render them more apt for Separation
and Digestion. For all Fat or Oyly
Bodies furr the Passages, and obstruct
the Stomach, and are extream heavy
and hard to be divided. By which
means, in all Countries where People
feed much on fat succulent Foods, the
common Distempers are <hi>Feavers, Gout,
Stone, Gravel</hi> and <hi>Wind,</hi> all which are
occasion'd by the Oyliness and Greasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Foods, and too great a
quantity, which naturally generates
thick cloddy Blood, dull and impure
Spirits, which hinder the Circulation
of them both: And Experience teaches
that in the Eastern Country, where Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
live much on Corn Food, those cruel
Distempers are hardly known.</p>
               <p>Now it is to be observed, that all

themselves in, the strong nutritive
Powers, or gellius glewy qualities,
which is the band of Nature, are by the
predominancy of the Heat broken as a
Man would break a Stick in sunder.</p>
               <p>Therefore Bread will not thicken
when put into Milk, Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
boyled, but easily separate, and not at
all incorporate and become one Body
with the Water, as Flower will, before
it is baked. So that the making Flower
into Bread, by baking of it, doth not
consume the quantity, but the natural
quality of Corn also: and too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eaten alone will obstruct the Stomach
and all the subservient Vessels.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, Bread as it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
eaten, is a very good thing, and
of great use, tho' in it self but of little
Nourishment, however being eaten with
fat Food it mightily helps Concoction:
But Flower when dress'd after the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
method, affords the most
Nourishment, especially if there be good
Pot Herbs added. But if you would
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36787:93"/>
divert and gratifie the Stomach with a
dryer and harder sort of Food, which
Nature sometimes loves, make the
Flower into small Dumplins, so called,
but little bigger than Crown pieces,
put them into boyling Water, and let
them boyl quick; they will presently
be done.</p>
               <p>This sort of boyled Bread does not
only afford more and better Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but is pleasanter to the Palate,
and more satisfactory to the Stomach.
This may be called boyled Bread, and
is best without Salt, or any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient.
Therefore Flower properly
diluted and prepared, best agrees with
the Eaters; if it be the most part of
your Food, then thick is best: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thin is very healthful between
whiles. But such as live upon solid
fat Food, their Gruels ought to be thin,
which will better cleanse the Vessels of
the Stomach and Ureters, preserve
Nature, and prevent the Generation of
the <hi>Stone,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Rickets</hi> in Children.</p>
               <p>Now Fish, Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are loaded with
a gross Phlegmatick Body, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
eating thereof cannot but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the Eater with the like Qualities.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:36787:93"/>
As is manifest from those Cattle that
feed on green Food, as Grass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are
not such Beasts less able to travel and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and is not their Flesh more gross,
apter to putrifie, and Salt it self will
not preserve it from Corruption? On
the contrary, such Beasts as feed on
Corn, Hay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are dry, they
are not only strong and able to endure
Labour and Travel, but their Flesh is
more firm and substantial, and durable
when salted, than the former.</p>
               <p>We deceive our selves if we judge
that Flesh hath much Nourishment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath much Juice or Matter:
By the same reason, Grass would have
more good Nourishment and Strength
in it than Corn: But the more gross
Matter and Phlegmatick Juices any
thing is loaded with, the weaker and
fainter that thing is, and consequently
more subject to decay, and distemper
the Spirits, being but few, and those
that are dull, Cloudy and impure. So
that upon the whole matter, Flesh,
Fish, and Fowl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot have the
Preheminence of Foods: Neither are
they indued with so much, nor so good
Nourishment as Corn Foods. But
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:36787:94"/>
here we must give way to the prevailing
Tyrant Custom, which is the Champion
I am to make War against; and as the
Foods of Beasts are better or worse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
clean or substantial, their Health,
Strength and Ability are according.
The like is to be understood of the
Food Men live on, for it is not, as is said
before, the gross Juices that affords the
true Nourishment, but the fine, light,
volatile Spirituous Vertues; for this
cause most are greatly mistaken, that
attribute so great and good Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Flesh and Fish. Indeed they
are full of gross Matters and Juices,
which do serve chiefly to cloud the finer
Vertues and true Life, which do also add
Weight and not Spirit, so that the
great Eaters thereof, become dull and
heavy, loading Nature with too great
quantities of Phlegmatick Juices and
Humours, which do not only oppress
Nature in all her Operations, but is the
Root of many Diseases both of the
Body and Mind. Green Corn and Grass
are endued with more Substance and
Juices than either Hay or Corn; but it
is Earthly and Gross, and affords a
Nourishment of a like Nature: The
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:36787:94"/>
more any thing is loaded or endued
with Gross or Corrupt Matter, the
sooner it falls into Putrifaction. But
on the contrary, the dryer, firmer,
and more Spirituous any thing is, the
longer it will endure and be preserved
from Corruption. But of all things Men
eat, Flesh and Fish do s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oner decay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the abundance of gross Matter
it does contain, which does as it were
in a moments time cloud and suffocate
the fine Sal-nitral Vertues.</p>
               <p>I am sure that a Man may make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Meal with half a Penny-worth of
Wheat-Flower made into Pap, and half
a Penny-worth of Bread to eat with
it, and a little Salt, and be as strong,
brisk, and able to perform any Labour,
as he that makes the best Meal he can
with either Flesh or Fish. So great is
the Ignorance, Folly, Blindness, false O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
and Custom, of those that
call themselves the Learned. Pray tell
me what kind of Ignorance and Madness
does possess the Poor Labouring Man
that hath but Six Pence, or One Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to buy Food for his whole Family,
and to lay it out in a Sheeps Head and
Gethers, or an Oxes Liver, which is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:36787:95"/>
his whole Stock; and the best Food that
can be expected from it, is a little Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Broth or Putrified Pottage; when
with five times less charge in Flower, he
might have procured a far better Meal,
being made into Pap or Gruel, with a
little Bread and Salt.</p>
               <p>It is also to be noted, that those that
live on Corn Food, have not occasion
to drink Strong or Cordial Drinks, as
those that eat Flesh and Fish; the first
being more spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uous and warming,
the last Cold, Phlegmatick and Gross,
and harder of Concoction.</p>
               <p>'Tis likewise observable, that half
the quantity of Wine or strong Drink
will exhillerate a Man that lives on
CornFood to as high a degree as double
the quantity will those that feed on
Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is a good Argument
that Corn Food affords the cleanest and
finest Nourishment, and breeds the best
Blood and Humours, the Spirits being
as it were always upon the Wing, and
consequently apter to be moved. The
Complexion of Fish and Flesh is Cold
and Phlegmatick, (but whilst living)
they are for the most part of a hot,

and about <hi>London,</hi> Forty Thousand
Gentlemen, Merchants, Shopkeepers
and Tradesmen, worth in Estates from
Five Hundred to Ten Thousand Pounds,
and these might possibly have three
Children each, one with another,
which is a Hundred and Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
so that at this time it is not to be
questioned, if an exact scrutiny be
made, and account given of each Man's
Off-spring, but that there are now half,
or two thirds of these that really want
such a piece of Charity as is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:36787:100"/>
Now if we will but look forward,
we may rationally conclude, That
Thirty or Forty Years hence, our
Children or Grand-Children may be
in the like poor Condition; so that
Money thus disposed of, as we have
proposed, is a far better Security to our
Posterity than the Free Land of any
particular Person can purchace for
them: Besides, you have the Great
God's Word, and our Saviour Christ's
Promise, to Indempnifie and save you
harmless; for <hi>he that gives to the poor,
lends to the Lord,</hi> and there shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
Restitutions made, with the
Blessings of this World, and with Life
Eternal in the World to come, which
is both personal and Real Security.
Neither do I believe there is any firmer
or better way of Conveying or Intail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Estates on our Children and Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
than by Works of Mercy and
Almsgiving, being assured according
to the Word of God, that they are the
likeliest Expedients and Antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the secret Canker, and give our
Children a sure and lasting Title to
their Inheritance: For Retaliation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments is the Indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:36787:101"/>
Law of God, which will have its
Execution either in this World or that
which is to come. This our Saviour
further exemplifies in the Parable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Sheep and the Goats, when
he says to the Sheep on his Right Hand,
<hi>Come, ye blessed, into the Kingdom prepared
for you; for I was hungry, and you fed
me; naked, and ye cloathed me; sick,
and in Prison, and ye administred unto
me:</hi> But to the Goats he says, <hi>Go ye
cursed into everlasting Darkness, prepared
for the Devil and his Angles; for you have
neither fed, cloathed, nor administred to
me.</hi> And further, when they expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulated
with him, saying, <hi>Lord, when
did we see thee hungry, naked, sick, or in
Prison?</hi> His Answer was, <hi>Insomuch as
ye did it not to one of these little ones, ye
did it not to me.</hi> Hence it is Evident,
in so many plain words, what Christ's
Sheep were justified for; and for what
the Goats were condemned; the first
had Charity, the latter not; therefore
to do good, and communicate those
Gifts the Lord hath intrusted us with,
is one of the most Binding and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Precepts in the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Charity being therefore the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:36787:101"/>
first true step to all Vertue; that we
may obtain the Blessing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
upon the Publick Undertakings,
and all our Private Lawful Endeavours,
let us resolve to go on chearfully, and
lay up a Treasure in Heaven, by being
Liberal to the Poor and Needy upon
Earth. And for the better and more
singular performance of these Duties,
our Holy Religion and Interests obliges
every one in his Station, avoiding Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness
and Expensive Sensuality,
to betake our selves to Sobriety and
Temperance, which are the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters
and Encouragers of Charity,
with proper and due Fasting, which is
none of the least Vertues, for they
all proceed from the Fountain of God's
Grace, and an inward Ground or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Principle in the Soul.</p>
               <p>This is what I have given my Mind
to think of, and do believe it my Duty
to Recommend the same to my Fellow
Citizens, wherein I humbly Pray,
That my good Will, at least, may be
accepted, though it should happen that
some of my Notions are not altogether
approved of; for I am conscious to my
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:36787:102"/>
self of no other aim than the discharge
of my Duty, to persuade Men to be

made of Beer, Wine, Cider, or other

most agreeable, friendly Foods to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
being easie of Concoction, and
do afford greater Strength, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
better Blood and finer Spirits,
than most do imagine, which are the
Sinews of Health; and they may be

Surfeits, either with Bread or without;
for these Liquid Regions, do as it were
contain the Sominary Vertues, both of
dry and moist Aliment, contributing a
more Sublime Nourishment than strong,
hard, salt Foods, being tempered with
such equality of Parts, whence do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

Balsamick Vertue, that the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

and gross Phlegmy Humors, and
at the same time supplying Nature with
a substantial, brisk Nourishment, and
sweet, friendly Moisture, provided they
are mixed and prepared with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and all that Love their Health,
ought to Eat them, at all times of the
Year, but more especially in Summer,
and hot Seasons; they make no noise,
nor cause any insurrection in the Body,
so that after a Meal of such Foods,
there is felt no inequality or indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
the Body doth not Burn with
an unatural Flame, nor the Crown is
not pestered with Fumes and Vapours;
in a word, they are endued with all the
good united Vertues, both of the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

these Pottages have such a Sympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

and Powers of Nature, but they are
easily melted into Chyle, without any
manifest trouble or molestation to the
Stomach; for the nearer affinity the
Foods have to the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> the easier
they are digested, and sharper is the
Appetite, because the sweet Vertues of
such things are drawn forth into all
the Members and Parts of the Body,
gently and mildly supplying them with
a fit and proper Nourishment, with far
more ease and pleasure to Nature, than
from hard, strong, salt Foods; neither

do proceed, after the eating thereof, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition,
and an unatural Drought,
which renders the whole uneasie, and
unfit, either for the Business of the Body
or Mind; therefore it is observable, that
in the Eastern and Southern Parts of the
World, where the Natives drink Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
their Foods being most, or all, made
into Pottages, where they never, or very
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:36787:104"/>
seldom, eat any Flesh, Fish, old Cheese,
salt Butter, and but little Bread in gross,
as the Custom is in the Northern Parts
of the World, therefore the Gout, Stone,
Scurvy, and many other Cruel Diseases
are not known; which Distempers do
for the most part proceed, and are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the constant feeding on strong,
hard, salt, crude Foods, and the drinking
of strong, harsh, sharp Drinks, being all
of a disagreeing Nature to the <hi>Menstruum</hi>
of the Stomach; and therefore they do
mightily obstruct Nature, stop the Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
begetting sharp, windy Humours,
thick Blood, dull and heavy Spirits, which
are the Original Causes of the Gout,
Wind, Stone, Scurvy, and many other
Diseases: For this Cause when any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
under those forementioned Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
the Learned advise them to live on
some of the above-mentioned Gruels and
Pottages; for if such Foods recover lost
Health, <hi>pars ratione,</hi> consequently it must
maintain and promote it.</p>
