            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For this Ladye and Quene ys her most

And yet thoughe thei have done,

neuer have thei bene able by anie directe

matter farther, as to certaine other noble
men, by vvhome at the last, Yt vvas reveled
to the Erle Murraye. Wherefore the Erle
dyd continuallie after, beare hym, a deadlie

he had so conningelie contriued the

suche motiues (as vpon the readinge of

of muche more dignitie and worthines. But
nowe I claime nothinge for the vvorthines

be any thinge preiudiciall to the iuste title
of others: yf moste open and manifeste
right, Iustice, and title do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre with
the worthines of the person: Then lett the
praise and Worthines remaine where yt ys,
And the right Where God and the lavve

good cavvses and grovvndes, to remoue

moste open and euidende, so yt ys moste

and never restored, and yet no
dishabilitie thereby vnto Edvvarde the
fovvrethe, nor vnto Henry the seaventhe
to receave the crovvne by lavvfull successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But to thys you wolde seame to ansvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in your saide booke, saienge that Henry
the seaventhe not vvithstandinge hys At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder
came to the crowne, as cast vpon
him by the order of the lawe. For as muche
that vvhen the crovvne vvas caste vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him,
that dishabilitie ceased. Wherein ye confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
directlie, that the Attainder ys no disha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
at all to the successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the crovvne.
For althovvghe no dishabilitie can be allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in him that hathe the crovvne in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
yet yf there vvere any dishabilitie in
him before to receaue and take the same
by lavvfull succession, then muste ye saie
that he vvas not lavvfull kinge but an vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
And therefore in confessinge Henrye
the seaventhe to be a lavvfull kinge, and
that the crovvne vvas lavvfullie caste vpon
hym, ye confesse directlie thereby that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he Was kinge in possession, there vvas
no dishabilitie in hym to take the crovvne
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8937:67"/>
by lavvfull succession, hys saide Attainder
not vvith standinge: Whiche ys as muche as
I vvolde vvishe you to graunte. But in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
vnderstandinge your self, that this

the case of forren birthe ovvte of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
alleagance: sainge, that in the case of the
Attainder necessitie dothe enforce the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the crovvne vpon the partie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted:
For othervvise ye saie the crovvne
shall not descende to anye. But vpon the
birthe ovvte of the kinges allegeance, ye
saie yt ys othervvise. And for prouf therof
ye put a case of I. S. beinge seased of landes,
and havinge issevve A, and B. A, ys attainted
in the life of I. S. his father, and after I. S. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethe,
A livinge vnrestored. Novve the lande
shall not descende either to A, or B. But shall
goe to the lorde of the fee by vvaye of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chete.
Othervvise yt had bene (ye saie) yf A,
had bene borne beyonde the sea. I, S. brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge

I, S. cometh againe into the realme, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hathe

shall inherite hys fathers landes. Yf the
<pb facs="tcp:8937:68"/>
crowne had bene holden of any person, to
whom yt might haue escheted, as in your
case of. I, S. the lande did. Then paraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
there had bene some affinitie betwene
your saide case, and the case of the crowne.
But there ys no suche matter. Besides that,
ye muste consider, that the kinge cometh
to the crovvne not onlie by discente, but
also and cheifelie by succession, as vnto a
corporation: And therefore ye might ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
haue sene a difference in your cases be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene
the kinges Maiestie and I, S. a subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte:
And also betwene landes holden of a

earthlie lorde, but of God almightie onlie.
But yet for argumentes sake, I wolde faine

yt ys a worlde to see, hovve you vvolde shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te

Well admitt that he came to the crowne by

this dothe not proue that he vvas dishabled

of the lavve duringe his mothers life,
yet after his mothers deathe no man hathe

Whiche thinge beinge trevve, all the obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

are fullie ansvvered, and thereby clierlie
vviped avvaye. Yet for farther argumentes

Amonge all the rules, maximes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gementes

rule ys so vntrevvlie sert forthe, that I can
not vvell agree, that yt ys any rule or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime
of the comon lawe of this realme of

time as the Kinge be intitled ther vnto by

And so ys a verie alien capable of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
within this realme. And then it muste
nedes fall ovvte plainlie: that your generall
maxime vvhere vpon you haue talked and
braged so muche, ys novve become no rule
of the common lavve of this realme. And
yf it be so, then haue you vttered very many
vvordes to small purpose. But yet let vs see
farther vvhether there be any rule or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime
in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lavve that maye seame
any thinge like to that rule, Whervpon any

ys one rule of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lavve, in vvordes
somevvhat like vnto that, vvhiche hathe
bene alleaged by the aduersaries. Whiche
rule ys sett forthe and declared by a statute
made An. 25. of Kinge Edwarde the thirde.
Whiche statute recitinge the dovvbte that
then vvas, Whether infantes borne ovvte of
the allegiance of Englande shoulde be able
to demaunde any heritage vvithin the same
allegia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or no? Yt vvas by the same statute

owte of the allegiance of the kinge, whose

that the common lawe alwayes was, and
yet ys, that no person borne owte of the

allegiance, shoulde be able to haue or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
any heritage within the same alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance

yt seamethe verie plaine, that the saide rule
bindethe also denizens, and dothe onlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
to discentes of inheritance, and not
to the hauinge of anie landes by purchasse.
Nowe will we then consider, whether this
rule by any reasonable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>struction can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
vnto the ladie Marie the Quene of
Scotlande, for and concerninge her title to
the crowne of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Yt hathe bene sayed
by the aduersaries, that she was borne in
Scotlande, whiche realme ys owte of the
allegiance of Englande, her father and
mother not beinge of the same allegiance.
And therefore by the saide rule she ys not
inheritable to the crowne of this realme.
Althowghe I might at the begininge verie

will firste examine the antecedente whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the saide Quene of Scotlande and all her

And altowghe sins the time of kinge Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

and subiection, whiche they did
owe vnto the kinges of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de: And haue
geuen and submitted them selues vnder the
obedience and allegeance of the vsurpers.
But as for the realme of Scotlande yt ys o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwise:
For the title which our Souereigne
Ladie and Quene and her ꝓgenitours haue
claimed vnto the realme of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de ys not
in the possession of the lande and crowne
of Scotlande, but onlie vnto the seruice of

the kinges of Scotlande sithe the
time of kinge Henrie the eight, haue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to do the saide homage and fealtie
to the kinges of England: Yet for all that
the kinges of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de can not by any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or lawe be called vsurpers. And thus
maye ye see (gentle Reader) by the opinion
of all indifferent men, and not led by affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the realme of Scotlande hathe
bene, and yet ys, within the allegeance and
dominion of Englande: And so your ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent

that makethe no prouf that the realme of

(not beinge especiallie mentioned in the

to be with in the meaninge of the same
maxime, as we haue before sufficientlie ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by a greate nomber of other suche like
generall rules and maximes of the lawes.
An other cause ys, for that the crwne ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not
be taken to be with in the wordes of
the saide supposed maxime: And that for
two respectes, one ys by cawse the rule
doth onlye dishable aliens to demaunde

Englande, which rule can not be stretched
to the demaunde of the crowne of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande,
which ys not with in the allegiance
<pb facs="tcp:8937:75"/>
of Englande, but ys the verie allegiance yt
self: As for a like example. Yt ys trevve that
all the landes vvith in the kinges dominion
are holden of the kinge either mediatlie or
immediatelie, and yet ys yt not trevve that
the crovvne (by vvhiche onlie the kinge
hathe his dominion) can be saide to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the kinge. For withoute the crowne
there can be neither kinge nor allegiance:
And so longe as the crovvne restethe onlie

crovvne can not be saide by any meanes to
be vvith in the allegiance of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de: And
therfore not within the wordes of the saide
rule or maxime. The title of the crovvne ys
also ovvte of the vvordes and meaninge of

Wherby yt dothe plainlie appeare that the

an other reason to proue, that the kinge and
the crowne can neither be saide to be with

thirde and moste principall cause of all ys,
for that the saide statute vvhere vpon the

may verye vvell beare a more large and
ample interpretation. And that for three
causes and considerations. Firste by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
lavve, this vvorde Liberi (vvhiche the

the first degree, but the other also ys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined.
The like ys vvhen the lavve of the

I am driuen to thincke, that there

suche for the meanenes of theire state of
the one side, and for the greatenes and
vveight of the cause on the other side, as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame
not the most sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te for suche a case.
The importance of the cause beinge no
lesse, then the disherison of so manye heires
of the crowne, As vvell from the one sister
as from the other, requirid and craued
some one or other of the priuie counsaile,

And vvell yt maye be, that he made a

nowe then, that yt so fallethe ovvte that

abowte certaine scrowles and copies of
the saide will, that the aduersaries pretende

so easelie carried awaye by suche scrowles
and copies. When all this faylethe, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
haue yet one shifte lefte for the

by makinge this assignation, for the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shinge
of the succession, and prouidinge
that the realme shoulde not be lefte voyde
of a gouernour. And therefore we muste
not subuerte the statute in cauillinge for
the defecte of the kinges hande. For as
muche as the parliamente might haue had
aucthorised his consente onlie withowte

And no newe aucthoritie geven to him to

that in this case, there ys no feare in the

               </gap>re other wise, as the

that by reason this surmised will was not

any vvaye hurte or hinder the iuste right a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

Nowe supposinge that neither the Lorde

of the saide Assertion, aswell againste the

iustlie require the saide will to be browght

of the same vvith the kinges hande, to be
dewly and consideratelie pondered, weied,

were against all lawes, and the lavve of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

all good reason geavethe, that the saide ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall

speake not vvith ovvte good probable and

Which parchance some other vvolde here

vvorthie and necessarie to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And firste before we entre into other

question. Whether theis generall
vvordes, vvhereby this large and ample
aucthoritie ys conueyed to kinge Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

mynde and purpose of the parliamente, as
muste of verie necessitie or greate lykely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hodde
be construed to be the verye mynde
and purpose of the sayde parliamente. Ye
will saye perchance, that the power and
aucthoritie of assignation muste be taken
generallie and absolutelie withowte excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
sauinge for the owtewarde signinge
of the will. Trewthe yt ys, there ys no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
elles expressed: But yet was there
some thinge elles principallie intended,
and yet for all that,<note place="margin">there must nedes be some qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d restrai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall words of the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</note> neaded not to be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.
The owtewarde manner was so
speciallie and preciselie appointed and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
to auoide suspitious dealinge, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
corruption and forgerie: And yet
vvas the vvill good and effectuall vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owte
the kinges hande: Yea and the assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

restrainte of the kinges hande, bene added

of the person to be limited and assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and so for the necessarie restriction
and limitation of the vvordes, were they
neuer so large and ample, there ys,
thowghe nothinge were spoken therof,
an ordinarie helpe and remedie other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
Yf the realme had bene set ouer to

of the vvordes seame to beare yt:
But the good mynde and purpose of the
ꝑliamente, and mans reason do in no wise
beare yt. Yf ye graunre that theis wordes
muste nedes haue some good and honeste
construction and interpretation (as reason
dothe force you to grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te it) Yet will I aske
farther, whether as the kinge cutt of in this
pretensed will the whole noble race of the
eldeste sister, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the firste issewe of the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geste

as of the remnante of the royall bloude, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to reason, and to the mynde
and purpose of the parliamente. Yt vvere
suerlie to greate an absurditie to graunte yt.
There muste be therefore in this matter
some reasonable moderation and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as vvell towchinge the persons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hended

right, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet excluded: As for the manner of
the doinge of the acte, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d signinge the will.
For the kinge as kinge coulde not dispose

And vvhat theire mynde vvas, yt vvill

Which thinge they do plainlie confesse: for
in vrginge theire presumptions, wherof we
have spoken, and myndinge to proue that
this will, which they saye is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie called
kinge Henryes will, was no newe will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised

Where of (as they saye) vvere dyvers olde
copies. Theye inferre theis Wordes, saienge
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8937:113"/>
thus: For yf yt be a newe will then devised,
Who coulde thincke that either hym self
wolde, or any man durste haue moved him,
to putt therein so many thinges contrarie
to his honour: muche lesse durste they them
selves devise any newe succession, or moue
hym to altre yt otherwise then they founde
yt, when they sawe that naturallie yt coulde
not be othervvise disposed. Wherein they
saie very trevvlie: For yt ys certaine that not
onlie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lavve of this realme, but
nature yt self tellethe vs, that the Quene of
Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (yf our gratious Souereigne shoulde
happen to dye hauinge no heyres of her
dodie) ys the next and right full heire of the
crovvne. Wherefore the kinge, yf he had
excluded her, he had done an vnnaturall
acte. Ye will saye he had some cause to do
this, by reason she was a forrainer a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d borne

he did very vnnaturally, Yea vnadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
inconsideratelie and wrongfullie, and to
the greate praeiudice and daunger of his
owne title to the crovvne of Fraunce, as we
haue alredie declared. And more over, yt ys
vvell to be vveighed, that reason and aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and <hi>ius gentium</hi> dothe require and crave:
That as the kinges of this realme wolde
<pb facs="tcp:8937:114"/>
thincke them selues to be iniuriouslie ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

vvith the heires of Spayne, Scotlande
or any other contrey (vvhere the succession
of the crovvne deuoluethe to the vvoman)
vvere shutt ovvte and barred from theyre
sayde right devve to them by the vviues (as
vve haue sayde) So likevvise they ovvght
to thincke of vvomen of theirr Royall

maye vvell iudge and take them selues
muche iniured, vnnaturallye and vvrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye
delt vvith all, to be thruste from the
succession of this crowne, beinge therto
called by the nexte proximitie of the Royal

kingdomes to the crowne of Englande, by

haue chaunced, and vvas eauen nowe
in this our time verye like to haue chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced

vvill nowe saye farther, that supposinge the
parliamente mynded to exclude her and
migh rightfullye so do, and that the kinge

For yf the lavvfull heires of the sayde La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye

when so euer any man shoulde by that
generalitie take any do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage and hurte

in that case cease and quaile, and be taken
as voyde. As for example yt appeareth
by the ciuill lavve,<note place="margin">Alciat. l. 1. verb. sig.</note> that yf yt be enacted
by Statute in some cities, that no man shall
pleade againste an instrumente, no not
the executours: Yet this not withstandin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
yf the executour make a trevve and

Wherfore the kinges doinges seame either
muche defectiue in the saide Ladie Frances
<pb facs="tcp:8937:117"/>
and Ladye Elenour, or muche excessiue in
theire childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And so thowghe he had sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the sayde will with his hande, yet the
saide doinges seame not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to the
mynde and purpose of the parliamente. We
vvill nowe goe forewarde and propownde
other greate and graue considerations, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
our saide purpose and inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, wherof
one ys, that in limitinge the crowne vnto
the heires of the bodie of the Ladie Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces,
the same Ladye then, and so longe after li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge,
the saide kinge did not appointe the
succession of the crowne accordinge to the
ordre and meaninge of the honorable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamente:
For as muche as the saide acte of
parliamente gaue to him aucthoritie to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d appointe the crowne to suche ꝑson
or persons in reuersion or remainder, as
shoulde please his highnes: meaninge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bye
some person certaine, of vvhom the
people might haue certaine knovvlege and
vnderstandinge after the deathe of kinge
Henrie the eight. Whiche persons certaine
the heires of the Ladye Fraunces coulde
not by any meanes, be intended: For as
muche as the saide Ladye Frances was then
liuinge, and therefore coulde then haue no
heires at all. By reason vvherof the people
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8937:117"/>
of this realme coulde not haue certaine
knowledge and perfecte vnderstandinge
of the succession,<note place="margin">11, H. 4: fol 72.</note> accordinge to the trevve
meaninge and intente of the saide acte of
parliamente.<note place="margin">19, H. 6: fol. 24.</note> But to this matter some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
vvolde seame to ansvvere and
saye,<note place="margin">11, H. 6: fol. 15.</note> that althovvghe at the tyme of the
saide kinge Henries deathe, the heires of
the bodye of the saide Ladye Frances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
vvere vncertaine: yet at suche tyme
as the sayde remainder shoulde happen to
fall, the saide heires might then certainlye
be knowen. In deede I vvill not denye, but
that paraduenture they might be then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynlie
knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but what greate mischeiffes
and inconueniences might haue ensewed
and yet maye, yf the vvill take place vpon
that ꝑaduenture and vncertaine limitation.
I vvolde vvishe all men vvell to note and
consider. Yt ys not to be doubted, but that
yt might haue fortuned at suche time as the
remainder shoulde happen to fall to the
saide heires of the Ladye Frances, the same
Ladie Frances shoulde then be also liuinge.
Who I praye you then shoulde haue had
the crowne? Paraduenture ye wolde saye,
the hey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es of the bodye of the Ladye Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>our,
to whom the next remainder vvas ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
<pb facs="tcp:8937:118"/>
Vndowbtedlie that were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie
vnto the meaninge of the saide supposed
wyll For so muche as the remainder ys ther
by limited vnto the heyres of the bodie of
the ladie Elenour, onlie for defaulte of is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sewe
of the saide Ladie Frances. Whereby
yt maye be very plainlie gathered vpon the
saide supposed wyll, that the meanynge
therof was not that the Chyldren of the
Ladie Elenour shoulde enioye the crowne
before the Chyldren of the Ladie Frances.
But what yf the sayde Ladie Elenour, had
bene then also lyvinge (wich myght have
happened, for as muche as bothe the saide
ladie Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, and Ladie Elenour by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
cowrse of nature myght have lived longer,
then vntyll thys daye:) Who then shoulde
have had the crowne? Trewlie the ryght
heyre whom thys supposed wyl mente to
exclude, so longe as there shoulde remaine
any issewe, eyther of the bodie, of the saide
Ladie Fraunces, or of the bodie of the saide
Ladie Elenour lawfullie begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
quite contrarie to the mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ninge of
the saide supposed wyll. Wherefore I do
verelie thincke, that yt woulde hardelie
syncke into any reasonnable mans head
that had anye experience of the greate
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8937:118"/>
wisdome and advised doinges of kinge
Henrye the eyght abowte other matters,
beynge of nothinge like weyght, that he
wolde so slenderlie, so vnadvisedlie, and
so vnlearnedlie dispose the succession of
the crowne (Where vpon the whole
estate of thys Realme dothe depende) in
suche Wyse, that they to whome he ment
to geve the same by hys will, coulde not
enioy yt by the lawe: Where vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye maye
plainlie see, not onlie the greate vnlikely
hodde, that kinge Henrie the eight wolde
make any suche will with suche slender
advice: But also that by the limitation of
the saide will, the succession of the crowne
ys made more vncertaine and dowbtefull,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yt was before the makinge of the saide
Actes of Parliamente, which ys contrarie to
the meaninge and inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te of the saide Actes,
and therefore with owte anie sufficiente
warrante in Lawe. But paradventure some
here will saye, that althowghe theis dangers
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vncerteinties might have ensewed vpon
the limitation of the said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvill, yet for as
muche as they haue not happened, neither
be like to happen, they are therefore
not to be spoken of. Yes verilie yt was
not to be omitted. For althovvghe theys
<pb facs="tcp:8937:119"/>
thinges haue not happened, and there fore
the more tollerable: Yet for as muche as
theye myght haue happened by the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the saide supposed will, contrarie to
the meaninge of the saide actes, the vvill ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not by any meanes be saide, to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge
to the meaninge and intente of
the makers of the saide statutes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in that respecte, the saide will ys insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in lawe. And to aggravate the matter
farthere, ye shall vnderstande of greate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>veniences
and imminent dangers, which
as yet are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kelie to ensevve, yf that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
will shoulde take place. Yt ys not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but that at the time of the makinge
of the saide will, the saide Ladie Frances
had no issewe male, but onlie three dawgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
betwene her, and Henry Duke of Suff.
Aftervvarde in the time of our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
Ladie Quene Marie, the saide Duke
of Suff was attainted, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sufferid according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
After whose deathe the saide Ladie Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to her greare dishonour and abasinge of
her self, toke to her husbande one Adrian
Stockes, who was before her serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, a man
of verie meane estate and vocation, and had
issewe by him. Whiche issewe (yf yt were a
sonne, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d be also yet livinge) by the wordes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8937:119"/>
of the saide supposed will ys to inherite the
crowne of this Realme, before the dawgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
betwene her and the sayde late duke
of Suff. begotten. Which thing was neither
intended nor ment by the makers of
the saide Actes. Who can withe any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or common defense thincke, that
all the states of the Realme assembled
together at the saide Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, did meane
to geve auctoritie to Kinge Henry the eight
by hys lettres patentes or laste Will, to dishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
the Quene of Scottes liniallie disce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
of the bloude Roiall of this Realme, and
to appointe the sonne of Adrian Stokes,
then a meane servinge man of the Duke
of Suff. to be Kinge and governour over
this noble Realme of Englande? The inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
wherof, as also of the like that
might have followed of the pretensed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of Maistre Keyes the late sergeante
Porter, I referre to the grave consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>norable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
of this Realme. Some paradventure
will saie, that kinge Henrie the eight mente
by his will to dispose the crowne vnto the
heires of the bodie of the saide Laide Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by the saide Duke lawfullie begotten:
And not vnto the heires by any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:8937:120"/>
to be begotten. Wiche meaninge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thowghe
yt myght verie hardlie be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vpon the saide supposed will, yet can
not the same be with owte as greate inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces
as the other. For yf the crowne shoul
de nowe remaine vnto the heires of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of the saide Ladie Fraunces, by the saide
Duke begotten: then shoulde yt remaine
vnto two dawghters iointelie, they bothe
beynge termed and certainlie acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted in
lawe but one heire. And by that meanes the
state and governement of thys Realme
shoulde be changed from the auncient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,
vnto the governemente of manie.
For the title of the Ladie Fraunces beynge
bywaye of remainder, wich ys compted in
lawe a ioynt purchase, dothe make all the
issue female inheritable alyke, and can not
goe accordinge to the aunciente lawe of a
discente to the crowne. Wich ys that the
crowne by disce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te muste goe to the eldeste
dawghter onlye, as ys afore saide. For
greate differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces be in lawe, where one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to any title by discente, and where as
a purchasser. And also yf the one of those
issewe female dye, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were her heire in the
title, as a severall tenante in taile. And so
there shoulde followe, that so many dawgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8937:120"/>
so manie generall governours, and so
myght theire issewe beynge heyres females
make the governeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t growe infinit, which
thinge was moste farre from the meaninge
of the makers of the saide parliamente.
What yf the saide Kynge had by hys laste
will disposed thys realme in to two or three
partes, devidinge the governemente therof
to three persons, to rule as severall kynges?
As for exemple, wales vnto one, the Northe
partes vnto an other, the Sowthe partes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the thyrde, and by that meanes had mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie
re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te this realme in to partes. Had this
ben accordinge to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te and meaninge
of the saide actes of parliament? or had yt
bene a good a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t limitation in lawe?
No verelie, I thyncke no man of any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
vnderstandynge will so saye. And no
more can he eyther saye or thyncke of the
remainder limited vnto the heires of the
bodie of the saide Ladie Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, by the saide

rather Olbion, that ys fortunate, happye
