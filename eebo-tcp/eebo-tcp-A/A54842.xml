            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF thou shalt <hi>ask</hi> in curiosity, why I happen to come so <hi>late</hi> to this <hi>Discharge</hi> of my <hi>Engagement,</hi> (to which I stood by my <hi>Promise</hi> so <hi>long obliged</hi>;) Know that my several Praeengagements with severall Books of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> together with several <hi>interventions</hi> both of <hi>sickness,</hi> and <hi>journies,</hi> and other Impediments una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, do conspire to give thee the <hi>Reason</hi> of it. For <hi>these</hi> did keep me from the <hi>thought</hi> of what I have brought to a <hi>conclusion,</hi> till somewhat <hi>after</hi> the beginning of this <hi>last Winter.</hi> Besides that at the <hi>end</hi> of my <hi>Autocatacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> (which I conceive more useful then all my Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies besides, and upon which I bestowed the greatest labour, that it might put a full <hi>end</hi> to the <hi>whole Dispute</hi>) I made a promise to my Readers of what I had purpos'd within my self, that if I return'd to any Dispute in any kind whatsoever, as it would fall out <hi>Cross</hi> to my <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>

so I resolved to do it onely at times of <hi>Leisure.</hi> That whilst my <hi>howers</hi> could be <hi>spent</hi> in my chief employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I might not <hi>lose</hi> too many of them in my <hi>least ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> Defences.

            <p>How impartial I have been in the maintaining of the Truth, I shall evince in the following papers by my Reply to <hi>Mr. BARLOW,</hi> the Reverend <hi>Provost</hi> of <hi>Queens Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> my very learned and loving Friend. To certain Reasonings of <hi>his</hi> in his <hi>second Metaphysical Exercitation,</hi> (which I am carefull to tell my Readers he printed <hi>twenty years ago,</hi> that by refuting those Errours which he asserted in his <hi>youth,</hi> when a <hi>stranger</hi> to me, I may not prejudice that <hi>Friendship</hi> which I desire may be <hi>preserv'd</hi> and improv'd betwixt us, nor take from the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> which is due to his <hi>Riper years,</hi>) I have replyed so much the rather for these three Reasons. First because Master <hi>Hickman</hi> is very guiltily beholding to <hi>Mr. Barlow's Book,</hi> for the considerablest part of his <hi>own collection.</hi> He having stoln from that treasure whatsoever hath the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>strong,</hi> or <hi>handsome</hi>; (I mean as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>positivity of sin.</hi>) Next that the Adversaries may grant, That if their <hi>Cause</hi> hath miscarried under the management and Defence of such a Person as Master <hi>BARLOW,</hi> it sure hath wanted nothing but <hi>Truth,</hi> and not <hi>ability</hi> to support it. Last of all Mr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> (so great was his <hi>Candor,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi>) was pleased to give me his <hi>Free Assent,</hi> that I should persecute <hi>Errour</hi> where e're I found it. To differ in judgement, <hi>Incolumi licuit semper amicitiâ</hi>; and therefore he is farr from falling out with <hi>himself,</hi> (much less with <hi>me,</hi>) if he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much <hi>differs</hi> at this Time of his <hi>maturity</hi> (like <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchtho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now (Good Reader) I am resolv'd, rather to part abruptly from thee, than to detain thee any longer

with such <hi>Praeliminary Discourses.</hi> I hope it will appear by the following Catalogue of Authors, (at least by as many as will be granted to be the <hi>best</hi>) both that I am far from being <hi>singular</hi> in what I <hi>own</hi> as the greatest <hi>truth,</hi> And that in case thou hast insensibly <hi>taken up</hi> a vulgar Errour, thou needs not think it a discredit to <hi>lay it down.</hi>

               <p>THe thing in Question from the beginning was Sin properly so called. How Mr. <hi>Hick.</hi> was frighted from it, in spite of <hi>S. Paul</hi> and Dr. <hi>Reynolds.</hi> Sin a Concrete: and so confessed by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> a little after he had deny'd it. The positive Act proved to be the sin of cursing God: Mr. <hi>H.</hi> (though challenged) not attempting to disprove it. No imaginable difference betwixt the positive Act of lying with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> and the Adultery which was the sin; Sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> to include a positive Act. The same is confessed by Mr. <hi>Whitfield</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> and (in lucid intervals) by Mr. H. himself: who writes against his own knowledge: and as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his own interest. 1. By the grosness of his own Falshood and Tergiversation. 2. by inferring that Vertue hath no positive Being. 3. by arming the Atheist against himself, in proving that God hath no positive Entity. 4. by putting it out of his power to deny he is a Brute, till he renounce his Transition <hi>à Thesi ad Hypothesin.</hi> The stone at which Mr. <hi>Hick.</hi> hath not stumbled only, but fallen, past all recovery. The true state of Sin (specified) as it differs from either part of Sin, and from Sinfulness it self. Mr. <hi>Hick.</hi> gets nothing though we should grant him his Reduplication, but rather looseth all he gapes at. Nay proves himself a <hi>Carneadist</hi> or <hi>Libertine.</hi> That Sin is <hi>positive</hi> and <hi>concrete</hi> may be concluded from <hi>Bonaventure.</hi>

               <p>MR. <hi>Hick's</hi> chief strength from Mr. <hi>Barlow's</hi> youngest writings. Why first encountred. An accompt of Dr. <hi>Fields</hi> Reasons for the positive Entity of sin. The first Reason: the second Reason. The first Reason was never answer'd. The second answer'd by Mr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> in his younger years. The Answer shew'd to be invalid in 5 Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. 1. by its granting what it pretendeth to deny. 2. by imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a contradiction. 3. by being offensive to pious mindes. 4. by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending against the Rules of sense. 5. by the twofold unfitness of the <hi>Simile</hi> alledg'd. <hi>Gulielmus de Rubione</hi> vindicated by way of Reply to Mr. <hi>Barlows</hi> Answer. Mr. H's answer proved vitious in 3 respects. 1. by such a gross Fallacy, as by which he is proved no man, but either a <hi>beast</hi> or somewhat <hi>worse.</hi> 2. by such a <hi>shifting</hi> from the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> as proves him convinced of maintaining a gross error. 3. by <hi>Blasphemy</hi> expressed, and <hi>Contradiction</hi> implyed. A third Reason ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from <hi>H. Grotius</hi> amounting to the same with <hi>Iacobus Almain.</hi> Mr. <hi>Barlows</hi> Answer; proved faulty in 7 respects. The words of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preolus</hi> make for me. Mr. <hi>Barlows</hi> plea out of <hi>Hurtadus</hi> proved faulty in 6 Respects. The Act of Hating God now, and of sin hereafter, unduly taken to be the same Act. A Denyal of <hi>Positivity</hi> betrayes its Owners to deny a <hi>Reality</hi> in Sin. A fourth Reason out of <hi>Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes de Rada.</hi> Mr. <hi>Barlows</hi> answer proved invalid in 4 Respects. A 5 Reason out of <hi>Aquinas.</hi> A Reply to the Answer of Mr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> proving it faulty in 3 Respects.

            <p n="4">§. 4. To this Answer I <hi>reply</hi> in the behalf of D. <hi>Field.</hi> first,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The answer shewd to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid in five respects.</hi>
               </note> That it <hi>granteth</hi> the very thing which it pretendeth to <hi>deny,</hi> and which alone was the thing that D. <hi>Field</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, to wit, <hi>that no Rectitude can be due to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God,</hi> which is no longer the <hi>hatred of God,</hi>

               </note> than the <hi>hatred</hi> is limited to <hi>such an object,</hi> to wit <hi>God.</hi> So what is urged by D. <hi>Field</hi> is exactly yielded by M. <hi>Barlow,</hi> and I appeal unto himself, whether it is not as I have said. For the Doctors words are, [what <hi>Rectitude</hi> is due to the <hi>specifical act of hating God</hi>?] now it cannot be the <hi>specifical act of hating God, unless the act be limited to that very object</hi>: and when it is, 'tis fully granted, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Rectitude or goodness is due unto it.</p>
            <p>Secondly I reply, That when he saith,<note place="margin">II. <hi>By implying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> 
               <hi>the hatred of God being taken by it self, may be good,</hi> he flatly <hi>contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> what he had said a little before, to wit, that <hi>the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God remaining, it cannot be possibly made good by any circumstance whatsoever.</hi> And the subject of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute being the <hi>hatred of God,</hi> it must needs <hi>remain</hi> till it is <hi>taken away</hi>; And being <hi>taken away,</hi> there is nothing of it to be disputed, no kind of <hi>thing,</hi> either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is an <hi>uncouth</hi> sentence (to say no worse) which affirms any <hi>goodness in hating God,</hi>

And to say that that can be good in <hi>any notion,</hi> which is confessedly good in <hi>none,</hi> is to add <hi>impiety</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. For the <hi>hatred</hi> of <hi>nothing,</hi> excepting <hi>sin,</hi> can be morally <hi>good.</hi> And therefore to say, that the <hi>hating God</hi> (in any sense) can be <hi>good,</hi> is to imply that the <hi>hating God</hi> is (in some kind of sense) the <hi>hating of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. It is far from good sense,<note place="margin">IV. <hi>By offending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rules of sense.</hi>
               </note> to say <hi>the hatred of God being taken by it self,</hi> that I would gladly think it an errour of the Press, if I did not find it so often used.

However I am confident his meaning was, That <hi>Hatred being taken by it self</hi> (without relation to <hi>God) may be good.</hi> For the <hi>hatred of God</hi> cannot possibly be taken <hi>by it self,</hi> so as <hi>hatred</hi> may stand without <hi>relating</hi> to the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to which 'tis <hi>joyn'd</hi>; for then the <hi>hatred of God,</hi> were <hi>not</hi> the <hi>hatred of God,</hi> which would be an express <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> And his <hi>meaning</hi> being granted to be so <hi>different</hi> from his <hi>words,</hi> as <hi>hatred</hi> taken without God for its object, must needs be from the expression of <hi>hating God,</hi> I then profess it to be <hi>true,</hi> but not at all to the <hi>purpose.</hi> For tis affirmed by D. <hi>Field,</hi> that <hi>no rectitude can be due to the hatred of God:</hi> not that it cannot be due to <hi>hatred,</hi> eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But I reply to this Answer, That the <hi>hatred of God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>act</hi> determin'd upon an <hi>object,</hi> can have <hi>no other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> then what it hath, (for if it be the <hi>hatred</hi> of any <hi>thing else,</hi> then is it no longer the <hi>hatred of God</hi>) much less can it be terminated on the <hi>hatred</hi> of <hi>sin</hi>; the <hi>hating God</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implying the <hi>love of sin</hi>: if by the <hi>hatred of God</hi> he means nothing but <hi>hatred,</hi> (in which case the word <hi>

                  </gap>od</hi> must be <hi>blotted out</hi>) then tis quite beside the purpose, as hath been shewd; for tis not <hi>hatred per se,</hi> much less <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of sin,</hi> which was said to be so <hi>evil that no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance advenient can make it good</hi>; but rather the contrary, the <hi>hatred of sin</hi> is so <hi>good,</hi> as that it cannot be made <hi>evil.</hi> And therefore the <hi>hatred of God</hi> being the term in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument proposed,</hi> should also have been the term in the <hi>Answer pretended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas it is added to his answer, that the <hi>hatred of God</hi> is not taken <hi>aggregately,</hi> or by way of <hi>connotation,</hi> when tis said <hi>it may be good</hi> by <hi>the position of the due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> (p. 73.) I also add to my reply, that though <hi>hatred</hi> can (<hi>per se</hi>) yet <hi>hatred of God</hi> cannot be possibly so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; for it implies a <hi>contradiction.</hi> Hatred there being the <hi>Act,</hi> and God the <hi>object,</hi> and both together the <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate:</hi> which <hi>whilst</hi> it <hi>is,</hi> it cannot be but what it is.

            <p>Secondly, He so shamefully flyes from the thing in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, to that which he knew neither <hi>was,</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> be, as to discover the mean opinion which he really hath of his own <hi>Tenet,</hi> and to prove his Book written, against nothing so much as his own <hi>conscience.</hi> 1. He knew it was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52441:32"/>
not the Question, whether <hi>hatred,</hi> without relation to <hi>God</hi> as its <hi>object,</hi> is a <hi>sin,</hi> or whether any thing, without <hi>hatred,</hi> is the <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>hating God.</hi> But he knew (by what I had said in my <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) that the thing in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, was the <hi>hating</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>sensu composito.</hi> For I had said in the plainest terms, That to <hi>hate God</hi> is a <hi>sin,</hi> or a <hi>sinful act,</hi> (two expressions for one thing.) That the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> consisteth neither in <hi>God</hi> without <hi>hating,</hi> (for he is <hi>purity</hi> it self) nor in <hi>hating</hi> without <hi>God,</hi> (for <hi>hatred</hi> in it self is a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> and apt to be <hi>good</hi> as well as <hi>evil,</hi> God himself hating <hi>sin</hi> with a perfect <hi>hatred</hi>) but in the <hi>union</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of that <hi>act</hi> to that <hi>object.</hi> As the nature of <hi>man</hi> consists not in a <hi>body</hi> onely, nor onely in a <hi>soul,</hi> but in the <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> with the <hi>other.</hi> (p. 13.) 2. He knew it could not be a Question, whether <hi>hatred</hi> is a <hi>sin</hi> when taken <hi>per se,</hi> without <hi>an object</hi>; or whether the <hi>pravity</hi> of <hi>hating God</hi> can be any thing at all, without the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>hating God</hi>; or whether there can be possibly <hi>any</hi> act when there is <hi>none.</hi> And yet his answer is as imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as if one of these had been the Question.</p>

               </hi> are in a state of <hi>Impeccability.</hi> 5. It would follow from hence, that the

               <hi>goodness</hi> of a <hi>vertuous act</hi> doth not consist in the <hi>substance</hi> of it, because it would then become impossible, that the substance of the <hi>act</hi> should continue without the goodness. Whereas it is said in this Evasion, that the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>hating God</hi> may remain in <hi>substance,</hi> without the presence of its <hi>obliquity.</hi> But (6.) to answer yet more expresly to his reason taken from <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>free</hi>; I say the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of the <hi>act</hi> is <hi>one</hi> thing, and the sinfulness of the <hi>agent</hi> is quite another. The <hi>obliquity alone,</hi> or the sole contrariety of the act to the <hi>Law</hi> (in conjunction with the <hi>act</hi> from which it cannot be disjoyned) is enough to constitute the sinfulness of the <hi>act.</hi> But the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>will</hi> and <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> are required onely to the sinfulness of the <hi>agent.</hi> Which yet again is no otherwise, then in respect unto God <hi>imputing</hi> or <hi>punishing,</hi> according to the <hi>Equity,</hi> [or <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>act</hi> is not <hi>morally evil,</hi> without relation to the Law which doth <hi>forbid</hi> it; so an act hath nothing of <hi>moral goodness,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Relation to the <hi>law</hi> which doth <hi>command</hi> it, or to the Councel which doth commend it.

            <p>Again 2. the <hi>first sin of Angels he supposeth to have been a proud desire to be equall unto God.</hi> (p. 103.)

            <p n="3">3. He doth not onely acknowledge, that the <hi>act</hi> or <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> of any sin hath a <hi>positive being,</hi> but further adds (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all example) That the <hi>privation it self</hi> is an <hi>evil Quality,</hi> (p. 56.) even that <hi>privation,</hi> which is called by some the <hi>formall part of sin</hi>; and is said by himself to <hi>denominate</hi> the <hi>act,</hi> or the <hi>habit, evil.</hi> Nor will a <hi>quasi</hi> superadded serve to do him a good turn.

Again he seems here to speak of an <hi>external denomination,</hi> as if he were not aware of what he was afterwards to say concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>action of hating God,</hi> That it is <hi>intrinsecally</hi> and <hi>essentially evil, not meerly through the want of some Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> (p. 94.)</p>
            <p>Again he saith, 4. That in <hi>hating God, the terminating of that act to that object is the sinfulness of the action.</hi> (p. 95.) Now we know it is an <hi>action,</hi> for the will to <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> or fix an act upon an object, and so (according to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52441:44"/>
Mr. <hi>Hickman) sinfulness it self hath a positive being,</hi> even whilest he saith it is but <hi>privative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. He goes but one line farther, when he saith in plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest terms, that <hi>moral goodness and evil are rather modi entium than entia.</hi> (p. 95.) whereby he yields me as much <hi>advantage</hi> as I can wish to my <hi>whole cause.</hi> For when <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>moral evil,</hi> is allow'd <hi>as much entity,</hi> as <hi>moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and moral <hi>goodness</hi> as <hi>little entity</hi> as <hi>sin</hi>; It must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be his Tenet, that <hi>sin</hi> hath also a <hi>positive being,</hi> or that <hi>goodness</hi> hath <hi>none</hi> at all. If the <hi>first,</hi> he at once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray's his whole cause: and withall makes God to be the <hi>Author of sin,</hi> (for he saith, He is the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive beings.</hi>) if the <hi>second,</hi> he must needs <hi>deny God</hi> to be the <hi>author</hi> of <hi>goodness,</hi> or lose the benefit of the <hi>shift,</hi> by which he would seem <hi>not</hi> to make him the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Again, If the <hi>evil works</hi> themselves be <hi>positive,</hi> (which he confesseth p. 96.) there needs no more to be added by him. For that there is also some <hi>privation,</hi> none is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to deny, whilst what is <hi>positive</hi> in <hi>sin</hi> is so fully <hi>yielded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. He grants as much as a man can wish, p. 102. viz. That <hi>man is the efficient cause of the evil of the Action.</hi> And the youngsters Argument against it, holds as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>good,</hi> as <hi>evil actions.</hi> See his Confession, p. 103.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the <hi>deficient</hi> cause is reducible to the <hi>efficient,</hi> the cause of the <hi>action per se,</hi> of the <hi>vitiosity per concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantiam, he confesseth</hi> p. 103.</p>
            <p n="9">9.

            <p>Nay 10. he confesseth that a <hi>sin</hi> is an <hi>action,</hi> if he is not unpardonably impertinent, p. 102. for an account of which, see forward chap. 8. §. 24.</p>

For Obliquity or whatsoever other Relation, can have no cause at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that which is the Cause of the Habit, of the Act, or Quality whence it necessarily results. And in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that conformity or similitude which the first man did bear to his Almighty Creator, did necessarily result from his substance or manhood, as it was the work of God undefaced. Nor can we search after any other true Cause of the First mans conformity to God, or his integrity, besides him who was the cause of his manhood, or of his existence with such qualifications as by his creation he was endowed with. In like manner whosoever was the cause whether of his coveting or eating of the Tree in the middle of the Garden, was the true cause of that obliquity or crooked deviation from Gods Law, or of that deformity or dissimilitude unto God himself which did necessarily result from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

               <note place="margin">p. 178.</note> for the avoiding of those consequences, by which their <hi>Doctrines</hi> are rendred odious; at last proceeds to make it appear, [<note place="margin">p. 182.183.</note> That this is no way applicable to the freeing of God "from being the <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>sin,</hi> of which he is said (by those men) <hi>to predetermine the act.</hi>
               <q>For 1. Though a <hi>free power</hi> of <hi>acting good or evil,</hi> be perfectly distinct and <hi>separable</hi> from <hi>doing evil,</hi> and therefore God, that is the Author of <hi>one,</hi> cannot thence be inferred to be the <hi>author</hi> of the other, yet the <hi>act of sin</hi> is not separable from the obliquity of that <hi>act,</hi> the act of blasphemy from the obliquity or irregularity of blasphemie, the least evil thought or word against an infinite good

God being as <hi>crooked</hi> as the rule is <hi>straight,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he that predetermines the <hi>act,</hi> must needs pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>determine the <hi>obliquity.</hi>

            <p>To conclude this Chapter. It is a thing so undeniable, that the Author of the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>hating God,</hi> must needs be the <hi>Author</hi> of the obliquity, that as the men of the Church of England affirm man to be the Author and the <hi>sole</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>both,</hi> and God of neither, so the rigid <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (as well as <hi>Papists</hi>) affirm God to be the Author, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>act,</hi> but of the <hi>obliquity</hi> of the Act.

I think as well of the <hi>Vniversity</hi> as when she <hi>burnt</hi> the <hi>Book,</hi> and condemned the Doctrine of the great <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist Paraeus,</hi> who sowed those <hi>Presbyterian seeds</hi> of the late prosperous Rebellion, of which such fellows as our <hi>Compiler</hi> enjoy the harvest.

               <hi>that the death or Passion of Christ as the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal cause of mans salvation, doth so far appease and reconcile God the Father to Mankinde, by the very fact of his Oblation, that he is truely now said to be ready to receive every man into Favour, as soon as he will believe in Christ, notwithstanding the aforesaid death of Christ restoreth no man (no man at least who is come to ripenesse) into a state of actual favour,

Reconciliation, or salvation, untill he actually believes.</hi>] No man (saith the Bishop) no not any of the <hi>elect,</hi> before he is <hi>qualified by faith</hi>; meaning that faith which <hi>worketh by love,</hi> an Universal obedience to the commandments of Christ.

But yet for as much as no such act can de facto (in regard of actual existence extra intellectum) be really abstracted from those things, without which (though extrinsecal to its essence) it cannot exist, and by the occasion whereof it first becometh morally good or evil, (for no act is morally evil in its own abstracted es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, nor otherwise a sin, then as is vitiated by the co-existence of some undue object, end, or circumstance:) it must necessarily follow, that the <hi>totum compositum,</hi> the <hi>vitiated act</hi> and that is the <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52441:116"/>
to have been, for want of a right understanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the dissenting parties.

            <p>Now since I have proved undeniably, that the question was from the beginning (betwixt my adversaries and me) whether any kinde of sins (plainly meaning whole sins, not the formal <hi>part</hi> of sin, which cannot possibly be the sin of which it is but the formal part) have a <hi>positive being</hi>; And since it is said by Dr. <hi>SANDERSON,</hi> that the <hi>positive acts above</hi> mentioned, [<hi>murdering and ravishing</hi> of men, women,] are (so in the <hi>concrete) horrid sins</hi>; nay in the plainest tearmes to be imagined, that a sin of <hi>commission</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of two things, an <hi>act</hi> and <hi>an obliquity</hi>; and since it is said by Mr <hi>Hickman,</hi> that it belongs <hi>to the universality of the first cause to produce</hi> (not onely every positive, but <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very real being,</hi> and (not onely so, but also) <hi>the positive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications of beings,</hi> (p. 95.

His <hi>own conceit</hi> was more likely to be <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> then mine, when he <hi>reproached</hi> me with a distemper, from the very <hi>suspicion</hi> of which I was ever free; and with which if my <hi>Body</hi> had ever been affected in any measure, (as I blesse God for it, it <hi>never was,</hi>) Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> should not have been so <hi>barbarous,</hi> as to have sported his Readers with my disease, which had been <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>helpless</hi> too, had it ever invaded my <hi>Hypochondres,</hi> as much as <hi>Fame</hi> hath affirmed it to have had dominion over his own.

And that for any person or persons to set up, maintain, or avow, in any their said Realms respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, under any pretence whatsoever, any Independent co-active power, either Papal, or popular, (whether directly, or indirectly) is to undermine their great Royal office, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly to overthrow that most sacred ordinance, which God himself hath established; and so is treasonable against God, as well as against the King.</hi>
(This I earnestly recommend to Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> his consideration, and that which follows in the <hi>Canon,</hi> viz.) <q>
                  <hi>That for subjects to bear Arms against</hi> their <hi>Kings, offensive,</hi> or <hi>defensive,</hi> upon any pretence whatsoever, is at the least to resist the powers, which are ordained of God: And though they do not <hi>invade</hi>

And that one of our <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> is, that we be visited by none <hi>but the King,</hi> or those that are <hi>sent by Him,</hi> as we are verily perswaded, so have we never heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f any other title, or pretension of any (which is thought even by our enemies to have any shew of Ground in our Charters, or Customes against our Plea) save onely that of the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the <hi>Metropolitan</hi>; to which our Answer is so clear, and punctuall, (<hi>viz.</hi> that in the vacancy of the Arch-bishops Sea, all power that can be thought to belong to him, must needs be acknowledged to devolve to the <hi>King</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his power, and so the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> having been long dead, this power of Visiting us (if any such belong to the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi>) must now needs be onely in the King) that we profess never to have heard of any word of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that hath been offered to this enforcement of our Plea, but are rather told that the Commission for this <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation</hi> coming under the name of our <hi>Soveraign Lord Charles, &amp;c.</hi> is a <hi>Commission</hi> issued out by the King; which as it seems to us an acknowledgement of the truth of all our pretensions; so is it the imposing upon us the belief of that which we know to be otherwise, having certain knowledge that the <hi>King</hi> never consented to the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing of this <hi>Commission,</hi> and so having no excuse of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, in case we should yield submission to that Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (as proceeding from him) which is acknowledged by all to involve us in <hi>Perjury,</hi> if it come not from him. To this we may add one obligation more, that as 'tis one of the <hi>Vniversities Priviledges</hi> to be exempt (without al

controversie as long as the <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> Sea is vacant) from all power but that of the <hi>King,</hi> so 'tis one of the <hi>Kings Priviledges</hi> and <hi>preeminencies</hi> to have this full, and (at this time) sole power over us. And then that branch of the Oath of Supremacy that obligeth all Subjects in these express words, [<hi>to assist, and defend to our power all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and Preeminencies, and Authorities granted, and belonging to the Kings Majesty, or annexed to the Imperiall Crown of this Kingdome</hi>] doth certainly bind us to defend this, as far as it is in our power to do it.</p>
            <p>For the obligations of <hi>Colledge Statutes</hi> which name us particular Visitors, and exclude all others from that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, I shall shorten your trouble, and yet not fail in giving you, and all men a perfect satisfaction, by setting down a few plain words out of some of them.

That it is not lawfull for the <hi>Bishop</hi> himself to depute any of those

                  </gap>rnours</hi> of particular <hi>Colledges</hi>) are made utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of that employment. I shall not need to mention any more, it being clear that these men are not <hi>deputed</hi> by that <hi>Bishop,</hi> and as clear, that if they were <hi>deputed</hi> by him, they are not <hi>qualified</hi> according to the Statutes, but expresly <hi>excluded</hi> by them. Now what is thus ordained by those statutes, every member admitted into those <hi>Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> is by Oath obliged to <hi>observe,</hi> and not onely invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in perjury if he do not, but where other penalties are not named (as in this matter there are not) is liable to the <hi>pain of perjury,</hi> that is, deprivation of all benefits of his Colledge; which is now become the punishment of none but those who will <hi>observe</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Besides these Oathes which particularly and directly look to the grand ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter of the <hi>Visitation,</hi> There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other branches of our <hi>Oathes Academicall,</hi> and <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate,</hi> which are most nearly concerned in the present trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions. The <hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>University,</hi> to the observing of which our <hi>oaths</hi> distinctly bind us, prescribe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Election</hi> of <hi>Proctours,</hi> (of calling and meeting in <hi>Convocations, &amp;c.</hi>) And therefore whensoever <hi>Proctours</hi> have been removed by the KING, the <hi>Vniversity Statutes</hi> have taken place in appointing the Successours; and those (as the <hi>Vice-chancellour</hi> also) are obliged to take <hi>Oaths,</hi> for the discharge of their places according to <hi>statute.</hi> But all is now done directly cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ary to all this. And therefore herein no sworn member of the <hi>Vniversity</hi> can think fit, without professing despight to Conscience or reputation, to joyn with them. And so in particular <hi>Colledges,</hi> the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52441:131"/>
Statutes are punctuall, that after the departure or a motion of any <hi>Governour,</hi> the <hi>Fellows</hi> must proceed within such a time to the election of a new, and he and none but he shall be reputed <hi>Warden, President, &amp;c.</hi> who shall be chosen by a major part of the Electours. And then he that is chosen must take severall <hi>Oaths</hi> particularly to govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Statute,</hi> before any of the <hi>muniments</hi> of the <hi>Colledge</hi> may be delivered up to him, or before he enter upon the Government, to act any thing in it. And this is established by severall positive statutes, to the observing of which, all members of Colledges are precisely sworn. And it is evident and acknowledged that no man can be made <hi>Dean or Prebendary</hi> of <hi>Christs Church</hi> (nor ever was since the foundation of the <hi>Church</hi>) but by the KINGS <hi>personal</hi> consent, and nomination under the <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> and <hi>Broad Seal,</hi> by which he is installed; And to him that is thus possest of that <hi>Deanary,</hi> every Student of that <hi>Church</hi> is by plain words of the <hi>Oath</hi> of his admission, bound to <hi>perform due obedience &amp;c.</hi> All which being now most clearly violated by not onely Sequestring, but removing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and putting in new <hi>Governours</hi> by <hi>force,</hi> without <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> or taking of <hi>Oaths</hi> to the <hi>Colledges,</hi> it follows that no sworn member of any <hi>Colledge</hi> can acknowledge any such <hi>Governours</hi> without wilfull un-execusable <hi>Perjury.</hi> The onely thing that hath yet been offer'd to us to answer the Force, and urgence of all this Plea (and at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of which, all mention of our <hi>Oaths</hi> must vanish pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently) is the pretended <hi>Soveraign power of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> to make and abolish <hi>Laws</hi> and Obligations; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving interposed here, is consequently said to quit us of all these engagements, which formerly lay upon us. But this is so far from removing our <hi>scruples,</hi> that it is it self a <hi>scruple</hi> much more hard to us to digest, then the former. For by our having taken the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> we have acknowledged that to be onely in the KING; and by our education in this Kingdome, have been brought up in a firm belief (grounded on the known <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customes</hi>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:52441:132"/>
thereof) that the power of enacting, and repealing of Laws belongs not to the <hi>two Houses exclusively,</hi> but to the KING' <hi>with the consent of the two Houses</hi>; and we do now profess, never to have heard any thing to the contrary, before these times: nor since these times, sufficient to alter our judgements in this particular. And therefore whatsoever question be made of this truth by other men, yet we, whose hearts assure us, that we make no question of it (and consequently acknowledge, that we do not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our selves to be freed from any one branch of any of these <hi>Oaths</hi>) cannot imagine what colour it is possible for the Tempter to put upon this required submission, by which to perswade us, that it might be reconcileable with a good Conscience now, or with any degree of excuse to God or men, or of quiet and tranquillity within our own breasts at the hour of death, in case we should, on such terms as these, <hi>submit</hi> to this <hi>Visitation.</hi> And as I think I might safely appeal to any Divine in the world as to a <hi>Confessour,</hi> or <hi>Casuist</hi> for the stating of this <hi>Question, Whether it were lawfull for us to submit, supposing our many Oathes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly bound us to the contrary, and that we are verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that those Oathes are in full force upon us, and as confident that the two Houses could not dispence with them, nor take off the obligingness of them</hi>; So would I likewise appeal to any man living that ever pretended to assert ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> or <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

by your assistance it may yet be resumed into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Whether it will be for the honour of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> or of the <hi>Protestant Profession,</hi> that our bare <hi>demurring</hi> or refusing to submit our selves to the grossest and most unquestion'd <hi>perjuries,</hi> should be voted by your <hi>Committee</hi> to be <hi>an high contempt of Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and such punishments assign'd thereto, which if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted impartially, must necessarily leave no one Scholar of what quality soever in this University (which is of age to have taken Oathes of admission to the <hi>University,</hi> or to any particular <hi>Colledge</hi>) which shall not appear to all men avowedly and confestly <hi>per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
