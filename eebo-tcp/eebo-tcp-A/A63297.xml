         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

At the Place of Execution at KENNINGTON Common

            <p>ON <hi>Thurſday June</hi> the <hi>25th. 1685. William Diſney,</hi> Eſquire;
being Indited of High Treaſon, for Printing and Publiſhing
a moſt Vile and Trayterous Paper againſt His moſt Sacred
MAJESTY and Government: Intituled <hi>The Declaration of</hi> James
<hi>Duke</hi> of Monmouth, <hi>and the Noble-Men, Gentlemen, and others now in
Arms,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Meſſenger <hi>depoſed,</hi> That having a Warrant for the Apprehending
of <hi>William Diſney,</hi> Eſquire; he took ſome Files of Muſqueteers, and
Two or Three Gentlemen to his Aſſiſtance; when approaching to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51681:2"/>
Houſe of one <hi>Tyrrel</hi> a Gardiner in the Pariſh of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> on
<hi>Monday June 15th.</hi> 1685. between Twelve and One of the Clock in
the Morning, he broke into the Appartment of <hi>Diſney</hi>'s, where entering
his Chamber, he found the Priſoner in his ſhirt, who craved his Breeches,
but the Meſſenger replyed no, ſaying, if he had a Night-gown he
might put it on: Immediately after, viewing his Breeches, there
was found a Dagger in his pocket, alſo ſome other things, likewiſe a
brace of Piſtols, and a great Hanger in the nature of a Scymeter.</p>
            <p>His Maid <hi>Mary Allett</hi> was ſuppoſed to be in Bed with him, by
reaſon her Cloaths were upon his Bed: His Daughter about Eleven
years of Age, or thereabouts, was in another part of the Room a
Bed alone: The Meſſenger farther depoſed, that getting into the
Printing-Houſe, he there found the Forms (as Printers call them) of
the Trayterous Declaration in the Printing-Room, there being by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
about 750 of them Printed on one ſide, and about Five of
the ſaid Trayterous Declarations perfect. Upon the Meſſengers
queſtioning how they came there? he pretended Ignorance.</p>
            <p>The Evidence appearing very plain, and he having nothing to ſay
for himſelf, was found guilty of High Treaſon, Sentenced to be
Drawn, Hanged, and Quartered; which was accordingly done, at
<hi>Kennington Common,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>29th.</hi> of
<hi>June,</hi> 1685. and his Quarters ſet upon the City Gates.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEtween Nine and Ten of the Clock in the Morning, I was ſent
for by the High Sheriff of <hi>Surrey,</hi> to officiate as Ordinary at
the Execution of the Priſoner at the <hi>Marſhalſea;</hi> before he was
brought out, a neighbouring Miniſter and I (upon the Sheriffs motion)
went into the Room where he was; when the Reverend Parſon (having
ſeen him the Night before) askt him whether he had conſidered of
thoſe things which he had formerly offered him, and did very pathiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
preſs him that he would give Glory to God by a full and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Confeſſion of his Crime, intimating to him the fatal conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that might have followed if he had perfected that evil work: How
many Mens Lives might have been loſt in the quarrel: whoſe blood
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51681:2"/>
he was ſo far guilty of, as he contributed to the increaſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
by his Printing the Trayterous paper (or words to the ſame
effect.) To which the Priſoner anſwered (with ſome ſigns of diſcontent)
to this purpoſe: That he hoped, (he ſpeaking to the Miniſter) did not
come to preſs him to burden himſelf now: That he had nothing to
ſay that might bring any perſon into trouble, and his time was ſhort,
ſo he deſired not to be troubled about any ſuch matters; ſo that few
words paſſed e're we parted; finding him reſolved not to make any
diſcovery, I only told him I did intend to meet him at the place of
Execution, and he thanked me.</p>
               <p>When he came to the Gallows and was in the Cart, I came to him
and asked him, how he deſired to improve thoſe few moments of his
Life that were yet to come? He anſwered in Prayer: I asked, will you
pray for your ſelf, or ſhall I pray for you? He anſwered, I will pray,
and deſire you to pray for me. Whilſt the Executioner was prepairing
the Rope, I ſhewed him the <hi>Bible,</hi> ſaying Sir, what comfortable
Sentence do you remember out of this word of God for your preſent
uſe? He anſwered, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners,</hi> of
whom I am chief: And then he proceeded in general terms to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
himſelf a great Sinner againſt God; but affirmed that he
had made his peace with God, that he had confeſſed his Sins with
humility and fervency, and had begged Gods pardon; and did not
doubt but God had for the merits of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> pardoned
all his Sins, and he was now under very comfortable hopes that he
ſhould ſoon be happy, not upon the account of his own merits,
but the merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I told him this was very good, if
his hopes were well grounded: He replied, his hopes were grounded
on the Scriptures, which aſſured him that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed to ſave Sinners.
Whereupon I recounted to him ſome other Gracious promiſes of God
to true Penitents, as that of <hi>Ezechiel, If the Wicked man turneth away
from his wickedneſs, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave
his Soul alive,</hi> &amp;c. After which he made his Addreſs to God in
Prayer, That he would forgive him all his Sins, and ſanctify this his
affliction to him; and prayed to God to bleſs the King, that he may
be merciful and kind to his Subjects, as well as juſt to his Enemies.
He farther obſerved how Gracious God was to him in giving him this
admonition (as he called it) for God might have taken him off by ſome
ſudden death, or deprived him of his Senſes, and then (he ſaid) it muſt
have been worſe with me, but now God hath given me time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
my ſelf: So that though the dolour and the ſhame of this death
having ſo many Spectators (upon whom he looked) may ſomwhat
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51681:3"/>
diſcompoſe me, yet I have peace and comfort within. Afterwards he
deſired me to pray with him, which I did briefly according to his
mind and preſent example: And cloſing with the Lords Prayer, he
anſwered every Petition deliberately, and calmly. He declared that he
lived in and did now dy in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
were he repeated again in theſe words, <hi>The Proteſtant Church of
England.</hi> After Prayer, I asked him whether we ſhould Sing ſome part
of a <hi>Pſalm?</hi> he anſwered, no: Then I asked him whether he had any
thing more to do or ſay? he anſwered, I have nothing more but to
return you thanks for your care of me. And I pray God bleſs you and
hear your Prayers for me, and mine for you, and our Saviour
<hi>Chriſt</hi> for us both: And ſo I left him going to his long home.</p>
