            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received your Letter dated the Twenty ſixth of <hi>October;</hi> in that you deſire me, That Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Priſoners now at <hi>Durham</hi> or elſwhere, able and fit for Foot Service, be ſelected, and marched thence to <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Liverpool,</hi> to be ſhipped for the South and Weſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that I ſhould take ſpecial care not to ſend any Highlanders.</p>
            <p>I am neceſſitated upon the receipt of this, to give you a full accompt concerning the Priſoners: After the Battel at <hi>Dunbar</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> my Lord General writ to me, That there was about Nine thouſand Priſoners, and that of them he had ſet at liberty all thoſe that were wounded, and, as he thought, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled for future Service, and their Number was, as Mr. <hi>Downing</hi> writ, Five thouſand one hundred; the reſt the General ſent towards <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> conducted to <hi>Berwick</hi> by Major <hi>Hobſon,</hi> and from <hi>Berwick</hi> to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> by ſome Foot out of that Gariſon, and the Troop of Horſe; when they came to <hi>Morpeth,</hi> the Priſoners being put into a large walled Garden, they eat up raw Cabages, Leaves and Roots, ſo many, as the very ſeed and the labor, at Four pence a day, was valued by ſufficient men at Nine pounds; which Cabage, as I conceive, they having faſted, as they themſelves ſaid, near eight days, poyſoned their Bodies; for as they were coming from thence to

               <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> ſome dyed by the way-ſide, and when they came to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> I put them into the greateſt Church in the Town, and the next morning when I ſent them to <hi>Durham,</hi> about Sevenſcore were ſick, and not able to march, and three dyed that night, and ſome fell down in their march from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and dyed; and when they came to <hi>Durham,</hi> I having ſent my Lieutenant Colonel and my Major, with a ſtrong Guard both of Horſe and Foot, and they being there told into the great Cathedral Church, they could not count them to more then Three thouſand; although Colonel <hi>Fenwick</hi> writ to me, That there were about Three thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, but I believe they were not told at <hi>Berwick,</hi> and moſt of thoſe that were loſt, it was in <hi>Scotland;</hi> for I heard, That the Officers that marched with them to <hi>Berwick,</hi> were neceſſitated to kill about Thirty, fearing the loſs of them all, for they fell down in great Numbers, and ſaid, They were not able to march; and they brought them far in the night, ſo that doubtleſs many ran away. When I ſent them firſt to <hi>Durham,</hi> I writ to the Major, and deſired him to take care, that they wanted not any thing that was fit for Priſoners, and what he ſhould disburſe for them, I would repay it. I alſo ſent them a daily ſupply of bread from <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and an allowance equal to what had been given to former Priſoners: But their Bodies being infected, the Flux encreaſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. I ſent many Officers to look to them, &amp; appointed that thoſe that were ſick ſhould be removed out the Cathedral Church into the Biſhops Caſtle, which belongs to Miſtris <hi>Blakiſton,</hi> and provided

Cooks, and they had Pottage made with Oatmeal, and Beef and Cabages, a full Quart at a Meal for every Priſoner: They had alſo coals daily brought to them, as many as made about a hundred Fires both day and night, and Straw to lie upon; and I appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marſhal to ſee all theſe things orderly done, and he was allowed Eight men to help him to divide the coals, and their Meat, Bread and Pottage equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: They were ſo unruly, ſluttiſh and naſty, that it is not to be believed; they acted rather like Beaſts then Men, ſo that the Marſhal was allowed Forty men to cleanſe and ſweep them every day: But thoſe men were of the luſtieſt Priſoners, that had ſome ſmall thing given them extraordinary: And theſe proviſions were for thoſe that were in health; and for thoſe that were ſick, and in the Caſtle, they had very good Mutton Broth, and ſometimes Veal Broth, and Beef and Mutton boild together, and old Women appointed to look to them in the ſeveral Rooms: There was alſo a Phyſitian which let them Blood, and dreſſed ſuch as were wounded, and gave the ſick Phyſick, and I dare confidently ſay, There was never the like care taken for any ſuch Number of priſoners that ever were in <hi>England.</hi> Notwithſtanding all this, many of them dyed, and few of any other Diſeaſe but the Flux; ſome were killed by themſelves, for they were exceeding cruel one towards another: If a man was perceived to have any Money, it was two to one but he was killed before morning, and Robbed; and if any had good clothes, he that wanted, if he was able, would ſtrangle him, and put on his clothes: And the Diſeaſe of the Flux ſtill encreaſing amongſt

them, I was then forced, for their preſervation, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it might be, to ſend to all the next Towns to <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> within four or five miles, to command them to bring in their Milk, for that was conceived to be the beſt Remedy for ſtopping of their Flux, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them what Rates they uſually ſold it for at the Markets, which was accordingly performed by about Threeſcore Towns and places, and Twenty of the next Towns to <hi>Durham</hi> continue ſtill to ſend daily in their Milk, which is boiled, ſome with Water, and ſome with Bean flower, the Phyſitians holding it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good for recovery of their health.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> You cannot but think ſtrange this long preamble, and to wonder what the matter will be; in ſhort its this, Of the Three thouſand priſoners that my Officers told into the Cathedral Church at <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Three hundred from thence, and Fifty from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> of the Sevenſcore left behinde, were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to Major <hi>Clerk</hi> by Order from the Councel, and there are about Five hundred ſick in the Caſtle, and about Six hundred yet in health in the Cathedral, the moſt of which are in probability Highlanders, they being hardier then the reſt, and other means to diſtinguiſh them we have not, and about Sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred are dead and buried, and Officers about Sixty, that are at the Marſhals in <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> My Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral having releaſed the reſt of the Officers, and the Councel having given me power to take out what I thought fit, I have granted to ſeveral well-affected perſons that have Salt-works at <hi>Sheels,</hi> and want Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Forty, and they have engaged to keep them to work at their Salt-pans; and I have taken out more

about Twelve Weavers, to begin a Trade of Linnen cloth like unto the Scotch-cloth, and about Forty Laborers. I cannot give you on this ſudden a more exact Accompt of the Priſoners, neither can any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt hold true long, becauſe they ſtill dye daily, and doubtleſs ſo they will, ſo long as any remain in Priſon. And for thoſe that are well, if Major <hi>Clerk</hi> could have believed that they had been able to have marched on foot, he would have marched them by Land; for we perceive that divers that are ſeemingly healthy, and have not at all been ſick, ſuddenly dye, and we cannot give any reaſon of it, onely we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend they are all infected, and that the ſtrength of ſome holds it out till it ſeize upon their very hearts. Now you fully underſtand the condition and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Priſoners, what you pleaſe to direct, I ſhall obſerve, and intend not to proceed further upon this Letter, until I have your Anſwer upon what I have now written.
