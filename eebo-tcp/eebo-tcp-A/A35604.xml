            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF CHARLES Earl of BANBURY.</head>
            <p>THE Right Honourable <hi>William Knollis,</hi> Created <hi>Lord Knollis</hi> and <hi>Viſcount Wallingford,</hi> and Knight of the moſt Noble Order of the <hi>Garter</hi> by King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Firſt;</hi> and by Letters Patents of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 2 <hi>Car.</hi> I. Created <hi>Earl of Banbury,</hi> To hold to him and the Heirs Males of his Body, with a Clauſe of <hi>Precedence,</hi> to take place next after <hi>Francis</hi> then Earl of <hi>Westmerland,</hi> and before <hi>Henry</hi> then Viſcount <hi>Mandevil,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Earl of <hi>Mancheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid Earl (having no Iſſue by <hi>Dorothy</hi> his firſt Lady) did, after her deceaſe, take to Wife the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eldeſt Daughter to the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Thomas</hi> late Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and they had Iſſue <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Banbury,</hi> who dyed without Iſſue, and <hi>Nicholas</hi> late Earl of <hi>Banbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Queſtions ariſing in <hi>Parliament</hi> 3 <hi>Caroli,</hi> upon the Clauſe of <hi>Precedence</hi> in the Patent of 2 <hi>Car.</hi> I. certain Earls did at the King's Requeſt Grant <hi>Precedence</hi> to the then Earl of <hi>Banbury;</hi> but ordered, that he ſhould have that <hi>precedence</hi> during Life only, and not <hi>deſcendable</hi> to his Heirs.</p>
            <p>Earl <hi>William</hi> dyed 25 <hi>May</hi> 1632.</p>
            <p>Earl <hi>Edward,</hi> his Eldeſt Son, being at the time of his Father's death aged little above five Years, was not ſummoned to any of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> in time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt,</hi> nor could rightfully claim to be ſo ſummoned, being under Age, and ſo dyed without Iſſue, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Earl <hi>Nicholas</hi> being born <hi>January</hi> 3. 1630. did, after his arrival to full Age, ſit in <hi>Parliament,</hi> Convened in the Twelfth Year of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> at the time of His Majeſties happy Reſtauration.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſummoned in the Thirteenth Year of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> the ſaid Earl <hi>Nicholas,</hi> having received no Writ of Summons to that <hi>Parliament,</hi> Addreſſed himſelf by humble Petition to his ſaid late Majeſty, ſetting forth, in effect, the Matters before expreſſed, and praying that he might be ſummoned by Writ to the ſaid <hi>Parliament,</hi> and enjoy the Priviledge and <hi>Precedency</hi> granted by the ſaid Letters Patents of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Petition being by his Majeſties Appointment delivered to the Houſe of <hi>Peers,</hi> by the Lord Great <hi>Chamberlain</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> was thereupon by them taken into Conſideration, and thereupon referred to the Lords Committees for Priviledges, who were upon hearing the Petitioners Counſel, and the Kings Attorney General to make Report thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Lords <hi>Committees</hi> being attended by <hi>Counſel and Witneſſes</hi> on the Petitioners behalf, and alſo by <hi>Mr. Attorney General</hi> for the King, it was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, that the ſaid Earl <hi>Nicholas</hi> was born of the Body of the ſaid <hi>Counteſs Elizabeth,</hi> during the Coverture between her and the ſaid Earl <hi>William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Attorney inſiſted on an <hi>Office</hi> by which it was found in 9 <hi>Caroli,</hi> That the ſaid Earl dyed without Iſſue, and that it was reputed that he ſo dyed.</p>
            <p>Whereunto it was inſiſted, That by the <hi>Common Law of the Land,</hi> if the Husband be within the four Seas, and the Wife hath Iſſue, <hi>no proof is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to prove the Child a Baſtard.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> did admit the <hi>Law</hi> to be ſo. And moreover, it was proved <hi>Ex abundanti,</hi> That the ſaid Earl <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> was kind and converſant with his Counteſs, and of a good ſtate of Health, uſing to ride abroad Hawking and Hunting, although of great Age.</p>
            <p>And by a ſubſequent Inquiſition, found in 17 <hi>Car. primi,</hi> it was found that the ſaid Earl <hi>William</hi> had Iſſue as aforeſaid, <hi>(viz.) Edward</hi> the then Earl of <hi>Banbury,</hi> his Son and Heir, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter the Lords Committees came to this Reſolution, after ſeveral Attendances to Report their Opinions, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Nicholas</hi> Earl of <hi>Banbury,</hi> being in the Eye of the Law Son to <hi>William</hi> late Earl of <hi>Banbury,</hi> the Houſe ſhould therefore <hi>adviſe the King</hi> to ſend him a Writ to come to Parliament.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Earl ought to have <hi>place</hi> in the Houſe of Peers, according to the <hi>Date of his Patent,</hi> and not according to the Tenor of that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which ranketh him before other Earls Created before him.</p>
            <p>After thoſe proceedings, and before any final Determination thereupon, the ſaid Earl <hi>Nicholas</hi> (having no Iſſue Male by the Lady <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Daughter of the Right Honourable the late Earl of <hi>Newport,</hi> his firſt Wife) took to Wife <hi>Anne</hi> the Daughter of the Right Honourable the late Lord <hi>Sherrard,</hi> and had Iſſue by her <hi>Charles,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Banbury,</hi> his Eldeſt Son and Heir, and about years ſince dyed, leaving the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Banbury</hi> an Infant under Age.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Banbury</hi> hath not been <hi>ſummoned</hi> to any of the Parliaments of his late Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> and by reaſon of his <hi>Infancy</hi> hath forborn to <hi>Claim</hi> or <hi>Petition</hi> for his Right:</p>
            <p>But being now of full Age, and not being <hi>ſummoned,</hi> as other Peers are, hath humbly Petitioned the Houſe of Peers to conſider his <hi>Caſe,</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſame to the King, to the end he may be relieved according to Right.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Clauſe</hi> whereby the King granted <hi>Precedence</hi> to Earl <hi>William,</hi> and his Heirs Males, beyond what he would have had by his <hi>Anciency,</hi> and the Date of his Patent, did firſt occaſion the Queſtion touching the enjoyment of his Honour, which perhaps had never been otherwiſe queſtioned at all. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the <hi>Law</hi> therein to be <hi>one</hi> way or <hi>other,</hi> the Honour of the <hi>Earldom</hi> is indubitably <hi>deſcended</hi> on <hi>CHARLES</hi> the now Earl of <hi>Banbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And neither the firſt <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> or any <hi>Opinions</hi> or <hi>Preſumptions</hi> concurring therewith, or founded thereon, are to be received or regarded in preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the <hi>Legal</hi> and Rightful Heir, and the ſtanding Rules of <hi>Law</hi> in Caſes of <hi>Deſcent</hi> and favour of <hi>Legitimation,</hi> upon theſe plain Reaſons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The firſt <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is no Evidence to <hi>conclude</hi> againſt other direct proof of the Fact, made in the Caſe upon <hi>Oath</hi> before the Lords <hi>Committees,</hi> of the Birth of Earl <hi>Nicholas.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The ſecond <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is to the contrary, and doth in effect Anſwer and <hi>Avoid</hi> the former.</item>
               <item>3. By Law, no Proofs or Preſumptions whatſoever, ought to be received to <hi>Illegitimate</hi> Iſſue born within Lawful <hi>Wedlock,</hi> while the Parents are both within the <hi>Four Seas.</hi> And in this Caſe, there was, beſides the ſecond <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> Proof of <hi>Actual</hi> Kindneſs and Converſation between the Parents, which the <hi>Law</hi> would <hi>intend,</hi> if not proved.</item>
               <item>4. By Law, no man ought to be <hi>Baſtardized</hi> after his Death, when he cannot Anſwer for himſelf.</item>
               <item>5. The <hi>Law</hi> doth ſo much favour <hi>Legitimation</hi> of <hi>Iſſue,</hi> That if a <hi>Baſtard,</hi> actually born out of <hi>Wedlock,</hi> became ſeized of an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent</hi> thereof to be caſt on his <hi>Iſſue,</hi> even the Right of the Lawful Heir, or <hi>Mulier</hi> (as the Law Terms it) is thereby <hi>barr'd,</hi> and therein that <hi>Deſcent,</hi> from a mans <hi>Iſſue</hi> though <hi>Illegitimate,</hi> doth differ from others.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The now Earl of <hi>Banbury</hi> is unqueſtionably deſcended from Earl <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Actually <hi>Legal</hi> Heir of Earl <hi>William,</hi> in all <hi>Regular Qualifications,</hi> and Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to all the favourable <hi>Preſumptions</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> doth afford; And it would be an extraordinary thing, both beſides, and contrary to all common Rules of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to oppoſe a <hi>Legal</hi> Title, upon pretence and <hi>Opinion</hi> of Fact, ſo long ſince paſt, and never <hi>proved,</hi> examined, or brought to <hi>Judgment</hi> in the Lives of the Parties concerned, when themſelves and many other <hi>Honourable</hi> Perſonages of their <hi>Alliance</hi> and Acquaintance might have given Proof and Teſtimony of their knowledge of many <hi>material</hi> Circumſtances and other things now buried with them, and the very truth whereof is become impoſſible to be throughly diſcovered and made out.</p>
