            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

&amp;c. Some to our inferiors,
as to ſeruants, laborers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yf we ſpeake or write of or to
our ſuperiors, we muſt do it with
all honour, humilitie &amp; reuerence,
vſing to their perſonages ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue
and comparatiue termes:
as moſt high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt mighty, right

altogether according to the

it is to be noted that of ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
comparatiue, poſitiue or
diminutiue termes, we muſt vſe
but three at once at the moſt.</p>
               <p>Note alſo that moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Epiſtles &amp; Letters, there be
<pb facs="tcp:2903:9"/>
three neceſſary points. The firſt
is the ſalutation of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
which is made in ſundrie
maners, according to the pleaſure
of the enditer, as may well be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by diuers ſtyles hereafter
folowing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which muſt be don according
to the eſtate of the writer, and the
qualitie of the perſon to whome
we write: For to our ſuperiors
we muſt write at the right ſyde in
the nether ende of the paper, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
By your moſt humble and
obedient ſonne, or ſeruant, &amp;c. And
to our equalles we may write to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the midſt of the paper ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
By your faithfull frende for

write on high at the left hand ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
By yours &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The third is the Superſcripcion,
<pb facs="tcp:2903:10"/>
which muſt be vpon the back ſyde,
the letter being cloſed, ſealed and
packed vp after the fineſt faſhion,
whereupon muſt be written his
name to whome the letters ſhold
be addreſſed, &amp; his dwelling place,
(if it be not notoriouſly knowne)
placing therwith the name of his
dignitie, Lordſhip, Office, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
Science, or Parentage:
And if we write moe than one, the
chiefeſt and permanent dignities
muſt be written firſt, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinitie:
and afterwarde the
mutable dignitie, as for example:
To my Lord of ſuch a place, my
couſin, Maiſter of the Requeſtes
of our ſoueraigne Lord the King.
Yf we write to our Superiour,
we muſt vſe all honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
without embeſeling his
name, as to the King our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lorde: To our reuerend
<pb facs="tcp:2903:10"/>
Father in God the Biſhop of &amp;c.
To the high &amp; mighty Lorde, my
Lord of, &amp;c. To my Lord of, &amp;c. Yf

name, and the name of his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

honeſt and ſemely poſitiue or two
at the moſt, correſpondent to the

(or truſty friende) ſuche a
one, &amp;c. Yf we write to oure infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
we may vſe in our ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription:
To his louing ſonne,
ſuch a one, &amp;c. To his truſty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
ſuch a one, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is to bee noted, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
not an inferior perſon,
ſpeking or addreſſing his words
to his ſuperior, to ſpeke nor write
<pb facs="tcp:2903:11"/>
by the imperatiue, or commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
as if one ſhould ſay thus:
Soueraigne King, behold a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
man, make him knight: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ſuch a one, who is a good
Clerke, giue him a benefice: but
with all humilitie we muſt ſay:
worthy ſoueraigne, I aſſure your
maieſty that he is an expert man,
pleſeth it you to haue him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance:
Such a one ſemeth
vnto me to be very learned and
ſkilful, it were a charitable deede
of your maieſtie to prouide for
him, and therefore I am bolde
to commit him to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>Yf we addreſſe our ſpeach to
our equall, we muſt ſpeake with
a certaine familiar reuerence, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
poſitiue and comparatiue
termes, and very fewe ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2903:11"/>
as wyſe, ſage, honorable,
worſhipfull, diſcrete, renowmed,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yf we ſpeake to our infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
we muſt vſe a certayne
kynde of modeſt and ciuill au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
in giuing them playne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to vnderſtand our intent and
purpoſe. A Marchaunt hauing
many ſeruantes, to his chiefeſt
may ſpeake or wryte by thys
terme, you: but to them whome
he leſſe eſtemeth, and are more
ſubiect to correction, hee maye
vſe this terme, thou, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
at his diſcretion: Alſo a
Father to his ſonne may do the
like.</p>
               <p>If Epiſtles or Letters ſhold
be written by fonde, Lunatike,
or folkes wythout reaſon, to
ſuche maner of people it were
<pb facs="tcp:2903:12"/>
were but ſimplicitie to gyue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.
Yet notwithſtanding
bycauſe that thys place remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vnfurniſhed, and for that
<hi>Stultorum infinitus est numerus.</hi> I will
declare ſomething of that which
I haue ſene and heard: For ſome
wryte thus, Patrick Spendal,
Prince of pouertie: to his Goſſip
Geffrey Graceleſſe, Doctor of
Dronckenſhip ſendeth greeting,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Before that we take in hand
the material inſtruments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to write an epiſtle or letter,
we haue to conſider theſe pointes
following: to wit, the eſtate, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
or qualitie of hym vnto
whom we write: whyther he bee
a publike perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or a priuat, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be rich or poore, a friend or
an enemie: alſo whyther he bee
well known vnto vs, or but little.
<pb facs="tcp:2903:12"/>
There bee ſome of ſo ouerthwart
a nature, that they neuer take
pleſure to reade any thing that is
writen vnto them, be the matter
neuer ſo pleaſant and mery: vnto
ſuch it behoueth to write ſuccinct<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
and briefly: But to them whom
we know do take pleſure to reade
letters, we ſhould, and may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger write amply, properly
and eloquently.</p>
               <p>When we write to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualtie,
we muſt reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce them,
&amp; that by ryght: for ſuch perſons
are called of God to hygh digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and if we requeſt any thyng
at their handes, we muſt humble
our ſelues, gyuing them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which is iuſtly
due vnto them. Yet we muſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
take heede that we exalt them
not to much &amp; more than reaſon
would permit, for ſo might we be
<pb facs="tcp:2903:13"/>
noted of flattery and adulation,
and they themſelues alſo might
therewithall iuſtly be offended:
therefore let vs take heede that
we write not impudently or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly.</p>
               <p>But if we write to our frend,
we may make our Epiſtle or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
long or ſhort, as we ſhall
thinck beſt, and as it ſhall be moſt
delectable: For a frende taketh
all things agreably and in good
part, and excuſeth euery thing
that he may reaſonably excuſe,
whereas the enimie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe
quickly reprehendeth and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
yea where there is no fault
nor offenſe. And therefore he
that writeth to his enimie, or to
a perſon of ſmall acquaintance,
or where he douteth will be ſmall
eſtimation made of his writing,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2903:13"/>
he muſt wittily, and firſt of all
declare that loue is iuſt or chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for ſome honeſt cauſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting himſelfe, or ſpeaking
arrogantly, as to ſay, I would
that you ſhould vnderſtand what
I am, &amp;c. And then afterwarde
to be briefe and circumſpect.</p>
               <p>And aboue all things we muſt
take heede, that we write not of
higher matters, than our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
or knowledge may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend:
for thereby are fooles
knowne and manifeſted, euen as
they be that preſume to diſpute of
thinges that either they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not, or elſe haue very litle
knowledge in them.</p>
               <p>Alſo we muſt not write to
them that be ſimple and ignorant
by termes that be ſtraunge &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
for ſo ſhold they haue iuſt
occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuſpect that we deride
<pb facs="tcp:2903:14"/>
and mock them.</p>
               <p>And in fine, reteyne this for a
principall, that the fayreſt langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
that may bee, is the common
and familiar ſpeache, and not that
of rare and diffuſed phraſes, or
inckhorne termes ſkummed from
the Latin, nor of to baſe termes &amp;
barbarous, or termes vnknowne
except in certain places, for there
is nothing more decent, than to
keepe a meane in all things, and
nothing more ſure than to ſwim
betwene two Ryuers, <hi>Nam in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio

               <p>Furthermore, it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb facs="tcp:2903:14"/>
whether the matter that
we write off bee honeſt, true, or
ſuch like: or whether it be ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
doutfull, obſcure. &amp;c. For if
the matter of yt ſelfe bee honeſt &amp;
perfect, then needeth it but ſmall
perſwaſion: but if it bee doubtfull
or obſcure, it behoueth to make
large and euident declaracion: if
it be ſlanderous or vnhoneſt, then
muſt bee added thereunto agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
remedies: as <hi>Terence</hi> doth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
diſſolute perſones, for he
ſayeth it is thorough negligence

that it was done thorough

               <p>Moreouer there be ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry other
ſortes of Epiſtles &amp; Letters, for
ſome are theologicall or of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
as be the Epiſtles of <hi>Plato,</hi>
of <hi>Denys,</hi> &amp; of thappoſtles <hi>S Paule,
S. Peter, S. Iames,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn:</hi> other
ſome are of maners and vertues,
as thoſe of <hi>S. Auguſtine, S. Hierome,
S. Ambroſe, Seneca, Cyprian:</hi> and other
ſome are of great importance, as
of peace, warre, and gouernance:
other ſome of newes: other of
Recommendations: other of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition:
other of loue, as be
thoſe of <hi>Ouid,</hi> and of <hi>Propertius:</hi>
other of domeſticall familiaritie:
and other ſome are pleaſant and
ioyfull. But in this litle volume
we will onely entreat of the moſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2903:15"/>
vſuall, and of ſome diffuſedly,
and the ouerplus ſhal remaine to
the imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gentle mindes,
who by the ſkill of their penne,
were able to repaire the whole
ruine of Rethorike, if there ſhold
happen any deſtruction or detry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Euery Epiſtle is either of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
of Myrth, or of Grauitie.
The Epiſtle of Doctrine is that
wherein are expreſſed all good
and euill things to them that be
abſent. That of Myrth is, which
by pleſaunt, long, and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
language, is made either to
comfort, to reioyce, or to get the
good wyll and beneuolence of
them whome we write vnto.</p>
               <p>And that of Grauitie is, when

&amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2903:16"/>
And all theſe three ſortes doe
tend to their proper endes: For
whoſoeuer writeth of Doctrine,
ought to haue regarde to this end
&amp; to profit and inſtruct them vnto
whome he writeth: he that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

               <p>The firſt way to get beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

his bountifulneſſe, his iuſtice,
his vertue &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond waie to purchaſe

               <p>The third is, to make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

and for the which he vnto

But if God ſo prouide for me hereafter

and confeſſe, that you haue vſed your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie
towards me. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here are to be noted ſix con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
of thankes giuing,
which may take place as well in
the iudiciall gender as in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberatiue:
for thanks giuing is
a kynde of recompenſe: That is
to wit, we muſt conſider the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and thing giuen, him that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
it, the time, the qualitie, the
value that is demaunded, and the
authoritie of him that dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth,
together with the facultie of him
that is demaunded. Concerning
the gift or benefit, ther is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidred
whether it be great or ſmal
ſumptuous or paynfull, priuate
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2903:38"/>
or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, eaſy or difficult, much
or litle, good or bad. As touching
him that giueth, there is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
his liberalitie, &amp; cuſtom of
giui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. Alſo for the time, whether
we haue extreme neceſſitie, &amp; that
none other of our fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds either did
it not, or knew it not, could not or
wold not do it, and that without
hope of ſuccor as a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnloked
for, he did vs that benefit. And as
for the qualitie, whether he did it
for our profit or his owne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by fortune or of ſet purpoſe,
whether liberally or by conſtraint,
or otherwiſe. As concerning the
value, it is by compariſon, as to
conſyder what it is that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
how much, conſidering
alſo the compariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which
is giuen, and of that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.
And as touching the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
is to be conſidered what
<pb facs="tcp:2903:39"/>
maner of perſons they be which
demaund, for what cauſe: there is
likewiſe to be conſidred the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of him that is demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the facultie of the recompence.
Moreouer it is to be conſidered &amp;
noted, that he which demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
recompence hath three common
places. The firſt is Amplificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the benefits &amp; good turns that
he hath done, of the paines &amp; loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that he hath had in doing him
good &amp; ſeruing him, &amp; then adni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilating
and counting nought
worth any rewarde that he hath
had, as to ſay thus: I haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
you at myne owne proper
coſtes, I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed my youth
I haue deſtroyed my ſelfe for you
and yet haue I ben nothing reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced.
The ſeconde by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as thus: You haue heretofore
done me ſome pleaſure, but that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2903:39"/>
doth nothing approch, nor is not
worthy to be compared to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
that I haue done you. The
third is by remonſtration, as for
to ſay thus: do you wel vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
that from henceforth there is no
man that will do you ſeruice, nor
kepe promiſe except you ſatiſfy
me, &amp; therfore if you do not, I wil
declare it vnto euery one. Now
he that will deny ſuch benefits
done, or at leſt not recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
may ayde him ſelfe by the three
reaſons aforeſayde in confuting
them: firſt by Amplification, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus: A man ought not to
giue vnto wicked perſons any
good or excellent recompence, for
the paynes of a villaine are to
be made no accompt vppon. By
comparyſon, ſaying: If any by
their vertues haue hadde anye
<pb facs="tcp:2903:40"/>
benefit, the other vicious may
not looke to haue lyke preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
By remonſtracion, in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the men are more coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
of money than of vertue, &amp;
that for a mans money he may
alwayes haue ſeruauntes moe in
number, than vertuous. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or remuneracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is
made in three ſortes, by will, by
word, and by deede. By wil when
the faculty, the tyme, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
are not: and yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
in the man a perpetuall
memory of the good deede which
he hath receiued, and wold glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
render pleaſure for pleaſure, or
better. By word, when in giuing
thanks for the good turne which
hath ben done vnto vs, we binde
our ſelues to do all ſeruice to our
benefactour. By deede, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde
the thanks of words, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2903:40"/>
the benefactour with
goods, with gifts, with ſeruice,
with mutuall loue: or at the leaſt
by offring to ſatiſfie.</p>

that I eſteme the death to be much ſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

haue iudged your onely Sonne worthie

God, yea or his Father or Mother, me
thinketh he were not worthy to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned

for in veritie, there is nothing more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely
in a yong man, than to giue
occaſion of anger vnto a man of rype
age. Therefore as <hi>Marcus Cicero</hi>
writeth, wyſedome is the knowledge
of good and euyll thynges: And thys
<pb facs="tcp:2903:117"/>
goeth morally, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſputing ſaith,
that it falleth not for youth: therefore the

wiſe man is temperate and conſtant: &amp;
he that is conſtant and without pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
&amp; without wickedneſſe, is he that
is quiet and vntroubled: then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude,
the wiſe man is happie. Therfore exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
your pitie vnto me: for according to the

repenteth him of his errour, is worthy
of pardon. But bicauſe I wil not be long
