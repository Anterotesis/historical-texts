            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet, I Confess, I neither am, nor ought to be surpriz'd at this Indulgence; For your Lordship has the same Right to Favour Poetry which the Great and Noble have ever had.</p>

            <p>'Tis indeed their Interest, who endeavour the Subversion of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to discourage Poets and Historians; for the best which can happen to them is to be forgotten: But such, who, under KINGS,

His MAJESTY, the most knowing Judge of Men, and the best Master, has acknowledg'd the Ease and Benefit he Receives in the Incomes of His Treasury, which you found not only Disorder'd, but Exhausted. All Things were in the Confusion of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> without Form or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, if not reduc'd beyond it, even to Annihilation: So that you had not only to separate the Jarring Elements, but (if that boldness of Expression might be allow'd me) to Create them. Your Enemies had so Embroil'd the Management of your Office, that they look'd on your Advancement as the Instrument of your Ruine. And as if the clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Revenue, and the Confusion of Accounts, which you found in your Entrance, were not sufficient, they added their own weight of Malice to the Publick Calamity, by forestalling the Credit which shou'd Cure it: Your Friends on the other side were only capable of Pitying, but not of Aiding you: No farther Help or Counsel was remaining to you, but what was founded on your Self; And that indeed was your Security: For your Diligence, your Constancy, and your Prudence, wrought more surely within, when they were not disturb'd by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motion. The highest Virtue is best to be trusted with its Self, for Asistance only can be given by a <hi>Genius</hi> Superiour to that which it Assists. And 'tis the Noblest kind of Debt, when we are only oblig'd to God and Nature. This then, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is your just Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That you have wrought out your Self a way to Glory, by those very Means that were design'd for your Destruction: You have not only restor'd, but advanc'd the Revenues of your Master without Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the Subject: And as if that were little yet, the Debts of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> which lay heaviest both on the <hi>Crown,</hi> and on <hi>private Persons,</hi> have by your Conduct been Establish'd in a certainty of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. An Action so much the more Great and Honourable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Case was without the ordinary Relief of Laws; above the Hopes of the Afflicted, and beyond the Narrowness of the Treasury to Redr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ss, had it been manag'd by a less able Hand. 'Tis certainly the Happiest, and most Unenvy'd part of all your Fortune, to do Good to many, while you do Injury to none: To receive at once the Prayers of the Subject, and the Praises of the Prince: And by the care of
<pb facs="tcp:94178:3"/>
your Conduct; to give Him Means of Exerting the chiefest, (if any be the chiefest) of His Royal Virtues: His distributive Justice to the Deserving, and His Bounty and Compassion to the Wanting. The Disposition of Princes towards their People, cannot better be discover'd than in the choice of their Ministers; who, like the Animal Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Soul and Body, participate somewhat of both Natures, and make the Communication which is betwixt them. A King, who is Just and Moderate in his Nature, who Rules according to the Laws, whom God made Happy by Forming the Temper of His Soul to the Constitution of His Government, and who makes us Happy, by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming over us no other Sovereignty than that wherein our Welfare and Liberty consists; A Prince, I say, of so excellent a Character, and so suitable to the Wishes of all Good Men, could not better have convey'd Himself into His Peoples Apprehensions, than in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Person; who so lively express the same Virtues, that you seem not so much a Copy, as an Emanation of Him.

               </gap>ration is doubtless an Establishment of Greatness; but there is a steadiness of Temper which is likewise requisite in a Minister of State: So equal a mixture of both Virtues, that he may stand like an <hi>Isthmus</hi> betwixt the two Encrooching Seas of Arbitrary Power, and Lawless Anarchy. The Undertaking would be difficult to any but an Extraordinary <hi>Genius,</hi> to stand at the Line, and to divide the Limits; to pay what is due to the Great Representative of the Nation, and neither to inhance, nor to yield up the undoubted Prerogatives of the Crown. These, <hi>My Lord,</hi> are the proper Virtues of a Noble Englishman, as indeed they are properly English Virtues: No People in the World being capable of using them, but we who have the Happiness to be Born under so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and so well-pois'd a Government. A Government which has all the Advantages of Liberty beyond a Commonwealth, and all the Marks of Kingly Sovereignty without the danger of a Tyranny. Both my Nature, as I am an Englishman, and my Reason, as I am a Man, have bred in me a Loathing to that specious Name of a Repu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ck; That mock-appearance of a Liberty, where all who have not part in the Government, are Slaves; And Slaves they are of a viler Note than such as are Subjects to an absolute Dominion. For no Christian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is so Absolute, but 'tis Circumscrib'd with Laws: But when the Executive Power is in the Law-Makers, there is no farther check upon them; and the People must suffer without a Remedy, because they are Oppress'd by their Representatives. If I must s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:94178:4"/>
is exactly Suited both to the Situation of our Country, and the Temper of the Natives: An Island being more proper for Commerce and for Defence, than for extending its Dominions on the Continent: For what the Valour of its Inhabitants might gain, by Reason of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteness, and the Casualties of the Seas, it cou'd not so easily preserve: And therefore, neither the Arbitrary Power of one in a Monarchy, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>r of many in a Commonwealth, could make us greater than we are. 'Tis true, that vaster and more frequent Taxes might be gather'd, when the Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>nt of the People was not Ask'd or Needed; but this were only by Conquering abroad to be Poor at home: And the Examples of our Neighbours teach us, that they are not always the Happiest Subjects whose Kings extend their Dominions farthest. Since therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not win by an Offensive War, at least a Land-War, the Model of our Government seems Naturally contriv'd for the Defensive part: And the Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>iting themselves on too much Happiness, wou'd perswàde the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they might be Happier by a Change. 'Twas indeed the Policy of their old For father, when himself was fallen from the Station of Glory, to seduce Mankind into the same Rebellion with him, by telling him he might yet be freer than he was: That is, more free than his Nature wou'd allow, or (if I may so say) than God cou'd make him. We have already all the Liberty which Free-Born Subjects can enjoy; and all beyond it is but License. But if it be Liberty of Conscience which they pretend, the Moderation of our Church is such, that its Practice extends not to the severity of Persecution, and its Discipline is withal so easie, that it allows more freedom to Dissenters than any of the Sects wou'd allow to it. In the mean time, what Right can be pretended by these Men to attempt Innovations in Church or State? Who made them the Trustees, or (to Speak a little nearer their own Language) the Keepers of the Liberty of <hi>England?</hi> If their Call be extraordinary, let them Convince us by working Miracles; for ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vocation they can have none to disturb the Government under which they were Born, and which protects them. He who has often chang'd his Party, and always has made his Interest the Rule of it, gives little E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of his Sincerity for the Publick Good: 'Tis manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:94178:4"/>
but were crush'd themselves by the Usurpation of their own Instrument. Neither is it enough for them to Answer, that they only intend a Reformation of the Government, but not the Subversion of it: On such pretences all Insurrections have been founded; 'Tis striking at the Root of Power, which is Obedience. Every Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance of private Men, has the seed of Treason in it; and Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which are couch'd in ambiguous Terms, are therefore the more dangerous, because they do all the Mischief of open Sedition, yet are safe from the Punishment of the Laws. These, <hi>My Lord,</hi> are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations which I should not pass so lightly over, had I room to manage them as they deserve: for no Man can be so inconsiderable in a Nation, as not to have a share in the welfare of it; and if he be a true Englishmen, he must at the same time be fir'd with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and revenge himself as he can on the Disturbers of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

That as your Fathers Fortune waited on the unhappiness of his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> so your own may participate of the better Fate which attends his <hi>Son.</hi> The Relation which you have by Alliance to the Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of your Lady, serves to confirm to you both this happy Angury. For what can deserve a greater place in the English Chronicle, than the Loyalty and Courege, the Actions and Death of the General of an Army Fighting for His Prince and Country? The Honour and Gallantry of the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> is so illustrious a Subject, that 'tis fit to adorn an Heroick Poem; for He was the Proto-Martyr of the Cause, and the Type of his unfortunate Royal Master.</p>
            <p>Yet, after all, <hi>My Lord,</hi> if I may speak my thoughts, you are happy rather to us than to your self: for the Multiplicity, the Cares, and the Vexations of your Imployment, have betray'd you from your self, and given you up into the Possession of the Publick. You are Robb'd of your Privacy and Friends, and scarce any hour of your Life you can call your own. Those who envy your Fortnne, if they wanted not good Nature, might more justly pity it; and when they see you watch'd by a Croud of Suitors, whose importunity 'tis impossible to avoid, would conclude with Reason, that you have lost much more in
<pb facs="tcp:94178:5"/>
true Content, than you have gain'd by Dignity; and that a private Gentleman is better attended by a single Servant, than your Lordship with so clamorous a Train. Pardon me, <hi>My Lord,</hi> If I speak like a Philosopher on this Subject; the Fortune which makes a Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie, cannot make him Happy: and a Wise Man must think himself uneasie, when few of his Actions are in his Choice.</p>
            <p>This last Consideration has brought me to another, and a very sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable one for your Relief; which is, That while I pity your want of leisure, I have impertinently Detain'd you so long a time. I have put off my own Business, which was my Dedication, till 'tis so late, that I am now asham'd to begin it: And therefore I will say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Poem, which I Present to you, because I know not if you are like to have an Hour, which, with a good Conscience, you may throw away in perusing it: And for the Author, I have only to beg the continuance of your Protection to him, who is,</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe death of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> is a Subject which has been treated by the greatest Wits of our Nation, after <hi>Shakespeare;</hi> and by all so variously, that their Example has given me the confidence to try my felf in this Bowe of <hi>Ulysses</hi> amongst the Crowd of Sutors; and, withal, to take my own measures, in aiming at the Mark. I doubt not but the same Motive has prevailed with all of us in this attempt; I mean the excellency of the Moral: for the chief Persons represented, were famous Patterns of unlawful Love; and their end accordingly was unfortunate. All reasonable Men have long since concluded, That the Heroe of the Poem, ought not to be a Character of perfect Virtue, for, then, he could not, without injustice, be made unhappy; nor yet altogether wicked, because he could not then be pitied: I have therefore steer'd the middle course; and have drawn the character of <hi>Anthony</hi> as favourably as <hi>Plutarch, Appian,</hi> and <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> wou'd give me leave: the like I have observ'd in <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> That which is wanting to work up the pity to a greater heighth, was not afforded me by the story: for the crimes of Love which they both committed, were not occasioned by any necessity, or fatal ignorance, but were wholly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary; since our passions are, or ought to be, within our power. The Fabrick of the Play is regular enough, as to the inferior parts of it; and the Unities of Time, Place and Action, more exactly observ'd, than, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the English Theater requires. Particularly, the Action is so much one, that it is the only of the kind without Episode, or Underplot; every Scene in the Tragedy conducing to the main design, and every Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with a turn of it. The greatest error in the contrivance seems to be in the person of <hi>Octavia:</hi> For, though I might use the privilege of a Poet, to introduce her into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> yet I had not enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, that the compassion she mov'd to her self and Children, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to that which I reserv'd for <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> whose mutual love being founded upon vice, must lessen the favour of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them, when Virtue and Innocence were oppress'd by it. And, though I justified <hi>Anthony</hi> in some measure, by making <hi>Octavia</hi>'s depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to proceed wholly from her self; yet the force of the first Machine still remain'd; and the dividing of pity, like the cutting of a River into many Channels, abated the strength of the natural Stream. But this is an Objection which none of my Criticks have urg'd against me; and therefore I might have let it pass, if I could have resolv'd to have been partial to my self. The faults my Enemies have found, are rather cavils concerning little, and not essential Decencies; which a Master of the Ceremonies may decide betwixt us. The <hi>French</hi> Poets, I confess, are strict Observers of these Punctilio's: They would not, for example, have suffer'd <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Octavia</hi> to have met; or if they had met, there must only have pass'd betwixt them some cold civilities, but no eagerness
<pb facs="tcp:94178:6"/>
of repartée, for fear of offending against the greatness of their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, and the modesty of their Sex. This Objection I foresaw, and at the same time contemn'd: for I judg'd it both natural and probable, that <hi>Octavia,</hi> proud of her new-gain'd Conquest, would search out <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to triumph over her; and that <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> thus attack'd, was not of a spirit to shun the encounter: and 'tis not unlikely, that two exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Rivals should use such Satyr as I have put into their mouths; for after all, though the one were a <hi>Roman,</hi> and the other a Queen, they were both Women. 'Tis true, some actions, though natural, are not fit to be represented; and broad obscenities in words, ought in good-manners to be avoided: expressions therefore are a modest cloathing of our thoughts, as Breeches and Petticoats are of our Bodies. If I have kept my self within the bounds of modesty, all beyond it is but nicety and affectation; which is no more but Modesty deprav'd into a Vice: they betray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves who are too quick of apprehension in such cases, and leave all r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

La ceremonie nous defend d'exprimer par paroles les choses licites &amp; naturelles, &amp; nous l'en croyons; la raison nous defend de n'en faire point d'illicites &amp; mauvaises, &amp; personne ne l'en croid.</hi> My comfort is, that by this opinion my Enemies are but sucking Criticks, who wou'd fain be nibbling ere their Teeth are come.</p>
            <p>Yet; in this nicety of manners does the excellency of <hi>French</hi> Poetry consist: their Heroes are the most civil people breathing; but their good breeding seldom extends to a word of sense: All their Wit is in their Ceremony; they want the Genius which animates our Stage; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis but necessary when they cannot please, that they should take care not to offend. But, as the civillest Man in the company is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the dullest, so these Authors, while they are afraid to make you laugh or cry, out of pure good manners, make you sleep. They are so careful not to exasperate a Critick, that they never leave him any work; so busie with the Broom, and make so clean a riddance, that there is little left either for censure or for praise: for no part of a Poem is worth our discommending, where the whole is insipid; as when we have once tasted of pall'd Wine, we stay not to examine it Glass by Glass. But while they affect to shine in ttifles, they are often careless in essentials. Thus their <hi>Hippolitus</hi> is so scrupulous in point of decency, that he will rather expose himself to death, than accuse his Stepmother to his Father; and my Criticks I am sure will commend him for it: but we of grosser ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, are apt to think that this excess of generosity, is not practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but with Fools and Madmen. This was good manners with a venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and the Audience is like to be much concern'd at the misfortunes of this admirable Heroe: but take <hi>Hippolitus</hi> out of his Poetick Fit, and

I suppose he would think it a wiser part, to set the Saddle on the right Horse, and chuse rather to live with the reputation of a plain-spoken honest Man, than to die with the infamy of an incestuous Villain. In the mean time we may take notice, that where the Poet ought to have preserv'd the character as it was deliver'd to us by Antiquity, when he should have given us the Picture of a rough young Man, of the <hi>Amazonian</hi> strain, a jolly Huntsman, and both by his profession and his early rising a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy to Love, he has chosen to give him the turn of Gallantry, sent him to travel from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> taught him to make Love and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the <hi>Hipp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> the only Criticks. But till some Genius as Universal, as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> shall arise, who can penetrate into all Arts and Sciences, without the practice of them, I shall think it reasonable, that the Judgment of an Artificer in his own Art should be preferable to the opinion of another Man; at least where he is not brib'd by interest, or prejudic'd by malice: and this, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uppose, is manifest by plain induction: For, first, the Crowd cannot be presum'd to have more than a gross instinct, of what pleases or displeases them: every Man will grant me this; but then, by a particular kindness to himself, he draws his own stake first, and will be distinguish'd from the multitude, of which other Men may think him one. But, if I come closer to those who are allow'd for witty Men, either by the advantage of their quality, or by common fame, and affirm that neither are they qualified to decide Sovereignly, concerning Poetry, I shall yet have a strong party of my opinion; for most of them severally will exclude the rest, either from the number of witty Men, or at least of able Judges. But here again they are all indulgent to themselves: and every one who believes himself a Wit, that is, every Man, will pretend at the same time to a right of judging. But to press it yet farther, there are many witty Men, but few Poets, neither have all Poets a taste of Tragedy. And this is the Rock on which they are daily splitting. Poetry, which is a Picture of Nature, must generally please: but 'tis not be understood that all parts of is must please every Man; therefore is not Tragedy to be judg'd by a witty Man, whose taste is only confin'd to Comedy. Nor is every Man who loves Tragedy a sufficient Judge of it: he must understand the excellencies of it too, or he will only prove a blind Admirer, not a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. From hence it comes that so many Satyrs on Poets, and censures of their Writings, fly abroad. Men of pleasant Conversation, (at least esteem'd so) and indu'd with a trifling kind of Fancy, perhaps help'd out with some smattering of Latine, are ambitious to distinguish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Herd of Gentlemen, by their Poetry;</p>

And is not this a wretched affectation, not to be contented with what Fortune has done for them, and sit down quietly with their Estates, but they must call their Wits in question, and needlesly expose their nakedness to publick view? Not considering that they are not to expect the same approbation from sober Men, which they have found from their flatterers after the third Bottle? If a little glittering in discourse has pass'd them on us for witty Men, where was the necessity of undeceiving the World? Would a Man who has an ill Title to an Estate, but yet is in possession of it, would he bring it of his own accord, to be try'd at <hi>Westminster?</hi> We who write, if we want the Talent, yet have the excuse that we do it for a poor subsistence; but what can be urg'd in their defence, who not having the Vocation of Poverty to scribble out of mere wantonness, take pains to make themselves ridiculous? <hi>Horace</hi> was certainly in the right, where he said, That <hi>no Man is satisfied with his own condition.</hi> A Poet is not pleas'd because he is not rich; and the Rich are discontented, because the Poets will not admit them of their number. Thus the case is hard with Writers: if they succeed not, they must starve; and if they do, some malicious Satyr is prepar'd to level them for daring to please without their leave. But while they are so eager to destroy the fame of others, their ambition is manifest in their concernment: some Poem of their own is to be produc'd, and the Slaves are to be laid flat with their faces on the ground, that the Monarch may appear in the greater Majesty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionysius</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> had the same longings, but with all their power they cou'd never bring their business well about. 'Tis true, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd themselves Poets by sound of Trumpet; and Poets they were upon pain of death to any Man who durst call them otherwise. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience had a fine time on't, you may imagine; they sate in a bodily fear, and look'd as demurely as they could: for 'twas a hanging matter to laugh unseasonably; and the Tyrants were suspicious, as they had reason, that their Subjects had 'em in the wind; so, every man in his own defence set as good a face upon the business as he could: 'Twas known before-hand that the Monarchs were to be Crown'd Laureats; but when the Shew was over, and an honest Man was suffer'd to depart quietly, he took out his Laughter which he had stifled; with a firm resolution never more to see an Emperor's Play, though he had been ten years a making it. In the mean time, the true Poets were they who made the best Markets, for they had Wit enough to yield the Prize with a good grace, and not contend with him who had thirty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>egions: They were sure to be rewarded if they confess'd themselves bad Writers, and that was somewhat better than to be Martyrs for their Reputation. <hi>Lucan</hi>'s example was enough to teach them man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and after he was put to Death, for overcoming <hi>Nero,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror carried it without dispute for the best Poet in his Dominions: No man was ambitious of that grinning Honour; for if he heard the malicious Trumpeter proclaiming his Name before his Betters, he knew there was but one way with him. <hi>Mecoenas</hi> took another Course, and we know he was more than a great Man, for he was witty too:
<pb facs="tcp:94178:8"/>
but finding himself far gone in Poetry, which <hi>Seneca</hi> assures us was not his Talent, he thought it his best way to be well with <hi>Virgil</hi> and with <hi>Horace;</hi> that at least he might be a Poet at the second hand; and we see how happily it has succeeded with him; for his own bad Poetry is forgotten, and their Panegyricks of him still remain. But they who should be our Patrons, are for no such expensive ways to fame: they have much of the Poetry of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> but little of his Liberality. They are for persecuting <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> in the Persons of their Successours, (for such is every Man, who has any part of their Soul and Fire, though in a less degree.) Some of their little <hi>Zanies</hi> yet go farther; for they are Persecutors even of <hi>Horace</hi> himself, as far as they are able, by their ignorant and vile Imitations of him; by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an unjust use of his Authority, and turning his Artillery against his Friends. But how would he disdain to be Copyed by such hands! I dare answer for him, he would be more uneasie in their Company, than he was with <hi>Crispinus</hi> their Forefather in the <hi>Holy Way;</hi> and would no more have allow'd them a place amongst the Criticks, than he would <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Mimique, and <hi>Tigellius</hi> the Buffoon;</p>

               <l>All gaping for the Carcass of a Play!</l>
               <l>With Croaking Notes they bode some dire event;</l>
               <l>And follow dying Poets by the scent.</l>
               <l>Ours gives himself for gone; y'have watch'd your time!</l>
               <l>He fights this day unarm'd; without his Rhyme.</l>
               <l>And brings a Tale which often has been told;</l>
               <l>As sad as <hi>Dido</hi>'s; and almost as old.</l>
               <l>His Heroe, whom you Wits his Bully call,</l>
               <l>Bates of his mettle; and scarce rants at all:</l>

               <l>Weeps much; fights little; but is wond'rous kind.</l>

               <l>I cou'd name more; A Wife, and Mistress too;</l>
               <l>Both (to be plain) too good for most of you:</l>
               <l>The Wife well-natur'd, and the Mistress true.</l>
               <l>Now, Poets, if your fame has been his care;</l>
               <l>Allow him all the Candour you can spare.</l>
               <l>A brave Man scorns to quarrel once a day;</l>
               <l>Like Hectors, in at every petty fray,</l>
               <l>Let those find fault whose Wit's so very small,</l>
               <l>They've need to show that they can think at all:</l>

               <l>And snatch the homely Rasher from the Coals:</l>
