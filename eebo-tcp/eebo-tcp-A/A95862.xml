         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Phyſician came, and the people flock'd about him, entreating him to uſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of his art: He viſited the patient, whom he found in his garden, all alone under a Plane tree, without either ſtockings or ſhooſe, with books before him intent at his ſtudy, haveing diſſected ſeveral ſorts of creatures which lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: Sir, ſaid <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> I am glad to ſee you ſo well employ'd, I pray to what end are all theſe diſſections? of late, anſwer'd he, I have been very curious to find out the true cauſes of Madneſs and Melancholy, and on this account it is that you ſee ſo many different Anatomies lie before me; Happy man, ſaid <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who can take to himſelf ſo much leaſure thus to contemplate the works of God and Nature: and are not you too that happy man who can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to your ſelf ſo much leaſure when you pleaſe, replied <hi>Democritus?</hi> I wiſh indeed I were, ſaid he; but how many concerns at home, how many affairs abroad of a quite different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture am I to look into and diſpatch for my ſelf

and others? this neighbour or that friend, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, or a complemental viſit, the health of this or the diſeaſes of that, a wedding on the one hand, or a funeral on the other, wife, children, ſervants, ſuch things as theſe take up the greateſt portions of my time: at the hearing of this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> ſo profuſely laughed, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſtartled at it, and aſk'd him the reaſon of it: can any man, ſays he, of reaſon forbear laughing at the contradictory vanities and abſurd humours of men? how emptie are they of wit and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and what a buſtle and ſtir do they make for gold? what end is there of their ambition? what infinite pains for a ſhort pageantrie, a little glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to acquire wealth or honour, tho their lifes are paid down in the purchaſe! ſome fancie an empire over dogs, and ſome over horſes, ſome are for governing their wives, if they can, and ſome for ruleing provinces. How many have even do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on their new brides, and yet ere long have forſaken them or wiſh'd them dead; and how many parents have given up their children to the worlds mercie, and yet by all means imaginable they muſt endeavour after wealth, tho when 'tis obtein'd 'tis not enjoyed, but either hoarded up or viciouſly ſpent, perverting that to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of body and torment of mind which is deſign'd to ſuſtein in the one &amp; ſolace the other: what truth, what Juſtice is to be found amongſt them? one pleads this and the other pleads that, they are going thurrow the world, and all the

When after this manner he had repreſented the ridiculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties that are every where to be found in the world, his Phyſician percieved that he had not to do with a ſick man; all his diſcourſe proveing ſo ſound and rational; Divine <hi>Democritus,</hi> ſaid he, ſurely all the world is mad but thee, and haveing took his leave of him, he declared to thoſe that had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Democritus</hi> to his care, that tho the Philoſopher appeared indeed ſomewhat negligent as to his attire and diet, yet that the world had not a more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, learned, or more generous ſpirited man than he, and that for the future any ones fancy to the contrarie ſhould be to him one certain ſign of that perſons not being in his right wits who concieved ſo. The fame of <hi>Democritus</hi> his learning afterwards grew very much in the world; his predictions of future things were wonderfull; and particularly his ſkill in Phyſiognomy rendred <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf an admirer of him; amidſt manie one famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance upon this account we may well take notice of; 'twas this; A Maid came to him one day, and he call'd her Virgin, ſhe came to him the next day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after, and he call'd her woman, and told her that he percieved ſhe had loſt her Maiden-head ſince ſhee had been laſt with him. He was honoured with great preſents and verie magnificent ſtatues: he protracted his death three days by ſmelling too hot breed; died near the 80th Olympiad, having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an 109 years; and had a very ſumptuous funeral at the public charge of the citizens.</p>

                  <head>To which 't was anſwered.</head>
                  <p>That if ingenuity conſiſted only in ſubtlety, there would be none in making a Coloſſus, in erecting glorious palaces, and contriveing the moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſtructures of the world, wherein ſurely there is far more than in little trinckets, which become uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by being too fine: and as he, that diſtinguiſhes pertinently in a diſpute, is reputed ingenious, ſo is he no leſs, who entangles the Reſpondent by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding things which ought to be ſeparated; and likewiſe in the practiſe of affairs, things too ſubtle paſs for Chimeras, and are never put in execution; nor is he to be accounted the beſt limner, that draws always only the fineſt ſtrokes: Much leſs probable is it, that the Choleric are more ingenious than the Melancholic, ſince reflection is ever neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the makeing of a ſolid concluſion, which the impatiencie of choler permits not; and indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there a man of great parts who was not thoughtfull, ſedate, and contemplative. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, northern people being more cold and reſerved, will, for a laſting ingenuity, carry it above other nations.</p>
                  <p>An other ſaid, that, conſidering nations, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that as not only the plants, but alſo the pearls and jewels of the eaſt, are more excellent and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151844:6"/>
purer than thoſe of other parts of the world, ſo alſo thejr witts: the reaſon whereof is, that the ſun com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the eaſt beſtows the firſt fruits of his own and other coeleſtial influences upon the orientals; which influences, like the impreſſion of perfumes, are moſt vigorous in their beginnings; and indeed here were the firſt law-givers and ſages of the world. As for temperaments the ſanguin have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; becauſe 'tis the moſt healthfull complexion, and health is the principal condition of a good wit, which cannot ſo well exert it ſelf in a ſick body. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, bloud is the proximate matter of ſpirits, and he that hath good bloud muſt have plenty of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and then likewiſe this is the complexion of the Amorous, who have been ever eſteem'd ingenious, whence that of the Poët, <hi>Quis fallere poſſit amantem?</hi> But if the queſtion be, what exerciſe or employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath the moſt ingenious people, 'tis harder to be determin'd; ſo great wits being found at this day of all ſorts of profeſſions, that 'tis difficult to judg of which there are moſt; Some prefer Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick divines for their nice diſputes, looking upon it as admirable how myſterious their Philoſophie is, rendering it intricate by explications, and difficult by the aperture and diſſolution of diſtinctions. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the rational Phyſicians, for their diſcourſes and conjectures upon the cauſes of hidden diſeaſes; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Mathematicians, for their curious ſearches into heaven it ſelf; or the Lawyers, who manage their affairs ſo advantageouſly above others to their own intreſt.</p>
                  <p>The third ſayd, that abſolutely ſpeaking there is no quarrer of the world more oriental or occidental than an other; theſe words having been invented only in reſpect to men themſelvs, (to ſome of whom one and the ſame people is oriental, and yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151844:7"/>
occidental to others) ſince the world is round, and all the parts of a ſphear are of the ſame nature. What differences there are, muſt be taken from ſomthing els than the four parts of the world; more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from cold and heat: thus they that live under the Poles are of a different complexion both of body and mind from thoſe that are between the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, and according to this difference the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the temperate zones muſt be moſt ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Cold being too much an enemy to life, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance wit; and exceſſive heat burns the humors no leſs both within and without, as the wooly hair, and black ſkin of the nations expos'd to it manifeſt. So that 'tis no preſumption in nations of a temperate climate, to award the preheminence to themſelvs in this matter; operations of the mind as well as the digeſtions and other operations of the body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireing a temperate, not an exceſſive heat.</p>
                  <p>The fourth ſpake his ſentiments thus: Since there are good and bad, ingenious and fools in all lands, to be the one or the other, depends not on the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; heaven, from whence the ſoul deſcends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a like in all places; nor is it likely that profeſſions render men more or leſs ingenious, ſince thoſe to which people are lead by natural inclination, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects than cauſes of good or bad parts; as for thoſe to which we are perſwaded or forc'd, nothing can be inferr'd from them, haveing no affinity with our nature; laſtly, nor doth temper always contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to render men ingenious, ſince there are ſome ſo of all tempers, ages and ſexes. The true cauſe is the proportion which happens to be between the ſoul and the body at the firſt conformation; whence the ſureſt ſigns, natural, of good or bad parts are taken from the figure of the body, chiefly of the head, which if ſharp never makes a wiſe man, as on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151844:7"/>
the contrary, large heads and broad fore-heads are good indications of ingenuity, in whomſoever, of what ever country, vocation and temper they may be. But yet, ſayd <hi>Democritus,</hi> I cannot but hold the lawyers in their way, to be the moſt ingenious of the world, for that generally recieved truth, which ſays, that what ever hath a begining, hath alſo an end, is confuted by them, ſince they render ſuits immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and inſtead of the four cauſes taught by natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, they create others without numbet; and in ſpight of the maxim which ſays there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> they make one, at lencth, in the purſes of their cliens.</p>
                  <p>Two perſons being together in the feild about to leap over a ditch, hold ſays one, look before you leap, I was juſt a ſaying ſo, ſays the other, why then good wits jump, ſays he, and ſo away they leapt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> with all his oratory and reaſon could not keep the people from mutinying, even while he was ſpeaking; at laſt he bethought himſelf to divert them with a ſtrange ſtory, and 'twas this: There was a man that hired an aſs, to carry him a journey, and the owner of the aſs was to attend him on foot by, it ſo fell out that before the journey was half finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſun ſhined ſo exceſſively hot, that it grew ſo intollerable to the rider, that he was glad to quitt the aſſes back, and betake him to her ſhadow: upon this the owner of the aſs withſtood him, telling him that he muſt ride on, alledging that tho he had hired the body of the aſs, he had not hired the ſhadow, that was not in the bargain, but the owners ſtill, much buſtle there was between them, till at laſt the contention grew even as hot as the ſun it ſelf. This diverſion prevaled more than all his eloquence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151844:8"/>
and appeas'd their anger when his whole ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not.</p>
                  <p>A female Citizen ſufficiently ignorant in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try affairs being told, that malt did not grow, aſk'd how it came? anſwer was made, that the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the country ſpin'd it, upon my word, ſayd ſhe, I thought ſo, for one may ſee the very threds hang out at the end of it.</p>
                  <p>There was ſo great a Sedition at Rome, that the common people all left the city, retireing from it with a reſolution uot to return, unleſs the Senat and the rich citizens would take off the taxes, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, by which the meaner thought themſelvs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much oppres'd: <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> an eloquent man was ſent to them, who with the following A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologue or Fable prevaled more than by all other ways of perſwaſion whatſoever. Upon a time there aroſe, ſayd he, great ſtrife and ſedition amongſt the other members of the bodie againſt the bellie: the eyes, ears, hands, feet and tongue, all ſaid, they, each of them, performed their ſeveral offices to the bodie: but the bellie alone doing nothing at all, as a king enjoyed their labours, and conſumed upon it ſelf all thoſe things, which were purchaſed with their ſweat and induſtrie. The Bellie could not but confeſs theſe things were true, and if it pleaſed them for the time to come they ſhould allow it nothing. The Members decreed it among themſelvs, that nothing ſhould be given to the bellie: when this had been for a little time, the hands and feet loſt their ſtrength, and all the other members became dull, ſick, and immoveable: ſo that at laſt they percieved that the food allowed to the bellie, was of as equal advantage to all the reſt of the members, as to it ſelf, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their former obedience: And ſo did the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151844:8"/>
people of Rome too, being hereby ſufficientlie ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that what was repoſed in their Magiſtrates hands, did at laſt tend to the intreſt of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal.</p>
                  <p>The Gold-ſmiths of London had a cuſtom once a year to weigh gold in the ſtar-chamber, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the privie council, and the Kings Attorney general; this ſolemn weighing by a word of art they call'd the Pixe, and made uſe of ſo exact ſcales there in, that the maſter of the companie affirmed, that they would turn with the two hundereth part of a grain, I ſhould be loath, ſaid Attorney Noy, that all my actions ſhould be weighed in thoſe ſcales.</p>
                  <p>The King of France being at Calais ſent over an Embaſſador, a verie tall perſon, upon no other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, but a complement to the King of England, at his audience he appeard in ſuch a light garb, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the king aſk'd lord keeper <hi>Bacon,</hi> what he thought of the French Embaſſador, he anſwer'd, that he was a verie proper man; I, his Majeſtie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, but what think you of his head-piece, is he a proper man for the office of an Embaſſador, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd he, it appears too often, that tall men are like high houſes of four or five ſtories, wherein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie the uppermoſt room is worſt furniſhed.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151844:9"/>
thc chief chymiſt told them that the word labour ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified that they ſhould lay aſide Alchymie, and betake themſelvs to ſom honeſt art of employment, and that it appear'd the part of men purely maz'd and mad to fancy the making of gold in ſuch a ſmall ſpace of time, ſince nature it ſelf is wont to ſpend more than a thouſand years about it.</p>
                  <p>In time of war a certain Prince, being very vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, would, on horſs-back, himſelf go the rounds one night: upon a ſuddain a ſouldier met him, who being fudl'd, immediatly laid hold on the bridle of his horſe, and aſk'd the price of him, for at preſent, he ſaid, he wanted an horſe: the Prince percieving in what condition he was in, caus'd him to be taken into an houſe, and put to bed: in the morning the Prince ſent for him, and aſk'd him what he would give for his horſe; Sir, ſaid the recover'd ſouldier, the merchant that would have bought him yeſter night, went away betimes this morning.</p>

                  <p>One aſk'd a noble Sea-captain, why, haveing means ſufficient to live upon the land, he would yet endanger his perſon upon the ocean? he told him that he had a natural inclination to it, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could divert him: I pray, ſaid the other, where did your father die? at ſea, ſaid the captain; and where your grand-father? at ſea too, ſaid he, why then, ſaid the other, are not you afraid to go to ſea?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151844:9"/>
before I anſwer you, ſaid the Captain, I pray tell me where died your father? my father, ſaid he, died in his bed: and where your grand-father? in his bed too, ſaid he: and are not you then, ſaid the Captain, afraid to go to bed?</p>
                  <p>A Souldier in Ireland having got his paſs-port to go for England, as he went through a wood with a knap-ſack on his back, being weary; he ſate down and fell to ſome victuals, upon a ſuddain he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with two or three wolves, who coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he threw them ſcraps of bread and cheeſs ſo long till all was don; then the wolves coming nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to him, he knew not what ſhift to make; he took a pair of bag-pipes, which he had with him; and ſo ſoon as he began to play, away ran the wolves, as if they had bin ſcared out of their wits: a pox take you all, ſaid he, if I had known that you had lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved muſick ſo well, you ſhould have had it before dinner.</p>

My Lord, ſaid <hi>John,</hi> I was ſworn to ſpeak the truth, and all the truth, and I am reſolved to do it: and ſo went on: Theſe two Gentlemen aſked for a room, and I ſhewed them up into the green chamber, it was two ſtories high, upon the left hand as ſoon as you are up two pair of ſtairs. <hi>Honeſt John,</hi> ſaid my Lord, if thou art ſo called, trouble us not with theſe impertinences, but come to the matter. I am about it, quoth <hi>John,</hi> and ſo proceeds: As ſoon as they were in the room, they ſaid unto me, now <hi>honest John</hi> bring us up a pint of the beſt Canary, which I did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was of the furthermoſt pipe but one in all our cellar, and we had no better wine in all the houſe; it coſt my maſter four and twenty pound the pipe: as I was going up the ſtairs, my maſter called to me, and aſked me whether I was carrying up that pint of wine, and I told him to the two Gentlemen. <hi>John,</hi> ſaid my Lord, that is not the queſtion I aſked you, but what paſſed between theſe two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? I ſhall tell you, quoth <hi>John,</hi> preſently: When I had carried them up the wine, and that they had taſted of it, they told me that I was as good as my word, and that it was of the beſt Canary. But, ſaid my Lord, what is this to the purpoſe? Yes, ſaid <hi>John,</hi> it is to the purpoſe, and if your Lordſhip plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to come thither at any time, I ſhall draw ye of the ſame wine, and then you will ſay that <hi>honest Iohns</hi> words were true indeed. My Lord ſeeing no good to be done with <hi>Iohn,</hi> bid them ſet him aſide, which <hi>Iohn</hi> took in very great dudgeon, profeſſing he had ſpoken nothing but the truth, neither durſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151844:23"/>
he ſpeak any thing but what was true, his maſter bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him before he came to have a ſpecial care of what he ſaid. After ſome other witneſſes being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, the Councel on the Plantiffs ſide began to ſpeak in the name of his client, (as the uſual cuſtom is) ſaying, My Lord, we came into this tavern with a peaceable intention, only to drink a pint of wine with that Gentleman, where we were by him abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, beaten and miſuſed, and put in danger of our life. <hi>Iohn</hi> hearing him to ſay ſo, could forbear no longer, but ſtepping up, ſaid, My Lord, that fellow with the Coife there tells a moſt damnable lie, for he ſays he was beaten and miſuſed in our houſe, when (I can juſtifie) that he never was in our houſe in all his life.</p>

No, ſaid the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the tell-tale, did not you ſay he was a great player at cards? Yes, and pleaſe your Worſhip, quoth he, he is ſo, and ſo addicted to them, that he ſeldom goes without a pair in his pocket. Upon theſe words the Gentleman commanded his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets to be ſearched, wherein was a pair found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. What is this? ſaid the Gentleman, did not you ſay you knew not cards? then pray what things are theſe? O that, quoth the man, is my Almanack, which I carrie continually about with me. Pray, ſaid the Gentleman, make it appear how theſe cards can be an Almanack. Why thus Sir, ſaid the man; there are in theſe things, you call cards, as many ſuits as there are Quarters in the year, as many cards as there are Weeks in the year, as many court-cards as there are Months in the year, and as many ſpots as there are Days in the year. And is this, ſaid the Gentleman, all the uſe that you make of them? No, quoth the ſervant, I have more uſes of them than theſe; for when I look upon the King, it puts me in mind of the allegiance that I ow to my ſoveraign Lord the King; looking upon the Queen, puts me in mind of the like allegiance that I ow to the Queen; the Ten puts me in mind of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; the Nine, of the nine Muſes; the

Haveing undreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he pulls off his Perriwig, and ſets it upon a ſtool by him, which the maid percieving, verily i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined that he had pulled off his head, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited ſhe was of it, that ſhe ran down to her Dame, telling her, that the Gentleman, who lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, was no other than an arrant conjurer, for ſhe ſaw him with her own eyes to pull off his head, and ſet it upon the ſtool by him, and if ſhe doubted any thing of the truth thereof, if ſhe would go up ſhe might ſee it ſtanding there at that preſent. Her Dame, though ſomething a nullifidian of what ſhe heard, yet to ſatisfie her maids curioſitie, went up, where peeping likewiſe in at the hole, and ſeeing it upon the ſtool, ſhe was then of the ſame opinion with her maid; and ſo fearfull they were both there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that neither of them durſt fetch the candle, but the Gentleman was forced to put it out himſelf.

judging that bad weather to proceed from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, and expecting yet worſs: but when in the morning they ſaw all fair, and a ſerene ſky, they changed their opinion, and that though he was a conjurer, yet that now he would do no more harm: Whilſt they were now entered into this good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him, one of her neighbours came in, who had loſt a horſe, whom he judged to be ſtole, for which he made a great complaint: Hold your peace, ſaid ſhe, I can tell you a way which I warrant you will fetch your horſe again: We have a conjurer that is now lodged in our houſe, who for half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of beer, I queſtion not but will do your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and therewithal ſhe went up to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, acquainting him with her neighbours loſs, and deſireing his aſſiſtance for the gaining him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for, ſaid ſhe, I know you have ſkill in the <hi>black Art,</hi> my maid and I ſeeing your head laſt night up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtool, when as the reſt of your bodie was gon to bed. The Gentleman percieving her folly in her grand miſtake, and willing to have ſome mirth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his wet journey, told her, that for her ſake he would do his beſt endeavour for her neighbour; and that when he was readie, he would raiſe a <hi>Spirit</hi> which ſhould quickly tell him where the horſe was. The woman overjoyed at theſe words, ran down and told her neighbour that he ſhould have his horſe again within an hour, and that if he would ſtay ſo long, he ſhould ſee him come galloping to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in a full carriere: This news pleaſed the fellow ſo well, that he reſolved to ſtay. In the mean time the Gentleman was conſulting with him ſelf how to bring his purpoſe the beſt way to effect; in order thereto, he told his boy that he muſt act the part of a Devil; and to perſonate him the better, Whilſt I am gon down, ſaid he, to ſpeak with him about the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:151844:31"/>
buſineſs, do you turn your coat the wrong-ſide out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and creep under the bed, where you muſt lie till I ſpeak theſe words, <hi>Elhavareuna, Phonſontho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohia, Heidon cus Towronus Dungeonis Keptoribus;</hi> then do you come forth from under the bed, and make as hideous a noiſe with your mouth as you can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The boy promiſed to do as he bad him: and when his maſter was gon down, he went about his buſineſs; but remembring with him ſelf, that in the chamber where he lodged, there lay a raw bulls-hide left there by ſome butcher, thought that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonate the Devil far better than his coat; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſuddenly fetched it, and wrapped himſelf therein, with the horns appearing juſt over his head; which haveing don, he crope under the bed, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the event: ſoon after he was fixt, came up his maſter, the dame, the maid, and the fellow that had loſt his horſe; when the Gentleman haveing a chalk-ſtone in his hand, marked them everie one out a circle; then placeing them therein, he bid them not to ſtir out of them whatſoever they ſaw: ſo pulling a book out of his pocket, he began to read ſome hard uncouth names, and at laſt came to thoſe words, <hi>Elhavareuna,</hi> &amp;c. when the boy made his appearance from under the bed, with a great pair of horns and a bellowing noiſe: his maſter, who knew not of his boys new invention for acting the devil, ſeeing ſuch a hideous thing to appear, thought it had been the Devil indeed, who had come to have puniſht him for undertakeing to conjure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ran as faſt as he could drive, makeing but one ſtep from the top of the ſtairs to the bottom: the women and the man ſeeing the Gentleman to run, thought likewiſe the Devil was come to fetch them for being ſpectators, and thereupon ran as faſt as he, tumbling down the ſtairs one upon the neck

of another: the boy ſeeing them all to run in ſuch diſorder, thought alſo that the Devil was indeed come for him for acting his part, and therefore he began to throw off his coverture; but he had before ſo faſtened it unto him, that ſeeing he could not pull it off, he ran with it on, when coming to the top of the ſtairs, the hide ſo wrapped about his legs, as threw him from the top to the bottom amongſt them, when they hearing the horns to make a clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, ſo ſhrieked and bellowed as if the Devil had been amongſt them indeed.

back to bed with her, although as it ſeem'd ſhe had rather to have had his room than his companie; for no ſooner was he gon, but his place was ſupplied by another, whom ſhe loved more dearly, his next neighbour, who by trade was a Grocer. It happened one morning, that the Carpenter went forth as he was accuſtomed; but before his place was cold, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other was gotten therein: he had not gon a quarter of a mile, but there fell ſuch a ſtorm of rain, with likelihood of continuance, tht he returned back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and drawing the latch, went into the houſe: which the Grocer hearing crope out of the bed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath it as faſt as he could.

               <p>Within one of the Provinces of the <hi>United Neatherlands</hi> there lived a Mercenary Scribler, who wrote a Paſquil, or Defamatory Libel againſt the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and preſented it to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſame place, which was a perſon of the

               <p>A Nobleman of France did very lately fall in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve with a Citizens Wife of Paris, and left no means unattempted till he had made her all compliance: This Lord being one day at Court ſaw the Husband of this Female Friend come into the Palace Royal, and by enquiry found that his buſineſs would not quickly be diſpatcht, whereupon away he ſlunk out of the Court, and got privately (as he thought) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of this Citizen, but it ſeems he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by this Citizens Brother, who deteſted the debauchery of his Siſter, and therefore preſently diſpatcht away a Meſſenger to Court to acquaint
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:151844:93"/>
his Brother what unhappily he had diſcovered. The Citizen preſently takes his Alarm, and thinking his feet too ſlow, took Coach and drove <hi>Jehu</hi>like, to hinder what was allready paſt prevention. His Wife hearing a Coach come in that Furious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to her door, imagin'd ſhe was betray'd, and therefore adviſed the Lord that was in bed with her to riſe and abſcond himſelf in a place ſhe had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in caſe any ſuch diſcovery ſhould happen: hearing as he thought ſome body coming up ſtairs, for haſt left his Cloaths on the bed, which ſhee ſeeing, in as great haſte and confuſion, threw them into a Cheſt, but ſo unadviſedly, that the embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſleeve of the Doublet hung ôut, of which ſhe took no notice, but fell to dreſſing her ſelf as little concern'd, as if ſhe had no more harm in her than in a little Female Devil newly arrived at the Teens. Her Husband entring the Chamber, ſaid, <hi>Madam,</hi> I underſtanding that my Lord came to viſit you this morning, I thought he might alſo have ſome buſineſs of great importance to whiſper in my ear, and this made me return ſooner than you expected. The Gentlewoman confidently replyed, that he was miſ-informed, for there had no body been with her that day. Her Husband looking about the Room eſpied the Lords embroydered ſleeve hang out of the Cheſt, and ask't whoſe it was, and how it came thither, this ſubtle Woman, who like the reſt of her ſex, never wants an excuſe in time of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, replyed, (but trembling) Sweet heart, I beg your pardon, for my forgetfulneſs; A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, wanting money brought it me to ſhew you, deſiring to have but forty Crowns lent upon it; let mee ſee it (ſaid he) and looking upon it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knew whoſe it was, and without diſcovering any paſſion, pull'ed off his own Coat, and put on

that Embroydered with Gold; when he had ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, come come ſaid he, I muſt examin your War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drobe, and looking into the Cheſt found what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaïn'd thereunto, as Hat, Cravat, Breeches, &amp;c. which he took up and habited himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with from top to toe; being thus gallantly, nay, nobly attired, he ſtruts to and fro the Chamber, admiring himſelf in his Walk, and when he had left off adoreing himſelf, ſaid he, now prethee Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe tell me, don't I look like a Lord? have not I his very Mein? I cannot believe but I am one now; do thou believe ſo to, and we ſhall hug one the other oftner; but all this while I pitty the poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that owns them, for doubtleſs he hath been at Play to Night, and loſing all, is forced to depoſit his Garments, and is it may be now acold for his heat of Fancy. This Noble-man being in a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge confuſion, knew not what to do, nor ſay; at length collecting a little courage, ſhe had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to ſay, Sir, you ſtrangely impoſe upon me; for why is it not as Lawful for me to go to the Court of Aids, as for you to go ſo often to the Exchange? No, replyed he, ſince you have fitted me for the <hi>Court,</hi> I'le no more to the <hi>Exchange;</hi> and thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon inſtantly went down ſtairs, and calling for a Coach, ordered the Coach-man to drive him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to the <hi>Palace Royal,</hi> where diſmounting, he betook himſelf to the long Gallery, where the Nobility uſually frequented, at his approach, the Eyes of all the Court were upon him, every one wondering what this Fine thing ſhould be, after ſeveral opinions were ſpent upon him, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the moſt, that as he was a ſtranger, he could by his habit be no leſs than a Nobleman; at length a Courtier, drawing near to Careſs and Complement this Noble ſtranger, looking ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly

in his face, knew him, and cryed out aloud, O the Devil, is it you Mr. Coquelineux; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon made all the haſte from him he could to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Majeſty firſt, of a ſtrange ſight was newly come to Court, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Mercer</hi> as fine as any Lord. His Majeſty commanded him to be brought in, which was as the other deſigned and deſired. At firſt ſight the King knew the Perſon, and to whom tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe fine Cloathes properly belong'd, and was ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely ſurprized at the ſight of both ſo improperly conjoyn'd. At length ſays the King, <hi>Coquelineux,</hi> prythee thy meaning for this thy phantaſtical ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: wouldſt thou by this Garb (becauſe I am in thy Books) perſwade me to make thee what thou doſt perſonate?

The <hi>Mercer</hi> heard his Majeſty with great attention, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an Anſwer was expected, replyed, May it pleaſe your Majeſty, my intent of coming hither, was to no other end then to reſtore to the right ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner his due. This ſplendid Suit with the appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances I found in my Wives Chamber, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered where ſhe had laid them by the ſleeve of this embroydered Coat hanging out of the Cheſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly: upon a full view, I askt whoſe they were; ſhe very ingeniouſly told me, A Gentlewoman brought them to her to ſhew to me, to know how much I would lend upon them, but I miſtruſting they may be ſtoln from ſome perſon of Quality, thought fit to put them on, and walk publickly at Court, for by that means the right owner may come to a better knowledg of his goods by ſight, than any diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The King could not forbear laughing hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee ſo much ſeeming honeſty, and ſimplicity
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:151844:94"/>

               <head>A French Noble-man Cuckolded by his Servants,</head>
               <p>IT is cuſtomary among the Nobility, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of great quality in <hi>France</hi> to lye in Chambers apart from thoſe of their Ladies. Now there was a Lord (ſhall be at preſent nameleſs) who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Lady was as eminent a Beauty as moſt was in <hi>France,</hi> yet he muſt (forſooth) follow the humour of the Countrey; now when at any time he had a deſire to enjoy the ſweet embraces of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely conſort, riſing from his own bed he would ſteal out in the dark in his Shirt, making no noiſe, and knocking at his Ladies Chamber dore ſoftly, ſhe knowing his cuſtome gave him admittance; now beſides the Mode, he had another reaſon (as he ſaid) to approve thereof, becauſe it lookt ſo like whoring. Having performed the neceſſary and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging duty of the Marriage Bed, he returned to his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:151844:95"/>
own Chamber there to ſpend the reſidue of the Night in an undiſturbed repoſe. One of this Lord's <hi>Valet de Chambre's</hi> taking notice of this humour, concluded that he might have the ſame admittance into his Ladies Chamber, and participate of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Pleaſures by the ſame means his Maſters humour had inculcated into his thoughts. Upon a ſerious conſultation with himſelf, he concluded that Night beſt for the accompliſhing his Deſign, in which his Maſter had viſited his Lady; about an hour after he reſolved to put his luſtful Project in Practice; which he did ſo well by imitation that he got entrance: Your own thoughts may inform you how they ſpent the time, without my putting the modeſt to the extravagant expence of bluſhes. All I ſhall ſay is, That this Fellow performed his part ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly and ſo often, that when he went from her, he left her all wonder and amazement: and that which encreas'd her <hi>admiration</hi> was not only his profound ſilence, although ſhe urged him to ſpeak to her with all the melting Rhetorick ſhe could deviſe, but the coming of her busband twice as ſhe ſuppoſed; whilſt ſhe was thus ruminating with her ſelf being left alone, her Husband ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated more than ordinary by ſome provocatives he had taken the day before, comes and with his acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed knock and whisper demanded entrance, ſhe knowing her Lords voice aroſe and let him in; as he was about to proſecute his accuſtomed enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Lady begg'd him to forbear, urging that he was much to blame to be ſo inordinate in his deſires: what (ſaid ſhe) Could not you my Lord (ſince you find ſo great an alteration) be content to have out done your ſelf this night by ſo many repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, but that you muſt again expoſe your body; to the injury of the cold in ſo ſhort a time again
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:151844:96"/>
and coming a third time, in leſs than two hours? Nay, nay ſweet-heart this is but twice, you wrong me indeed ſaid he: To which ſhe replyed, That ſhe was not miſtaken, for aſſuredly it was ſo often. Hereupon this Gentleman began to pauſe upon it; and from what he had already heard and gathered from other circumſtances he verily believed that he had been abuſed by one of his Servants; but kept all cloſe from his Lady (for ſhe was a vertuous Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewoman) to avoid the ill conſequences ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery might produce. Having laid a while (in which time he ſtudied to divert his Lady as he could) he got up, and being come into his own Chamber he could not reſt there long, but putting on his Breeches and a Gown went into all his Male ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Chambers that were about him, making, along as he went, a ſtrict enquiry with his Noſe in every Bed, for it ſeems this Lady was well ſented. There was one of whom he at length might have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me grounds of ſuſpition; becanſe, beſides his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection which never fail'd of ardent inclination to the Female Sex, he was both a handſome and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubtle Fellow, but he could not tell which Bed he lay in; by chance groping up and down in the dark he found his Bed, and pulling up the Cloathes ſmelt a perfume he was very well acquainted with; and from thence judged this muſt be the Rogue that had done him this diſhonour; wherefore that he might be ſure to know him the next day, he took out of his Pocket a pair of Sizers, and ſnipt off one of his Whiskers, for then it was the Faſhion to we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar them. This Fellow was awke, and by this knew very well his Maſter, and his Deſign, firſt by ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and then by marking him, that he might be known the next day, to prevent which as ſoon as his Maſter was gone, he inſtantly ſtarts up; and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:151844:96"/>
going into all the Chambers aforeſaid, cuts off (from every one that had any) that Whisker that was on the ſame ſide of the Mouth that his was on, and returns to his own Bed. The Servants getting up next morning, and ſeeing each others right Whisker gone, ſtood ſtaring one upon another li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſo many diſtracted Bedlamites, not knowing what to ſay, or whom to accuſe. In ſhort, one that was known ſufficiently to be an arch Rogue was ſuſpected, and thereupon ſome of the more paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fell upon him and abuſed him moſt pitifully, others took his part, by which means they were all engaged by the Ears; at the noiſe hereof the whole Houſe was alarmed, and running to ſee what was the matter, they were ſo ſurprized with the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneſs of ſuch a Comical ſight, that laying aſide all reſpect to their Lord and Lady, they laught beyond meaſure. Sure it muſt be very pleaſant to ſee two ſuch contrary Paſſions, in one entire Company, proceeding from one and the ſame cauſe. Theſe poor <hi>Semi-barbarians</hi> finding themſelves laught at by their fellows, whom they obſerved not ſo abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as they were, imagining them the Plotters of this miſchief, and without examining whether it was ſo or no, diverted the quarrel among themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves upon the others. Now did the Combat begin afreſh, with more eagerneſs than before, which cauſed one to run and tell the Lord, that there was a Civil War Commenced among his Servants, and that if he came not quickly and decided the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie their fury would utterly leave him deſtitute of his preſent Attendance. Hereupon his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip commanded a Ceſſation of Arms, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded they ſhould come before him; and having cleanſed themſelves from the Blood, each Face by Fighting had contracted; (for as they then were,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:151844:97"/>
one Face could hardly be diſtinguiſht from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) they appeared before their Lord in the great Hall. In the mean time he ordered his Lady to be there. Upon the appearance of the men, my Lord and Lady were poſſeſt with the ſame different Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as their Servants were; for the firſt was in a Fury to ſee that Traitor who had abuſed him; whilſt the other fell into the greateſt laughter imaginable; after a little time the half Whiskers made a bitter complaint againſt the whole whiſkers, as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury they had ſuſtained in the abuſe of their beards; the Defendants alledged that they were guiltleſs of the Fact, and that for their good will in coming to part them they were Aſſaulted by them. To end the Controverſie, in ſhort, ſaid my Lord, it was I that cut off one Whisker, whoſoever is the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof I will have his Head off too for an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable injury he hath done me; their former paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was now converted into another of that for fear, ſo that now their Knees wag'd more then their Hands before; look here (ſaid my Lord) whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Whisker matcheth this in Colour, he is the Subject of my revenge. Hereupon Carrats fell on his knees, and beg'd his Pardon, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the whole Truth; for this witty indeavour of concealment he gave him his Life with the loſs of his Ears, and delivered him over to the abuſed <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miwhiskers</hi> who got a blanket and toſt him ſo long in Revenge, that they had like to toſt his bones out of his skin, as well as him out of his Lordſhips ſervice.</p>

When they had chatted their fill, to Supper we went, which finiſht, a Banquet ſucceeded, raviſhing both to Eye and Palat. This ended, one comes in, and whiſpering the Lady in the Ear, ſhe inſtantly chang'd Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and cry'd out, ſhe was undone for ever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I did her one friendly Office, which ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally engage her to me; having told her, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired no greater honour than to dye in her Service, ſhe then inform'd me, that the old <hi>Count</hi> her Husband was returned, and newly gone to Bed being very weary and expected her coming.

               <p>A few days after this new married Gentleman got his (ſuppoſed Maiden) Wife into his company, and having repeated his former delights, he told her, he would go into the Country, giving her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections where to ſend to him, and that if ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Child, and that her Parents ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, as that they would quickly do, that then ſhe ſhould diſſemble the greateſt grief imaginable, and when preſſed very much to diſcover the Father, ſhe ſhould then confeſs it was ſuch a one, who had formerly made Love to her but her Parents would not accept of the Motion; as for the reſt ſaid he, leave the whole management to me.</p>

him of the ſhame and Infamy that had befallen his Family, and by whom; this unexpected news ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de him ten times madder than his Wife; but at length they both concluded that it was but a folly, either to rave or rail at their Daughter, but to ſtudy ſome means to ſauder up the rack of their Daughters Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. No better expedient was thought on, but to write to the Gentleman and acquaint him with what he had don, requiring ſatisfaction; this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſent, and another returned by him in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereunto; to this effect, <hi>That it is true he had lain with their Daughter, but he knew not whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her he got her with Child, for ſhe that can diſpence with being a Whore to one, will be ſo to another.</hi> In ſhort he concluded, that he had no more to ſay than this, <hi>That if ſhe would be ſo impudent, to lay the Child to him he muſt maintain it, but as for her part, he had nothing to ſay to her, for he had already over-paid her that little pleaſure, he had purch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſed of her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This return netled them to the heart, and they ſho'wd it their Daugter with all the opprobrums that can be uttered.

He ſent them word, that he had extraordinary buſinefs where he was, and that he neither could, or would ſtir from it.

               <p>Yet upon another conſultation the Daughter told her Father, that before ever ſhe conſented he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her Marriage; this made the old Gentleman

               <p>The old man was all amazement, to hear what ere he ſaid at home in private ſhould be known abroad; at length he collecting himſelf, and having ſomewhat calm'd his paſſion, he told the young man ſince he ſaw the Stars did fight againſt him as to this Marriage, he ſhould have his Daughter, condit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionally he would tell him how he came by this ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge intelligence, whether the Devil, or his Angels did aſſiſt him in it, &amp;c. To this the young man replyed, That he came not to the knowledge of what he ſaid ſecretly elſewhere, nor his Daughter, but by humane means, and that he would tell him how, ſo be it he would for give the Perſon. No, no,

            <head>A PREACHMENT ON MALT.</head>
            <p>CErtain Townſmen of <hi>Priſal,</hi> returning from a merry Meeting at a certain Ale-houſe, met in the Fields a Preacher, who had lately made a bitter Sermon againſt Drunkards, and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opprobrimous words, called them Malt-worms, Wherefore they agreed to take him, and by violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce compel him to Preach a Sermon, and his Text ſhould be <hi>MALT:</hi> The Preacher thinking it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to yield, than contend with them in their cauſe, began his Sermon as followeth.</p>
            <p>There is no Preaching without Diviſion, and this Text cannot well be divided into many parts, becauſe it is but one word, nor into many Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, becauſe it is but one Syllable; It muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be divided into Letters, and they are found to be four, <hi>viz. M, A, L, T,</hi> Theſe letters repreſent four interpretations, which Divines commonly do uſe thus, M. Moral, A. Allegorical, L. Literal, T. Tropological.</p>
            <p>The Moral Interpretation is well put firſt, and firſt to teach you boyſterous Men ſome good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, at leaſt in procuring your attention to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; Therefore M. Maſters, A. All, L. Liſten, T. to the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:151844:109"/>
An Allegory is when one thing is ſpoken, and another thing meant; The thing ſpoken is Malt, the thing meant is the Oyle of Malt, commonly call'd Ale, which to you Drunkards is ſo precious, that you account it to he M. Meat, A. Ale, L. Liberty, T. Treaſure.</p>
            <p>The literal ſenſe is as it hath been often heard of heretofore, ſo it is true according to the letter, M. Much A. Ale, L. Little, T. Thrift. The Tropological ſence applyeth that which now is to ſomwhat following, either in this world, or in the world to come, the thing that now is, is the effect which Oyle of Malt produceth and worketh in ſome of you, <hi>viz.</hi> M. Murther, in others, A. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, in all L. Looſe living, in many T. Treaſon, and that which hereafter followeth, both in this world and in the world to come, is M. Miſery, A. Anguiſh, L. Lamentation, T. Trouble.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now come to a concluſion, and withal, to perſwade you boyſterious men to amend, that ſo you may eſcape the danger whereinto many of you are like to fall, but I have no hopes to prevail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I plainly ſee, and my Text as plainly telleth me it is M. to A. that is, a Thouſand Pound to a Pot of Ale you will never mend, becauſe all Drunkards are L. Lewd, T. Thieves, but yet for diſcharging my Conſcience and duty, Firſt towards God, and Secondly towards you my Neighbouts, I ſay once again, concluding with my Text, M. Mend, A. All, and L. Leave, T. Tipling, otherwiſe, M. Maſters, A. All, L. Look for, T. Terrour and Torment.</p>
            <p>By this time the Ale wrought in the Townſmens Brains that they were between Hawk and Buzzard, nearer ſleeping than waking, which the Preacher perceiving ſtole away, Leaving them to take their Nap.</p>
