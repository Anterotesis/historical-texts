            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AMong the Curiosities of This Latter Age, the <hi>Invention</hi> of Transmitting unto After-Times the <hi>Apothegms,</hi> and <hi>Sayings</hi> of Men Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in their Generations, with a <hi>[He being Dead yet Speaketh]</hi> for the <hi>Motto;</hi> is, in my Opinion, not the least Considerable. This is the Sweet Oyntment that has Perfum'd the Memory of the <hi>Late Kings Judges,</hi> the Sufferers of the <hi>Kirk Militant,</hi> and the whole Band of <hi>Covenanted Martyrs,</hi> that have Finished their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, on the wrong Side of the Pale. What a Comfort is it for a Man, in the Contemplation of his Future State, to say with the Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter, (Saints Everlasting Rest,</hi> pag. <hi>100.</hi>) <hi>Then shall ye be with</hi> Pym, <hi>and</hi> White, <hi>&amp;c. Your Names</hi> shall be Chanted with <hi>Their Names, Your Sayings</hi> Recorded with <hi>Their Sayings,</hi> &amp;c. This Din may do well enough when a Man's Bones are laid, and his Head past Aking: But to see my Self <hi>Embalm'd</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58696:3"/>
before <hi>My Time,</hi> and <hi>Serenaded,</hi> with Mr. Roger L' Estrange's Sayings, <hi>with Brief Notes to prevent Mis-apprehensions,</hi> &amp;c. It looks methinks like the Inviting a Man to his own Funeral: And in few Words, I was not so very Hasty, but I could have waited, till the Complement might have come on in due Season.</p>
            <p>This is precisely the <hi>Seven and Thirty'th</hi> Civility of This Kind, that I have Received, within less than Two Months, from the <hi>True Protestant Dissenters:</hi> Which truly I look upon but as so many empty Casks thrown out to divert me from sinking the Rotten Barque they are Engag'd in. These Learned Pieces, I know very well, are Compos'd, and Publish'd at the <hi>Charge,</hi> and for the <hi>Service</hi> of our <hi>Ignatian Society:</hi> So that I cannot pitch upon a more suitable way of Acknowledgment, than to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>SAYINGS</hi> to <hi>SAYINGS</hi>; the <hi>Dissenters Sayings</hi> to <hi>L'Estrange</hi>'s <hi>Sayings,</hi> fairly and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Reported; and in such manner Digested, and Dispos'd, that the <hi>Reader</hi> shall find every Article of the Subject in Question, unanswerably Refuted by their Own Lips and Pens: <hi>Conscience</hi> Fighting against <hi>Conscience, Text</hi> against <hi>Text, Practice</hi> against <hi>Pretense</hi>; and the whole Meddling Party, from One End of the Controversy to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, laying violent Hands upon Themselves. So that there shall need no Other Plea for the Government, than the very Arguments of those that Contend so eagerly against it; Every Party still as it was <hi>Uppermost,</hi> serving it
<pb facs="tcp:58696:3"/>
self of the <hi>Same Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Weapons,</hi> against the <hi>Opposition</hi> of the <hi>Under-Schismaticks,</hi> which the Lawful Magistrate does employ for his own Support against the whole Body of the Schism.</p>
            <p>In This <hi>Extract,</hi> or <hi>Collection,</hi> the <hi>Reader</hi> may phansy himself to be gotten into the <hi>Phanaticks Tyring-Room</hi>; where he sees all their <hi>Dresses,</hi> and <hi>Disguises;</hi> their Shifts of <hi>Masques,</hi> and <hi>Habits</hi>; their Change of <hi>Scenes;</hi> their <hi>Artificial Thunders,</hi> and <hi>False Fires:</hi> Nay, the very <hi>Buggs,</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> that they fright Fools and Children with, at a Distance, to be no more, Near hand, than <hi>Paint,</hi> and <hi>Canvass.</hi> You have here laid open to you, the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Work</hi>; to the very <hi>Springs,</hi> and <hi>Wheels,</hi> that make the <hi>Motion Play</hi>; Their Deeds of <hi>Darkness</hi> brought to <hi>Light,</hi> their very <hi>Souls Expos'd;</hi> their <hi>Pleas</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> still varying with their <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi> Or, in One Word, You have here the <hi>Dissenters Picture</hi> to the <hi>Life,</hi> of <hi>their own Drawing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon That Fruitless Conference at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> where His Majesty did all that was possible for Him to do, to Gratify the Importunities of an Ungrateful, and Insatiable Party, without Laying the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Crown</hi> at their Feet: (And the Treaty brake off (in effect) because the <hi>King</hi> would not part with the Rest) What did they do; but, instead of Submitting to some Accommodable <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations</hi> in the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> (as was propounded) whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Abolish the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and Publish a
<pb facs="tcp:58696:4"/>
               <hi>Directory</hi> of their <hi>Own;</hi> with Miserable <hi>Complaints,</hi> and <hi>Appeals</hi> to the People, that they could not prevail, so much as to be <hi>Heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much are they beholden to <hi>Me</hi> then, for bringing them to the Fairest Hearing here that ever Men had; for they shall have their Own Choyce, (the <hi>Multitude</hi>) for their <hi>Judges,</hi> and They Themselves shall be allow'd to be their Own <hi>Advocates.</hi> And, in Truth, there will need no more; when every Man of them is both <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and <hi>Defendent</hi> within Himself, and his own <hi>Right</hi> Hand a <hi>Witness</hi> against his <hi>Left.</hi>

            <p>JUst as I was hurrying away this Sheet to the Press, out comes The <hi>Protestant Mercury,</hi> (If he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it The <hi>Protestant</hi> Cheat, or Cuckold, a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might have guess'd at the <hi>Authors</hi> of it, by Their <hi>Names.</hi>)</p>
            <p>On <hi>April 3.</hi> (say They) Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> thought fit to Take the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> at his <hi>Parish-Church;</hi> (St. <hi>Giles in the Fields)</hi> and was observed To Whisper the Minister some time before he did Receive. But he would do well in his next Pamphlet, to tell those that still suspect him; how oft, and where, and when, he came to That Holy Table, in Sixteen Years Time before the
<pb facs="tcp:58696:4"/>
Discovery of the <hi>Popish Plot;</hi> and before he was Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly question'd for being a <hi>Papist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true that I Received the Blessed <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as above; and <hi>Whisper'd</hi> also <hi>to the Minister;</hi> (the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Reverend Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi>) and the very <hi>Words</hi> I <hi>Whispered</hi> were <hi>These. [So let</hi> God <hi>deal with Me, as I am</hi> Clear, <hi>not only of</hi> Popery, <hi>but of All the Things that have been Sworn against me, that look towards it.]</hi> Now, for the further Satisfaction of <hi>Knaves,</hi> and <hi>Fools,</hi> (for no other, that know Me, and my Circumstances, can pretend to suspect me) let them Ask Mr. <hi>Gatford,</hi> Minister of St. <hi>Dionis Backchurch,</hi> &amp; a Worthy Divine, if I have not several times Received the Holy <hi>Sacraments</hi> from <hi>his Hand,</hi> and in my <hi>Parish-Church</hi> too; <hi>long,</hi> and <hi>late</hi> before the Discovery of the <hi>Popish Plot.</hi> To say nothing of Hundreds of other Witnesses that I could produce in my Justification, if the <hi>Triple League</hi> of <hi>Mercenary Libellers</hi> were worthy of it.</p>

               <head>§. 1. Of Toleration.</head>
               <p>(A) A <hi>Toleration</hi> is against the Nature of <hi>Reformation</hi>; a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> and a <hi>Toleration</hi> are diametrically opposite. The <hi>Apologists</hi> in Petitioning for a <hi>Toleration,</hi> have not only broken the Covenant themselves, but they endeavour by all their Wit and Art to bring the Parliament and Kingdom into so great a guilt as the breach of This Solemn Covenant. <hi>Edwards Antapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia, Pag.</hi> 241. A <hi>Toleration</hi> of men in their <hi>Errours,</hi> this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Liberty of Conscience, is against the Judgement of the greatest Lights in the Church, both ancient and modern, <hi>Pag.</hi> 242.</p>
               <p>(B) Doth it indeed belong to you only to look to the Civil Peace, and to let Religion, and Truth, and the Worship of God stand or fall, to their own Master? <hi>Fight God, Fight Devil; Fight Christ, Fight Anti-Christ; Catch that Catch can</hi>; you have nothing to do but to stand by, and look on. Say so then; Speak, out, publish it in your Declarations to the World, and let the People of <hi>England</hi> know, that it is the Right and Liberty to which the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> are born; that every man hold what he please, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and Preach what he holds: That it is the <hi>Birth-Right</hi> (as some would have it) of the <hi>Free-born-People</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> every man to worship God according to his own Conscience; and to be of what Religion his own Conscience shall Dictate: Do so, and see (Fathers and Brethren) how long your Civil Peace will secure you, when Religion is destroy'd; how long it will be ere your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Peace be turned into Civil War! For no doubt, if this be once granted them, but they may in good time come to know also, (there be them that are instructing them even in these Principles too) that it is their <hi>Birth-Right</hi> to be freed from the Power of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> and from the Power of <hi>Kings; and to take up Arms against Both, when they shall not Vote and Act according to their Humours. Liberty of Conscience</hi> falsly so call'd may in good time emprove it self
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58696:6"/>
into <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Estates,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Houses,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Wives</hi>; and in a word, <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Perdition,</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>Bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hold it a Truer Point in Divinity, that <hi>Errans Conscientia LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GANDA,</hi> then <hi>LIGAT</hi>; but certainly the <hi>Devil</hi> in the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> may be, nay, must be bound. <hi>Lightfoot Serm. to Com. Aug.</hi> 26. 1645. <hi>Pag.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>Ye Servants of Christ, take heed of yielding to the Pretenses of <hi>Conscience</hi>; the Devil, not Christ, has his Throne There. <hi>Hugh's Serm. to the Com. May</hi> 26. 1647. <hi>Pag.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>(C) What? when we have so much appear'd against Popery and Superstition, shall we now begin to think of Indifferency and Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? Certainly it is but a sorry exchange of a <hi>Bad Religion</hi> for <hi>None. Horton Serm. to the Lords, Dec.</hi> 30. 1646. <hi>Pa.</hi> 38.</p>
               <p>(D) Would These men that so highly defend Toleration, grant that Toleration (if they had power in their hands) to others, which they desire for themselves? I doubt it. The <hi>Arrians</hi> did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times seem as earnest Enemies to Persecution, as these men; yet when they had Authority on their side, they raised a Persecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> more terrible then the <hi>Heathen Emperours</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Christians. Cranfords Serm. before the Lord Mayor, Feb.</hi> 1. 1645. <hi>Pa.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>(E) O let the Ministers therefore Oppose <hi>Toleration</hi> (as being that by which the Devil would at once lay a Foundation of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to all Generations) witnesse against it in all places; possesse the Magistrate of the Evil of it; yea, and the People too; shewing them how, if a Toleration were granted, they should never have Peace in their Families more; or ever after, have Command of Wives, Children, Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let's therefore fill all Presses, cause all Pulpits to ring, and so possess Parliament, City, and the whole Kingdom against the Sects, and of the Evil of <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; that we may no more hear of a <hi>Toleration,</hi> nor of <hi>Separated Churches,</hi> being Hateful Names in the Church of God. <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> Ibid. <hi>Edwards Gangraena, Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 84.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58696:6"/>(F) We are bold to hint unto you these ensuing Reasons against the <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>Independency</hi> in this Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> No such Toleration hath hitherto been established (so far as we know) in any Christian State, by the Civil Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because some of them have solemnly profess'd, that they cannot suffer <hi>Presbytery</hi>: And answerable hereunto is their Practice in those places where <hi>Independency</hi> prevails.</p>
               <p>(G) <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To grant to <hi>Them,</hi> and not to <hi>Other Sectaries,</hi> who are Free-born as well as They, and have done as good Service as they to the Publique (as they use to pleade) will be counted Injustice, and great Partiality: But to grant it unto all, will scarce be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from great Impiety.</p>
               <p>(H) <hi>Fourthly, Independency</hi> is a <hi>Schism,</hi> &amp;c. Now we judge, that no <hi>Schism</hi> is to be <hi>Tolerated</hi> in the Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Presbyt. Minist. Letter from Sion College, to the Assembly of Divines, Dec.</hi> 18. 1645.</p>
               <p>(I) Many Mischiefs will inevitably follow upon this <hi>Toleration,</hi> and that both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To the <hi>Church</hi>: As 1. Causlesse and Unjust Revolts from our Ministry, and Congregations. 2. Our Peoples mindes will be troubled, and in danger to be subverted, as <hi>Acts</hi> 15.24.3. Bitter heart-burning among Brethren will be fomented and perpetuated to posterity. 4. The Godly, Painful, Orthodox Ministers will be discouraged, and despised. 5. The life and power of Godliness will be eaten out by frivolous Disputes, and vain Janglings. 6. The whole Course of Religion in private Families will be Interrupted and Undermined. 7. Reciprocal duties between persons of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and dearest Relation will be extremely violated. 8. All <hi>other Sects</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> in the Kingdom will be encourag'd to endeavour the like <hi>Toleration,</hi> and shelter themselves under the wings of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency.</hi> 9. And the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> in short time, will be swallow'd up with Destruction and Confusion.</p>
               <p>(K) <hi>Secondly,</hi> To the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>; for it is much to be doubted lest the Power of the Magistrate should not only be weaken'd, but even utterly overthrown, considering the Principles and Practises of <hi>Independents,</hi> together with their Compliance with <hi>Other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> sufficiently known to be <hi>Anti-Magistratical, Ibid.</hi>

You have destroy'd <hi>Baal</hi> and his Priests; but have you been zealous against <hi>Golden Calves,</hi> and the Priests of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of the People?—You have put down the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and there are many among Us that put down the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; slighting, yea, blaspheming them.

                  <p>Take (in one Word now) the Steps of the whole Proceeding. The <hi>First</hi> Effort upon the Government was made in the Name of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> in <hi>General;</hi> for <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> So soon as the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

had gotten the Power into their hands, they presently set up for an <hi>Uniformity: opposing</hi> a <hi>Toleration,</hi> with all their Might (as in the <hi>First Section)</hi> foreseeing, and predicting the Monstrous Opinions and Confusions which it would Infallibly produce.</p>
                  <p>They shew us in the <hi>Second Section</hi> (upon Experiment) that they were true Prophets; and that all the Evils they foretold us, came accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to passe: So that (in short) under pretence of <hi>Tender Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> they dissolved the Established Government; and by the help of that Pretext got themselves into the Saddle. No sooner was the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Mounted, but he, without any more to do, bent all his Force immediately to the Erecting of an Inexorable and Rigorous <hi>Uniformity:</hi> Wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that the same Trick that they had put upon <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> would most Infallibly (if not prevented) be the Ruine of the <hi>Presbytery</hi> too; or of any Government upon the face of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Now take Notice, Good People, that in <hi>Asking</hi> a <hi>Toleration,</hi> they <hi>Ask</hi> what they judge <hi>Unsafe,</hi> and <hi>Unlawful</hi> to <hi>Allow.</hi> They <hi>Ask,</hi> what they <hi>Know,</hi> and <hi>Declare,</hi> will be our <hi>Undoing:</hi> With what <hi>Equity, Reason, Conscience</hi> or <hi>Designe,</hi> be you the Judges.</p>

                  <p>LEt the Reader lay his hand upin his Heart here, and ask himself. Is this pretended <hi>Tenderness</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> the stile of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or no? Is it the Language of the Disciples of Jesus Christ? Can these People really have an <hi>Evangelical Compassion</hi> for their <hi>Brethren,</hi> and at the same time fly thus in the face of <hi>Dignities,</hi> and treat their <hi>Superiors</hi> at this outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rate? <hi>Have we so learn'd Christ,</hi> as to make <hi>Scurrility</hi> and <hi>Railing</hi> the Badge of our <hi>Profession?</hi> They would be thought to supplicate all this while for <hi>Gentleness</hi> and <hi>Compassion</hi>: And is this the way to obtain it, by a Practice, that is almost sufficient to turn <hi>Mercy</hi> it self into <hi>Indignation</hi>? But alas! their business is not to procure Favour from the Government, but to expose it to Reproach. And all this clutter about the <hi>Clergy</hi> is only to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them Odious and Contemptible to the People. Pray'e take notice once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The stress of their Charge upon the Church is only to move the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude against it, as a Frame of Constitution that is <hi>Antichristian</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish:</hi> And yet, pray mark it, they do in the same breath; offer Proposals of being Vnited into that <hi>Ecclesiastical Popish State;</hi> Which brings the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unavoidably to this Issue; either that they do, against their Consciences, cast that scandal upon the Church for the Advancement of some Other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe; or else, by desiring this Vnion, they do acknowledge themselves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be Incorporate into a Popish Constitution. But this Bustle about the Church, you shall fee, has a furthlr Prospect: For these People have the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of handling <hi>Religious Matters,</hi> in order to <hi>Political</hi> as well as of hooking in <hi>Temporal Matters,</hi> in order to <hi>Spirituals.</hi>

               <p>(C) The State sheweth it self not upright, alledge the Parliament what it will—It shall be easier for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in the day of Judgment, then for such a Court.— There shall not be a man of their seed that shall prosper, be a <hi>Parliament-man,</hi> or bear Rule in <hi>England</hi> any more—None ever defended this Hierarchy of Bishops to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but <hi>Papists,</hi> and such as were infected with <hi>Popish Errors</hi>—All the <hi>Newgates</hi> and <hi>Oldgates,</hi> yea, and all the <hi>Tyburns</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are too little for such rash and presumptuous Heads, that will not give God leave to Rule, but will take the Sceptre out of his hands.—I do fear that many of the forwardest Enemies of Reformation are not the backwardest Friends that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> has in <hi>England</hi> at this day.

Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Prophet comes with Ashes upon his Face, and waited for the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> in the way where he should return, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.42.) and as the King passed by, he Cry'd unto him, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, because thou hast let go a Man whom I appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Destruction, therefore Thy Life shall go for his Life.</hi> Now see how the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> after this, answers <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Love: About Three years after, <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> engaged in a New War: <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s Life was once in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s hand, and he ventur'd Gods displeasure to let him go.

               <p>(D) When Kings command unrighteous things, and People suit them with willing complyance, none doubts but the Destruction of them both is <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Righteous.
