            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S nothing can mooue or stirre man more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, vnto the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his owne sins, then the lawe of God, thundred out, &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his iniquity: so, nothing can draw him, more forcibly vnto repentance, then the sencible sight and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, of fearefull and mighty plagues, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly threatninges, and strange and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious wonders, drawn by the efficient cause (God) from the operations of earthy, ayrie, watry, &amp; heauenly supernal Elementes. As on Munday, beeing the second of <hi>September, Anno</hi> 1583. was seen very strange sights in the ayre, beginning betwixt the houres of eight &amp; nine at night. And so increasing &amp; continuing till after midnight, but chiefly betwixt eleuen &amp; twelue was séen maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous strange, rare, miraculous, &amp; wonderful permouements, ad and regrediacions, with constellations of the ayre, and watery ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were sometime darke, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time red, sometime fiery, and bloody collou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with streames like sharpe speares, shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:5496:3"/>
straight vpwarde, and meeting togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (as it were) in a round point, with flashes, much brightnesse, many streames, and straunge and vnwonted collours of the rainebow. As also with the collour of the fire of Brimstone, and seeming as it were burning with fierye flashes and smoake. Straunge, and fearefull no doubt to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, as though the gallant frame, of all the radient skie and elements, had beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then about to be set on fire. All which threates and often preachings from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, by Fyre, doth yet once agayne call our disobedience, vnto speedy obedience, and amendment of life. I therefore, as one that beheld the same, although of all others, the most vnfittest to report it, haue here in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, published the very trueth, and sight, as it then appeared and was manifestly seene, (ouer our horrizon at London) &amp; no doubt of many others. To the end that none might be ignorant, of that last warning, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, to call vs vnto repentaunce. Before the Lord God (whose mercies, are alwaies as great, as him selfe) do bring any notable ouerthrow, or destruction vpon any nation, kingdome, or people, he firste of all giueth
<pb facs="tcp:5496:3"/>
them warning, to the ende, that if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not, yet they might be found, vnexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, as hauing no cause, to plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Thus he dealt towardes the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, to whom, before hee destroyed them. (With fire and brimstone from heauen) hee sent three Angels to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to giue them warning, who prayed for them. And before he destroyed the old worlde,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.</note> by the diluge of water, he sent them <hi>Noah,</hi> who preached by the preparing of an Arke, an hundreth and twenty yeares, so that euery stroke of his hammers, might haue been a sufficient ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to warne them, of the comming of the waters: before the dearth came vpon <hi>Egipt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.</note> the Lorde sent <hi>Ioseph,</hi> to prouide barnes, and store, for old father <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp; his familie, as it appeareth, in the 45. chapiter of <hi>Gene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> could be mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, towards the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> by none other meanes then by the Lordes punishmentes, The Lorde sente ten merueilous notable plagues, and wonders vppon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and al his host, yea, from the hiest that sitteth on themperiall seate, to the lowest, that grindeth in myll, or slandeth behinde the doore, and made his stoute stomacke, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:5496:4"/>
to stoupe. The Lorde hath forwarned vs a great while, &amp; yet doth not cease, so to doe stil, first by his Law, then by his gospel, thirdly by the benefites, that we haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually receiued of him, fourthly by his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and miraculous tokens, strange mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, blazing commets, vnwonted enunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of waters, straunge fishes, perrillous warres, earthquakings, and last of all, firye constellations, as now also lately appeared, and is here afore more plainly specified. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing in al pointes (touching the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that strange sight, which I sawe) the trueth, so neare as I can. Requesting, the gentle readers, to pardon me, as one vnlear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, and willing to submit my faltings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to the censure, iudgement, and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the learned, whom I reuerence. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing al, to bear in mind, the holy words of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his second epistle, and thirde Chapter, which are spoke to this purpose. First, that there shal come in the latter dais mockers, walking after their owne lustes, And saying, wher is the promise of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming? For euer since, the olde fathers fel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe, al things haue continued still alike from the beginning and creation of the
<pb facs="tcp:5496:4"/>
worlde. For this they know, (how be it are wilfully ignoraunt of it) howe that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens were of old, and the earth consisting of the water, and the water by the worde of God. By the which the worlde that then was (as I haue sayde before) perished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer runne with Water. But the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and the earth which be now, are kept in store, by his worde, and reserued vnto fire, against the day of iudgement, and the pardition of vngodly men. And therefore be not ignoraunt of this, that one day is with the Lord, as a thousand yeares, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares, as one day. And that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord is not slack in comming, as some men count slacknesse, but is patient to vs warde, (foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much) as he would haue no man lost, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued all, vnto repentance. Neuerthelesse, whether ye repent, or continue stil in your sinnes, yet the day of the Lorde shall come, as a theefe in the night, in which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens shal passe away with a greate noise, and the elementes shal melt, with feruent heat, the earth also and the workes that are therein, shalbe vtterly burned. Seing then, that al these things shal perish, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of persons ought ye to bee, in al manner
<pb facs="tcp:5496:5"/>
of holy conuersation and Godlinesse. Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for, and hasting vnto the comming of the day of God, by whom, the heauens shall perishe with fire, and the elementes shall melte with feruente heate. Wherefore good Christians and beeloued brethren, seeing that you doe nowe looke for suche thinges, which vndoubtedly shall come to passe, be diligent, that ye may be founde of the Lord in peace, without spot, and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed. Wherefore seeing ye bee warned, (and that afore hand by diuers and sundry pread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions) to take heed. Take heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, least ye fall away (thorow the error of the wicked) from your owne stedfastnes. But growe ye in grace, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our onely Lord, and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iesus Christ, to whom be glory both now and for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer.
