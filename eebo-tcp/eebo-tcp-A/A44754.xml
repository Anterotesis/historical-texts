         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

here, but that of late years it hath
been usual to intercept and break up <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
which is a baser kind of <hi>burglary</hi> then

he who breaks open one <hi>Letters,</hi> which

elsewhere) may be said to rifle the very
brain, and rob one of his most precious

               <p>They say that the <hi>English</hi> are a sturdy,

and wealth of this Island was never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
so much before both by Land

this Nation was never hit upon till now;
<hi>Politicians</hi> new and old have beaten their
brains, and shot at rovers in writing of
divers sorts of Governments; but the
wisest of them concur in this opinion,
that there is no Government more resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

the errors of Common-wealths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he tels us what a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is,
which is (under favour) an irregularity in
method. In his first book he speaks only
of the parts of a City, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal,
but he tels us not what they are til
he comes to his third Book, where in
handling the kinds of Government in
generall, he flies backward and forward
in a disorderly way; but when he comes
to treat of particular forms, he is full
of contradiction and confusion; in some
places he seems to deny any natural right
and publick interest, (much more any
<hi>underived Majesty)</hi> in the <hi>people,</hi> whom he
saith to <hi>be little inferiour to beasts;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
elsewhere he affordeth a liberty to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
City, to set up either by force or
cunning what government they please,
which in effect is to allow men to doe


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55759:8"/>
what they list <hi>if they be able:</hi> But at last he
confesses that after <hi>Kings</hi> were given over
in <hi>Greece,</hi> Common-wealths were made
of them who <hi>waged warre,</hi> and that all
power was summ'd up in the Government
of an <hi>Army,</hi> which is pure <hi>Stratocracy,</hi> or
Military Government.</p>

               <p>We cannot blame this great Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
to rove herein up and down, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impossible for any humane brain to
prescribe any certain and infallible uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
rules of Government that may
quadrat with the nature of all climes, and
be applicable to the humors of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
all other <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> have <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictical,</hi>
and undenyable <hi>principles,</hi> but the
<hi>Art of Government</hi> hath no such Maximes;
the reason is the various dispositions of
people, and a thousand sorts of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
that attend worldly affairs; it is,
you better know then I, one of the main
principles of policy in <hi>France</hi> to keep the
<hi>peasan</hi> (which is the grosse of the people)
still indigent and poor, because they are
of such a volatil instable nature, that if
they were rich and fed high, <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonesse</hi>
would make them ever and anon to
be kicking against Government, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55759:8"/>
out for a change, whereas this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of policy is held to be a paradox in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and other Countreys. Some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are so firy mouth'd, that they must
be rid with a <hi>bit,</hi> if not a <hi>Martinghal,</hi> but
a <hi>snaffle</hi> will serve others: nor are the
same laws fit for the <hi>Continent,</hi> that are
proper for an <hi>Island,</hi> nor those of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritim

               <p>I concur with you there is no Art so
difficult, and fuller of incertainties, as
<hi>Hominem homini imperare,</hi> as the <hi>art for man
to govern man,</hi> which made one of the deepest
<hi>Statesmen</hi> these modern times afforded to
confesse, that though he had served so
many <hi>Apprentiships,</hi> and been a <hi>Journeyman</hi>
so long in this <hi>Art,</hi> and reputed a <hi>Master,</hi>
yet he found himself still a <hi>Novice:</hi> For
State affairs as all sublunary things, are
subject to alteration, the <hi>wisdome</hi> of one
day may be the <hi>foolishnesse</hi> of another, and
the week following may be Schoolmistress
to the week before in point of <hi>experience,</hi>
which is the great Looking-glass of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and Policy.</p>
               <p>Therefore whereas <hi>Aristotle</hi> useth to be
constant to himself in all other Sciences


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55759:9"/>
while he displayes the operations and
works of Nature, when he comes to
treat of <hi>humane government,</hi> he is not only
often at a losse, and inconstant to himself,
but he involves both himself and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>I am of opinion that there is in policy
but one true Vniversal Maxime, which is,
as you said before, to <hi>have alwayes a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
visible effectif power in being,</hi> as well to
<hi>preserve,</hi> as to <hi>curb</hi> a people; and it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

is our confederat the <hi>Hollander,</hi> so
he be protected in his trade, to part with
any thing, to pay tols for what he hath
either for back or belly; he is content to
pay for all beasts sold in the Market the
twelf part for <hi>Excise,</hi> six shillings upon
every Tun of Beer, two stivers a week for
every milch Cow, six pence upon every

commodities: The States of <hi>Italy</hi> do more,

in <hi>Florence,</hi> and the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi>

Country upon earth) ther's not a grain

               <p>But Sir, now that I have been absent
so long, I pray be pleased to tell me
something of the proceedings of the late
<hi>long</hi> Parlement, and of this mighty revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for I find such a kind of <hi>transposition</hi>
of all things in point of Government,
that <hi>England</hi> may be said to be but the

               <p>There is a <hi>periodical</hi> Fate, that hangs
over all Governments, this of <hi>England</hi>
may be said to have come to its <hi>Tropique,</hi> to
a posture of turning; The people extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>long'd</hi> for a Parlement, and they had
a <hi>long</hi> Parlement, for it lasted longer then
all the Parlements that ever were in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
since the first institution of Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
put them all together; there was


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55759:10"/>
never such an <hi>Idol</hi> upon earth as that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement,
for people thought there was an
inerring spirit tyed to the Speakers chair,
they pinn'd their salvation upon it, it
was held blasphemy, and a sin against the
holy Ghost to speak against it, nay some
gave out that that blessed Parlement was
as necessary for our <hi>Refromation, as the coming
of Christ was for our Redemption;</hi> such a sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
kind of infatuation had seiz'd upon
some kind of people.</p>

never aked; 'Tis true, they were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

of a credulous easie King, they did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
monstrous things. They as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to themselves all the Regalia's of

               <p>I will not resolve you in that, till I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with the Pedigree, &amp; primitive
institution of Parlement, which I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to do as succinctly as I can, but in
regard that our Parlement was erected at
first in imitation of the Assembly of the
three Estates in <hi>France,</hi> in which Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you are so well vers'd, I pray do me
the favour as give me a touch of the mode
of <hi>France</hi> in those publick Assemblies,
and then I shall apply my self to satisfie
you touching <hi>English, Irish,</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,
having in some measure studied

               <speaker>Polyander.</speaker>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> the Kings Writ goeth to the
Bayliffs, Seneschals or Stewards of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
who issue out warrants to all
such ashave fees and lands within their
Liberties, as also to all Towns,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55759:11"/>
requiring all such as have any complaints,
to meet in the principal City, there to
choose Delegats in the name of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
to be present at the <hi>generall Assembly.</hi>
Being met at the principal City of the
Bayliwick, the Kings Writ is read, and
so the Delegates are elected and sworn;
Then they consult what is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, and fit to be proposed to the
King, whereof there is an Index or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
made, which is delivered to the
Delegats to carry to the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
All the Bayliwicks are divided to
twelve Classes; but to avoid confusion,
and to the end there may not be too
great a delay in the Assembly by gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the voyces or suffrages, every
Classis compiles a brief, or Book of the
grievances and demands of all the Bayli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks
within that Classis; then these
Classes at the Assembly compose one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Book of the grievances and demands
of the whole Kingdome. This being the
order of the proceeding of the Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
or <hi>third Estate,</hi> the like order is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Nobility:</hi> so when
the three books or <hi>Cahiers</hi> (as they call
them) for the three Estates are perfected,
then they present them to the King by their
Presidents in the open great Assemby.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55759:11"/>
The first who presents the <hi>Cahiers</hi> is

                  </gap>or the <hi>Nobility</hi> speaks next in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
But the President for the <hi>Commons</hi>
begins and ends his Oration on his knees:
whilst the President of the Clergy speaks,
the rest of that order rise up &amp; stand bare,
till they are bid by the King to sit down,
and be covered; and so the like for the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;</hi>
but whilst the President for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalty
speaks, the rest are neither bid to
fit, or to be covered. The grievances
and demands being thus all delivered at
once, and left to the King and his <hi>Privy
Councel</hi> without further debate or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of time, the <hi>General Assembly</hi> of the
three Estates endeth, expecting afterwards
such a redresse to their grievances, as the
King and his Councel shall think fit.</p>

               <p>These proceedings of <hi>France</hi> are not
much unlike the ancient usage of this
Kingdome for many ages, when all Laws
were nothing else but the Kings answers

Law and Logic are meerly founded upon
reason; This discoursive faculty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
comes with us into the world ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with certain general notions
and natural principles to distinguish
right from wrong, and falshood from
truth.</p>
               <p>But before I come to the <hi>English</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement,
a word or two of the Parlement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> about three weeks before the
Parlement begins, Proclamation is made
throughout the Kingdome, to deliver
unto the Kings Clerk or Master of the
Rols, all bils to be exhibited that Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then are they brought to the King,
and perused by him; and only such as
he allows are put in the Chancelors
hand to be proponed in Parliament, and


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55759:12"/>
no others; and if any man in Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
speak of any other matter then is
formerly allowed by the King, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor
tels him there is no such bill allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the King: When they have passed
them for laws, they are presented to the
King, who with the Scepter, put into his
hand by the Chancelor, ratifies them, but
if there be any thing the King mislikes
they raze it out before.</p>
               <p>The Parlement in <hi>Ireland</hi> is after this
manner. No Parlement is to be held but
at such a season as the Kings Deputy there
doth certifie the King under the Great
Seal of the land, of the causes, considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and necessity of a Parlement; The
causes being approved of by the King a
Licence is sent under the broad Seal of
<hi>England</hi> to summon a Parlement in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
provided that all such bils that shall
be proposed there in Parlement, be first
transmitted hither under the Great Seal
of that Kingdome, and having received
allowance and approbation here they shall
be put under the Great Seal of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and so return'd thither to be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in that Parlement; this was called
<hi>Poinings Act</hi> in the time of King <hi>Philip</hi> and
<hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus given a concise account


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55759:13"/>
of the usage of Parlement in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Kingdomes, I will now passe to that
of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every <hi>Freeholder</hi> who hath a voice in
the election of Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses to sit in Parlement, ought to
know well, and consider with what
power he trusts those whom he chooseth,
in regard the power of the House of
Commons is derived from that trust:
Now that which gives authoritie for the
<hi>Freeholders</hi> to make their election is the
<hi>Kings Writ</hi> directed to the Sheriff of the
County, in which is expressed not only
the Sheriffs duty in point of summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but the Writ contains also the duty
and power of such Knights, and Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that shall be elected; therefore to
know the full extent of the power of
Parlement, you must have an eye, and
observe well the words of the Writ; for
the <hi>Freeholders</hi> cannot transfer a greater
power then is compriz'd in the Writ to
those that they appoint their servants
in Parlement. The Writ being us'd to
be in <hi>Latin,</hi> few Freeholders, God wot,
understood it, or knew what they did; I
will faithfully render the said Writ to
you in <hi>English.</hi>

                     </gap>ridian</hi> truth, that the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners</hi>
were no part of the High Court of
Parliament in ages passed: Moreover I find
in an ancient Manuscript, that the <hi>Commons</hi>
were reduced to a <hi>House,</hi> by the advice of
the <hi>Bishops</hi> to the King in the brunt of the
Barons Wars, that they might allay and
lesson the power of the <hi>Peers</hi> who bandied
so many yeers against the <hi>Crown;</hi> yet to
prevent that they should not arrogate too
much authority to themselves,
(as <hi>Asperius nihil est humili cum surgit in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum)</hi>
it was done with those cautions th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

they had scarce as much jurisdiction given
them as a Pyepowders Court hath, for they
should neither exhibit an oath, nor impose
fine, or inflict punishment upon any but their
own members, or be a Court of Record, or
grant Proxies, therefore it may well be a
<hi>quere</hi> how they can appoint <hi>Committees,</hi>
considering that those Committee-men
whom they choose are no other then their
Deputies, and act by power and <hi>proxy</hi> from
them. But it is as cleer as the Sun that the
Conquerour, first brought this word <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
with him, being a <hi>French</hi> Word,
and made it free Denizon of <hi>England</hi> being
not known before; for therein the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>

was that wheresoever they conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they brought in their language with

that besides those instances you produce,
I could furnish you with many in the
Saxons times who govern'd by the councel
of the <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Peers,</hi> not admitting
the Commons to any communication in
affairs of State: There are records hereof
above a thousand yeer old in the Reign of
King <hi>I a, Offa,</hi> and <hi>Ethelbert;</hi> and the rest
of the seven Kings during the <hi>Heptarchy,</hi>
They called their great Councels and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
then <hi>Michael Smoth, Michael
Gemote, and Witenage Mote,</hi> wherein the
<hi>King and Nobles with the Bishops</hi> onely met,
and made laws; that famous Convention at
<hi>Gratley</hi> by King <hi>Athelstan</hi> was compose'd
onely of <hi>Lords spiritual</hi> and <hi>temporal;</hi> such
also was that so much celebrated Assembly
held by <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> who was King of
<hi>England, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Norway: Edward</hi> the
<hi>Confessor</hi> established all his Laws thus, and
he was a great <hi>Legislator.</hi> The <hi>British</hi> Kings
also who retain'd a great while some part
of this Island unconquered, governed and
made laws this way by the sole advice of
their <hi>Nobles</hi> whom they call <hi>Arglwyded;</hi>

called <hi>Howel Dha</hi> (the good King <hi>Howel</hi>)

whereof there are yet extant some <hi>Welch</hi>

               <p>But in your discourse before, among

you make mention of one that was held in

               <p>To prove my assertion further, that the
<hi>Commons</hi> were no part of the high Court,
and Common Councel of <hi>England,</hi> I will
make use of the testimony of Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> who
was in such high repute most part of the
late long Parliament, and appeared so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
for the priviledge and power of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
House: In his Book of <hi>Treachery</hi> and
disloyalty, he proves that before the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Conquest by the Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Confessor, the King was to do Justice by
the Councel of the <hi>Nobles of his Realm:</hi> he
would also prove that the <hi>Earls and Barons</hi>
are above the King, and ought to Bridle
him when he exorbitates from the law, but
not a syllable of the <hi>Commons.</hi> He further
tels us, that the <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> have oft
translated the Crown from the right Heir,
whereof out of his great reading he urgeth


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55759:18"/>
divers Examples; First, after King <hi>Edgars</hi>
decease they crowned <hi>Edward</hi> who was
illegitimate, and put by <hi>Ethelred</hi> the right
Heir: Then they crowned <hi>Canutus</hi> a meer
forraigner in opposition to <hi>Edmund</hi> the
lawful Heir to <hi>Ethelred. Harold</hi> and <hi>Hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canute</hi>
were both elected Kings successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without just title, the Lords putting
by <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Alfred</hi> the rightful Heirs.
Upon the death of <hi>Herold</hi> the English No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
enacted that none of the Danish
blood should raign any more over them;
<hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> was rejected by the Lords,
and though he had the best title, yet they
elected <hi>Harold.</hi> He goes on further in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the <hi>Commons,</hi> saying that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the first is
observable, which runs thus, <hi>Henry by the
Grace of God King of</hi> England, &amp;c. <hi>Know ye
that by the mercy of God and Common Council
of the Barons of the Kingdom, I am crowned
King. Mawd</hi> the Empress was the right heir,
but she was put by the Crown by the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
and Barons,</hi> and <hi>Steven</hi> Earle of <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi>
who had no good title, was heav'd up
into the Throne by the Bishops and Peers.
<hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was Crowned King also
by the Barons instead of King <hi>John,</hi> and
by the same Barons was uncrowned, and
sent back to <hi>France.</hi> In all these high


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55759:19"/>
transactions, and changes, Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
the <hi>Commoners</hi> had nothing to do the
<hi>despotical</hi> and ruling power as well as the
<hi>consultative</hi> being in the Council of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and Peers; and if Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> could
have found halfe so much Antiquity for the
Knights Citizens, and Bourgesses, without
question we should have heard from him
with a witness; but while he converseth with
Elder times, he meets not with so much as
the names of <hi>Commoners</hi> in any record.</p>

               <p>How then came the <hi>Commoners</hi> to sway so

               <p>It is a certain truth that in former ages
the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as well <hi>Saxons, Danes,
Normans,</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Kings did steer the
course of their government by the advice
of their own <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
cases by the compasse of the <hi>great
Council</hi> consisting onely of <hi>spiritual and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Barons,</hi> whom they convoked by
royal summons when they pleased; I told
you this word <hi>Parliament</hi> came in with the


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55759:19"/>
                  <hi>Norman;</hi> yet the Commons were not call'd
to Parliament till that raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the
first, which was a good while after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
to which purpose Sir, <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>
writes, saying it is held that the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> had no <hi>formal Parliaments,</hi> till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the 18. year of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, at which
time the Commons were summoned, and the
<hi>great Charter</hi> was granted: and if we believe
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> and others, the <hi>House of
Commons,</hi> and <hi>Magna Charta</hi> had first but
obscure births, being sprung from <hi>userpers,</hi>
and fostered afterward by <hi>rebellion:</hi> for
King <hi>Henry</hi> the first did but <hi>usurp</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and therefore to secure himself the
better against <hi>Robert</hi> his eldest brother, he
courted the the <hi>Commons,</hi> and granted them
that <hi>great Charter,</hi> with <hi>Charta de Foresta;</hi>
which King <hi>John</hi> confirmed upon the same
grounds, for he was also an <hi>usurper, Arthur</hi>
Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> being the undoubted Heir
of the Crown, so the house of <hi>Commons</hi> and
these <hi>great Charters</hi> had their original from
such that were Kings <hi>de facto</hi> not <hi>de jure.</hi>

               <p>It is observed that <hi>usurpers</hi> are commonly

themselvs the more to the people, as


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55759:20"/>
besides these Kings you have named, <hi>Richard</hi>

were admitted to the Common Council of
the Kingdome, yet they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
called, for though the said King
called them to his Coronation, and againe

            <sp>

               <p>I remember to have read one remarkable
passage in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, that
in his third year for the marriage of his
daughter, he raised a tax upon every hide
of Land, but he did this by the advice of his

also after the <hi>Commons</hi> were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to partake of the Common Council; But
to illustrate this point further, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the Commons were sought unto

the <hi>third,</hi> in whose reign the <hi>Writs</hi> of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

those <hi>Writs</hi> at pleasure by the sole ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of their <hi>Privy Council,</hi> as we read in the

framer of that famous Ordinance, <hi>Whereas
Elections of Knights have been made with

of which most part was people of no value, yet

               <p>The difference 'twixt the King or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream

though the Petition be directed to the

               <p>In the 2. yeer of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, there was
a Law made, wherein there is a clause, that

it is to be observed, that as Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

how, if the Petitions were from Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the <hi>answer</hi> from the King, 'tis
easie to judge who <hi>makes</hi> the Acts: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
Sir <hi>John Gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

times the way of Petitioning the King,
was this: The Lords, and Speaker either
by words or writing preferr'd their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55759:28"/>
to the King, (which was afterwards
called a <hi>bill)</hi> which Petition being receiv'd
by the <hi>King,</hi> he received part, and part he
<hi>put out,</hi> and part he <hi>ratified,</hi> and as it came
from him it was drawn to a <hi>law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore it appears that Ordiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Provisions and Proclamations made
heretofore out of Parliament have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
acknowledged for Laws, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
               <p>The Statute call'd the <hi>Statute of Ireland,</hi>

               <p>'Tis hard to distinguish among the old

(and of those as <hi>many</hi> and <hi>whom</hi> they

'twixt a <hi>Proclamation</hi> and a <hi>Statute;</hi>
or 'twixt the Kings <hi>Privy Counsel,</hi> and his

               <p>In the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> 'tis said,

When <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was confirmed,
there are found these two provisions in

               <p>First, nevertheless the <hi>King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>

to diminish the Regal right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second, notwithstanding all these
things before mentioned, or any part of
them, both the King and his Council, and

that the <hi>right and Prerogative of his Crown</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Statute of Escheators</hi> hath this title,
At the Parliament of our Soveraign Lord

               <p>We find also that it hath been very usual

               <p>
                  <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Thorp</hi> were sent by the Judges
to the Kings <hi>Privy Council</hi> to demand of
them whether by the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the

Judges said, <hi>Sue to the Kings Council,</hi> and as
they will have us to do, we will do, and no
otherwise.</p>
               <p>Thus we find that the Court-Council did
guide and check the Judges oftentimes, yet
the Judges have guided the great Common
Council, or high court of Parliament.</p>

with his learned and Privy Councel whether
they trench upon his Royal Prerogative,

much modesty answered, that touching that
point, it belonged to his Majesty to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it, and consult with his <hi>learned and
Privy Councel</hi> about it; And whomsoever
his Majesty would please to nominat in his
last Will, they would confirm and ratifie;
Whereupon old <hi>Harry</hi> made a formal Will,
which was enrolled in the Chancery,
wherein (remembring the perfidious carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of <hi>James</hi> the fourth, his brother in
law) he declared the issue of his eldest sister,
the Queen of <hi>Scotts,</hi> being forreners, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to inherit, and the issue of <hi>Charles
Brandon,</hi> after the progeny of his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to succeed next: This <hi>Will</hi> continued
in the Chancery all <hi>Edward</hi> the sixts time,


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55759:32"/>
till Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who about the midst of
her reign did cancel it. But now Sir, be
pleas'd to pardon this Parenthesis, and
resume the thread of your former discourse,
in displaying what are the <hi>priviledges</hi> of
Parliament which were so much insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and cried up in the late <hi>long</hi> Parliament,
till they swell'd so high, that they swallowed
up and devour'd the Prerogative.</p>

               <p>If we will give credit to Sir <hi>Ed. Coke,</hi> who
was a great Champion of the House of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
and no friend to <hi>Prerogative</hi> (which
he was us'd to call that <hi>Great Monster)</hi> the
priviledge of freedom from Arrests is the
onely priviledge of Parliament. He cannot
or at least, he doth not so much as name any
other in his Section of the <hi>priviledge of
Parliament;</hi> neither is <hi>this priviledge</hi> so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
and cleer as some do imagine,
as divers examples may be produced in the
reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was so great
a <hi>darling of the Commons:</hi> In the 39. of her
reign, Sir <hi>Ed. Hobby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brograve</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
of the <hi>Dutchy</hi> were sent by the House
to the Lord Keeper, to require his Lordship
to revoke two writs of <hi>Subpoena's</hi> which
were serv'd upon Mr. <hi>Tho. K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>vet</hi> a Member
of the House; the Lord Keeper demanded of


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55759:32"/>
them whether they were appointed by any
advised consultation of the House to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this message unto him with the word
<hi>require;</hi> they answered, yes; he replyed as he
thought reverently and honourably of the
House, and of their liberties and privileges,
so to revoke the said <hi>Subpoenas in that sort</hi>
was to restrain her Majesty in her greatest
power which is in the publick administration
of Justice in the place wherein he serves her,
Therefore he concluded, that as they had
required him to revoke his Writ, so he did
require farther deliberation.</p>
               <p>18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> report was made by the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of the <hi>Dutchy</hi> upon the Committee for
the delivering of one Mr. <hi>Halls</hi> man, that the
Committee found no precedent for setting
at large by the Mace any person in arrest
but onely by Writ, and that by divers prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of records perus'd by the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
it appeared that every Knight, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
or Burgesse, which doth desire privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
hath used in that case to take a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
oath before the Lord Chancellor or
Keeper for the time being. that the party
for whom such writ is prayed <hi>came up with
him, and was his servant at the time of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
made;</hi> Thereupon Mr. <hi>Hall.</hi> was directed
by the house to repair to the Lord Keeper,
and make oath, and then to take a warrant


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55759:33"/>
for a writ of privilege for his servant.</p>
               <p>270 <hi>Eliz. Richard Coke,</hi> a Parliament
member, being served with a <hi>subpoena</hi> of
Chancery: The Lord Keeper boldly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that he thought the House had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
such privilege against <hi>subpoenas,</hi> as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
Neither could he allow of any
precedents of the House used in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
unlesse the House of Commons could
also prove the same to have been likewise
allowed, and ratified by precedents in the
high Court of Chancery.</p>
               <p>Now, the Original writ for Election;
which is the foundation of the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
makes mention of no such privilege,
and 'tis a rule that to vary from the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Writ makes a nullity of the
cause, and the proceedings thereupon: For
where a Commissioner exerciseth more
power then is warranted by his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the act is not only invalid but punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Now the end and scope of privileges of
Parlement, is not to give power to do any
publick act not warranted by the writ, but
they are intended as helps only to enable
the members towards the performance of
their duties, and so are subservient to the
power comprized in the Writ; For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the freedom from Arrests doth not


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55759:33"/>
give any power at all to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to do any extraordinary act there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
but the Members are made the more
capable to attend the publick service by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
free from the trouble of arrests; so that
this privilege giveth no further power at
all, but only helps to the execution of the
power derived from the Royal writ; Nor
can the Freeholders by their Elections
give any such privilege of exemption from
arrests, but it is the meer gift, and grace
of the Soveraign Prince, yet in point of
treson, felony or breach of the Kings peace
this privilege extends not; Now, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
are things contrary to law, or at least
they serve as a dispensation against law,
intended originally for the better expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Kings businesse, or som publik
service.</p>
               <p>Nor could the House of Commons pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
any for breach of this their privilege
till they had conferr'd with the Lords, and
till the punishment had been referred by
them to the Commons; there is a notable
example hereof in the 33. of <hi>Henry</hi> the
eight, <hi>George Ferrers</hi> the Kings servant and
Burgesse of <hi>Plymouth</hi> going to Parliament,
was arrested by process out of the Kings
Bench for debt; which being signified to

purpose to forbear the committing of the

               <p>35 <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter Wentworth,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Henry Bromley</hi> delivered a Petition to
the Lord Keeper desiring the Lords of
the Upper House to be suppliants with
them of the Lower House unto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
for entayling the succession of the
Crown, whereof a Bill was ready drawn.
The Queen was highly displeased here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and charged her Councel to call


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55759:35"/>
the parties before them, so Sir <hi>Thomas
Henage</hi> was sent to fetch them; so they
were first commanded to forbear going
to the House, and not to go out of
their several lodgings; afterward they
were called before the Lord Tresurer, Lord
<hi>Buckhurst,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Henage: Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
was committed to the Tower, and
<hi>Bromeley</hi> to the Fleet, together with Mr.

               </p>
               <p>The Queen sent a notable check to
the House of Commons 28. of her raign
for chosing and returning Knights of the
Shire for <hi>Norfolk,</hi> a thing impertinent
for the House to deal withall, and belonging
only to the Office and charge of her Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
from whom the Writs issue and are
return'd.</p>
               <p>In one Parliament, when Mr. <hi>Coke,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> was Speaker,
the Queen sent a Messenger or Sargeant
at Arms into the House of Commons,
and took out Mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to Prison, with divers others,
for some speeches spoken in the House;
Thereupon Mr. <hi>Wroth</hi> moved the House
that they would be humble sutors to her
Majesty, that she would be pleased to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
those members of the House that


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55759:36"/>
were restrain'd, which was done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and answer was sent by her Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
That her Majesty had committed
them for causes best known to her self,
and to presse her Highuesse with this suit
would but hinder the whole good they
sought: That the House must not call
the Queen to an account for what shee
doth of her Royal Authority: That the
causes for which they are restrain'd may be
high and dangerous: That her Majesty li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no such questions, neither doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the House to search into matters of
that nature.</p>
               <p>The Commons were told 39. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
that their priviledge was <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>no:</hi> And
that her Majesties pleasure was, that if
the Speaker perceived any idle heads,
which would not stick to hazard their
own estates, but meddle with reforming the
Church, and trans forming the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal
by exhibiting Bills to that purpose,
the Speaker should not receive them till
they were viewed and considered by those
who are sitter to consider of such things,
and can better judge of them: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
the Queen rejected 48. Bills which
had passed both Houses, in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

or time of payment, considering that all we
have is her Majesties, and she may lawfully at

as much right to all our lands and goods, as
to any revenew of the Crown, and he said he
could prove it by precedents in the raign of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

This speech agrees with that which Sir</hi>

did it onely out of a design to establish an

it absolutely; it never being his purpose

               <p>To resume my discourse, the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
though it breathed nothing but
grace, would not suffice the Scots, but having
an <hi>inch</hi> given them, they would take an <hi>Ell,</hi>
and nothing would serve their turn but an
utter extirpation of Episcopacy, for by tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
the Miter under their feet, they hoped
to have some of the Birds Plumes being pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to feather their own Nests, and they
brought their work about: Good Lord,
what a deal of dirt was thrown into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
faces by every rural petty Clerk? what
infamous Ballads were sung up and down?
what a thick Cloud of Epidemical hatred
hung suddenly over them, so far that a <hi>Dog</hi>
with a white neck was called Bishop amongst
them.</p>
               <p>The chiefest contrivers of this uproar,
finding their designs to fadge so well, and
perceiving the Country to be so eagerly
bent against Bishops (and what Artifices and
suggestious were used to render them so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
is incredible.) But finding withall the
King unwilling to alter the Government
his Father had left him, and to which he
had been sworn at his Coronation: They
put themselves in Arms, and raised Forces
to beat down the <hi>Miter</hi> with the <hi>Sword,</hi> if

Army, pretending they came as Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
but they brought their Petition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the pikes point. Hereupon the King
raised a Counter Army, and marched as far
as <hi>Barwick,</hi> but some of the great ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him grew cold in the Action; so a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification
was shuffled up, and I think it was

to forbear, and utterly to abolish the

legal, being advised thereunto by <hi>Noy</hi> his
Attorney General, who was cryed up to
be so great a Clerk in the Law, yet he would
not rest there, but he advised further with
his learned Council of the Sergeants at

and afterwards of the major part of all
the twelve upon a leasurely debate; this he
thought sufficient to induce his conscience
to hold the things legal: It was proved that
the moneys levied that way were employed
to the right use and no other, <hi>viz.</hi> to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the narrow Seas, and to preserve the
right of his dominion in them (being the
fairest flower of his Crown) which was not
onely discoursed of abroad, but the French
Cardinal was over heard to question his right
that way. And touching the danger that

further, that not one peny of that

Coffers, or was given to any favorite, but
he added much of his own treasure for the

Bill for the abolishing of the said Ship-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and redressing of any grievance besides,

the House was inclinable to comply with

that passed at Court as far as what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
in the Cabinet Council, or spoken
of in the Bed-chamber (where of the six
grooms, five were <hi>Scots)</hi> which was a great
advantage unto him. He armed also, and
preferring to make <hi>England</hi> the Stage of the
War rather then his own Country, and to
invade rather then to be invaded, he got ore
the <hi>Tweed,</hi> where he found the passage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and, as it were, made for him all the
way, till he come to the River of <hi>Tine:</hi> And
though there was a considerable English ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of horse and foot at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> yet they
never offered to face the <hi>Scot</hi> all the while.
At <hi>Newburg</hi> there was indeed a small skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
but the English foot would not fight;
so <hi>Newcastle</hi> Gates flew open to the Scot
without any resistance at all, where 'tis
thought he had more friends then foes, for

all Presbyterians were his confederates.</p>
               <p>The King being advanc'd as far as <hi>York,</hi>
summon'd all his Nobles to appear, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise

were appointed on both sides who met at
<hi>Rippon,</hi> and how the hearts and courage of
some English Barons did boil within their
breasts to be brought to so disadvantagious
Treaty with the <hi>Scot,</hi> you may well imagine:
So the Treaty began, which the <hi>Scot,</hi> would

alledging how dishonourable it would

in point of <hi>National</hi> repute; But in this last

to have been bought and sold, considering

the two Armies one <hi>English,</hi> the other <hi>forraign,</hi>
which were gnawing the very bowels of the
Kingdom might be both dismissed: Touching
grievances of al natures he was ready to redress
them, concerning the <hi>Shipmony</hi> he was willing
to passe a law for the utter abolition of it, and
to canc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them not to spend much time about that: For
Monopolies he desired to have a List of them,
and he would damn them all in one Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Touching ill Counsellours either in
<hi>White-Hall</hi> or <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> either in
Church or State, hee was resolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
none: Therefore he desired that all jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies

so concluded with this caution, That they

               <p>Thus at the beginning of the Parliament
there were great hopes of <hi>Fair weather</hi> after
that cold Northern <hi>storm</hi> and that we should
be rid of the <hi>Scot,</hi> but that was least intended
till some designs were brought about: The

the Judges, and divers other are
clapp'd up, and the Lord Keeper <hi>Finch</hi> took

               <p>It is possible that the lenity of the King

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philanglus.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and to comply further with them,
he took as it were into his bosom, I mean
he admitted to his Privy Council, such
Parliament Lords who were held the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Zealots among them: The Lord <hi>Say</hi>
was made Master of the Court of Wards, the
Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> Lord Chamberlain. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55759:46"/>
to give a further evidence how firmly
he was rooted in his Religion, and how much
he desired the strengthning of it abroad, the
Treaty of marriage went on 'twixt his eldest
daughter and the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
may be added as a special Argument of
compliance, the passing of the Bill for a
<hi>Triennial</hi> Parliament, and lastly he was
brought to passe the <hi>Act of Continuance,</hi>
which prov'd so fatal unto him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Polyander.</speaker>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Triennial</hi> Parliament, I
heard of a Prophetick mistake that came
from a Lady of honour, who sending news
that time to the Country, did write, that the
King had passed a Bill for a <hi>Tyrannical Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
whereas she should have said <hi>Trien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial;</hi>
And touching the Act of Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
or perpetual Parliament, I heard a tale
of <hi>Archy</hi> the fool, who being asked whether
the King did well in passing that Bill, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>that he knew not whether the King was
the greater Fool to grant it, or they the greater
knaves to ask it.</hi> But the saying of the late
Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> is remarkable who saluted the
King the next morning with the stile of
<hi>fellow Subject,</hi> in regard that by that grant he
had transferred both <hi>Crown, Sword and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>


                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55759:46"/>
to the Parliament, for now we may
say, that <hi>England</hi> hath four hundred and
odd Kings in her: But tis observed, that
Princes of a hard destiny do follow the
worst Councils; But Sir, in lieu of these
monstrous Acts of Grace and trust, what
did the Parliament all this while for the
King.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philanglus.</speaker>
               <p>They promised, specially upon the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the last Act, that they would make
him <hi>the most glorious, the best beloved, and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
King that ever reigned in England,</hi> which
promise they voted, and confirmed with the
deepest protests and asseverations that could
be. Adde hereunto, that the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
was passed over unto them, who after a
long costly tryal was condemned to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
and so made a Sacrifice to the <hi>Scot</hi> (and
them) who stayed chiefly for his head.</p>

               <speaker>Polyander.</speaker>
               <p>Touching the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> 'tis true
he was full of ability, courage and Elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet I heard his wisdom questioned beyond
Sea in divers things. First, that having a
charge ready against his chiefest Accusers,
yet he suffered them to take the start of him,
and have priority of suit, which if he


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55759:47"/>
had got, he had thereby made them parties,
and so incapable to proceed against him;
Secondly, that during the time of his tryal,
he applyed not himselfe with that compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to his <hi>Jury</hi> as well as to his <hi>Judges,</hi>
for he was observed to comply only with the
Lords, and slight the House of Commons,
Lastly, that knowing he had both Parliament
and <hi>Scot</hi> his enemies, as also the <hi>Irish,</hi> he
would not go aside a while, and get beyond
Sea (which he might have easily done from
<hi>York)</hi> in lieu of coming up to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philanglus.</speaker>
               <p>I beleeve his death was resolved upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his comming from <hi>York,</hi> if not by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way of justice, yet by way of publique
expedience, which appears, in regard the
proceedings against him, was by a clause in
the Act <hi>not to be produced for a leading case,
for example to future ages, and other
inferior Courts.</hi> Good Lord, how the
rabble of the City thirsted after his
death! who were connived at, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
by the Parliament it selfe to strut up
and down both before <hi>White Hall</hi> and,
<hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> where they cryed out,
that if the <hi>Common</hi> Law failed, <hi>Club</hi> Law
should knock him down: nay, their inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55759:47"/>
was permitted to swell so high, that
they demanded the names of those Lords
who would not doom <hi>Strafford</hi> to death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Polyander.</speaker>
               <p>Is it possible that the grave and solemne
high Court of Parliament should permit such
popular insolencies to be committed before
their faces.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philanglus.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and notwithstanding that the Lords
did often solicit the House of Commons to
take a course for suppressing them yet 'twas
not hearkened unto; nay when the King
had commanded a double guard of Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Watch-men (which is the usual way
by law) to attend at <hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> for
suppression of such disorders, the Commons
cryed out, that it was a <hi>breach of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of the House</hi> and a trenching upon their
liberties; so they took afterwards a band of
Souldiers to guard them of their own electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was never known before.</p>

               <speaker>Polyander.</speaker>
               <p>Me thinks that the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> being
gone, fair weather should have followed,
he was the cause of the tempest being thus
thrown over board.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>'Tis true, the Scots were dismissed a little
after, having Fidlers fare, Meat, Drink,
and Money for eleven Months together in
<hi>England,</hi> with <hi>Straffords</hi> head to boot. So
the King prepared to go for <hi>Scotland</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Articles, to <hi>hold</hi> a Parliament there;
This fill'd the house of Commons with odd
kind of jealousie, therefore they cast about
how to prevent the journey: so they did
beat their brains night and day about it,
so far that they sate upon Sunday in
debate, but with another proviso, that it
should not be made <hi>a Precident for future
ages,</hi> as the other <hi>Caveat</hi> was for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
against the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> Well,
the King went to his <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament, where
he fill'd every blank, for they did but <hi>ask</hi> and
<hi>have.</hi> He granted them what possibly they
could <hi>propone</hi> in point of governing, both
for <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> many received new ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
they made havock, and divided all
the Bishops Lands amongst them; for all


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55759:48"/>
which unparallel'd Concessions and Acts of
grace, as an argument of gratitude, they
caused an Act (though already in force) to
be publish'd and reviv'd. <hi>That it should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable,
and damnable treason in the highest
degree that could be for any of the</hi> Scots <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
conjunctly or singly to levy Arms, or any
Military forces upon any pretext whatsoever,
without the Kings royal Commission;</hi> but how
the <hi>Scot</hi> observed this solemn Act afterwards
the World knows too well.</p>
               <p>During the Kings being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that
formidable hideous Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi>
broke out; which the <hi>Irish</hi> impute to the
<hi>English</hi> Parl. First, in regard that one of their
accusations against <hi>Strafford</hi> was, that he
used the Papists in that Kingdom too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably:
Secondly, for the rigorous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
intended by the said Parliament
against the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks; Thirdly, for

the last of whom the Irish do hate in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

the stopping of that <hi>Irish</hi> Regiment of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered
Souldiers, which the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
by Royal Word and Letter to the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who relying upon that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment

               <p>The King having setled <hi>Scotland,</hi> was
his return to <hi>London</hi> received with much joy,
but though he was brought with a kind of
<hi>Hosanna</hi> into one end of the Town, he found
a <hi>Crucifige</hi> at the other; for at <hi>Westminster</hi>
there was a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> fram'd, a work of

when most of the moderate and well-minded
members were retir'd to their rest; in which
remonstrance, with as much industry and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

               <p>How could this agree with the <hi>Protestation</hi>

answered, that he would consider of this, and

               <p>A hard destiny it was for a King to lose
the love of his subjects in that manner, and
to fall a clashing with his great Council:
but under favour; that demand of the Militia
was somewhat too high: for every natural
Prince, and supream Governour hath an
<hi>inherent</hi> and inalienable right in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
strength of the Country, for though
the peoples love be a good Cittadel, yet
there must be a concurrence of some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
visible force besides, which no Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power may dispose of without his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and for him to transmit this power to
any other, specially to any that he mistrusts,
is the onely way to render him inglorious,

               <p>The Scepter and the Crown are but

There's none so simple as to think ther's

such as every one carrieth at his

suspect that an attempt might be made to

to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, yet upon the Lord
Mayors and Cities solicitation, hee came
back to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> to keep his Christmas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But when the Bill against Bishops was in
agitation, which lasted above ten Months,
and was twice cast out of the House of Peers,
a crue of hold sturdy mechanicks, Marriners,

ruffled again before <hi>White-hal</hi> and <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-hall,</hi>
and would have violated the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi>

               <p>The King finding such distempers still in
the Parliament, and knowing the chiefest

Authors of them who he had impeach'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but could get no justice against them in
an ordinary way, though he desir'd the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to <hi>direct</hi> him in a course how to go
on in the Empeachment in such extremity,
for desperate diseases requiring desperate
cures. He took the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> with him, and
making use of the next Coach he met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
at the Court gate, he went to the House
of Commons in person to demand five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which he would prove to be Traytors in
the highest degree, and to be the fomenters
of all these divisions, protesting unto them
upon the word of a King, that they should
have as fair and legal a Trial as ever men
had; in the interim, he desir'd onely that
their persons might be secur'd: The Walls
of both Houses, and the very stones of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
streets did seem to ring of this high car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the King, and the sound thereof far
and neer into the adjacent Countries, whence
the Plebeans (by incitement of some of the

               <p>'Tis true, the King went in state one day

               <p>The King as I told you before, having
gone to the House of Commons himself to

so, unusual voluntary collections
were made both in Town and Country;
the Seamstress brought in her silver thimble,
the Chamber-maid her Bodkin, the Cook
his silver spoon, the Vintner his Bowl into
the common Treasury of War and they who
contributed to so pious a work, were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
more then others in some Churches to
come to the <hi>Holy Communion</hi> in the very


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55759:69"/>
time of administration; And observed it was
that some sorts of <hi>Females</hi> were freest in
those contributions, as far as to part with
their Rings and earings, as if some <hi>Golden

which prov'd true for the <hi>Covenant</hi> a

have been a kind of Idol, as I shall make it
appear hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thus a fierce funestous civil War was a
fomenting in the very bowels of <hi>England,</hi>
which broke out into many storms and
showers of blood: The fatal Cloud where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this storm lay long ingendring, though
when it began to condense first it appeared
but as big as a hand, yet by degrees it did
spread to such a vast expansion, that it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
it self through the whole Region, and
obscur'd that fair face of <hi>Heaven</hi> which was

               </p>
               <p>The King fell to work then in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and made choice of the Earl of <hi>Linzey</hi>
for General of the Infantry, which choice
was generally cried up of all; Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>
was made General of the Horse, but that
election did not find such an applause;

Kings Infantry could get into the bottom


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55759:70"/>
Being put there in a fighting posture, and
having the wind favourable, the King gave
command to let fly the Cannons to begin
Battail; Thus a most furious Engagement
began, which lasted about three houres, till
night parted them; and some old <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>German</hi> Commanders who were there
employed in the Royal Army, reported af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
they never saw such a manful fight
in all their lives: Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> springing
ore a low hedge lind thick with the enemies
Musqueteers, pursued their Horse very far,
and did notable execution upon them all the
way, and had he not worried them so far,
and deserted the Infantry, or had not his
<hi>German</hi> Souldiers fallen a plundring too soon,
matters might have gone better with the
King.</p>

               <p>I heard it reported that this Battail was

the Rebellion and Massacre began in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was so, being the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> a
day fatal for blood; Now, though this
Battail of <hi>Edg-Hill</hi> may be said to be sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
inexpected, and unpitched, yet for posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ground 'twas fought in as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55759:71"/>
and a fit place for a battail as possibly
could be lighted upon, for the Combatants
had scope enough to fight, and the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
whereof there were multitudes upon
the rising adjacent grounds, might behold
all as plainly as a Tragedy acted upon a
Stage, or Cock fighting in a Pit.</p>
               <p>The Parliaments Army had the advantage
of the Kings in point of Infantry who were
very good Fire-locks, most of them having
been trained up in <hi>London,</hi> and so left their
<hi>Wares</hi> to follow the <hi>Wars.</hi> They had also
the advantage of the King in point of Arms,
for scarce three parts of four were Armed in
his Army: But for Cavalry, the Royalists
had the greater advantage, for the flower of
most of the English Gentry was there, in
so much that the life-Guard of the Kings
was computed to above one hundred
thousand pounds sterling of yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</p>
               <p>About the evening of the day following,
both parties retired from the field, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
back towards <hi>Northampton,</hi> the
Kings to their former road towards <hi>Oxford,</hi>
and in the way they took <hi>Banbury,</hi> where
there was a strong Garison for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which sure, as the Cavaliers gave out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

After this battail of <hi>Edge-Hill</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
diverse other traverses of war 'twixt
King and Parliament for about four years,
in which revolution of time, there were more
skirmiges and battails fought, then happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>There were mighty advantages indeed;

Towns of strength, both by Land and Sea.
They had all the Navy Royal; They had
the Tower of <hi>London</hi> with all the Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
and Arms of the Crown; They had
the Imposts and Customs, Poundage and


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55759:72"/>
Tonnage, they had the Exchequer at their
devotion, with the Revenues of King, Queen,
and Prince; They had the City of <hi>London,</hi>
which may be called the great Magazin of
men and money, where there is a ready sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of all things that may feed, cloath, or

               <p>Then they had <hi>Sea, City</hi> and <hi>Scot</hi> on
their side. But how came the <hi>Scot</hi> to be so

his Commission, considering the late great
Protestations and Oaths they had made not
to do it, by reviving the Act of Parliament

               <p>Those foolish Kirk men grew afterwards
his greatest enemies by virulent seditious
Preachments and Pasquils to corrupt and
lessen the hearts of the Subjects towards him
nay, when he made himself a Prisoner to the
<hi>Scots</hi> Army at <hi>Newark</hi> and <hi>Newcastle</hi> those
Kirk-men did so little resent his hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>Whereas, The common sort of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
who were bound to pay Tithes to
the Impropriation or Lords of the <hi>Erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as they stil'd themselves, were us'd to be
much incommoded, and oftentimes damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
because they could not take in their
Corn till the secular Lord had fetched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his Tithe, which he would sometimes
delay of purpose, to shew his Passion or
Power, whereby the whole Crop for not
taking the advantage of the weather, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
did suffer: The King for relief of
the Country Husbandman, appointed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Commissioners to take this grievance
into consideration, who after much pains
taken in the businesse, found out a legal
and indifferent way to purchase those Tithes


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55759:73"/>
and bring the Impropriator to take a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary

               <p>Just as the Kirk-men did; But you shall
hear more, when the King, as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
had in a full Parliament confirm'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Scot</hi> all the priviledges of Kirk and
Kingdom, when he had made an oblation to
them of all the Bishops Lands, conferred
many honours and offices, and done them
many other obliging Acts of Grace, and all
this <hi>gratis,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Parliaments using al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to answer their Kings favours in this
kind, with a supply of Treasure, I say in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done all this <hi>gratis,</hi> He before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
desired them to continue their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
and live in peace, for they had not
now the least grievance to complain of, and
if any difference should fall out betwixt him,
and his <hi>English</hi> Subjects which he hoped
God would avert, He desir'd them not to
intermeddle, for whereas he might expect
and demand aid of <hi>them</hi> if the case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
yet he would not trouble the repose


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55759:74"/>
of that his <hi>Native</hi> Countrey: This they all
did not onely promise to do, but they did
solemnly oblige their Souls thereunto by
revival of the Act I told you of before,
at the publishing whereof one of their
Grandees fell on his knees, and lifting up
both his Arms, wish'd they might rot to his
body before death, if ever he would heave
them up hereafter, or draw sword against his
gid King; yet for all this they intruded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the Kings affairs, convok'd a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
without his summons, sent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and thrust themselves
to be <hi>Vmpires:</hi> They made besides, a strict
League with the English Parliament, and at
last rush'd into <hi>England</hi> again with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in the dead of Winter, which Army
they had levied not onely without, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
against the Kings Commission and
Countermands; that wretch who had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
vowed never to draw Sword again
without his Majesties Commission, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
comming General of the said Army: But
for Martial exploits the little credit that
Army got by storming <hi>Newcastle</hi> was not
countervailable to that which they lost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Hereford,</hi> where the Welchmen bang'd
them to some purpose from before the
Town, and made their General after 9
weeks siege to trusse up his pack and away,


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55759:74"/>
sending him a fat Sow with a Litter of
Piggs after her, and a blew Bonnet upon
her head for his Breakfast. I must inform
you farther, that the King being reduced
to much extremity in <hi>Oxford,</hi> by crosse
successes and <hi>Councils,</hi> he got away in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-mans
disguise to the <hi>Scots</hi> Army neer
<hi>Newark</hi> as his last refuge, which plot was
managed by the subtilety of the French A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
then residing here: A man would have
thought that Nation would have deemed
it an eternal honour to have their own
King and Country man to throw himselfe
thus into their Armes, and repose so singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
a confidence in them upon such an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
But they corresponded not with him
as he expacted; For though at first when
the English Parliament sollicited their <hi>Dear
Brethren</hi> for a delivery of the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
unto them, their note was then,
that if any stranger Prince had put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
so upon them, they could not with
honour deliver him up, much less their own
native King, yet they made a sacrifice of
him afterwards for a summe of money;
Whereupon <hi>Bellieure</hi> the French Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
being convoyed by a troop of <hi>Scots</hi> horse
to such a stand, in lieu of larges to the said
Troopers he drew out half a Crown piece,
and asked them how many pence that was,


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55759:75"/>
they answered thirty pence, he replied, for
so much did <hi>Judas</hi> betray his Master, and so
hurld them the half Crown.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Polyander.</speaker>
               <p>But afterwards the <hi>Scots</hi> carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bravely by sending a gay Army under
D. <hi>Hamilton</hi> to assist the King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Polyander.</speaker>
               <p>Touching that <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Army, the
bottom of its design is not known to this
day, and I was told, that when the King
heard of it, and that <hi>Himilton</hi> was in the
head of it, he should say; <hi>Then I expect but
little good to be done for me.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Polyander.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly the routing of that Army, was
a glorious exploit of the Lord Protector that
now is, his forces not amounting to the third
part of the <hi>Scots.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philanglus.</speaker>
               <p>It was certainly a very heroik Achive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as also was the battail of <hi>Dunbar,</hi>
where the Scots had greater advantages far
of him: which two exploits deserve to be
engraven in large Letters of Gold in the


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55759:75"/>
Temple of immortality, and transmitted
to after ages; For hereby he did more then
<hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, or after them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <p>But before I have done with this unlucky
Nation; I will give you a touch of those
visible Judgments which have fallen upon

in few years more then fell upon the

greatest plague in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> that ever was
in that Country, for in less then a twelve-month,
the Town was peopled with new
faces, the Pestilence having swept away
almost all the old: There have been above
2000 Witches arraigned and executed there
within these few years: After the routing
of D. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the battail of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi>
with that at <hi>Worcest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r,</hi> many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of that Nation have been bought and
sold in quality of slaves to be banished, and
sent over to forraign Plantations, what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of them were starved, and buried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were dead; And what is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of their hundred and ten Kings, and
their Crown? which I heard them brag,
was more weighty, as having more Gold in


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55759:76"/>
it then the English? and for their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they are reduced to be as pure a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
providence, and subject to the will
of the Conqueror as ever Country was.</p>

               <p>I must tell you also that they have lost
much of their repute abroad; but if I were
worthy to be heard by the Lord <hi>Protector,</hi>
I would make a motion that his Highnesse
would take in at least, all the Land 'twixt <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
and <hi>Edenburgh</hi> into the <hi>English</hi> Pale,
and impose a new name upon it for an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

the Skirts of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Our <hi>thoughts,</hi> as long as we keep them

the Law hath provided no punishment

The Law referrs that to the great

               <p>But Sir, now that you have been pleased

<hi>Civill</hi> matters, after they had monopolized
unto themselves all power by the Act of
Continuance?</p>

               <p>First I must tell you, that touching that
monstrous Act, the soundest Lawyers of the
Kingdome were of opinion, that it was of no
validity, that it was void in it self, in regard
that what grants or concessions soever the
King makes, the Law presupposeth, they are
alwayes made with these Proviso's, <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Regio, salvo jure Coronae;</hi> now it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that any grant could possibly trench
more upon the Right of the King or Crown,
as that extravagant Act of Continuance,
therefore it was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l in its own nature at the
first; nay, as some affirmed, the very <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall</hi>
of it was Treson in a high degree.</p>
               <p>But having hooked the power thus into
their hands, they strained it up to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pitch that could be; They made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Land-Lords of al the three Kingdoms,
it was a common thing to take any man,

house over his head, and make use of it for
their service; They meddled with every
thing, so far, that scarce a Church-warden or
Vestry-man could be made without them,
they would have a hand in making common
Counsel men, and Constables, with other
petty Officers.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Polyander.</speaker>
               <p>Me thinks that was somewhat derogatory
to the supremacy of their power, for great
Counsels should not descend to every petty
object, but with their high authority they
should enlarge their souls to consider of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versals.</p>

               <p>I could produce many Instances how they
undervalued themselves this way, but let this
one suffice. It happened one day that a
company of ramping wenches, who went
under the name of <hi>Mayds,</hi> or Holy Sisters,
came with a Remonstrance to shew their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to the House, and they were <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>

                  </gap>otion against him; Then, this <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi>
was made, with these two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso's
and reservations; First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it shold be
of no vertu and validity at all till the whole
Treaty were totally consummated; Secondly,
that he might when he pleased enlarge, and
cleer the truth hereof with the reservedness
of his meaning by publique Declaration;
Moreover, <hi>That</hi> Grant or Acknowledgment
was but a preambular proposition it was not
of the Essence of the Treaty it self; Now, as
the Philosophers and School-men tell us,
there is no valid proof can be drawn out of
<hi>Proems,</hi> Introductions, or Corollaries in any
Science, but out of the positive Assertions,
and body of the Text, which is only argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-proof,
so in the Constitutions &amp; Laws
of <hi>England,</hi> as also in all civill accusations
and charges, fore-running Prefaces (which
commonly weak causes most want) are not
pleadable. And though they use to be first
in place, like Gentlemen Ushers, yet are they
last in dignity, and shold also be so in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings;
Therefore there was too much hast
used by the Parliament to draw that <hi>Hyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I will not presume to determin that, only
I will inform you, that the Parliament took
the first Military gard; they first interdicted
trade: They countenanced all tumultuous
Riots, gave way to <hi>Club</hi>-law, and They kept
the King by force out of <hi>Hull,</hi> issued Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions

But if the supream power were in an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,

what's become of the power, sure it must rest
in the air, or sticking to the Walls of the

touching <hi>long</hi> Parliaments, I am of opinion, it
is the greatest and generallest grievance that
can be possibly to the English people, by
reason that besides other irregularities, it
stops the ordinary course of Law, in regard
of the priviledge they have, not to <hi>be subject
to arrest</hi> with others to whom they give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
now not one in four of that long
Parliament men, but ow'd money, and
what use Sir <hi>Peter T<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and others made of that
priviledge, to the detriment of a thousand
poor Creditors, is too well known: And
were such men, think you, fit to keep the
Kingdomes Purse in their Pockets so long?
but having got the Great Seal, as well as the
Sword into their hands, what signal Acts of
Justice did they do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philanglus.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true they had got the <hi>Seal</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi>
which the Law of <hi>England</hi> doth appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to the <hi>chiefest Magistrate,</hi> the one
should be girt onely to his side, and the
other hang at his Girdle; And it was told


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55759:86"/>
them to their faces by the knowingest Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in the House, that to cut a broad Seale
of <hi>England</hi> was the highest reason that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
could be attempted, without the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the <hi>Governor in chief.</hi> Now Sir touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any signal Act of Justice they ever did,
I am to seek to this day; but for horrid acts
and passages of in justice, I think there could
be produced a thousand clear, and <hi>yet crying</hi>
examples (which would make a greater vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
then the Book of <hi>Martyrs.)</hi> I mean
Acts that were done before the wars begun,
and after it was ended, which takes away
the specious colour of <hi>necessity</hi> wherewith
they varnished all their excesses and actions.</p>
               <p>I will instance onely in two (for this was

<hi>viz.</hi> The business of the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi>
and Sir <hi>John Stawel:</hi> the first a personage
who is a great ornament to this Nation by
his gallant comportments beyond the Seas,
the other one of the considerablest Knights
in the whole Country.</p>
               <p>Touching the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> he went with
consent of <hi>Parliament</hi> to his charge in the
Low Countries, not onely before the War,
but before any discontentment happened at
all 'twixt King and Parliament, and being
atten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing his said military charge at <hi>Breda</hi>
when the King of <hi>Scots</hi> came thither, and


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55759:87"/>
the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> being also there, he
could not avoid seeing them sometimes;
nor was there any Order or Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prohibit any body from doing so; but
for intermedling with any affairs of State,
or mixing with the <hi>Scots</hi> Council, he never
did it; At that time there happened to be in
<hi>Breda,</hi> many cashiered English Officers, and
among them one <hi>Faulkner,</hi> who having a
Petition drawn, and written all with his
own hand, the pourport whereof onely was,
that the King would <hi>releeve their necessities;</hi>
they desired the intercession of my Lord
<hi>Craven</hi> herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he with a civil Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
declined the business, for he was not
fit to do them service, because, as he said, he
was neither Courtier nor Servant to the
King. Hereupon <hi>Faulkner</hi> being offended,
both with King and <hi>Craven,</hi> in a passion
said (as 'twas proved) <hi>This it is to follwo a
thing called King, dam me, I'le to England
and do all the mischiefe I can;</hi> Being come to
<hi>London</hi> he forg'd <hi>another</hi> Petition, wherein
there were scandalous words against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<hi>viz.</hi> That they were <hi>barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
villains.</hi> Then going with a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the Parliaments who fed him with
Money to go on in his design, He made an
Affidavit upon Oath, that the foremention'd
Officers at <hi>Breda</hi> shewed this very Petition to


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55759:87"/>
the Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> who read it, and delivered
it to the King, (both which was damnably
false) As soon as this Deposition was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to the House, they presently voted
a Confiscation of all the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
He being then neer upon a thousand
miles off in <hi>Germany,</hi> and no soul appearing
for him, nor could any on his behalfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a Copy of <hi>Faulkners</hi> deposition: <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
having notice herof, he sent a most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Petition to the Parliament, declaring his
innocence, which Petition was sent in the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ambassadours Packet, who delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it accordingly; but it was denied to be
read in the House, because there was none
present, who could testifie they did see the
Lord <hi>Craven</hi> subscribe it; He sent afterwards
another Petition, but it was seven Months
before it could be read in the House; In
the mean time his estate had been sequestred,
his woods cut down, and other spoils done;
His Agents here to invalidate the Affidavit
of <hi>Faulkner</hi> indited him of Perjury, which
was clearly proved in open Court, and the
original Petition was produced, which
was written by <hi>Faulkner</hi> himselfe, wherein
there was not one syllable that spoke of the
Parliament; There was legal proofe also
made that <hi>Craven</hi> had nothing to do with
that Petition; This Inditement of perjury


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55759:88"/>
being found against <hi>Faulkner</hi> by the grand
Jury, the Parliament was informed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
yet neretheless a Bill passed for sale of
the Lord <hi>Cravens</hi> Estate, and Surveyors sent
accordingly to the Country; <hi>Faulkner</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus convicted of Perjury, it was prov'd
also in Court what a nefarious Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and most wicked fellow he was both in
his words and actions, how he had nothing
more common in his mouth, then <hi>dam me,
blood and wounds, and buggering of his Soul to
Hell:</hi> It was proved that at <hi>Petersfield</hi> he
<hi>drank a health to the Divel,</hi> and that he
should say our <hi>Saviour was a Bastard, and
but a Carpenters son, carrying a basket of
tools after his Father;</hi> The Parliament was
acquainted with all this, and divers ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and sedulous applications that possibly
could be made, were used, but nothing would
prevail.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Craven</hi> finding the House so
inexorable and obdurate, rather then so fair
an Estate should bee canconiz'd and squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
into so many hands, he proposed by
way of humble Petition, that the House
would punish him by way of pecuniary <hi>mulct,</hi>
and there were two able Knights attending

thereof, which motion the Lord <hi>General,</hi>

yet all would not do, but the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
of the Estate being return'd, the Bill of

of the House stepp'd in with the first to
buy the flour of his Lands, to the value of
6000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> as appears by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
made at <hi>Drury</hi> House in their own
names: That goodly house at <hi>Causam</hi> near
<hi>Redding</hi> being in excellent repair, was bought
by some, who for greedy lucre and gain ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
defac'd it, they pull'd down the Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scot,
Stair-cases, Lead, Iron, and all other
materials about the House, which had cost

having made such a subscription<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should
be admitted to a moderate Composition, which
was not to exceed two yeers value of any mans

               <p>Sir <hi>John Stawel</hi> having subscrib'd accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,

that he was compriz'd in <hi>Exon</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
made his addresse to. <hi>Goldsmiths</hi>
Hall, and producing the said Certificate
and Subscription, He Petition'd that hee
might be admitted to compound according

that hee was not capable of Composition
unlesse he would take the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Oath, whereunto he modestly repl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'d,
that there was no Article for that, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>è contrario;</hi> whereupon hee was not
onely barr'd of his Composition, but he was
sent Prisoner to <hi>Ely</hi> house; Afterwards by
the <hi>sole</hi> order of the House of Commons, he
was committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> for high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
in levying War against the Parliament,
where he continued almost four yeers, in
which time, he was several times i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dited of
Treason, and twice arraign'd at the K. Bench
Bar for his life; Then was he remov'd from
<hi>Newgate</hi> to the <hi>Tower</hi> and kept close Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
whence hee was several times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55759:90"/>
before the High <hi>Court of Justice,</hi>
which had been newly erected who after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
daies trial would neither <hi>sentence</hi> him, nor
<hi>acquit</hi> him, but onely certified their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, you must know, that presently
upon the taking of <hi>Exceter,</hi> his whole estate
was sequestred, and continuing so above 7
years, he being not allow'd a peny to put
bread in his mouth, hee visibly lost above
30000 <hi>l.</hi> which he humbly prayed might sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
for his Composition, which would not
have amounted to the sixth part so much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Article; He was not onely deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that, but a <hi>nigrum Theta</hi> a black Bill was
voted for selling away his whole Estate: A
little after, an <hi>Act</hi> being passed, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
appointed for the <hi>relief of Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
upon Articles</hi> in time of War, Sir <hi>John</hi>
made his addresses unto them, and after
above ten moneths debate of the business, the
whole Court (consisting of eight Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners)
delivered their opinions cleerly, that
Sir <hi>John Stawel</hi> was within the Articles of
<hi>Exon,</hi> that he had not broken any of those
Articles ever since, but exactly observ'd
and perform'd them, that consequently
Hee was not onely to have his person
unmolested, and his whole Estate <hi>resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him,</hi> but to have <hi>satisfaction</hi> for the

great losses he had received while his Estate
lay under Sequestration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This clear and positive Judgement being

then I, having had the honour to have
been a good while a small part thereof; They
were used to be the <hi>bulwark of our liberties,
the main banks and boundaries which kept us
from slavery, from the inundation of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

This high superintendent Court at
its first Constitution was used to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

And as the Heavenly bodies when three of
them meet in Conjunction, use to produce


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55759:92"/>
some admirable effects in the Great world,
so when the <hi>three States</hi> did use to convene
and assemble in one solemn <hi>Junta,</hi> some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and extraordinary things were used to
be brought forth tending to the wellfare of
the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Now, there were three essential proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that belonged to Parliament, <hi>viz. fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Election, fulness of Members, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Speech:</hi> 'Tis too well known how
little of all three were found in the late
long Parliament, specially the last, to wit,
<hi>liberty of speech.</hi> For none was permitted to
speak, unless he spoke still to the <hi>sense of the
House, to the sense of the House,</hi> which was a
pure restraint; what a deale of time was
spent in bandying of answers in Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances,
in Replies, Rejoynders, and descan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon words? so that the first 16. months
were spent meerly in chopping Logick with
the King, and nothing at all done; For <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Members,</hi> they were purg'd at last
very low, so that there was scarce the tenth
part of what they should have been in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
The King offered to give them a little
purge of five or six Drams, but it was furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
cast away, because there was too much
<hi>Basilicon</hi> in it. Then there was a purge of
<hi>eleven</hi> drams given them, wherein there
was some <hi>unguentum Armarium</hi> that cures a


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55759:92"/>
far off, which made some of them to flie
t' other side of the Sea, where one <hi>Member,</hi> as
soon as he put foot on shore, fell sick of the
Plague, and so was buried no better then in
the Town ditch, because he had first infected
the place; At last they had a good sound
purge, as big as a drench administred them,
which purg'd away above a hundred Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
at once; yet all this would not do, for
some Members were grown so corrupt and
putrid, that nothing could cure the House
but an utter <hi>Dissolution,</hi> according to the old
saying,
<q>—Immedicabile vulnus
Ense recidendum—</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which great Dissolution was made <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one tear, or drop of bloud,</hi> as the <hi>Portugal</hi>

               <p>The late <hi>long</hi> Parliament degenerated to
such a one, whereof thousands of instances
might be produc'd; Let this one serve at
present; The Army had occasion to make
their address to the House, upon a business
of a just and general concernment; But the
Grandees of the House answer'd, <hi>That if
they should read those demands, they might
chance to find them of that nature, as they could
not with justice deny them, nor with honour
grant them,</hi> &amp;c. But herein they shew'd
themselves but poor Politicians; for you
know it is a true Rule. <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Omnia dat qui usta negat.</hi> And was it not
time then for the Army to think of dismissing
their Memberships? But the truth is, that
if you go to the right rule of Parliament, they
had dissolv'd themselves I cannot tell how
often before; for besides that the Original
Writ from whence they deriv'd their power
was void by the Kings death, how often did
they rise up in confusion, without adjourning
the House? How oft did they sit without a
Speaker, he being fled to the Army? How
many hundred ways did they break their
own Priviledges? What things did they do
which they voted shoùld not serve for Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
hereafter? As <hi>Strafford's</hi> death, and


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55759:94"/>

were resum'd, being twice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ejected out of

and touching the <hi>Militia,</hi> &amp;c. yet were they
taken into debate again the same <hi>Session,</hi>
which is point blank against the very funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of Parliament: How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Petitions (some whereof were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the Lords) lay mouldring in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and were never so much as read in the
House? And was it not high time think you
to quell this <hi>Monster?</hi> or rather, to pull
down this <hi>Idol?</hi> Truly this great prudential
act of shutting up that House, and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up of that cold Postern door in the

are marvellous in our eyes; Nor do these

with the breath of them. <hi>England</hi> may be
said to be heretofore like an animal that

acquainted with her self; for in point of
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Treasure,</hi> she did never appear so
high both at home and abroad, as you said
before: This makes <hi>France</hi> to cringe unto

peace with Indian Patacons upon any terms:
This makes the <hi>Hollander</hi> to dash his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and vail his Bonnet so low unto her;
This makes the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, and all other

whom she cannot reach from her
Gun-rooms care not much for her.</p>
               <p>Now Sir among those many Heroick and
difficult exploits of divers kinds which his
Highness hath performed there is one Act
(humbly under favour) may well become the
greatness of his spirit; It is, to reach a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hand for preserving the stutely Temple of
<hi>Pauls</hi> from tumbling down, and from being
<hi>buried</hi> in her own <hi>rubbish;</hi> a Temple which
hath above a thousand yeers tugg'd with the
fury of the Elements, and the iron teeth of
<hi>Time;</hi> the goodliest pile of stones in the

               <p>'Tis also the greatest and most visible or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament

all others, as to be founded upon <hi>Faith,</hi>
having a spacious Church of that <hi>Name</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath

such a work, and one moneths Tax or two

Parliament, which in lieu of redressing grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
became it self at last the greatest grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.
As also of the practise and modesty of
Parliaments in former times, who declin'd

               <p>SIR,
Touching the account you speak of, that I
have endeavour'd to render of the traverses
that happen'd for matter of fact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> during the
Reign of the <hi>long Parliament,</hi> I have given
you but cursory short touches; There would
be subject enough for so many Tomes as
would make a Library, if one should relate
all; But for inferences and conclusions in
point of Judgement which may be drawn out
of what hath been said already, I leave that
to be done in the close of every ones private
Conscience.</p>
