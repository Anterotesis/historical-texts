            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my dearly Beloved FRIENDS, The Pariſhioners of <hi>Thoydon-Garnon,</hi> and others my Hearers at my Lecture at <hi>Epping.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>Beloved in the Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Told you the reaſon of my Preaching, you know the reaſon of my Printing theſe Sermons; I Preached them volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to eſtabliſh you, I Printed them by a kind of conſtraint to ſatisfie others. I Preached them to manifeſt the truth to prevent others miſleading you; I Printed them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Truth, I wiſh they may help you to reduce others. What my Publike labours (and open oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from ſome) have been among you, you are the beſt witneſſes; what my ſecret trouble hath been, partly from a ſenſe of mine own weakneſs, partly from ſome incapacity to do what I deſired among you, God and mine own conſcience can beſt teſtifie. I cannot but wonder at Gods providence in this, to put me to aſſert the outward Call of a Miniſter in Publike, who (it may be) have ſo often queſtioned mine inward Call in private. <hi>But hitherto hath God brought me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of you may have heard what ſolicitations I
<pb facs="tcp:59022:3"/>
have had to other places of greater profit; moſt of you know what reſolutions I had to return to the place whence I was driven, of leſſe means, had not your importunity, procuring their conſent, held me here. Many have been the ſcandals I have ſuffered about it, through the confident reports of bold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, for which I could willingly have Printed both your engagement to me here, and their teſtimony thence; the one to free me from the murmurings of ſome againſt mine abode here, the other to clear me from that falſe imputation of receiving profit thence, while that Living lay unreſigned in mine hands; but to have done it without conſent might not have been civil, to have done it at all (beſides the ſwelling of the book) might have ſavoured of arrogance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I forbear, my conſcience bearing me witneſs, and many upon the private ſight of the Papers being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>I did intend (if I had been in Print at all) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might have been more for your practice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I hope this may be for your profit: But ſince God hath called me out in this, I will improve it what I can. If by what I have already ſuffered, or may by this further undergo, you may receive any advantage, I ſhall think my labour well ſpent, and my ſufferings abundantly recompenſed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore beſeech you, 1. That you would not eſteem or be contented with any light or heat, but what is cauſed by the riſing and efficacy of the Sun of Grace in you. There are a ſort of people, who being <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> never ſtir at all, but lye ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in the grave: I ſpeak not this to them, although
<pb facs="tcp:59022:3"/>
I could be glad they might <hi>hear the voice of the Son of God and live:</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt would effectually call them (as once <hi>Lazarus)</hi> out of that deadly ſleep that hath ſeized on them. But there are others who ſeem to ſtir, yet not from a principle of true life in them: who continuing in ſinne, think it Grace enough to pretend to an opinion: who neglecting the Power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, content themſelves to talk of ſome Diſciplinary parts of Religion; I never liked their building, who begun the Fabrick at the roof, (but indeed he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to draw only the picture of an houſe, needs not care at which end he begins) I never fancied their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which begins (and ends too) only in opinion. To hear drunkards talk of gathering Churches, and ſwearers queſtion the Call of Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that is ſomething more then Diſciplinary) is ſuch a Paradox in Religion, that the Churches of Chriſt have not uſually bin acquainted with all. When men out of a deſire to appear ſomething, yet for want of any true work of Grace upon their ſpirits, ſhall take up only that faſhion of Religion, which may ſuit beſt the times in which they are, they may be good talkers, but ſeldom are ſound practiſers of godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>I would have you labour to finde the work of Grace upon your ſpirits, which may make you <hi>new creatures,</hi> for <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion, nor uncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on availeth any thing, but a new creature,</hi> Gal. 6. When that ſpring once moves the wheels, although the work may ſeem to go more ſlowly, and with ſome more trouble, yet it goes more ſurely, and with much more truth. Practiſe more the power then the ſhew of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs:
<pb facs="tcp:59022:4"/>
let your lives, rather then your tongues declare your Religion. Old-faſhioned, unskilfull Limners; were conſtrained to underwrite the name of what they Painted, that people might know what it was rather by the inſcription then the draught. Such is the new-faſhioned Religion of ſome men, that if they did not tell you, it was Religion they profeſſed, men would ſcarcely deem it ſuch by their profeſſion. People are apt to think well of being Religious, but they are often miſtaken in what is Religion: they will grant <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be great gain,</hi> but they are not convinced what is godlineſs. If I finde a man once ſhaken, who hath been truly rooted; miſled, who hath been ſet right in Gods way; as I am apt to be much troubled for him, ſo I deſire to be very tender of him: but when I ſee a looſe and light body <hi>toſſed with every minde,</hi> I am little affected with it; It is as much wonder to ſee the one ſtable in bluſtring times, as the other ſhaking.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall intreat you, That you would now be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the ſtudy of Fundamentall Truths. When Fundamentals are queſtioned, we had need to be well ſatisfied about them: when the foundation is aimed at, the greateſt defence had need to be made there. <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to ſee the Romans, <hi>to eſtabliſh them,</hi> Rom. 1. 11. it is from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is rendred (by one) <hi>ruitur a ſuffulcio:</hi> ſurely if ever people had need to be eſtabliſhed in the Truth, it is now; when truth (in this ſenſe) decays, and its very foundation begins to be ſhaken. When men build their Religion upon props ſet up by their own fancy, they may quickly be carried beſides the Truth. It is a ſtrange thing to ſee how men now adaies delight moſt in the looſe notions of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
<pb facs="tcp:59022:4"/>
but little in the ſtanding. Truth laid by Gods Word. This is to loſe Truth in the miſt of their own making, and to put out their own eyes by the duſt they themſelves have raiſed; they that flie ſo high in their affected, although confuſed notions, frequently leave the Truth behind, when through the coldneſs of the ſecond region, they are ſo frozen in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that (if ever they return) they ſeldom purſue Truth with much love after. This is to lay up a mans Religion in a Caſtle built in the Air, when <hi>every winde of Doctrine may toſſe it to and fro.</hi> It is an unhappy thing, that ſome men are guilty of, to delight in expreſſions they underſtand not, and to be loſt in the purſuit of thoſe cloudy notions they cannot reach: when they are alwaies pointing at what they have but ſmall ken of themſelves, although they cannot diſcover them to others. By this the growth of true Religion is much hindered in them, and the profit of Chriſtian confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence much prevented in their meetings, when much is propoſed, a great deal talked of, but little gotten, nothing agreed on. There is more advantage to be gotten in one hours conference with him, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands and will ſpeak of a Fundamentall in Religion, then in many dayes with thoſe; for although there leſſe may be talked of, there is more diſcovered.</p>
            <p>I would have you much in the ſtudy of faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To that end reade much of the Scripture, and of thoſe other good Books (written by godly men) which God hath holpen this age with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. I could wiſh (beſides others) you would be all well verſed in that little Carechiſme I uſe among the 
 younger people: <note place="margin">The Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies (<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </note> 
which although ſmall in bulk, is as
<pb facs="tcp:59022:5"/>
full ſtuffed with ſound Truths as ever I ſaw any ſo cloſely comprized. Enquire after the good old way, and walk in it. The moſt of our new lights are but old darkneſſes, which are cauſed rather by the privation, then the encreaſe of true Light: moſt of our new truths are but old errours, riſing afreſh out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit; the hand of liberty having rouled away that ſtone, which the arm of Government had before laid to ſtop the mouth of it.</p>
            <p>Beware of controverſies that are either above your reach, or leſſe neceſſary to Religion: the former may puzzle and perplex you; the later but diſturb and unquiet you: the former often ends in defection from the Truth; the later only in difference and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention among (ſeeming) brethren: By both men are frequently ſo forced or perſwaded from the Truth, that if they are not hurried into one, they are cheated into another errour. When <hi>Peter</hi> would prevent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>falling from their ſtedfaſtneſs,</hi> he preſſes them <hi>to grow in Grace,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18. A low houſe ſetled upon a good foundation, will ſtand longer then an high tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering edifice upon a weak baſis. Not that I would have you contented with ſmall meaſures, low ſtatures in Grace; build as high as you will, as you can, only let the foundation be firm and proportionable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I would beg you to meaſure all the Doctrines you hear by the line of Gods word: ſeeing there <hi>are falſe ſpirits gone forth into the world, it is good to try the ſpirits, whether they are of God or not,</hi> 1 John 4. 1, 2. It is an evil thing (in this) <hi>to have mens perſons in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> If the beſt of men on earth, if an Angel from Heaven ſhould bring any other Doctrine, then what is
<pb facs="tcp:59022:5"/>
left by Chriſt for your direction, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi>

If a ſtone be looſe, although upon a good foundation, it is no difficult thing to remove it: that will moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably continue, which is well faſtened.</p>
            <p>When men pin their faith upon others ſleeves, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever thoſe ſleeves are ſtretched out, their Faith muſt follow: when doctrines are judged of by the men that bring them (be it what it will) it can only be ſo prevalent, as the man that vents it is of Authority with them that hear it. The Corinth. vvere accuſed as carnal that they pretend, ſome to <hi>Paul,</hi> others to <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 4. when yet they were both Miniſters, v. 5. (Good God!) vvhat are they, who are ſome for this,
<pb facs="tcp:59022:6"/>
others for that gifted brother, who are no Miniſters, only intrude into that Office intruſted unto others. Thus men beſt like, and moſt cry up thoſe Preachers who are of that party they moſt affect, and then the Doctrine they bring, whether true or falſe. This is to judge of things by the men that do them (a falſe rule) and not of men by the things they do. Hence the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing party hath alwaies moſt followers, ſuch <hi>Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> Preachers can command Audience. It is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our late Aſtrologers to gaze only on thoſe Stars which are <hi>aſcendant,</hi> and ſtill ſpeak beſt of thoſe Conſtellations which have the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> influence, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they have but a favourable aſpect towards them: whoſe Prognoſticks are calculated for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians of ſtrength and weakneſs, of power and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. I vviſh it vvere not too much the fault of our new-faſhioned hearers, vvho love not the light of the brighteſt Star, if not of their party.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall hope, and ask better things of you: let truth and falſehood be the cauſe of your eſteem or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect of what you hear: let that have beſt reception with you, which hath moſt Authority from Scripture, although leaſt of the power of men vvith it. When falſe coyn is abroad, all men will look to the money they receive: Seeing it hath been foretold, that in the laſt daies (vvhich are theſe) there ſhould come ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and our experience tels us it is fulfilled, let us try before vve truſt, and examine the Doctrine vve hear, before vve believe it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I vvould have you ſuſpect, and be ſhy of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doctrines pleaſe the fleſh; of vvhatſoever it is that indulgeth corrupt nature. Fleſh and bloud are no
<pb facs="tcp:59022:6"/>
more apt to love, then they are able to <hi>enter into the Kingdom of God: the fleſh luſteth against the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. It is very unlikely that ſhould be from the ſpirit, which is delightfull to the fleſh. Many <hi>ſmooth the way,</hi> and <hi>widen the gate</hi> to heaven, I pray God they lead not people that way to hell. <note place="margin">Facilis deſcenſus Averni, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
The down-hill 
 paſſage is moſt eaſie. Where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The way is narrow, and the gate is ſtrait that leads to life,</hi> Mat. 9. 13, 14. he preſently ſubjoyns a ſeaſonable warning; <hi>to take heed of falſe Prophets.</hi> The way may be paved with Agates, which yet may be painfull to the feet of the traveller; the gate may be made of Diamonds, which yet may be ſtrait in the paſſage.</p>
            <p>It hath been the generall practice, and conſtant ſign that God hath given of falſe Prophets, <hi>to preach ſmooth things: they promiſe peace,</hi> Jer. 23. 17. <hi>they ſeduce my people, ſaying, Peace, when there is no peace, and daub with untempered morter,</hi> Ezek. 13. 10. <hi>they ſee viſions of peace,</hi> ver. 16. <hi>they ſow pillows to</hi> All <hi>armholes,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>they ſave the ſouls alive,</hi> ver. 19. <hi>they ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, promiſing life,</hi> v. 22. It is the duty and delight of true Prophets, to promiſe life, to preach peace to thoſe who are entitled to it. Yea they would that the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſes of the falſe Prophets might be fulfilled; as <hi>Jer. 28. 6. Amen, the Lord do ſo, the Lord perform the words which thou haſt propheſied:</hi> but to ſpeak pleaſing things to him that lies in ſin, is ſo far from preaching Heaven, that it may occaſion mens running to hell. What eaſe, what advantage can it be to godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to threaten judgement againſt ſinners, were it not for Gods command, and their profit? What proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb facs="tcp:59022:7"/>
is there, that people ſhould receive advantage by thoſe doctrines that continue their carnall peace? They were falſe Teachers, who by <hi>their lies</hi> cauſed prophane people to reproach the true Prophets with <hi>the burthen of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 33. they thereby refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the words of the true Prophets, becauſe they ſpake of the judgement of God againſt them: but men that are proclive to ſleep need no rocking.</p>
            <p>Let me in the Name of the Holy God, warn you of any doctrine that favours, or tends to ſinfull liberty. Indeed Chriſt hath purchaſed liberty to his Saints, but <hi>we must not uſe our liberty as an occaſion to the fleſh, Gal.</hi> 5. 13. To be Chriſt's freemen and ſins ſlaves at the ſame time, is impoſſible. I cannot but wonder at ſome new Preachers, who cry up <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> as if there were nothing of <hi>juſtice</hi> or <hi>truth</hi> in God at all: who dare promiſe mercy to <hi>ſinners,</hi> and by their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of life, ſtrengthen their hands in wickedneſs?</hi> It is one thing to offer mercy to people upon repentance; another to promiſe mercy to them while ſinners. It is one thing to hold out Chriſt to them that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; another, to promiſe Chriſt to them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Religious <hi>Greenbam</hi> ſpeaking how God had joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed godlineſſe and the means of godlineſſe together, calls them frantick hereticks that neglect the means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Beware of them, who dare perſwade you to a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect 

 of duty, who by their preaching can intimate it as needleſs to be preſſed, as unneceſſary to be practiſed. If there are Impoſtors under heaven, if there are any upon earth, that bring <hi>another Goſpel</hi> then what Chriſt left, theſe are the men; who under a pretence of preaching Chriſt and free-grace, brand all thoſe with the name of <hi>legal Preachers,</hi> who but endeavour to convince people of ſin, or perſwade them to their duty. As if diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:59022:7"/>
to men their need of Chriſt, were not preaching of Chriſt; and that the Spirit had not been ſent by Chriſt, who came to <hi>convince the world of ſin,</hi> Joh. 16. 8. As if preſſing men to the duty the God of mercy requires, were to deny the freeneſſe of grace; and that <hi>Peter</hi> had abridged the free grace of God, when he commanded people to <hi>repent and be converted, that their ſins might be blotted out,</hi> Act. 3. 19. As if there were no difference between duty and deſert, between means and merit. There is a vaſt difference between what God requires as a means, to which <hi>ex gratiâ</hi> he promiſeth a reward, and the doing of a work which <hi>ex debito</hi> deſerves its wages. In this there is a proportion between the work and the reward, yea, the man performing it doth the work by his own ſtrength: but in the other, beſides the diſproportion between the thing required, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſed; and beſides his love (in whoſe power it was) to impoſe no harder a task upon us, he that out of grace promiſeth the reward, out of the ſame mercy gives ſtrength to perform the means. So that in this, the doctrine of free-grace is much advanced. Can it be thought that man muſt be only paſſive in the work of his ſalvation? To what end had he a reaſonable ſoul gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, if not to imploy its faculties (eſpecially) for that <hi>better part which cannot be taken from him? Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> might have been cured without the application of figs: <hi>Naaman</hi> might have been healed without going to <hi>Jordan,</hi> yet the not uſe of commanded means might have prevented their deſired deliverance (but of that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fra.)</hi> 
               <q>It is a pretty obſervation of learned <hi>Perkins</hi> upon <hi>Rev. 3. 20. If any man will open,</hi> &amp;c. mans will is not like a piece of wax, only paſſive, which without any
<pb facs="tcp:59022:8"/>
action receiveth impreſſion; but as fire, which as ſoon as it is fire, it burns, and as ſoon as it burns it is fire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is the ſad effect ſuch preaching hath produced in many hearers (in ſome that I dare not but hope wel of) that they ſcarcely endure to hear any thing of duty preſſed. They can be content to hear of believing as a Goſpel-duty, but if repentance or obedience be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that is, what we cannot perform, theſe are but legal duties. As if believing were leſs a duty, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; or that we were of our ſelves more able to perform one then the other. Or as if repentance were leſs a Goſpel-duty then believing: when it is manifeſt that repentance could have no place under the legal Covenant. The Covenant of works was to do or die: under which, as we are unable to perform, ſo neither 

 could we be profited by repentance. <note place="margin">For this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that of <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 14, 15. Note it well: Chriſt is ſaid to preach the Goſpel when he preached repentance.</note> It is only the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace through Chriſt that admits repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. That came in through Jeſus Chriſt, it was one of the new laws given us by that Lord, and then can be nothing elſe but a Goſpel-duty. How eaſie is it for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to miſtake? and then with violence to purſue what through-miſtake they propoſe as good? like ſome hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mettal'd doggs, which over-hunting the true ſent, are either quite beaten out, or follow what is falſe.</p>
            <p>Friends! Is duty more out of faſhion now than it was? Is it the liberty of Chriſtians to be free from Gods ſervice? To be <hi>free from ſin,</hi> was to be <hi>ſervants to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 6. 18. Can the encreaſe of mercy free us from, or ſhould it engage us more to duty? May I not ſay to thoſe who are guilty, as <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 3. 1. <hi>Oh fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey he truth?</hi> Do but obſerve what an unchriſtian liberty
<pb facs="tcp:59022:8"/>
ſome have made uſe of (even ſome profeſſors of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) ſince this doctrine of liberty hath been ſo much preached: unto what an height of groſſeſt prophaneſs, of <hi>ranting</hi> wickedneſs ſome have run, who began but at the neglect of duty! Tender conſciences would be afraid of ſuch occaſions of evil. Duty helps to pinnion the wings of the fleſh; take off that pinnion, give the wings but liberty, whither (ſhort of heaven) may it not flie? Duty lops off the exuberant branches of the old ſtock; neglect that, the ſprouts may quickly grow long and thriving.</p>
            <p>Good God! what hardſhips do not only the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but the truth of Chriſt ſuffer from men of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary mindes? It hath been the Miniſters work former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vindicate their Miniſtry againſt Papiſts, becauſe not ordained in their Sea: It is now their buſineſs to uphold their Miniſtry againſt thoſe, who would null their Call, becauſe (as they ſay) received from <hi>Rome.</hi> It was not long ſince that our great conteſt was againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who from the Scriptures preſſing duty, would have inferred a power in mans Will to perform it: We have now to do with them, who becauſe man hath no power in himſelf naturally to perform it, would have no duty preſſed at all. Thus are we ground between tvvo milſtones: But neither extream is good, when <hi>virtus</hi> is in the middle. The Truth is, men love not Duty, and therefore diſlike the preſſing it: they delight in ſin, and therefore hate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it, They would <hi>ſtand still all the day idle,</hi> yet willingly <hi>receive the penny,</hi> as if they had <hi>wrought in the vineyard.</hi> Ephraim <hi>loves to tread out the corn, but not to break the clods,</hi> Hoſ 10. 11. people are willing
<pb facs="tcp:59022:9"/>
to receive the profit, but love not, like not the burthen of the work: they would feed upon the corn of the bleſſing, but love not the yoke of obedience: Love then that preaching beſt that moſt diſcovers your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Be willing to perform whatſoever God requires of you: Let this prevail with you to ſet up Duty in your families, to practiſe obedience in your perſons: The Lord knows how many families there are in which duty was never yet ſet up, and obſerves where it hath been begun, but is now neglected. The Lord grant that none of you be found in the number of thoſe <hi>enemies that will not have Chriſt to rule over them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe reproving of ſin, and threatning judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt it; preſſing duty upon the people, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing mercy upon the performance of it, is looked on as ſo legal, ſo unſutable to Goſpel-preaching; as what too much ſtraitens Gods grace, and enlargeth mans power beyond the rule, I'le lay down ſome things briefly to vindicate it from all miſtakes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is leſs probable deceit, not ſo much palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble danger in reproving ſin, and threatning judgement againſt it, whereby people are convinced of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; than in holding out large and inconditionate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of grace, from which men groundleſly may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect mercy. There may be more pain in ſearching of the wound, but there is leſs danger; there may be more eaſe in skinning of it, but leſs ſafety. We finde the Scripture very often condemning falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets for <hi>preaching ſmooth things, promiſing life, and thereby ſtrengthening the hands of the wicked in ſinne</hi> (in many places, as was touched on before,) but
<pb facs="tcp:59022:9"/>
where do we find any prohibition of, or reprcof for an endeavor to <hi>convince the people of their ſin,</hi> that they may afterward be <hi>convinced of righteouſneſs?</hi> The Scribes and Phariſees are ſaid to <hi>binde heavy burthens upon others ſhoulders,</hi> Mat. 23. 4. they preſſed a ſtrict obſervance of the Law, a burthen too heavy to be born by mens own ſhoulders; but their fault was not in preſſing of the Law, but in preſſing it as a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe of life, not ſhewing them the way, how E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelically through Chriſt to perform it. Thus to preſs the law is blame-worthy. But ſecondly, Their fault <hi>there</hi> reproved was not ſo much in preſſing the Law as the rule of obedience, but not practiſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what they preſſed upon others, not walking by the ſame rule themſelves. For you ſee Chriſt gives it as a charge to people, to obey what they commanded, <hi>ver. 3. Whatſover they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do.</hi> How often was Chriſt and his Apoſtles in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſin, and threatning puniſhment! <hi>Luk. 13. 3. 5. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. <hi>unrighteous, drunkards, extortioners,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> beſides many other places.</p>
            <p n="2">2. (Not to name the practice of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,) it hath been the unqueſtioned method of Chriſt and his Diſciples, to preſſe thoſe duties upon people, which by their own ſtrength they are not able to perform. Chriſt preached repentance, which was not in mans power (of himſelf) to practiſe, <hi>Matth. 4. 7. John</hi> preached it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 2. The Diſciples preached it, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 8. 12. Nay, it was part of the work he preſcribed them after his reſurtection; that <hi>repentance and remiſsion of ſins ſhould be preached to all
<pb facs="tcp:59022:10"/>
Nations in his name,</hi> Luk. 24. 47. The command <hi>Peter</hi> gave a people unable of themſelves to perform it, was, <hi>repent and be converted,</hi> Act. 3. 19.</p>
            <p>Surely that's the beſt preaching that is neareſt the pattern given in the Mount; that is the moſt Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of teaching, that is moſt agreeable to Chriſt's method. One upon <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. calls repentance, the 

 very ſumm of the preaching of <hi>John,</hi> of Chriſt, of the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Summa &amp; caput praedicationis, Johanuis, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti &amp; Apoſtolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>m.</note> 
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. What duty people are preſſed to from the word, it is their ſin not to do; through their own default they are not able to perform. So that if it were for no other end, but to ſhew Gods right that he hath to our obedience, our wickedneſs that we are not able to practiſe it, our duty, what we ought to perform, this were ſufficient cauſe of preſſing it, and from this good uſe might be made of it. Diſobedience to the Law is ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 4. it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Although the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of duty can deſerve no reward, yet the not doing it deſerves ſevere puniſhment. <note place="margin">Note.</note> The great end of God's 

 giving Scripture was, <hi>to reprove, to inſtruct, 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 16. What muſt we <hi>reprove</hi> if ſin muſt not be ſpoken of? What <hi>inſtruction</hi> muſt be given, if duty muſt not be preſſed? Yea, it is intimated, that who would not hear <hi>reproof, rebuking, exhortation,</hi> would not endure <hi>ſound doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>That people cannot perform what God requires, is from their own defaults: ſo that it is no injuſtice in God to require it. <hi>God made man righteous,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 29. he may juſtly require according to what he gave, not according to what we <hi>have.</hi> The Maſter that gave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny talents, may require the whole ſumm, although the
<pb facs="tcp:59022:10"/>
ſervant (through his idleneſs) is not able to pay it. It is <hi>meer mercy,</hi> that <hi>God accepteth according to what a man hath,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12. he may in juſtice require according to what he firſt gave.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The preſſing of duty upon people unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, is the ordinary, and may prove the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious means to enable men to do it. The <hi>Ninevites</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented at the preaching of <hi>Jonah,</hi> Mat. 12. 41. <hi>Peter</hi> preached repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9. and ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were (by Gods bleſſing on it) enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. 4. The few that were truely <hi>choſen,</hi> were of the number of them who were outwardly <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> before, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 14. I confeſs the means is not effectual to all, but muſt it be therefore uſed to none? nay, becauſe we know not to whom it may be effectual, therefore it muſt be uſed to all, that it may be profitable to thoſe to whom God intends it. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are much miſtaken in the preſſing of duty, who look upon it onely as a <hi>command</hi> of obedience, not at all as a <hi>means</hi> of profit: in the commands of God, there is not only a diſcovery of duty, but an offer of power and ſtrength to perform it. It were but vain to bid a groveling child ariſe, which of it ſelf is unable; but if at the ſame time I hold forth my hand to help it, it may be a means to raiſe it. It had been an hard injunction of Chriſt, to bid <hi>Lazarus ariſe,</hi> when he had been dead four daies and not able to ſtir: but when the voice carried with it a ſecret power to enable him, he was able to come out of the grave: it was the Angel that ſtirred the water, whereby the diſeaſed were cured at <hi>Betheſda;</hi> muſt not impotent people be adviſed therefore to go to the pool, becauſe of
<pb facs="tcp:59022:11"/>
themſelves they could not work the cure?</p>
            <p>But where commanded duties are not practiſed, they leave them without excuſe that neglect them. God ſent <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to a ſtubborn people who (he knew) neither would nor could practiſe his commands, that they might <hi>know that there was a Prophet among them.</hi> Ezek. 2. 5.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Duty is not preſſed by Miniſters as a meritorious cauſe of ſalvation, but as the condition which God requires in them to whom he will give it. <hi>When we have done all we can, we are unprofitable ſervants,</hi> Luk. 17. May not God, who in free love gives the reward, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what condition he pleaſeth? nay, which is more, he that propoſeth the condition, makes people to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he requires: (as was touched before) which is very plain, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, 26. 27.</p>
            <p>The reſult of all is, To beſeech you to conſider, how they cheat you of the Truth, and may deceive you of your Souls, who preach the neglect, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of that Duty God commands and will have (though he himſelf work it) in thoſe to whom hee'l ſhew mercy: ſuch who call the <hi>way eaſie and broad,</hi> which Chriſt calls <hi>ſtrait and narrow:</hi> that <hi>promiſe life</hi> to men in ſin, and <hi>ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked</hi> in their iniquity.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I ſhall deſire you: That you would be more in judging of yourſelves, then in cenſuring others. It is (now) a great part of ſome mens Religion, to finde or make faults in others, when they obſerve not their own: <note place="margin">Magis utimur ſpectacillis quam ſpeculis.</note> they uſe ſpectacles to look on others whereby 

 their faults are multiplied, but endure not a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſſe to reflect upon themſelves that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb facs="tcp:59022:11"/>
might be diſcovered. Indeed mens eyes are naturally placed to look outward on others, when they need the help of ſome reflecting glaſſe to take an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward view of themſelves. But ſurely there is (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides nature) ſome wicked art, whereby they are holpen, notwithſtanding <hi>the undiſcovered beam in their own eye, to obſerve ſo clearly a ſmaller moth in their Brothers.</hi> People are ſo buſied to eſpy faults in other mens houſes, that they neglect the cleanſing of their own.</p>
            <p>You may obſerve others faults privately to reprove, not publickly to reproach a Brother: you may take notice of others ſins, to be warned by their falls, not to make it an occaſion of ſinning to you: yet in this, as I would not have you judge them by the reports of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo neither to meaſure them by the line of malice. As report like an evil ſpirit often preſents that which never was in ſubſtance: ſo malice like a falſe glaſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents double what is.</p>
            <p>Be chiefly in the examination of your ſelves, with what face will you reprove others, when your own faults are more eminent? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 21, 22, 23. A dirty bruſh ſeldom makesclean clothes. If your brother be guiltleſs when you accuſe him, it manifeſts malice, at leaſt too much credulity, if faulty; yet when you are guilty, it argues too little ſincerity. <hi>Prove your ſelves,</hi> was <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, 2 Cor. 13. 5. The beſt Chriſtian is moſt at home; the beſt husband is moſt converſant in his own books.</p>
            <p>Is it that there is not work enough at home, that you are ſo buſie abroad? Is not the ſin of your life enough to employ you in the examination of, and
<pb facs="tcp:59022:12"/>
mourning for it? will not the making ſure your title to Eternal happineſs finde you work enough in private? (poor ſouls!) If you have not work enough to day, you will be ſure to make more before the morrow. Obſerve your own ſins, and endeavour to avoid them: mark your own temptations, and endeavour to reſiſt them. Let your own tempations make you pitty others if they do fall: Let your own aptneſs to fall plead ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, if it be but an infirmity: I would not have you too rigid againſt the (only) infirmities of others, yet I would not have you too indulgent toward your own. I would have you do with infirmities, as modeſt Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives do with ſome leſſer pieces of ſluttery, although they will not endure it in their own, yet they will excuſe it in their neighbours houſe. Then ſhall I think you religious indeed, and that the Lord intends good to your ſouls, when you accuſe not others, but your ſelves; when your endeavour is more to amend your own, then obſerve others deformities.</p>
            <p>I thought to have ſpoken a word to you about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but I have been too long in the porch already, beſides, that concerning mine own Congregation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhall refer it to a more private occaſion: You may conceive upon what grounds I adminiſter it; you know for what reaſons I have for ſome time forborn it; ſome of you have been informed what courſe I am about in our future preparation for it. Onely I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve that thoſe who before made it their argument againſt us, that we adminiſtred it to ſome, whom we had then no power to debar; are novv as apt to reproach us, vvhen they think we have as little povver to reform it. But I am comforted in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb facs="tcp:59022:12"/>
that I had declared my reſolutions about it, before it was objected againſt us. I ſee it is hard to be free from blame, when men love to finde fault.</p>
            <p>All I have now to ſpeak to you, is that you would not turn your back upon the Truth. Some may neglect the reading, from a want of deſire to know Truth; others may caſt a way all as falſe, becauſe not ſuitable to their fancy. This will prove a laſting record againſt you, if I ſhall not now prevail with you.</p>
            <p>If the Preaching of Ordained Miniſters be the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, then wait upon it; run not up and down after unprofitable Teachers; the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>They ſhall not profit</hi> (as in the book:) And one of their great pen-men in part confeſſeth that they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, nor beget faith: as ſhall be ſhewed in the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix after it. God (through his great mercy) hath not left me wholly without witneſs (I mean ſome ſeal of my Miniſtry among you) the Lord increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that I may <hi>give up mine account with joy.</hi> It hath frequently troubled my ſoul in private, to think what hopefull Reformation among us hath been hindred by the falſe aſperſions, and cauſeleſs oppoſition of ſome: But the Lord will require it at their hands. The good God pardon it.</p>
            <p>Beloved, Let not ſuch things diſcourage you; it is a ſign God hath ſome work to do, where the Devil ſtirs oppoſition againſt it. I would beſeech you to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> Jude ver. 3. and with <hi>Paul,</hi> I ſhall beg you to be <hi>ſtedfast, unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, alwaies abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi> The Lord appear ſo upon you and me, that we may order our converſation according to his will, that we may all
<pb facs="tcp:59022:13"/>
walk that way he hath preſcribed us to heaven. That when the great day of account ſhall come, we may all have our names written in the Book of Life, which is the earneſt prayer of,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Pologies of (this nature) are ſo cuſtomary, that when most ſincerely and needfully uſed, they are judged but Complements. The needleſſe requeſts of ſturdy beggars make many want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medicants go without their alms. Such is this Subject, of which many have ſpoken ſo much, and ſome ſo well, that it is hard to ſay any thing that hath not been touched on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſuch my ſenſe of weakneſs (of which too much is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in this) that it is hard to ſay any thing at all worthy. Wherefore I might plead ſufficient and real excuſe, were it not that I fear the excuſe it ſelf would again need to be excuſed: For, if it be fruitful, why ſhould not the Sun ſhine on it, without the Gentleman-uſher of a Complement to bring it forth? if not, why had not the darkneſs ſtill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it? But there being a kinde of <hi>neceſſity laid upon me,</hi> which, although no fair pretence for abſolutely unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, may be a juſt plea for ſeemingly inconvenient things; I ſhall give you a ſhort and inoffenſive narrative of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and then be willing to bear what blame you ſhall juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay upon me.</p>
            <p>In my Lecture at <hi>Epping,</hi> which (at firſt) I voluntarily and freely ſet up, and now (for ſometime) have conſtantly and gainleſly maintained; I lately handled the <hi>neglect of the Goſpel,</hi> on <hi>HEB. 2. 3.</hi> In which, preſsing the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to receive the Goſpel, I gave (amongst others) this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; <hi>(viz.) That they would eſteem and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:59022:14"/>
the Miniſters that brought it:</hi> which was urged from <hi>1 Theſſ. 5. 12.</hi> My reaſon was, <hi>Becauſe people ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome receive profit by any meſſage, unleſs they look upon him as Commiſſioned that delivers it.</hi> From this I conceived my ſelf engaged to diſcover who were Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to preach the Goſpel: not onely becauſe the Office of the Ministry in theſe daies, and about that place, hath been ſo much decried, and that I was ſo much importuned by godly people to ſpeak ſomething of it, but in regard of the profit people might receive by being ſatisfied and ſetled in it: for I am apt to apprehend, that a great cauſe there is ſo little profit by hearing of the Word, is, that the preaching of it is no more looked upon as an Ordinance: this I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and laboured to do with as much candor, and as little provocation as might be. <note place="margin">I had preached three of the Sermons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came &amp; when I was to preach the laſt Sermon they were brought to oppoſe me. They took the Pulpit before I came, both this day and the next. Which three things are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in that place from which they take their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak after others have preached <hi>(viz.) 1 Cor.</hi> 14</note> 
            </p>
            <p>But before I had finiſhed the ſubject, ſome (I conceive) through the ſecret miſinformations, and impetuous ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of others, (who could not deny, yet would not grant what was delivered) were brought to oppoſe what I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and if it were poſsible, either by the favourable in ſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of themſelves, and their way, or the harſh miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of us and our Calling, to ſubvert or prevent the reception of my Doctrine. Which was attempted not only by a long diſcourſe to the people before I preached but by a ſhort oppoſition of me after. I told the Gentleman (who ſpake) that I conceived he ought not to ſpeak there, unleſs he were a <hi>Prophet,</hi> nor then unleſs he had a <hi>Revelation,</hi> nor then but when he may be ſubject to the Prophets: but proffered to justifie what I had delivered, either by a private communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or a publick printing of my Notes; thinking by that way Truth might be examined to more profit, and with leſſe paſsion, than by a tumultuary conference amidst an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsionate
<pb facs="tcp:59022:14"/>
multitude, than by a <hi>doubtfull diſputation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong prejudiced and unknowing hearers. But that was not taken.</p>
            <p>The next Lecture-day the like attempt was made again, there having two ſpoken ſucceſsively, before I went into the Pulpit. When although I was loth to provoke, yet I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have accepted any way that could have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as most tending to love and edification, for the deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and (if poſsible) for the deciding the controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us: to which end I had beſpoken a Notary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent preſent miſtakes, and after miſreports. But through Gods goodneſſe we ended peaceably. Not yet that I expected to convince engaged men, nor by any ſuch publick diſpute to reduce wilfull men ignorantly miſlead (there have been too many ſad and fruitleſſe examples of ſuch conferences al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) but meerly to prevent their boaſtings, that we dare not ſtand an Argument; or a ſuſpition in others, that our cauſe would not endure a trial. The moſt peaceable is the moſt Chriſtian way; where Gods honour, not our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is intended: that courſe is moſt to be purſued, which may probably end in moſt advantage, in least difference. Good Corn is beſt winnowed in a gentle gale, when a blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering winde blowes away chaff and Corn too. The high windes of paſsionate debates oftentimes blow up ſtorms and clouds, ſeldome produce any clear or fair agreement.</p>
            <p>Upon this I was much ſtrained, I love peace, but I dare not forſake truth. Not to Print the Sermons, beſides the inconvenience of miſreports already raiſed, and too readily received about it, were to lye under the ſuſpition of cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and (with ſome men) to yeeld them the victory that never got it; for although the offer was not taken by them, it might have been objected against me. To Print them,
<pb facs="tcp:59022:15"/>
beſides the diſcovery of mine own weakneſs, might produce further conteſt, which I have no leaſure to attend, being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently toyled with the conſtant labour of three times a week Preaching (beſides ſomething elſe:) yet I am willing to undertake any task to finde out or diſcover truth.</p>
            <p>Beſides, to hang them upon the ſame Text, would have taken up too much time to tranſcribe, and would have puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Reader to have found out the buſineſs, I having preached many more Sermons upon it: to have tacked them to another, might have given ſuſpition that they were not the ſame: It is no hard matter to finde or make an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, which increaſed my trouble, I was to print, with the ſame weakneſs I preached them; <hi>The ear tries words,</hi> but the eye obſerves writings; what infirmity might paſs the ſudden hearing of a tranſient voice, is ſoon diſcovered by the more ſerious view of a diſcerning eye. Had I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Preſſe, I might have taken more pains: but I may be ſorry, that what was intended only for a private Auditory, ſhould now come to publike view; that what was prepared in ſo little time (I am aſhamed to ſay how little) ſhould now undergo the cenſure of a more deliberate exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Nor do I conceive it fit to alter them, leaſt that ſhould be objected, if not againſt the truth of what was printed, yet against the repute of what was preached: and indeed ſo great was the oppoſition, and ſo many have been the falſe reports about it, that I am willing (for this) to let you ſee what it was I preached.</p>
            <p>Such as they are I commit to your judgement and Gods bleſsing, take them (I may almoſt ſay) as I preached them; I have altered nothing of the method, ſcarcely any thing of the Scripture or Argument, and but little of the expreſsion; I remember but one Scripture that I have added, nor that
<pb facs="tcp:59022:15"/>
added, only again urged in one place, where it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. (What I have added about the Oaths that Miniſters take before their Ordination, I tell you of in the margin;) I ſcarcely uſed then any Authors (which might eaſily have been done) but for the illuſtration of thoſe Scriptures I ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; nor many of them neither, only ſuch which are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for piety, which might be eaſily examined by any that ſhould doubt the quotation, which my ſhort time would afford the ſearch of, and which might not overburthen the Auditory, the Preſſe not being then intended: nor have I named any more now; you ſhall have it in the ſame naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or with very little more covering, then it was firſt brought forth with.</p>
            <p>I was conſtrained to introduce it ſome other way (for the reaſon before mentioned) but the margin directs to the beginning of the Sermons. I have caſt it into Sections, not to diſtinguiſh the Lectures, but to help your reading only; where ſome little Uſe hath been made, it hath been (for the moſt part) at the end of Lectures.</p>
            <p>I am conſcious to my ſelf of many weakneſſes, and ſhould ſure have bluſhed to be thus generally obſerved, had not conſtraint (in a manner) offer'd violence to modesty. I ſhould have been induced rather to have ſuffered the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of cowardiſe, in not appearing in the field, then the reproach of inſufficiency by a too weak undertaking: but this chiefly relates to mine own perſon, the other reflects more upon the truth. Beſides, cowardiſe can but ſuffer, he that for fear forſakes one piece of ground at firſt, may after be quite driven out of the field: whereas weakneſs may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, yea being aſsiſted by the God of ſtrength may get the conquest; when truth muſt appear more glorious, and God himſelf receive much more honour. I ſhall be glad if I finde
<pb facs="tcp:59022:16"/>
(among men) rather the loving conjunction of <hi>Shem</hi>'s and <hi>Japhet</hi>'s ſhoulders to cover my nakedneſs, then the open mouthes of curſed <hi>Hams</hi> to proclaim what they diſcern.</p>

               <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> mentions ſome Books that ſpeak much, but ſay little: I would not willingly be reckoned in that number; if that little I have ſpoken, may be ſo much, as to conduce in any meaſure, to the ſatisfaction of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the eſtabliſhment of ſtanding Chriſtians, but the leaſt tittle to exalt the truth, and ſupport the Miniſtry of Ieſus Chriſt; eſpecially if in theſe daies, now the axell-tree of the Miniſteriall function is ſo much ſtruck at, and begins (here) to crack, I might by this providence be made inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, to clap one band to ſtrengthen it, but to put one ſpoke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wheel to help it, I ſhould esteem it a ſuperabundant recompence.

It's ſome mens greateſt policy, to caſt dirt on all  hands, that ſomething may ſtick. It is much if in a large Bill, ſomething doth not (at leaſt) appear, if not prove true.

What wickedneſſe is in that? Can that Office be evil that is ordained by God himſelf? Were not the Prophets and Prieſts inſtituted by him under the Law?

And hath not he promiſed to be  with them to the end of the world? Can that Calling be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, which was appointed for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt? A deſire of Dominion is objected againſt their perſons, and (which is worſe) a Title to power is ſuſpected in their Offices: What Authority God hath entailed upon the Office, it is a ſin in any to cut off, unleſs there could be a <hi>Fine and Recovery</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Court of Heaven: And I wiſh that the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Brethren knew with what unwillingneſſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Power others think they affect; and what a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that is to their ſhoulders, which ſome conceive they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in.</p>

Was it not only their deſire to ſhare in what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended evil in others, that was the cauſe of the outcry? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is as blinde as Love, they equally, although in a different manner, darken the judgement; we muſt never expect right Sentence, where Paſſion brings in the Evidence, and Malice gives in the Verdict Where malice is in the ſediment, a little heat will raiſe the ſcum of falſe accuſations, and unjuſt reports: where that lies under the earth, there will not want an <hi>Aetna</hi> through which to breath forth the flame of railings, or 'twill  ſhake the whole Iſland: if that fire be but kindled, it will quickly burſt out: when it is reſolved the dog muſt be beaten, is is no hard matter to finde a ſtaff.

I preſſed the Congregation (as a means to help them to receive it) that they would receive and eſteem the Miniſters of the Goſpel, which I urged from that of 1 Theſ. 5. 12, 13. and explained it as here; although I have not inſerted the direction at large as then I handled it: ſo that, although I intended not to have touched this ſtring in that leſſon; yet being ſo providentially brought upon it, I could not without ſuſpition of cowardiſe retreat.</note> 

BUt the great Objection is: That thoſe who thus <hi>labour in the Lord,</hi> and are thus <hi>highly to be eſteemed,</hi> are not the  Black-coated Miniſters, Ordained by men, furniſhed with lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Univerſities, to neglect them is not to refuſe Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God: nor is it to ſleight the Goſpel, to caſt off what they preach.

               <p>What is ſpoken againſt their Coats, reflects upon their Function; not the colour of their Cloth, that is not worth a Reply any further then as it will fall under the other after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

cry out againſt the uſe of Ordination. It is not to infuſe new, gifts, it is only to try their gifts formerly acquired, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are (therein) competently qualified for ſuch an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Can this be hurtfull? Who, unleſſe ſuch as dare not ſtand a triall, would not deſire the approbation of judicious men in a ſervice of that importance, were it not otherwiſe neceſſary? A modeſt ſpirit, a tender conſcience will be rather apt to ſuſpect, then cry up ſelf-ability, when it remembers <hi>Paul's</hi> queſtion, <hi>Who is ſufficient?</hi> It is not to ſend any forth contrary to Gods minde, or whom God would not have ſent, (as far as men can diſcern;) but to ſet thoſé apart for the work, whom they judge God hath ſent to <hi>labour in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</hi> Can this leſſen their gift, or render their perſons more offenſive? That they have their learning at the Univerſity, I am apt to think ſhould not make them leſſe able: If by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they intend that eſpeciall gift of grace, whereby they are ſupernaturally furniſhed with abilities, experimentally to <hi>divide the Word aright,</hi> they are miſtaken; but if they mean that skill in Arts and Sciences, knowledge of Tongues, which although acquired by the uſe of means; yet are the common gifts of God, this muſt rather help then unfit them for the Miniſtry. Are any gifts of God to be contemned? can any gift of God unfit men for ſervice? Shall the gifts of Fortune (ſo called) be imbraced, and ſhall the gifts of the minde, which are more excellent, be accounted leſſe worthy? It is fit the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe ſhould rule in the houſe; yet the hand-maid may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable. Befides, they who object this againſt Miniſters, learn to reade Engliſh at home (although I do not know whether all that undertake to be Preachers are ſo well learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet) I beleeve few will judge him ſufficiently qualified for a Miniſter who cannot reade Engliſh. They learn to reade the Bible as it is tranſlated, others learn it in the Originall: Can this indiſpoſe them to that work! It was but a falſe conceit of a wicked man, that <note place="margin">Act. 26. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>much learning made Paul mad.</hi> If lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be good and uſefull, then the more the better; there 

 cannot be exceſſe of what is good in it ſelf: a good thing may be abuſed, but if good, the meaſure cannot be offenſive;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59022:19"/>
the nearer to perfection, the better it muſt be ſtill. But theſe things, as they are of little ſtrength, ſo I uſe but little force to repell them; I ſhall haſten to the main buſineſſe, which is of greater concernment.</p>
               <p>Only (in <hi>tranſitu)</hi> If it be proved that the preaching of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Miniſters only be the Ordinance; then it will follow, that to neglect them, is to refuſe the Goſpel: but that I ſhall labour to prove preſently. Then I muſt tell you, that although other may ſpeak pleaſing things, they only can in <hi>Chriſts ſtead beſeech you to be reconciled;</hi> although others may take pains, they only <hi>labour among you, and are over you in the Lord.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though others may promiſe ſalvation, they only can <hi>preach the Goſpel.</hi> Hence I conceive it is that <hi>Paul</hi> cals it his Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 

 1. 16. <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>according to my Goſpel.</hi> Which is (in <hi>Diodates</hi> words) according to the Goſpel of which I am a Miniſter. <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> It is Chriſts 

 <hi>Goſpel</hi> as given by him, as through him life is offered in it; it was <hi>Pauls</hi> Goſpel as it was preached, as it was promulgated by him: It is (in a ſenſe) their Goſpel, who have authority from God to preach it. The moſt ſtrict threatning of a private perſon to another; That he ſhall return to the place whence he came, thence to the place of Execution, and there ſhall hang till he die, is but vain and ridiculous; when the ſame words out of the mouth of an Authorized Judge, are the dreadfull ſentence of death. Not is the promiſe of life to a condemned perſon at all eſteemed from him that hath no power to give it; when the ſame promiſe from him who is Commiſſioned for the ſervice, is certain life.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now then labour to prove, That the Ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters only are thoſe who (by the Apoſtles command) are to be highly eſteemed, and that to neglect them and their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 

 is to neglect the Goſpel. <note place="margin">It was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion I made when I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</note> Which I profeſſe, I undertake not out of any love to Controverſie, nor any deſire to exalt my ſelf or Function, above the rule of Jeſus Chriſt; but (being through an unexpected Providence brought to it) out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, if not to reduce the miſlead, yet to eſtabliſh thoſe that yet ſtand; eſpecially receiving their entreaties about it, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their endeavours to ſeduce them.</p>

The Method I propoſe in the handling of it, is, to ſhew you. 1. That thoſe who preach muſt be called or ſent to that ſervice. 2. That this Sending or Calling is not only a gifting of men; but (beſides that) a ſetting them apart for that Office. 3. What calling or ſetting men apart for this Office, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ordinarily mentions. 4.

Much more might be ſpoken of this, but that will refer properly to the next thing; I hope it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that there muſt be a Call. Whence elſe is it, that they are ſaid to be <hi>made Over-ſeers over the Flock of God by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 20. 28?</p>
               <p>Saith Apoſtle concerning Chriſt, <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time; This is my Son, this day have I begotten thee?</hi> I may ſay, Unto what unſent Miniſter, or or ſelf-made Prophet, did God at any time ſay, Take care of the Flock, feed the Church of God, over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you over-ſeets.</p>
               <p>Beſides, which I wonder at, Thoſe who think men may run without a Call into this Office, (or rather employment, for it ſcarcely now acknowledged an Office) will pleade for a Call, a Commiſſion for any other undertaking: Strange I that this which is the moſt excellent imployment, ſhould be adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured on with the leaſt warrant: as if God had only neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own ſervice: or rather that men were reſolved to be carefull of himſelf when Gods work ſhall be careleſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. He muſt not ſit in the place of a Judge, that hath no Commiſſion, but is guilty of murther that puts a man to death (be the cauſe what it will) without juſt Authority. The
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59022:22"/>
common Souldier will not receive the Commands of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, onely of a Commiſſioned Officer; nor will one Officer take the Word of Command from another, unleſſe by Order he be impowred to give it: Nay, in your Cities, men are not ſuffered to manage a trade, but after ſerving an Apprentiſhip, and being made free of the Company. Such are generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have leaſt skill, and to ſell the worſt wares, and then pernicious to Societies. And is the Miniſtery the only Office to be run upon without a Call?</p>
               <p>Again, If one man may go without ſending, why not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? why not more? why not all? elſe what number is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and what meaſure of gifts is competent? Truly, people love the power of <hi>Heads,</hi> would caſt off the ſubjection of <hi>Members:</hi> So then, we ſhould have all Prieſts, and no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; all Teachers, and no Hearers; all the Members would become Head; all the Flock would be Over-ſeers, and at laſt none left to be overſeen but by their own eyes.</p>
               <p>How then ſhould men fear and tremble that dare take this honour to themſelves; who go without a Call, run without a Commiſſion; who go not <hi>in at the door,</hi> but <hi>creep into hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who need no other power but their own to make them Preachers! I mean ſuch, who have no Flock to overſee, but go from place to place venting their errours, ſowing their ſeeds of Hereſie; as if there were no Duty well done, nor any Office well diſcharged, where their Gift is not exerciſed. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is among wiſer and more religious men, diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Call, which I ſhall ſpeak to afterward; but what muſt we think of thoſe who pretend to no Call at all, but what their Gifts, which they call extrordinary, confer upon them? Such (me think) ſhould fear the judgement of God, who ſpeak in his Name, yet have of his Authority. Chriſt ſends forth his Diſciples as <hi>Sheep among Wolves,</hi> but then promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>to be with them;</hi> whom he ſends he is engaged to defend; but what protection can they expect, who have none of his Commiſſion?</p>
               <p>Nay, how ſhould people that fear the Lord be afraid to run after ſuch Teachers; not only in that they countenance,

 (beſides that) a ſetting them apart for that work. Were the conſent of Churches, and their practice, or the opinions of ſingle men at all available with the oppoſers of the Miniſters call, how many might quickly be produced: but I know theſe, if urged would be rejected, and therefore I ſhall not put you to the trouble of a refuſall; Scripture-practice being chiefly pretended to by them, Scripture-rule ſhall be my way of trial.</p>
               <p>(If gifting be calling; it muſt be either ordinary or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. It is not an ordinary Call, for the Scripture ſpeaks of another way of ſetting men apart ordinarily for this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (as will be proved afterward.)</p>
               <p>Nor is it an extraordinary calling; although if it were, it would not at all help our uncalled Preachers; for as it is not our buſineſſe here to handle extraordinary cales, ſo neither is it our wiſedom now to expect extraordinary callings. Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſending is either, when in the primitive times God did by his immediate command ſend out whom he pleaſed to that ſervice; Yet then there was an act of ſending different from the work of gifting of them (as will appear preſently:) <note place="margin">Note.</note> 

 this I beleeve our gifted brethren will not pretend to; if ſo, let them diſcover their miſſion. Or when in the firſt erecting
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59022:23"/>
or re-building of Churches, where an ordinary call cannot be  had, men are called out by an extraordinary power of God upon their ſpirits for this work.<note place="margin">

                  <q>
                     <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary only take place, where ordinary is not to be had: yea, it muſt afterward, when the Church ſhall be ſetled, receive Ordination in an ordinary way.</q> This our oppoſers cannot plead, becauſe among us an ordinary call is to be had; (which if they ſuſpect, I ſhall ſhew them in the third thing.) Or, when there are ſome extraordinary gifts conferred to enable men for this employment. Extraordinary gifts, I mean not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively only, when ſome have better gifts then others; or then ordinarily men of that place and breeding have, ſome may have a better Genius, may be more induſtrious, may have more advantages then others; but ſuch which are given in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner, as the extraordinary gift of Propheſying, the miraculous gift of Tongues, when there hath been no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means uſed for the acquiring of them: the immediate gift of working miracles, which were given in thoſe daies, <note place="margin">Note.</note> 

 not only to enable them for their work, but (beſides other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) to manifeſt and declare their calling. Which is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the reaſon of that extraordinary gift which is called <hi>Propheſying,</hi> not preaching (as is now pretended) that was given to the Seventy, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. <note place="margin">Numb. 11.</note> But of this more in its place. 

 Nor do I think that thoſe who talk of great gifts, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them thus extraordinarily beſtowed.</p>
               <p>Some of them indeed are Scholars, have (beſides other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) the gift of Tongues, but it is by ordinary means acquired; although they may by falſe pretences delude common people, yet let any of the beſt gifted men make it appear that they received that or any other gift extraordinarily: they may ſpeak good matter, and well manag'd, and ſo be cried up for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59022:23"/>
excellently gifted men, when they have gotten their abilities, but by the ſame way others have gotten theirs; then where is the wonder? I wiſh that ſubtle Jeſuites, learned Prieſts, come not under a grey cloak, or a blue apron, and ſo pretend to an extraordinary gift. For it is obſervable, that moſt of our groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt errours, that have been ſo plentifully vented, have been firſt broached in ſuch meetings: which for the moſt parttend to Arminianiſm, or Libertiniſm, fit leaven for Popery.</p>
               <p>Others have no extraordinary gifts at all, have ſcarcely common gifts, they are ſo far from having the gift of many Tongus, that they know not how to uſe their mother Tongue properly; nay, thoſe petty gift-lings they have, they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by ſome like endeavour of reading, hearing or confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. I know no more then ordinary gift they have, unleſſe it be of impudence and confidence.</p>
               <p>But yet more clearly to handle this thing; That gifting is not ſending: I ſhall do it in ſome few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture puts a difference between gifting, and ſending men for the work of the Miniſtry: Thoſe who were qualified with abilities, were Commiſſioned (beſides) before they undertook that ſervice. There is a difference between <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is <hi>collatio donorum;</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is <hi>collatio poteſtatis,</hi> (as is diſtinguiſhed:) the former makes a man able to preach, the other gives him authority to preach; there may be abilities, where there is no Commiſſion, and there may be a Commiſſion where many qualifications may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There is a Text much urged by (almoſt) all that handle this thing; but becauſe ſomething may be ſpoken againſt it, I ſhall lay no ſtreſſe upon it: <hi>(viz.)</hi> Act. 13. 1, 2. yet me think it plainly intimates a difference the Scripture owneth between gifting and ſending: <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> were gifted before, <hi>but they must be ſet apart for the work to which God had called them.</hi> But other Scriptures are plain.</p>
               <p>When God ſent the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to preach to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he firſt gifted him, he afterward gave him his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>He touched his lips with a coal from the Altar;</hi> thereby he was qualified: but afterward he received
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59022:24"/>
his authority to exerciſe his gifts, when he bid him <hi>Go and tell this people:</hi> Nay <hi>Iſaiah</hi> would not run till God ſent him, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. Judicious <hi>Perkins</hi> interprets this to be giving him his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to preach. Nor do I ſee what other unforc't expoſition can be given of it. But leſt the Old Teſtament (being almoſt out of faſhion) ſhould diſrelliſh, we will ſee what evidence the New will give us.</p>
               <p>If Chriſts own method in calling his Diſciples may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient teſtimony, you will ſee, that gifting for, and ſending them to execute the work were two diſtinct acts, <hi>Mat. 20. 1, 5. <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8. Reade the Text.</note> He gave them power againſt unclean spirits, to caſt them</hi> 

                  <hi>out,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. there he gifted them: but afterward he bids them, <hi>Go, preach, ſaying, the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand; heal the ſick, cleanſe the leper,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. there he gave them <hi>Authority</hi> to do what he gave them <hi>Power</hi> to do before, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. Yea, when their work was encreaſed, their Commiſſion was enlarged too, <hi>Math. 28 19. <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> Go teach all Nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> 

                  <hi>them,</hi> &amp;c. we reade not that they preached till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Commiſſion, nor that they went to any people, but who were comprehended in it. <hi>Timothy</hi> had a gift conferred by God, and diſcovered by Prophecy, yet he was ſet a part for the Office by the impoſition of hands, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 14.</note> The gift 

 was given by <hi>prophecy</hi> (i. e.) it was diſcovered in a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick manner, that he ſhould be a Miniſter; yet notwithſtanding ſo eminent a declaration of Gods minde, there was <hi>the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi> which <hi>Diodate</hi> cals a ſign of conſecration and bleſſing. How many places might I name, where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Ordaining Elders in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which plainly evidenceth (beſides gifting of them) a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them apart for the ſervice as <hi>Tit. 1. 5. Act.</hi> 14. 2, 3. beſides other places; but it is better to ſpeak enough then all.</p>
               <p>Shall I go one ſtep farther, and then ſhew you, that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf was fitted for the ſervice he came about, yet was ſent by his Father: although he was gifted, yet he would not go till he had his Fathers Commiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 5.</note> he had 

 <hi>a body prepared him,</hi> he was fitted to offer Sacrifice, and ſo to perform his Fathers will, but yet he would not <hi>take the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59022:24"/>
to himſelf to be made an High-Prieſt,</hi> Heb. 5.5. <note place="margin">

               <p>It is agreed by moſt, that to a faithfull Preacher, there are two things required; there muſt be gifts and abilities for the work, and there muſt be Authority and power to exerciſe 

 thoſe gifts; the one is from man ordinarily, the other from God. <note place="margin">Id tantum poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumus, quod jure poſſumus.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to favour this diſtinction, where he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the call of God to the call of man, <hi>Gal. 1. 1. <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 1.</note> Paul an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi>

For as no man muſt take that Office to himſelf, fo neither muſt any elſe put whom they pleaſe into the Office; the harveſt is Gods, and ſuch only muſt be labourers there which are of his ſending. <hi>Nor by man;</hi> which was to diſtinguiſh his Apoſtleſhip from ordinary Miniſters; he being an Apoſtle, was called by Chriſt immediatly; and after he ſaith, that this calling <hi>by man</hi> is the uſuall way of chooſing Miniſters. Very much further goes <hi>Calvin,</hi> if thoſe who are curious will ſearch him.</q> What need I tell you of <hi>Matthias</hi> his being ſat apart for the Apoſtleſhip in the place of <hi>Judas?</hi> Act. 1. 26. he was qualified by God, nor could the falling of the lot drop any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of gifts into him, but the lot muſt be given, that he may be thereby deſigned, and ſet apart for the Office: It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an extraordinary way of ſetting him apart, but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that was, becauſe it was to an Apoſtleſhip, to which the calling was different (as was newly ſaid) from the ordinary call of Paſtors and Teachers. But my buſineſſe (in this) is not to ſhew what way men are ſet apart (that belongs to the next thing,) it is ſufficient for me here to prove that there is (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides gifting) ſome or other ſetting apart for this ſervice; I ſhall do the other afterward.</p>
               <p>Beſides I finde a frequent diſtinction made in Scripture, between the gifts of private Chriſtians, whereby they may be able to edifie one the other; and of others who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Miniſtry. <hi>The Romanes were full of goodneſs, filled with all knowledge, able alſo to admoniſh one another,</hi> Rom. 15. 14. <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 14, 15.</note> yet they were not hereby authoriſed to preach preſently, but 

 <hi>Paul had the grace given to him of God, to be the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Christ to the Gentiles,</hi> verſ. 15.

When Chriſt taught in the Temple, and none doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his abilities, that they could not quarrel with him for them, the chief Prieſts and Elders queſtioned his authority, that they might finde an occaſion of contempt for want of that, <hi>Mat. 21. 23. <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 23.</note> By what authority doſt thou theſe things, and who gave</hi>

               <p>The performance of the outward act is not to adminiſter a Sacrament, if he be not called to the Office that executes it.

It is another part of a Miniſters buſineſſe to binde and to looſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. it was ſpoken to the Diſciples, which is only declarative, not that they have <hi>power to for give ſins;</hi> but ſurely gifted men, who were not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Office, will not undertake this imployment, to <hi>binde and looſe.</hi> This is the ſecond Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="3">3, Chriſt hath ſet Officers in the Church, for the work of the Miniſtery, which are diſtinct from the flock to whom he hath committed the word of reconciliation.

               <p>I would not be thought by this to condemn or deny the uſe of the beſt, or meaneſt gifts of any Chriſtian; as there is place for the meaneſt gifts to be exerciſed, ſo there is room enough for the greateſt gifts to be employed within the compaſſe of a mans Calling: I would have the ſmalleſt ſpark of fire blown up, nor would I have the greateſt flame to be quenched, if it may be uſefull, but I would have them both burn within the Chimney; he is no enemy to the uſe of fire that would not have it burn the houſe. A ſmall ſpark out of its place will quickly threaten, a violent flame will ſooner produce deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the whole fabrick. Water is uſefull and profitable, when within its bounds; but dangerous and pernicious if it once break out beyond them. <note place="margin">You ſee then by this, that a man may uſe his gifts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his neighbours, that if his neighbour comes while he is reading a Chapter, he needs not to ſhut his Bible, or if he meet another upon the way he needs not to hold his tongu, A man may uſe his gifts among his neighbours, yet not preach.</note> 
               </p>
               <p>Men may have Families to inſtruct, Children and Servants to teach, who yet may not have the <hi>over-ſight</hi> of the <hi>Flock</hi> committed to them: They may have Neighbours to reprove, Friends to comfort, who yet ought not to go into the Pulpit to preach. I could wiſh that Chriſtians gifts were yet greater, yea, I ſhould be glad, that (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid) in this ſenſe, <hi>All the Lords people were Prophets!</hi> Would they but thus manage their abilities, would they but edifie one the other, warn the unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, ſupport the weak (which are the common duties of Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 11. 14.) they might finde ſufficient uſe for their gifts within the bounds of their Calling. Men may finde work enough at home, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out running out of their places to exerciſe their parts, were they far greater then they are. I ſhall apply what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and ſo fitly uſe for my purpoſe what others object againſt what hath been ſpoken, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 10. As every one hath received the gift, ſo let him adminiſter the ſame,</hi> &amp;. But it is in reſpect to the gift men have, and the calling they are in; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59022:28"/>
perſons in their places, according to the liberty God hath given them; Publike Officers in their function according to the injunction God hath laid upon them. For the place doth not intimate that every one that hath any gift ſhould preach preſently, but (chiefly) that he who is a Preacher ſhould be faithfull and painfull in his Miniſtry; that <hi>in ſeaſon</hi> and <hi>out of ſeaſon</hi> he ſhould wait upon his Office.</p>
               <p>There is a vaſt difference between the only charitative ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions but of private Chriſtians, and the authoritative preaching of called Miniſters: The one requireth and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to obedience, not only <hi>virtute materiae,</hi> for the matters ſake which he preacheth; but <hi>virtute officij,</hi> by reaſon of his 

 Office, <note place="margin">If a private man require another to keep the peace, this he may do, becauſe it is a good things; but if a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable require, it muſt be done becauſe the Officer commands.</note> ſpeaking in the Name, and by the Authority of God; the other may engage the hearers to obſervance <hi>virtute obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cts &amp; materiae,</hi> in reſpect of the truth of the matter that may be ſpoken; but not <hi>virtute officij;</hi> they have no power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige by Office. Thus I have ſhewed you (to avoid all offence and quarrell) how private Chriſtians may uſe their gifts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have no liberty to preach.</p>
               <p>But I am afraid I may complain, that many who talk moſt of, and crave moſt liberty for the uſe of their gifts in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, make leaſt uſe of them in private; they will go many miles to get a Pulpit, who will ſcarce ſtep a foot to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houſe unleſſe to perſwade him from his ſtability; they who glory in ſpeaking to Congregations, and would every day be exerciſed in a publike throng, are negligent to inſtruct their houſe, can hardly any day ſpare time to overſee their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate charge. As if there were no vertue but in extremity, nor excellency but in exceſs; as if no water were ſweet, but what were ſtoln: In this (although I am ſomewhat loth to uſe the compariſon) too like the ſwiniſh drunkard, who although he hath good meat and drink at home, delights not in the eating or drinking of any, but where he may uſe it to intemperance. Or like ſome filthy Adulterers, who have handſome wives of their own, and (were they not wives) could ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, yet care not for the enjoyment of any, but whom they have no Commiſſion to touch or deſire. Indeed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59022:29"/>
in this, as in all things elſe, mans Nature is ſtrongly proclive to runne beyond its bounds, and to abuſe what in its place might be very uſefull.</p>

               <p>Only in this (as was ſaid formerly) you muſt not extend my Propoſition beyond the bounds of ordinary caſes; As in the primitive times, where extraordinary callings were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the beginning and perſecution of Churches where this cannot be had. I ſhewed you in generall, there muſt be a Call, and that this Calling was ſome ſetting a part, beſides gifting of men: This was true of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, who were moſt extraordinarily ſeparated: Chriſt by the Father, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Diſciples by Chriſt: but now I am to ſhew you what way the Scripture laies out for the ordinary practice of after ages, when ſuch extraordinary Cals ſhould neither be given nor expected. But ſomewhat more of this afterward.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> were ſet a part for the work to which God had called them, they were thus ſeparated by Church-Officers, with faſting, praier, and laying on of hands, <hi>Act, 13. 3, 4. <note place="margin">Act. 13. 3, 4.</note> They are Prophets and Teachers,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>and when</hi>

It was not by the deſignation of any ſingle perſon by his own power, nor was it the act of any particular Congregation by their only election, but by the Miniſters there aſſembled. <hi>Timothy</hi> received his gift by prophecy, but he was ſet a part to the work <hi>by laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 14. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 14.</note> By the <hi>Presbytery</hi> there is meant, <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Presbyterorum:</hi> which although <hi>Diodate</hi> explains to be

               <p>Others ſay, that the Apoſtles by laying on of hands, did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeulouſly confer the holy Ghoſt, but (beſides that it no where appears in Scripture, that the laying on of hands in the ſetting a part of Miniſters did work any ſuch Miracle) in that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Timothy</hi> it ſeems otherwiſe; for the Apoſtle bids him <hi>attend to reading, to meditation, that his profiting may appear,</hi> which are the ordinary and uſuall means of getting abilities for the work of the Miniſtry. If abilities were given by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, what need of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meditation to acquire them? if the holy Ghoſt were conferred by the impoſition of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, what need any other way to make his profiting appear? Beſides we finde, that others who were not Apoſtles uſed impoſition of hands, in whoſe power it cannot be imagined to be, to confer the holy Ghoſt by it.

               <p>But indeed the word is otherwiſe uſed: for that it at all ſignifies choice and election is only metaphorieall, becauſe among the Greeks, it was their cuſtome to give their votes in elections by the holding up of their hands: but by the like metaphor it may be uſed for <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> and it is ſo frequently uſed among Greek Authors: becauſe the hands when they are impoſed on others, are ſtretched forth. <hi>Leigh</hi> (in his <hi>Critica Sacra)</hi> ſaith it is taken among Eccleſiaſticall Authours for impoſition of hands, which no way belonged to the people, but was alwaies referred to the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors, <hi>Stephanus</hi> (well skilled in the Greek) ſaith, that when it hath an Accuſative caſe after it, it ſignifies not to give ſuffrage, but to create and ordain, ſo it is hete, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Not that by this it ſhould be denied to people or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, any right God hath left them, or may be fit for them; Election, approbation is allowed them, although Ordination be in the hands of others: In the ſetting a part one in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Judas,</hi> the 120. preſented two, but God choſe one of them, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 23. <note place="margin">Act. 1. 23, 24.</note> It is but an injury to the Text to ſay that the

               <p>I deſire in this to go as far as ſafely I may, but I dare not give this as abſolutely neceſſary, for the many inconveniences the Church may ſuffer by it; wherefore it is the practice of the Reformed Churches, that the Presbytery be conſulted with in their Elections; <note place="margin">Praecunte diri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</note> and that although a rationall diſſent

 (beſides the trifling away of the time) it would be unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to name them all; I ſhall pick out three or four which are moſt inſiſted on, and ſeem moſt proving: the clear anſwering of them may end the quarrell.</p>
               <p>But to avoid miſtakes, and to contract the Arguments and Anſwers too into the narrower compaſſe, I would premiſe theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall not ſtand much to anſwer any Arguments drawn from extraordinary caſes; it is ſufficient anſwer that they are extraordinary, which, but in the like caſes, can be no pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to us. For it is certain, that what hath been extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily done, cannot be ordinarily practiſed, (which becauſe much controverted, I will a little clear.) The Diſciples of Chriſt deſired him, that they might command fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to conſume thoſe that received not their Maſter; and the reaſon they urged was from the example of <hi>Elijah,</hi> he did ſo upon the like occaſion in his daies, and therefore they would do the ſame thing in theirs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 54. but Chriſts anſwer is, <hi>v. 55. Ye know not what spirit ye are of,</hi> it might be lawfull for the Prophet to do what might not be fit for them: I ſay, it might be lawfull for the Apoſtles and Prophets in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, for others at other times, when extraordinary things are, muſt be acted; which is not lawful at other times, when ordinary Calls may be expected and had.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would not have you confounded in terms; there is a preaching the Scripture mentions, which is not that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall preaching we are handling, and then an Argument drawn from that will nothing weaken the doctrine deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about this. There is a preaching which is nothing elſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59022:32"/>
but a declaration of the power and goodneſſe of God. Thus <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to preach Gods righteouſneſſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 40. 9. (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though if this ſhould be further urged, we know that <hi>David</hi> was a Prophet) the word ſignifies to declare a good thing. <note place="margin">

               <p>There is a Teaching alſo the Scripture ſpeaks of, which is not that Teaching that is part of the Office of a Miniſter: a Teaching which is nothing but a generall inſtruction, or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly admonition, either of ſuperiours or inferiours, or of one Chriſtian to another, and may be performed either by word or practice: Thus (amidſt other things might be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,) <hi>Abraham</hi> taught his family, (yet he was a Prophet, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 7.) If it ſhould be further objected, Thus Kings and Rulers, and Judges, may be ſaid to teach, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 7. which was different from the teaching of the Levites, <hi>who had the Law of the Lord,</hi> ver. 8. Thus in the New Teſtament, women might teach, for it is required <hi>that aged women ſhould teach the younger to be ſober.</hi> Titus 2. 4. it was both by their admonition and behaviour, which yet is not that teaching, which Chriſt gave in Commiſſion to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.</p>

                  </note> Again, There is Propheſying in Scripture, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time 

 a foretelling things to come, as <hi>Agabus</hi> propheſied, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 27. and the four daughters of <hi>Philip,</hi> Act. 21. 9. which is not a miniſteriall Preaching. It is <hi>Diodates</hi> gloſſe upon that place, that they had the gift of foretelling future things by divine inſpiration. Sometimes an extraordinary Office in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59022:32"/>
Primitive times, whereby they did not only foretell things to come, but explain the writings of the Prophets, and other difficult places, by immediate revelation; as would be eaſily proved, (and ſhall be ſpoken more of anon) from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 30, and 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 12. 28. which is not that ordinary Preaching, which is the work of called Miniſters; which is alſo called propheſying (as I conceive,) in the 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 10. although ſome do interpret that too of the extraordinary gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying.

By this will many things be anſwered, without naming of them, which to have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led particularly, would have ſpent much time, made a great noiſe, when they had had but little ſtrength, and ſo ſcarcely worth our labour.</p>

1. IT is objected from <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 25. &amp;c. That <hi>Eldad</hi> and  <hi>Medad</hi> propheſied in the Camp; that <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſhed all the Lords people were Prophets: and therefore others, who are not otherwiſe Called may preach.</p>

For anſwer: Either the force of the Argument lies in <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dads</hi>  and <hi>Medads</hi> practice, or in <hi>Moſes</hi> his wiſh; if in their practice, that they propheſied, the anſwer is eaſie; if in his deſire, that all Gods people were Prophets, it is not hard; I'le give it you in ſome few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Office unto which the 70. were here called, was not to ſerve at the Altar, to perform the Prieſts work, but to aſſiſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Government, to bear part of his burthen; v. 16. 17. <hi>they ſhall bear the burthen of the people with thee, that thou ſhalt not bear it alone.</hi> So then, to argue from this a liberty of every gifted mans preaching, is ſcarce rationall.

they had undertaken this ſervice without a Call, which you ſee they did not, for they were ſet apart by God for it, yet thence to have argued a liberty of preaching without a Call, would not be <hi>ad idem.</hi>

2, <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> were of the number of the 70. were  not of the common people, and they were all Elders and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers over the people before they were thus ſet apart to this extraordinary imployment.

 gift to aſcertain the people of it; <note place="margin">Non creati fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt Prophetae, ſed voluit Deus hác exterua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nota<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teſtari no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos eſſe homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>Calvin.</hi> in los.</note> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the reaſon, why they had this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gift beſtowed upon them, that the people might ſee they were called by God to it, So then this can prove nothing for the preaching of only gifted, uncalled Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, for theſe were eminently called, and ſet apart for the ſervice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is agreed by all that I meet withall, that this which is here called Propheſying, was ſome extraordinary gift con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by God only for ſome time; not that they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie

So that had they propheſied (in this ſenſe) without a Call, which yet you ſee they did not, it were no argument to prove preaching without a Call, becauſe that is not at all intended in propheſying here.</p>

4. That <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſhed all the Lords people were Prophets, hath nothing at all of proof in it; for beſides that by prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying here is not meant preaching (as was ſhewed before,) and that the Scripture makes a difference between Prophets and Teachers (as ſhall be ſhewed preſently) his wiſh is only that <hi>they were Prophets;</hi> which implies no more, then that when they were Prophets they might propheſie; that if they were thus gifted and ſet apart, they might in the like manner exerciſe their gift. If we ſhould hear of ſome great acts of mercy done by rich men, and I ſhould wiſh you were all rich; it were not to intend that you ſhould do the like acts, till you had the like riches. Or if we were filled with the reports of ſome famous acts of Juſtice done by ſome faithfull Judges in avenging bloud, in executing malefactours; and I ſhould wiſh that all the honeſt people in <hi>England</hi> were Judges; It were not that every honeſt man ſhould avenge bloud with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Commiſſion, or execute malefactors till he were a Judge. For my part, I wiſh that all Prophets may propheſie, and that there were more able and faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel, that the Lord would yet thruſt out more labourers into his Vineyard; yet I do not ſee, that this place will prove, that any ſhould propheſie till they are Prophets, that any ſhould preach till they are ſet apart for the Office.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> The ſecond Argument is drawn from the order of the 

 Corinthian Churches mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. where it is ſaid, that they <hi>may all Propheſie one by one,</hi> whence it is urged, that every one that is gifted may preach.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note> For the anſwer of this, as of the other, I ſhall lay down ſome particulars whereby you may ſee the miſtake the more

               <p n="1">1. Propheſying in that place was not Preaching, but was in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> an extraordinary Office; now an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary example is no foundation to ground an ordinary practice upon; (as was ſpoken ſufficiently before) Propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is generally taken in Scripture for a gift differing from Preaching.</p>

And that this was an extraordinary gift ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of here is manifeſt from the Context: it is joyned with the gift of tongues which was miraculouſly given: yea, they ſpake by Revelation, <hi>Ver. 31.

               <p n="2">2. Where it is ſaid that they might <hi>All</hi> propheſie; it is not meant of all the members of the Church, but only of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who had this extraordinary gift beſtowed on them.

It is ſtrange that men ſhould take occaſion by it, to introduce and Foment diſorder in the Church.

 in divers or ſeveral Aſſemblies; and ſo <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, it muſt not be the ſame day, but at ſeverall meetings; this is their gloſſe, although I ſhall not inſiſt on it.</p>
               <p>How little ſtrength there is in this Argument to prove the lawfulneſs of their preaching who are only gifted, me thinks every one ſhould ſee without any direction, and then what room there is left for a reply, (unleſs it be that wranglers can make room any where) I can ſcarcely ſee or imagine. Thoſe that might propheſie <hi>one by one,</hi> were not the private mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, for ſome are forbidden to ſpeak; but the Prophets, whoſe Office was extraordinary and who had an extraordinary gift, who had this liberty of ſpeaking upon a received Revelation. Adde but to this (what you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that Propheſying and Teaching were in that Church two diſtinct Offices, and I hope it will be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> The third Argument is built upon that prophecy, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59022:35"/>
18. where it is ſaid, that <hi>God will pour out his Spirit upon all fleſh, and their ſons and their daughters ſhall propheſie,</hi> &amp;c. This is looked on as a Goſpel promiſe, and therefore it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that in Goſpel daies all that have gifts may preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reſp. 1.</note> For anſwer to this alſo; 1. Conſider, that this promiſe of 

 propheſying cannot be meant of preaching; elſe muſt the promiſe in the daies of <hi>Joel</hi> croſſe the prohibition given by the ſame ſpirit in the time of <hi>Paul;</hi> here it is ſaid <hi>their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall propheſie,</hi> In the Epiſtle to the Corinthians, it is <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden that women ſhould speak in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be taken literally for propheſying, it muſt relate onely to thoſe times when all parts of the ſame prophcey might equally be fullfilled: young men may as well now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to viſions, and old men expect now to have God diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf by dreams, as others claim a liberty to propheſie <hi>now</hi> by this promiſe. Whatſoever prophecy is here meant (if you take it ſtrictly) can then only be practiſed, when God gave ſuch extraordinary gifts, and made ſuch diſcoveries of himſelf to people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is manifeſt that the Prophet in this Promiſe referreth to the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> where there ſhould be more Light, and greater knowledge given, then was before under the Law. The extraordinary part of it was fullfilled when the Spirit was moſt plentifully poured out. When Saint <hi>Luke</hi> urgeth this promiſe as foretelling what was there acted, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 16. 17. (this is that which was <hi>ſpoken by the Prophet Joel,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 22. it is ſaid that Chriſt was <hi>approved by ſigns and wonders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But fourthly, The true meaning of the place is, that when the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould come (as it is urged in Goſpel daies) God would pour out of his Spirit <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he would give the gifts of his Spirit unto all ſorts of people, as well <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o young as old, to Female as well as male <hi>(viz.)</hi> illumination, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he would do it extraordinarily in the Primitive times, for the confirmation of the Goſpel; which was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled: he would do it ordinarily afterward, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Goſpel, which is performed in our experience.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59022:36"/>
The <hi>Antitheſis</hi> in the former verſes will help well to confirm this expoſition; he had before promiſed them meats, and drinks, and only outward mercies, but he would then multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſpirituall bleſſings upon them. This is the judgement of others upon the place. I will by the inward vertue of my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enlighten the underſtanding of mine Elect, who by nature are but children in knowledge, ſaith <hi>Diododate;</hi> and ſo <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin;</hi> The holy Ghoſt means that knowledge and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wherein the Church under the Goſpel ſhall excell that 

 under the Law.<note place="margin">Propheta ſub his loquendi formis deſignes intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiae lucem, quâ excelluit nova Eccleſia poſt Chriſtum exhibitum. Argum. 4. Resp.</note> 
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Argument is framed from the practice of the Church that was ſcattered abroad after the death of <hi>Stephen, Act. 8. 1, 4. They were all ſcattered abroad except the Apostles, veaſ.</hi> 1. and they that <hi>were ſcattered abroad went every where preaching the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To anſwer this briefly, I could tell you, that it is probable that they had ſome extraordinary Call, from God, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Apoſtles before they went, for they had extraordinary gifts, and where God gives extraordinary gifts by immediate inſpiration, I ſhould not oppoſe ſuch mens Preaching.</p>
               <p>But plainly and clearly, Firſt, I cannot ſee any ground to imagine that the word (they) in <hi>verſe</hi> 4. ſhould be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to every particular member, for in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> all were ſcattered, but <hi>ver.</hi> 5. it is only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they that were ſcattered, which may relate to ſome only. Beſides, it is paſt doubt, that among ſo many that were ſcattered, there were many women, and (as you heard already) they might not preach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Although the Apoſtles were left, it is known that there were many Officers in the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> beſides; There were Prophets, Evangeliſts, and the ſeventy Diſciples: <hi>Philip</hi> was one of the ſcattered ones, who went down to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and preached there; <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. whom you will finde called an Evangeliſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 8. ſo that if the word (they) muſt not be referred to all (as you ſee it cannot be) then more then probably to thoſe onely who were called to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59022:36"/>
Office; they who were ſcattered, being called to the Office of Teaching; did preach the word every where.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, the anſwer is moſt eaſie: It was in a time when the Church was through perſecution ſcattered, <hi>there was a great perſecution againſt the Church,</hi> verſ. 1. (which was one of the extraordinary caſes I before mentioned) when an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Calling could not be had, nor expected; and among people who before had not received the faith of Jeſus Chriſt. Nor do I know any ſober-minded man that is or would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Preaching of well-gifted men in ſuch times and caſes, without any ordinary ſetting apart to the Office, when and where it is impoſſible to be had. But this (through the yet continued goodneſs of a patient God) not being our caſe, the Argument is too weak to prove the preaching of onely gifted uncalled men in our daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Argum. 5.</note> There is but one thing more, and I have done. It 

 is loudly cried out, That although gifted men may not preach, yet thoſe who are ordained by Antichriſtian Biſhops, are not true Miniſters, and then not the Preachers neither.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reſp.</note> For anſwer to this I ſhall tell you, 1. That all Biſhops by 

 whom Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> have been ordained, were not Antichriſtian; Many of them have more ſtrongly oppoſed, and done more againſt Antichriſt, then yet we have. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their ſerviceable endeavours, they have many of them in ſuffering reſiſted unto bloud; Me thinks we might yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the labours of <hi>Jewel, Abbot, Davenant; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> &amp;c. nor ſhould we ſoon forget the bloud of <hi>Hooper, Ridley, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Latimer,</hi> &amp;c. which I ſpeak not to pleade for the Office of Lord-biſhop, nor to excuſe the wickedneſſe of thoſe who were popiſh and ungodly, but to recover the names, and to remember the vertues of thoſe who were and are godly and uſefull in their generations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There have been evil men in Office in the Church at all times, <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> among the Prieſts; <hi>Judas</hi> among the Apoſtles, Scribes and Phariſees in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair; Thoſe who preached out of envy in <hi>Pauls</hi> time. Yet this could not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59022:37"/>
null nor evacuate their miniſterial Acts. The Baptiſm of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> (for he had Commiſſion as well as the reſt to baptize) might be of as good Authority as of the reſt of the Apoſtles. If the water be pure at the fountain, although it run thorow many impure channels, it may become pure again. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation or Reprieve of a Judge, though wicked, is as Legal, as Authoritative, as of the moſt godly. A wicked Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel may give a Commiſſion to a Captain, yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſion's firm, it is not one tittle eſteemed leſſe effectual for the unworthineſſe of him that gives it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Biſhops did never ordain Miniſters as Biſhops, but as Presbyters, not in their own names, nor by the Impoſition of their own hands only, but in the name of others, and with the conjunction of other Presbyters.</p>
               <p>But becauſe that ſome ſay, That the Miniſters are called by the Biſhops, and the Biſhops by the Pope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I'le ſpeak a word of it. This (were it true) would not null their Call. For (not to inſiſt on what is urged by ſome of the firſt Reformers of the Proteſtant Churches caſting off the Pope) Baptiſm adminiſtred in the Romiſh Church is true Baptiſm; nor are any ſo baptized, if converted to the true Religion, baptized again, <hi>ut ſuprà.</hi> Many judicious Divines are of the ſame judgement concerning Ordination. Money coyned in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies was not the leſſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant after; the Impreſs of the Popiſh Princeſs had no power to adulterate the ſilver. The Veſſels of Gods houſe were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Babylon</hi> by the hand of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> which yet were not the leſſe fit for the ſervice of God, when returned. The naturall ſucceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt was propagated tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the loins of <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Thamar,</hi> nay ſhall I ſay, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf came thorow the womb of a ſinfull woman, yet received no pollution by it.</p>
               <p>We muſt learn to diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Perſons</hi> and the <hi>Offices</hi> of men, between their perſonall Acts, and their Acts of Office; a wicked man may be a lawful, though not a good Officer; and then the Acts of his Office valid; this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all in other Offices, and muſt it be only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59022:37"/>
in the Office of a Miniſter? <hi>Jehu</hi> was a wicked man, was therefore his pulling down the Idols of <hi>Baal</hi> evil? Could his perſonall wickedneſſe evacuate all the civill or religious Acts (although good in themſelves) he did by vertue of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?</p>
               <p>If then it be proved that our ſetting apart or Ordination to the work of the Miniſtery, be right for ſubſtance, having an inward Call from God, and an outward Call according to the ordinary rule laid down in Scripture, the failing in ſome circumſtances cannot make it void, nor then the Miniſtry ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a falſe or no Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">This was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſince I preached it at <hi>Epping.</hi>
                  </note> But the great cry is againſt the wicked Oaths (as they are 

 called) that the Biſhops impoſed, and the Miniſters took at their Ordination. This makes a great noiſe; but you'l finde it laden only with powder, it may caſt ſome filth, make ſome ſound, it may defile the faces of ſome, and fill the ears of more, but hath nothing of ſtrength to hurt them againſt whom it is diſcharged: For anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This nothing (or very little) concerns their Ordination who took no Oaths at all, as it is now, and for ſome late years hath heen in our Church; As it hath been longer in other Churches where there have been no Biſhops to impoſe them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many godly men denied ſome Oath that ſome Biſhops would have impoſed, and were therefore refuſed: Not that they conceived their Ordination could have been injured, or their Call made void by it, but that they ſcrupled the matter of the Oath, and would not accept a Call upon ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some had no offenſive Oath at all offered; no other then what they in the Univerſities, and moſt men of the Nation upon ſome occaſions had taken before <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Oath of Supremacy. I ſpeak this on mine own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enbe, there was no other impoſed on, no other offered to me.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it is the Oath of Canonicall Obedience, that (I think) is ſo much ſhot againſt us. I'le tell you what it is,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59022:38"/>
and then (although I will not handle the matter of the Oath, but ſuppoſe, though not grant it, as bad as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it) ſhew you, that the taking of this could not <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ull, nor at all hurt the Call of Miniſters. <hi>You ſhall obey your Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Officers, the Arch-biſhop and Biſhop in their Dioceſs in things lawfull and honeſt.</hi> This (if I'know it) is the Oath.</p>
               <p>Therefore fourthly, Neither this nor any other Oath is any part of the Odination of Miniſters. This was done by prayer and laying on of hands; the Oaths were given at ſome other time (before Ordiantion) for ſome other ends. A Conſtable before he is made ſuch, had formerly the Oath of Supremacy given him, but that did not make him Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it was only to try whether he was fit for the office. Collonels and Captains were made ſuch by the Parliament; but before they had their Commiſſion, were enjoyned to take the Covenant: the taking or giving of the Covenant did not make them Officers, but their Commiſſion; the other was only to try whether they were fit to be employed in the Service. When men come to be Ordained Miniſters, they had ſome Oath or Oaths impoſed upon them, but not as part of Ordination, only as (ſome thought) convenient tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als whether they were fit for the Calling: Every man that had valour, that had skill, was not fit to make a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but he muſt be faithfull to, elſe might he leade his men to the contrary party, or upon their own ruine: Every man that had Gifts was not fit for a Miniſter, unleſſe he were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and peaceable too; elſe might he injure the Church by his Calling. The Oath of Supremacy was to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Papiſts (and I could wiſh that there were ſome other way found now to ſtop the like gap) the Oath (as it was called) of Canonicall Obedience, was to diſcover (as the Biſhops were pleaſed to fancy it) whether they were conformable to Government or not. But it is clear, that whatſoever the Oaths were, or whatſoever their intentions that impoſed them, the taking of an Oath was no part of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and ſo had no influence upon their Office that took it.</p>

I ſhall conclude all with theſe three Propoſals very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable at this time, and to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether every man ought not to continue in the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in which God hath ſet him? according to that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What can we conceive to be meant by Chriſt, where he ſaith, <hi>He hath left ſome Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> Eph, 4. 11. If all that have Gifts may do their work? or what <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, where he ſaith, All the members have not the ſame Office, and therefore he that hath the <hi>Miniſtry muſt wait on his Miniſtry,</hi> or he <hi>that teacheth on teaching,</hi> Rom. 12. 4. 7. if this be not a diſtinct Office from the Memberſhip of others?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider how much Papiſts and <hi>Socinians</hi> are by this gratified; and by our weakening the hands of each other get ſtrength againſt us: what a breach we make for the open e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to enter at.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts would prove us no Miniſters, becauſe not made by them and their Church, and ſo would argue us to be (what they commonly call us) all Heretikes; as having no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and then no Sacraments, and then no converſion: and how ſad is it, that ſeeming Friends ſhould do the work of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen enemies; that Brethren (ſo called) ſhould think to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that on a ſudden, which adverſaries have ſo long in vain attempted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> would not have us right Miniſters, becauſe ordained at all: when the only giving of Gifts, and the Election of the Church is (in their eſteem) ſufficient Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: yet they although formerly decried Hereticks, go further then many now adares cried-up brethren. They deny not but if the Church had continued uncorrupt, the cuſtome of the primitive times might have been continued: men might have been ordained, although they do not hold it neceſſary.

                  <note place="margin">Here ended the Sermons.</note> 

AFter I had ended the Sermon (which was the laſt I had  to preach on that buſineſſe) It was asked, who made me a Miniſter, or in what Church I was made ſuch? Which although then impertinently asked, hath been now ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered.</p>
               <p>It was afterward enquired, Whether any men were ever made Miniſters by men ſince the Apoſtles daies, or thoſe ſent by them? It hath been abundantly cleared, and by this enquiry in part acknowledged, that in the Apoſtles daies, and theirs ſent by them, Miniſters were by men ſet apart for the Office, and you have ſeen what ſetting apart it was which was in their time practiſed: I think then it will be granted, That the Apoſtles examples are rules for our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which is ſufficiently urged by our oppoſers, when it may ſerve their turns, What pretence elſe for this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Only they make uſe of the Apoſtles practice, as <hi>Jewel</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jewel <hi>Apol.</hi>
                  </note> tels <hi>Harding</hi> he made uſe of the Fathers, if they favoured 

 him then they are the Fathers, and muſt not their word be taken? If they were urged againſt him, then they were but men, and <hi>humanum eſt errare;</hi> As Merchants uſe their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſometimes they ſtand for a penny, and ſometimes for a pound. Beſides that, it hath been ſo conſtantly practiſed by all the Churches of Chriſt ſince, that it were but vain to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on it. I ſhall refer you for that to D. <hi>Seaman,</hi> where it is ſo well done. Nay, if Miniſters were not made by men ſince the Apoſtles daies, who made theſe men ſuch? But if this were intended (as I fear) to delude the people, that we could not prove by Scripture, that any were made Miniſters by men ſince the Apoſtles daies (in which there is ſo little ſtrength in the eyes of wiſe men, it needs nothing to repell it, yet becauſe more ignorant people might not ſee it) I ſhall only ſay, There was no Scripture written ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles daies, then if I ſhould ask him, how he could prove by Scripture, that there was any Miniſter, or any Church,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59022:39"/>
or that any hath preached ſince the Apoſtles dayes, or thoſe ſent by them? either of theſe would be as hardly proved.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Vex filet meus deficit, &amp; nox mea tantum ſed etiam Angelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> How ſtrangely was <hi>Cyprian</hi> overcome, when he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 

 the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That his tongue was not able to expreſſe, nor his thoughts in any meaſure able to reach it.</hi> If it were fit to apply it, I ſhould think, what aſtoniſhment hath befallen even men and Angels, to behold the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evil ſpirits (which in theſe daies) are riſen up againſt, and would lay violent hands upon the Miniſtery, <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>In all bodies there are two ranks, Head and Members, Father and Childe,</hi> &amp;c. It is much, that only in the Church there ſhould be no diſtinction of Miniſter and People, of Flock and Overſeer. <hi>The ſeven Starres are in Chriſts right hand,</hi> Revel. 1. 20. which was ſpoken only of the <hi>Angels,</hi> Ibid. not of the <hi>Churches;</hi> of the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> not of any <hi>gifted Brother.</hi> Surely they muſt tug hard that remove them. May I not ſay in this, as it was ſpoken in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>My Father is ſtronger then I, and no man taketh them out of his hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What are the Miniſters the only troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they are ſo troubled by all ſorts of people? Is this the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their pains, the return of their prayers, ſighs, groans and labours for you? Whence hath ſo many people been freed from Popery, been converted unto God in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that it hath been the moſt famous Church in the world (I would it had not loſt its Crown) but by their endeavours inſtrumentally? And can that be an unlawful Miniſtery, that hath brought in ſo many ſouls to God? Or is this a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence now to cry them down? Would you violently thruſt them out of the Church, who have travelled in birth to bring you into it? Or can you think them Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, that have drawn you into Chriſt, if you are at all in him. Whence have theſe <hi>enlightened People</hi> gotten all their Knowledge and Gifts, whereby they are enabled to pleade ſo ſtifly againſt the Miniſtry, but from the Preachings and Writings of theſe Miniſters they thus decry? (for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59022:40"/>
Gifts are now acquired by the uſe of means.) Are they now ſo evil, who have been the Inſtruments of ſo much good? Is this all their Reward, to be beaten with the Weapons they have put into others hands? Is the childe bred up only to ſcratch out the Fathers eyes? <q>
                     <hi>Clemens</hi> who lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an hundred and thirteen years after Chriſt, ſpeaking of <note place="margin">Clem. <hi>in Epiſt.</hi> ad Corinth.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Contra Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teros ſeditionem movere.</note> 
                  <hi>For which of their good deeds would ye kill them?</hi> If the Miniſters of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are no true Miniſters, then where are the true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es? And if no true Churches, who hath power to ſend them to preach, that queſtion the Call of others? Truly I would adviſe ſuch to forbear preaching till Chriſt come again to call new Apoſtles, and then poſſibly they might be ſent among the reſt. Is the paſt example of the Apoſtles of no value? Is the conſtantly ſucceſſive practice of the Churches in all ages of no prevalency?</p>
               <p>Oh that I could ſpeak (in this) a ſeaſonable word to the whole Nation: If it hath been proved (as I hope it is) that the Miniſtery (ſo ſet apart) is Gods Ordinance, it is a great evil to oppoſe, a ſin of a great magnitude to overturn it. I could ſay as <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> Act. 5. 19. <hi>Ye cannot overthrow it, leſt happily ye be found to fight againſt God.</hi> A faithfull Miniſtry hath been alwaies eſteemed the greateſt bleſſing, and is it now become the greateſt curſe? Are we weary of our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or are we weary of God, or rather is not God weary of us? I wiſh <hi>England</hi> trifle not ſo long with their meat, till it be leſt before they are aware. Should the Miniſtry now contemned be ſuddenly taken away, be irrecoverably loſt, how would it then be too late repented! Did you ever reade that the Miniſtery was loſt to a people, and that God ſtaied long after? If the Shepherd be deſtroyed, who ſhall watch the flock, who ſhall prevent the worrying, the devouring of the ſheep? <hi>If there be no interpreter; who ſhall declare to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59022:40"/>
man his Righteouſneſſe?</hi> Job 33. 23, 24. If <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> be taken away, who ſhall pray for, or keep off the plague from the people! Did <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ever proſper, when the Prophets were ſlain? Is not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ingaged in their quarrell? And is it nothing to make him your Enemy? He may at preſent permit their injury, but will ſeverely avenge it afterward. Have not the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters been <hi>the Horſemen and Chariots of Iſrael?</hi> Have not they ſtood between you and Popery for theſe many years? Have not they ſtood in the gap between you and Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation many a time? Are you now ſo ſtrengthned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery, that you need their help no longer? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have not the Champions of Popery ſo inſinuated, that they have perſwaded you to caſt off your defence? Are you ſo ſecure from Gods Judgements, that you need their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion no longer? I pray God it be not rather, that your deſtruction being decreed, the Lord will no longer permit the means of its prevention among you, It was a ſad ſign, when the people would not hear <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> nor God ſuffer him to pray for them. What would be your miſery, ſhould it be ever ſaid of <hi>England,</hi> as once of <hi>Jeruſalem, Oh England, England! that stoneſt the Prophets, and killeſt them that are ſent to thee; How often would I have gathered thee, as an hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth her chickens, and thou wouldſt not! Behold, your houſe is left unto you deſolate,</hi> Luk. 13. 34. 35. Oh that before it be too late, <hi>We might know the things that belong to our peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have done, and can expect what I may ſuffer from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly men, but I ſhall rather account it mine honour, then my ſhame, to ſuffer for Chriſt, whoſe cauſe (in this) I pleade, although I am ſorry I have no more ſtrength to defend it. It was a good encouragement <hi>Jerome</hi> gave to <hi>Auſtin;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Signum eſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joris gloriae, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes haereticite deteſtantur.</note> but I'le not apply it, leſt it ſhould ſavour of too much glorying 

 in my ſelf, or bitterneſſe to others. I can think ſome will finde fault with all, ſome with ſome part, others with other parts of it. I hope none will accuſe me of either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or bitterneſſe; If any ſhall diſcover to me my weakneſſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59022:41"/>
(of which I am ſufficiently jealous) I ſhall humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. If any ſhall convince me of any falſhood (to which I am not yet conſcious) I ſhall chearfully retract it. Only I ſhall expect the ſame meekneſſe and candor I have brought with me: Uneven Weapons make no fair combat: And ſhall deſire, that if any anſwer it their Name may be ſubſcribed: I ſhall expect the finger of a Jeſuite, becauſe their cauſe is ſo much concerned in it.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince I had finiſhed this task, there came to mine hands the confident news of the <hi>Pulpit Guard Routed:</hi> which might have prevented my further march; But upon better examination I found, in this, as in other things, men for the moſt part ſpeak as they would have it; for ſurely had not the Author himſelf report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, others would not have judged it a Rout, nor do I think they'l yet beleeve it. Indeed I ſhould have imputed it to a ſtrange <hi>Providenc,</hi> if through ſo much weakneſſe, he ſhould have gotten ſo compleat a victory. But I perceived that this attempt was not deſigned only againſt that Guard, but equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt all the Party, and the Cauſe; I thought good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to appear, although but in the Rear, and with this ſmall Party, while the other might have liberty to charge him more throughly; at leaſt, that my Brigade (I mean the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons I have printed with this) might march with the more repute in the world.</p>
            <p>I had not time to anſwer the Book largely, (for I was conſtrained to do this, while the Preſſe wrought off the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) nor ſhould I have done much more in it, had my time been longer, and my leaſure greater; not only for that I finde little of Argument, although it is ſwelled into ſome bigneſſe with railing, but that the ſum of what is there urged, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken to by the Sermons herewith printed. I ſhall only in this make ſome further diſcovery of its weakneſſe, and direct you to them for more full anſwer.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe (upon what ſudden view I had of it) I finde but little work to do, but am much puzzled about the manner of doing it. It is in this, as with ſome ſeabbed ſheep, with ſome
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59022:42"/>
rancour'd wound, a man muſt cut off a great deal of filth, paſſe by much corruption, before he come to apply the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or attempt the cure. He is ſo bitter in his expreſſions againſt the Gentleman, ſo loud in his railings againſt the <hi>Coat</hi> (as he cals it, <hi>pag.</hi> 19.) that he deſerves no fair anſwer; But I forbear, leaſt in this the Proverb ſhould be verified, <hi>Like to like, quoth the Devil to the Collier.</hi> Onely, if I ſhould take equall pains to tell large ſtories, of the many filthy behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, the ranting practices of men of his gang, malice might be ſuſpected under it, no ſtrength of Argument would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, yet I wiſh that thoſe who might have account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it railing and bitterneſſe in me, do not eſteem it a vertue, an excellency in him.</p>

               <note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </note> I'le not meddle with his review of himſelf in the <hi>Looking-glaſſe,</hi> I ſhall leave that to him, who is more able and more 

 concerned in it; where he hath ſufficient opportunity to vindicate Truth, if he will adventure to fully his finger with ſo black an object. Yet I cannot but obſerve how he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies his Antagoniſt, in what he complains of as moſt injured in: he is troubled that he is <hi>reproached with the term of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Sectary;</hi> Surely he that but looks on him in that <hi>Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glaſſe,</hi> will conclude that he is only ſtandered with a matter of truth.</p>
            <p>Nor will I examine the triall and verdict he himſelf makes and gives of the Miniſters (under the name of falſe Prophets) For that, I ſhall refer him to be judged by him, whom he is pleaſed to name as Judge (I mean Jeſus Chriſt) in his cauſe; who will doubtleſſe one day ſhew him, What ſentence he will give upon the evidence he hath produced. Yet this is obſervable, that all the witneſſes he ſummons or brings in, are either of his forcing or making. What teſtimony of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth he bring, which he doth not miſapply? What evidence doth he produce from the <hi>Churches, deluded Souls, publike Peace,</hi> but what is <hi>dug out of his own pit,</hi> made of his own brain?</p>
            <p>To take notice of his ſtrength of Arguments, or depth of learning, is impoſſible, there is no diſcovery of what is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59022:42"/>
not. Althou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gh I muſt confeſſe, when I heard of, and ſaw ſome bold and confident aſſertions, I expected ſomething to ſupport them. I ſhall acknowledge my ſelf <hi>a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> (in this) if ever <hi>much learning made him mad.</hi> Yet I cannot but ſmile, that thoſe, who (becauſe of their own ignorance) decry, and rail againſt learning in others, are willing to make uſe of what they have themſelves, yea, would counterfeit more too ſometimes. I finde him at the charge of too whole words of Latin in one place, <hi>Cum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilegio;</hi> if it be the language of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> methinks his mouth ſhould not meddle of it: if it be any part of the <hi>tail of the Beaſt,</hi> his tongue ſhould not lick of it. In another place <hi>pag.</hi> 98. he ſtrains hard for two more, <hi>Epiſcopos, Presbyteros,</hi> But I confeſſe he hath brought them forth in a wofull caſe (the accuſative plurall for the nominative ſingular) but I ſee he ſpeaks all in the accuſative caſe. I would not wrong the man; if he meant Greek, it may be he thought <hi>heathen Greek</hi> was not fit to be uſed by Chriſtians, and therefore writ them in the letters of his mother-tongue, If he intended Latin, he might conceive that true Latin only was the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or that the whores head had been ſhelter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under <hi>Priſcians</hi> Cap, and he might lawfully break it. But I would willingly know how he got or came by this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſurely it was only humane, and then acquired only by induſtry; if it had been an immediate inſpiration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that would have taught him to have ſpoken it true. The Spirit is able to bring forth its conceptions perfect. He that gives the uſe of Tongues, could not want power to ſpeak properly: they that <hi>spake with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance,</hi> Acts 2. 4. <hi>were heard by the multitude speaking their own language,</hi> verſe 6. Beſides, what ado he keeps with his terms of Logick, the <hi>major</hi> and the <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition; if Logick be ſo black an Art, I wonder he would touch it; but I ſee he loves all of the <hi>Colour,</hi> unleſſe it be a <hi>black Gown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would give you a glimpſe of his skill in interpretation of Scripture, that ſince he fails in his humanity, you might ſee
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59022:43"/>
what Divinity he hath; but I ſhall ſpeak only of ſo much of that, as will fall into my way, as I run over thoſe few things which relate to the Arguments I have urged or anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In which I ſhall only give you ſome Animad<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er ions upon what he ſpeaks; the book will not require, nor will my time afford any long buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>I finde (in S. <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s expreſſion) much ſpoken but little ſaid about the Prieſts under the Law, and Miniſters under the Goſpel <hi>(pag.</hi> 17.) Becauſe there is ſome difference in their ſervice, therefore muſt their Offices be queſtioned? <hi>The Office of a Prieſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was appointed by God;</hi> and was not the Office of Paſtors and Teachers ſo too? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p>To excuſe himſelf both from <hi>Corah's</hi> guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſaith <hi>pag. 18. Corah and his company were ſmitten for doing what was forbidden, but the Saints are commanded, and commended for preaching,</hi> &amp;c. he hath not proved either of them by the letter of Scripture, but let him prove the latter, either directly, or by juſt deduction, and we will forgive him the former. You may ſee (in the Sermons) what command they had, nor can I yet ſee, by what he ſaith, any more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it is queſtioned by him, to whom <hi>Corah</hi> and his company ſhould be rather compared, whether to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Miniſters, or the only gifted Preachers: obſerve theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corah</hi> and his company out of a pretended fitneſſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſervice to which they were not called, would have intruded into the Office of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> It is eaſily jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged who are moſt guilty in this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corah</hi> and his company did not monopelize the Office to themſelves (as he pretends, <hi>pag. ead.)</hi> but would have ſhared with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> in what it was conceived they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolized. What think you now? who are moſt like <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and then may moſt fear their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>For his railing, That Miniſters have no more Authority then the Devill and the Pope could give them, and no more

               <hi>The Miniſters have no Call according to the letter</hi> (ibid.) I had though (if by the <hi>letter</hi> he means the <hi>letter</hi> of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) ſetting men apart <hi>by prayer, faſting, and impoſition of hands,</hi> had been according to the <hi>letter</hi> of Scripture; I am ſure what he objects againſt it is beſides the <hi>letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor have they any Call from the Spirit,</hi> (ibid.) Are not their gifts manifeſt? Can he without bluſhing accuſe them of <hi>walking in the Devils darkneſſe?</hi> will not many of his own party contradict him in this? will not they acknowledge, that many Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> live holily, <hi>walk by the light of Gods Spirit?</hi> What ſpirit hath poſſeſſed the man? truth, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, charity, are the fruits of the Spirit of God. He'l ſee what is ſpoken about gifts, <hi>ſuprà,</hi> He ſaith, <hi>it's dangerous for men to preach without a Call, and dangerous for people to hear ſuch,</hi> &amp;c. I am (in this) wholly of his minde; <note place="margin">In the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> I hope by what hath been ſpoken already, and what ſhall yet be touched on, it 

 will appear manifeſt, that only gifted brethren have no Call to preach.</p>
            <p>Nay, take his own words, and (if I underſtand them) there is enough granted for our purpoſe, <hi>(pag.</hi> 19.) <hi>although it's true, that none can preach according to the intention of that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> Rom. 10. 15. <hi>(viz.) for the working of faith, and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſouls, yet it doth not follow, that every gifted brother may not preach:</hi> (theſe are his own words.) If he means that <hi>gifted brethren</hi> cannot preach for the working of faith and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſouls, we have enough; nor can I ſee what elſe he ſhould mean; for it is evident, that the <hi>preaching</hi> of <hi>Sent Miniſters</hi> is the means of converting ſouls, of the begetting of faith. Beſides, the Gentlemans Propoſition, which he tries to anſwer, is, <hi>If none may preach but thoſe that are ſent, then every gifted brother may not preach.</hi> What he ſpeaks of <hi>ſending,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59022:44"/>
(pag. ead. &amp; prox,)</hi> I'le ſpeak ſomewhat to; and becauſe upon that and two things more hangs all his diſcourſe, the full anſwer of which ſhakes the whole book, Ile ſtand a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on them; yet not neither, becauſe they have been ſo fully anſwered already, <hi>ut ſuprà.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Gifting is ſending, it relates to the internall power of the Spirit in the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(ibid.)</hi> Indeed there muſt be a ſending from God, where men are faithfull Miniſters; but there muſt be (beſides) an outward deſignation to the Office, where any be lawfull <hi>Preachers.</hi> But beſides what hath been ſpoken already (in the Sermons,) That only <hi>gifting</hi> is <hi>not the ſending</hi> the Apoſtle mentions; I'le ſhew you in Scripture, that <hi>ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is only ſpoken of the outward ſetting thoſe apart for the ſervice who are ſent. (Not to name what is ſo much, and ſo often ſpoken of <hi>Chriſts being ſent by his Father.)</hi> Where <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was to go about Gods ſervice, the Lord asked, <hi>Whem ſhall I ſend?</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Send me,</hi> Iſa, 6. 8, 9. it was not ſpoken of gifting him, that was done before, but of his outward miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and thus it is explained by all I meet withall, who had as much of the Spirit to interpret Scripture by, as this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Diſciples were <hi>ſent,</hi> when after they were gifted, they were bid to go, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1, 5. yea, he ſeems himſelf to diſtinguiſh, where <hi>(p.</hi> 24.) it is ſaid, <hi>The gifting and ſending of the gifted brethren, is, when the Lord in a bleth them in a meaſure to it, and ſaith to them, Go.</hi> Are not <hi>gifting</hi> and ſaying <hi>go,</hi> two diſtinct acts? which is manifeſt in <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 22. 14, 15, 10, 22, whom he inſtanceth in, although he would falſly infer the contrary from another Scripture, yea, would delude people, by telling them, <hi>that he preached before he was ſeparated,</hi> Acts 13. 2. but I ſay he did not preach, before he was by a ſpeciall command <hi>ſent by Chriſt.</hi> To this purpoſe were the Apoſtles ſaid, when by faſting, praier, and impoſition of hands they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, to ſend them,</hi> Acts 13. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is very unhappy in confounding ordinary with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſes; which is ſo much anſwered already, that I ſearce know what to ſay more. I there ſhewed, that thoſe who were ſent moſt extraordinarily, were (beſides gifting of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59022:44"/>
them) ſet apart for the ſervice; and what ſetting apart ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily was afterward practiſed Although the Miniſters were not immediatly <hi>ſent</hi> by God, which was extraordinary, yet they had praier and laying on of hands, the ordinary deſignation the Scripture mentions. This he pretends not to; if he hath an extraordinary miſſion let him diſcover it. Extraordinary gifts we finde none; if God hath any time ſaid to him, as to the Diſciples, <hi>go;</hi> or as to <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 22. 22. <hi>I'le ſend thee to the Gentiles,</hi> whoſe examples chiefly he uſeth to prove his Calling, let him manifeſt it. If he ſhall any more adventure upon ſuch a buſineſſe as this, let him no more pleade extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Cals, but in extraordinary caſes: let him not urge <hi>Act.</hi> 8. Diſciples practice, unleſs he can parallell the caſes to: It will elſe be to as little purpoſe as this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He often diſtinguiſheth between the <hi>gift</hi> and the <hi>Office.</hi> A gifted member may exerciſe his <hi>gift,</hi> although not execute the <hi>Office;</hi> I ſay their gifts may be exerciſed, but it muſt be within the bounds of their calling, not in the place of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. A file-leader (if he be able) may exerciſe his file, or two files, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he muſt not carry them, much leſſe the whole company into the field, nor engage them againſt the enemy till he hath Commiſſion. In the exerciſe of a private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans gift, there is but a charitative admonition, which hath no other obligation, but as the matter may be good he ſpeaks; in the execution of an Office, there is an Obligation to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>virtute offlcij (ut ſuprà.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding his former diſtinction, he ſaith, <hi>page 27, 28. That a gifted brother may baptize and adminiſter the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per too.</hi> Strange! may they do all the ſervice of an Officer, yet not execute the Office? It is time for me to cry down ſuch <hi>Logick</hi> too. In the adminiſtring of Baptiſin, there is but little exerciſe of gifts; I ſhould have though this had been part of a Miniſters Office.</p>
            <p>When he ſo confidently aſſerted this, I expected proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable proof; I thought I ſhould have heard of ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary things at extraordinary times and caſes; which I ſhould have anſwered, <hi>quod fieri non debet, factum valet;</hi> but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59022:45"/>
all the prof I finde is of <hi>Johns</hi> baptizing, <hi>(ib.)</hi> And was not <hi>John</hi> commiſſioned for the ſervice? And <hi>the diſciples, who were then the ordinary Christians, baptized,</hi> (p. e<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d.) Did they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize when they were but ordinary Chriſtians, before they were ſent forth by Chriſt? But if when they baptized, there were not other Chriſtians, whom did they baptiz? And, <hi>Peter commanded people to be baptized. Act</hi> 10. <hi>(ib.)</hi> and (he ſaith) <hi>it is probable there were gifted preaching brethren who aid the work.</hi> Away with ſuch probabilities. I ſee it is lawfull (when it may ſerve ſome mens turns) to draw inferences from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: nor will <hi>Act.</hi> 8. (again urged) prove any thing.</p>
            <p>But to delude the people, he ſaith, <hi>Preaching diſciples may baptize.</hi> What then? They who had or have a Commiſſion to preach, might or may baptize, the ſame Commiſſion inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding both; may thoſe therefore either preach or baptize who have no Commiſſion at all? <hi>(p.</hi> 30.) he ſaith, <hi>Preaching and baptiſm are not ſo united together, as never to be ſeparated.</hi> But (whatſoever he pretends) we finde them put into the ſame Commiſſion, nor (for all the ſmoak he raiſeth) do I think he can produce one example in the whole Scripture, of any that ever baptized, who was not Commiſſioned to preach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The command makes things lawfull or unlawfull,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>(ibid.)</hi> An excellent poſition, one of the cleareſt truths in his whole Book; and I could wiſh that as it holds, ſo it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved and practiſed in all things. I ſhall inferre, That till he proveth there is ſome command (or what is equivalent) for the preaching of only gifted men, he muſt give me leave to call it unlawfull.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak nothing to his bitter inveighing againſt Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery (in great part of his Book) only let you ſee his black mouth, and ſelf-contradictions. <hi>You have altered the name from Biſhop, Prieſt, and Jeſuite to Presbyter,</hi> pag. 22. And were not Presbyters long before Jeſuite, Prieſt or Biſhop either (in his ſenſe?) <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. he ſaith, <hi>There was a Presbytery in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times.</hi> Yet <hi>Pag. 25. It was a ſtrange name till lately.</hi> Will prople never be ſenſible of ſuch mens abuſes? Had he but ſome few of theſe gifts that many of the godly Miniſters of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59022:45"/>
Chriſt have, he would finde <hi>Presbyters</hi> often enough in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>See how he foams <hi>Pag. 27. Presbyterian wolves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if they could have prevailed, they would have ſucked the bloud of the lambs of Chriſt.</hi> A charitable cenſure: What they would have done, he knows not, I know who do labour to ſuck the bloud of the lambs of Chriſt. Let me tell him, time was, that if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had exerciſed ſuch cruelty againſt him and his party, as he would have inflicted now upon the Miniſters of Chriſt, his tongue muſt not have run at this rate. It is pity ſo much tenderneſſe ſhould be repaid with ſo great ſeverity. But the Proverb is true:</p>
            <p>Pag. 20. <hi>We have no true Church, no true Miniſters.</hi> How then got he to be of a Church, or when did the true Church begin? For <hi>Pag. 29. We are not speaking</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>out of, but in a conſtituted Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is much put to it to anſwer that Argument, If gifted men may preach, then gifted women too. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is your concluſion, we ſay, and the Scripture ſaith, that gifted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren may preach: you Will will conclude, that gifted women may preach.</hi> But where doth the Scripture mention <hi>gifted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> more then <hi>gifted women?</hi> I had thought <hi>gifting</hi> had been the qualification, thè <hi>ſending;</hi> and then in one as well as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Let people ſee what pains he takes to ſhift off the truth, what <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He labours much to take off thoſe anſwers given to what is urged, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, But for all he ſaith to that, I ſhall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59022:46"/>
referre the Reader to what I have ſpoken of that place, and of the argument drawn thence, in the former part of this Book. He acknowledgeth propheſying to be extraordinary under the law, but not in Goſpel-daies, <hi>pag.</hi> 60. If it were ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Primitive times, why was it given then by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? Why were not all that had gifts Prophets? If it be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary now, Why doth it not continue? If <hi>Th. Collier</hi> can but diſcover that there is ſuch a gift of propheſying now as was then; when <hi>(ut ſuprà)</hi> they received immediate Revelation, when they could foretell things to come, when they could by ſudden inſtinct explain dark and difficult Prophecies, he will ſpeak ſomething; but I do not ſee that is attempted; I would adviſe him never to urge that Scripture more, until he can manifeſt ſuch a gift. Yet I cannot but obſerve his learned expoſition upon the 32. <hi>verſe</hi> of 1 <hi>Cor. 14. Let the ſpirits of the Prophets be ſubject to the Prophets.</hi> P. 21. <hi>(i.) They are able to contain themſelves, and be ſilent, while another ſpeaks:</hi> When it it is ſaid, <hi>ver, 29 that they muſt speak two or three, and the others judge.</hi> The text it ſelf tels you what ſubjection is meant there <hi>(i.)</hi> to the judgement of the Prophets. Surely if he had ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit that he pretends to, he would have more skill in diſcerning of Scripture. Let none think that he hath the ſpirit of propheſying, ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. that can no better explain ſo eaſie a Text.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </note> The Gentleman having ſaid that the holy Ghoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends 

 Learning: He replies <hi>pag. 41. Holy Ghoſts? Is there any ſuch word in all the Scripture as Ghost?</hi> How now? which way went the Spirit of God from him? What immediatly inſpired. yet ignorant of this? hath he forgotten <hi>Mat.</hi> 28, 20. Hath Baptiſm been ſo long out of faſhion, that he hath forgotten the words of it? Is <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 4. (beſides other places) quite out of his minde? Hath his new and clear light dazled his eyes? or hath he been digging ſo long in the bottomleſſe pit, that the ſmoak hath wholly beclouded him?</p>
            <p>He would know whether <hi>Pauls</hi> gift and ours were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved different waies; <hi>(p. 45.)</hi> I ſhall grant they were, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his falſe inference, we may have gifts from the ſame ſpirit, yet

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59022:46"/>
in a diverſe manner: As different gifts, ſo different wayes of conferring them were from the ſame ſpirit. <hi>Paul</hi> had his by immediate Revelation, we receive ours more mediatly, by the uſe of means. One man takes up water at the Fountain; is it not the ſame water, or muſt it be wickedly come by, that another takes up in the channell? Why had he not as well queſtioned what <hi>Timothy</hi>'s gift had been, when it was different from <hi>Pauls</hi> too? What is ſpoken concerning <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 25. to the 30. is ſufficiently cleared before: yet without further reference, he grants me enough, <hi>that it was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſpirit of prophecie:</hi> then whatſoever may be practiſed in Goſpel dayes; that place will afford us no Argument in ordinary times, when extraordinary gifts are not given. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat</hi> ſent Princes to teach <hi>(pag. 62.)</hi> from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. but you'll ſee the <hi>Levites</hi> had the Law of the Lord, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. It is urged: <hi>May not you do your ſelf, what you may command your ſervant to do? No:</hi> A King might command a Judge to hear and determine Cauſes, which he may not do himſelf: A King inthoſe dayes might command a Prieſt to offer ſacrifice, which to have done himſelf had been ſin. Our <hi>Iehoſhaphats</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>pag. 63.) have of late rather encouraged the gifted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for to teach, then prohibited them.</hi> I think the State is little beholding to him; If another ſhould have ſaid ſo much, it might have been taken ill. I am ſure they have not yet recalled thoſe <hi>Ordinances of Parliament,</hi> made againſt ſuch Preachers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that ſent Chriſt extraordinarily, ſends lay Prophets or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily</hi> (pag. 67.) that remains yet to be proved: this is <hi>per idem</hi> as he learnedly anſwers in anothers place. Let us but ſee the examples of any in Scripture that ever Preached, who were no otherwiſe <hi>ſent,</hi> then our gifted brethren are now. You have ſeen the Apoſtles, and Diſciples were ſent extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily by the immediate voice of God; but theſe, although they urge their examples, have no ſuch miſſion.</p>
            <p>He would perſwade us that <hi>Propheſying was not an Office, but a gift,</hi> (pag. 60. &amp; <hi>alibi.)</hi> yet it is numbred among the ſeverall Offices of the Church, <hi>Rom</hi> 12. 7. he confeſſeth that the Office of Miniſters is meant in the ſame place, why then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59022:47"/>
not propheſying; when they are equally called gifts? ſo they are called too, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. yet there meant of Offices.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of his vain-glorious crying up himſelf and his Party as the only gifted, the only godly men; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefull reproaching of the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ignorant, Antichriſtian Devils, what not? Let the world judge who have the beſt gifts, and (by this) who have the moſt pride: I could quickly ſhew you a parallell between their Doctrines and lives too, whether are moſt ſutable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God; but I could not do it without ſeeming bitterneſs to them, without a ſhew of arrogance in our ſelves. In this let God and all (but) moderate people judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall I ſpeak (more then I have in the former part) to his railing Arguments to prove Miniſters Antichriſtian; there is but one that is at all likely to get any credit, and that is anſwered there.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only propoſe what he asked, <hi>p. 44. Who are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet men, the gifted brethren or the Miniſters?</hi> If their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice will not ſufficiently diſcover it, in running from place to place to diſturb Congregations, who practiſed quietneſs only while they had no power to be unquiet; let this railing book be ſpread before you, and then ſee what boilings of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, what trouble ſome humours theſe men are affected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; who under a pretence of Chriſtian liberty diſturb the peace of Chriſtians; abuſe the Names (and if it were in their power) would even take away the lives of godly men.</p>
            <p>I muſt end, yet I might have ſpoken ſomewhat more, if I had had more time, but the Preſs will ſtay. I hope it is enough to diſcover the invalidity of his proof, who hath given in a great charge againſt the Miniſters: and then to take off the prejudice of Readers that might poſſeſs them againſt what I have Printed in Juſtification of the Call of the Miniſters of <hi>England.</hi> I am apt to think (but ſhall ſubmit to the judgement of more wiſe, and (now) leſſe engaged men) that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of value in his whole book, but either in the former part, or this ſhort Appendix, may receive a full and ſatisfying
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59022:47"/>
Anſwer. If there be any need, I may be larger afterward: In the mean time I ſhall earneſtly deſire the Reader to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both with a ſingle eye, and unprejudiced heart; look through the railing, and ſee what of Argument you can finde in that, then excuſe my weakneſs, and ſee whether you may finde an Anſwer in this. Take not reproaches for Arguments (which content ſome) It is eaſier to accuſe then to prove: caſt not off the truth for any infirmity in the managure of its cauſe. It is eaſier finding then amending faults. If ever the like piece ſhould come to mine hand again, I ſhould take little delight to reade it, and leſſe pains to Anſwer it: It is a great ſign of weakneſs of Argument, where there is ſuch ſtrength of reproaches. Barking doggs are beſt appeaſed by neglect: the greateſt ſcoldes are ſooneſt quieted by ſilence. If by this unpleaſant difference, truth may be at all mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and thereby the Saints of God in any meaſure advantaged; I ſhall bleſs God in it, and eſteem it a moſt gracious Providence that I had any hand in it.</p>
