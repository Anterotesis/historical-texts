            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Therefore to conclude unleſs you do immediately lay aſide all by-reſpects and your own intereſts, and unanimouſly joyn and act for the ſecuring of the kingdome, and give a ſpeedy te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony thereof, by your walking in the parts of juſtice and righteouſneſs; unleſs you do immediately adminiſter juſtice and execute judgement impartially and endeavour to ſettle a firm and laſting peace, whereby the King may be with due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour inveſted, and the Kingdome in its juſt liberty ſecured; truely the Kingdome ſhall not onely have been by you already expoſed to many hazzards, (beſides the large expence of blood and treaſure) but ſhall for the future be neceſſitated, to curſe the time that ever they entruſted you; and be forced in juſtice to proſecute you as perſons which had power, but not wills to reſtore them to their ancient liberties, and that which might have been an honour to you and your poſterities in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons

(I fear miſerable.) you that were the glory of the Nations, the envy of your Foes, and the admiration of ſtrangers, are now become the amazement of your friends, the ſcorn of your enemies, and a by-word to all Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caſt but an eye upon your follies, and ſee into what a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Diviſion, nay, your Prlde hath brought you: you that exalted your ſelves almoſt above the heavens, are now fallen, if poſſible, lower than the earth; your towring pride is now buried in the duſt of Diviſion; you have been long time in travaile with joy, and now are delivered of ſorrow: <hi>I wiſh you could yet ſee in this your day the things that belong unto your Peace;</hi> What, hath the love of money, eaten up your love towards one another? hath your earneſt purſuite of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, forſt Religion to a ſquat; truely you have hunted fairly, you have ſtrove ſo much for Religion in the Church that it is to be feared you have loſt it in your hearts; theſe are the fruits of Diviſion, your Presbytery, and Independency, your outward formes and formall circumſtances; what, have you ſtrove ſo long for the ſhaddow that you have loſt the ſubſtance; have you forgot <hi>That it is neither Circumciſiou nor</hi>

               <p>Therefore dear Friends and fellow Citizens, I beſeech you lay your condition ro heart, examine the ground of your Diviſion, and you will finde it to be the pride of your hearts, your ſelf-conceitedneſs, &amp;c. and cloath your ſelves in ſelf-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency, let him that would be the greateſt be the leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, let him that would or thinks himſelf wiſe, be a fool for Chriſts ſake, learn to bear with one another, labour to ſee that you are members of one body, united unto one head, and love one another, and adminiſter unto the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities one of another, ſo ſhall your love encreaſe and your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions dye, but if you ſhall continue to widen the gap, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion will enter, and what will ye do in that day?</p>

               <p>ACtions are alwayes honourable that are compaſſed by juſt wayes, and aim at good ends, for wee ought not to do evill to produce good, neither ſhould there be publike pretences made uſe of to advantage or ſecure private intereſts, I hope the contrary now, but yet I fear the event; when the fabrick is larger then the foundation, there is great danger in the building; ſo when the undertaking is greater then the power of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114969:6"/>
truely 'tis to be feared there will be more hurt then good, more detriment then advantage acrue to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned therein.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, your undertakings and engagements thereupon I have ſeriouſly obſerved, and impartially ſcanned, I find the end good, but the manner and proſecution hitherto, hath not been ſo good as I could wiſh; and the temper, nay, neceſſity of the Kingdome doth require: you engaged, if I miſtake not, not to give over, nor look back untill you had to the utmoſt of your powers made proviſion (not onely for your ſelves, and own intereſts as Souldiers) but as Commoners; and with your ſelves, all the free Commons of England, that they and you together might be for the future protected and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from all violence and oppreſſion whatſoever, and in whomſoever and that there might be a due adminiſtration of juſtice and judgement, with righteouſneſs: Now give me leave to demand the cauſe of your retreat from the purſuance of this ſo honourable action? How comes it to paſſe, I hear ſo many private whiſpers among you; <hi>That you have nothing to do to meddle with any thing that concerns the Kingdome, but meerly what concerns your ſelves, and your own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actings:</hi> was it juſt or lawfull for you to enter into an ingagement, to perform that, which you now ſeem to diſ-own, as unlawfull: Surely, either there wanted a ſerious conſideration at firſt, or elſe intereſts hath abated your Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions at laſt; which if either, how diſhonourable it will be to your ſelves, how deſtructive to the Kingdome, <hi>be your own Judges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>the welfare of the people be the ſupream Law,</hi> as you have ſometimes granted, yea affirmed; <hi>Then whatſoever is contrary or ſtandeth in oppoſition to that, is deſtructive to that main end, and therefore not onely to be avoided at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but prevented for the future.</hi> But oppreſſion and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice particular intereſts, &amp;c. are direct in oppoſition to the welfare of the people <hi>and altogether destructive,</hi> therefore to be prevented and removed.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114969:7"/>
And certainly what cannot be repelled by policy, maybe by power, for if there be not a ſufficient means left for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the end, it is altogether vain and to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But to every end there is a ſufficient means, therefore if the welfare of the people cannot be ſecured by one means, it may by another, if not by policy, then by power according to the Parliaments ow<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> language to the King, <hi>The Kingdome muſt not be without a means to preſerve it ſelfe.</hi> And truely if the kingdome hath a means to preſerve it ſelf againſt the King, being then acting againſt the welfare of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; It hath a power likewiſe to ſecure it ſelf againſt the Parliament, and Army too, if they ſhall act, in the ſame way, and ſhall not proſecute the main end (to wit) the peoples welfare.</p>
               <p>How comes it to paſſe I beſeech you that there is ſuch ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings among you? one great man favours another, and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks his oppoſer; and let him be never ſo bad, ſo he will ſide inſecuring ſome great perſons particular intereſts in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer among you, he ſhall not only ſcape Scot-free, but be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced and protected among you: Little theeves are hangd and great ones let go. Is this to be ſingle hearted? will you that have taxed the King and Parliament of partiality, be partiall too? what a blemiſh will this be to all your former actions? That you ſhould now fawn upon thoſe for favour, who would have rejoyced to have ſeen both you and the kingdome weltring in flouds of blood and confuſion; and who, it is to be feared by your too great indulgence and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, are plotting your deſtruction.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you gentlemen conſider, you ſtand upon a ſandy place, which will, if not carefully looked to, devoure you, Lay aſide all intereſts and be what you have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be, let not your own honour or promotions be onely aimed at, but have ſole reſpect unto the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I have with ſorrow obſerved. That there are, I may ſay too many among you, too great in power, who are ſwaid by paſſion not reaſon, who ſpeak much againſt injuſtice in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114969:7"/>
others, but never knew what it was to be juſt them ſelves; men neither of diſcretion nor religion, what ere they may pretend, who do vehemently act for to gain applauſe and the favour of great men, and not for any love to the peace of the Kingdome: now it is very unlikely that ever ſuch a man can do (or at leaſt intends) a generall good, unleſs it may advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage his own intereſt. I beſeech you obſerve and beware of ſuch perſons, you may eaſily finde them; for ſuch perſons in your Councells will do you more hurt then all your other enemies, be not deluded by pretences though never ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; thoſe perſons that plead ſo much for delay, and argue ſo critically, intend no good to you, but carry on a dangerous deſign againſt you and the whole kingdome. And you may aſſure your ſelves the Adverſary, with whom you now run a conteſt, could never have gained ſo much time, nor brought you to ſuch an exigency, had they not been encouraged, nay, aſſiſted by ſome that have too much power and influence in your Councell.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the eyes of the Kingdome are upon you; and unleſs you anſwer their expectations and perform your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and engagements, and that ſpeedily; truly, you will ſtand at as great a diſtance in their affections as others have done before you; loſe not this opportunity, ſeek the peace of the Kingdome now, and ſeek your ſelves afterward, leſt while you contend ſo earneſtly for a ſhaddow, you loſe the ſubſtance, be for pure juſtice without reſpect of perſons, and let the kingdome ſee, That you will not favour or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour any perſon for ſiding with or againſt you, or for being of this or the other judgement. But that all perſons of each party ſhall receive from you equall reſpect, according to their merit. But if you ſhall appear partiall to ſome, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to others; if you ſhall do the works your ſelves, which you condemn in others: if you ſhall pretend to free us from one form of ſlavery to involve us in another, aſſure your ſelves, Diviſion and Confuſion will follow, and a worm will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114969:8"/>
riſe from your own bowels which will certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour you and conſume your former glory.</p>
