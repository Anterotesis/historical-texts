         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, upon the 11 of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1689. My L. <hi>Preston</hi> did make ſome
claim in the Houſe of Lords that he was a Peer of the Realm; the Houſe of
Lords demanding of him upon what he founded his pretence; he ſaid he claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Letters Patents from the late King <hi>James,</hi> which paſſed the Great Seal
before the time of the Vote of Abdication. The Lords required that thoſe
Letters Patents ſhould be produced, which being done, and my L. <hi>Preſton</hi>
inſiſting upon his claim to be a Peer of <hi>England,</hi> the Lords thought fit that
day to commit my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> to the cuſtody of the Black Rod. The next
day being the 12th of <hi>November,</hi> upon ſolemn debate of the validity of theſe
Letters Patents, and conſulting with the Judges then preſent, the Lords <hi>nemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
contradicente</hi> did adjudge and declare thoſe Letters Patents to be void and
null: And by another Order of the ſame date, they did order Mr. Attorney
General to proſecute my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> in the <hi>King's Bench</hi> for a High Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor
in preſuming to claim Peerage by thoſe Letters Patents. And by a
third it was ordered that the Letters Patents ſhould remain in Cuſtody of the
Clerk of the Parliament. Thus you ſee, my Lord, this matter hath had already
a ſolemn determination in a Court which had the moſt proper Conuſance and
Juriſdiction of Claims in this Nature. And they having pronounced their
Judgment, I did not think it would have been urged again in this place. I
thought it proper to mention theſe things to ſhew how it comes to paſs that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53228:5"/>
my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> has not his Letters Patents to produce, and to ſatisfy every
man that there is no hardſhip put upon my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> by Trying him here
when he ought to be Tried by another Judicature. The Lords have given Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt theſe Letters Patents, and have Ordered that they ſhall remain in
Cuſtody of the Clerk of Parliament, and my L. <hi>Preſton</hi> is not a ſtranger to
theſe tranſactions, and therefore if my Lords Council had been of opinion
he could have made any uſe of them, they would have inform'd him he muſt
have taken another courſe to have got them, and could not expect this Court
ſhould make an Order for him, contrary to the Order of the Houſe of Lords,
to take the Letters Patents out of the hands of the Clerk of the Parliament, and
this, to help him to a Plea againſt their own Juriſdiction. I omitted one thing
that upon the <hi>27th.</hi> of the ſame Month of <hi>November,</hi> upon my L. <hi>Preſtons</hi>
humble Submiſſion and Petition his Lordſhip was diſcharged of his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the Houſe of Lords were pleaſed to remit the Order given to
Mr. Attorney, for Proſecuting him in the King's Bench for the Miſdemeanour.
So that I cannot but wonder to hear of this Claim of Peerage after that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
But there is nothing offered to the Court by my Lord that the Court
can take any legal notice of. If my Lord will plead any thing to the Juriſdiction
of the Court, he ought to have his Plea in Form, and be ready with his Proofs
to make it good.</p>

notice of what you ſay, unleſs it were pleaded, and pleaded in a legal Form.
But if the matter be, as the Kings Counſel have repreſented it, that this Patent
you now pretend to have, hath already had its determination in a proper
place, this Court (which is an Inferiour Court to that of the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
cannot intermeddle with it. We cannot help you, nor can we ſet up
what was condemned there. So that you can entertain no hope or expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ſaw it, nor heard it read, nor can we take notice of it. But your Lordſhip is
to be Tryed by the ſame methods of Law, that all Perſons that have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you have always been, it has always been the courſe, that the Priſoner
ſhould not have a Copy of his Indictment, Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> had it not, and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Hen. Vane</hi> in the year 1662, he demanded a Copy of the
Indictment, and it was denyed him, and it has been conſtantly denyed ever ſince
in all ſuch Caſes.</p>

I have heard a great many. Does any one of them tell you that this has
been done? If ever an one of them will come and ſhew us when it haseen done,
you ſay ſomething, but I dare ſay none of them will or can. Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> there,

ſuch a Statute, and it will be produced before your Lordſhips. If your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips

the Indictment is a Record<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Record of great conſequence to me

Caſe may be as to any other hereafter, or what the general conſequence may be

                        <p>My Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> for this thing that you now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in all Ages in all our Books, it is the ſame thing, and has been in all Mens
Caſes that have been for their Lives, denied; and this Statute that you bring
is quite of another intent: For it is ſaid, the Records ſhall remain in Court
for perpetual Evidence, and the Aiding of all Perſons to whom they ſhall
belong. My Lord, this is none of your Caſe; for God knows, you expect
no Aid from this Indictment: But this is meant of all Copies that concern
the Eſtates of Men, that they may have recourſe to their Records to make out
their Evidences to their Eſtates, or to have them Exemplified under the Seal
of the Court for Evidence: But to have a Copy of an Indictment, thereby
to be enabled to conſult with Counſel, how to make Exceptions to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
is a thing that has been denied in all Ages by all the Judges that
ever were. If any one can ſay the contrary, it were ſomething; but ſhall
we now admit Counſel to debate a thing that has been in all Ages denied, and
never admitted ſo much as once? That cannot be expected from us.</p>

Records are to be: If it be for the Aid of any Perſon, it ought to be granted,
and I may be aided by this Record, if I have a Copy of it; and I think it is
hard, when I am ſo much concerned in this Record, that I cannot be helpt
to it by this Law.</p>

this day Seven night at Night we had Notice we were to be Tryed as this day,
but 3 days of the 7 we had not the Liberty of ſeeing any Friend or Counſel,
or any Body, not till Tueſday Night, and that we got with great Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and great Charge to get an Order for our Counſel to come to us, ſo that

                        <p>We ſee the Nature of the Thing, and I am ſorry that I
muſt ſay it is fit that we ſhould take notice of it, perhaps the thing that you
are accuſed of is not true; but if it be true, you ſee what it is, that there are
Letters and Papers preparing for a Deſign to ſet all the Kingdom in Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
Men that will venture upon ſuch ſort of Things are not to Condemn the
Law if it be a little hard upon them, for 'tis the common preſervation that is
principally aimed at in Proſecutions of this Nature; and if this Accuſation
be true. 'tis but Juſt and Reaſonable, that all ſpeed ſhould be uſed to enquire
into and prevent it, and as it falls out in this Caſe, it is not in our Power to
do it. This Seſſions is ſet before this Buſineſs is known, and this is an Act
done in this County, and therefore the Seſſions is the proper place for the
Tryal, and ſo you have the ſame ſort of Proceedings that all other Criminals
have, which are very many, though I hope not many of ſo high a Nature,
7 days Notice you have had you acknowledge; if my Lords pleaſe we will
Indulge you as far as we can, and give you time for your Tryal till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,

<hi>Preſton</hi> has offered, as to the Buſineſs of the Act of Parliament, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
have been pleaſed to over-Rule that Plea; But, My Lord, I am told,
That if an Indictment be faulty, but even in a Letter, we cannot be found
Guilty upon that Indictment. Now, if we never have a Copy of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
how ſhall we know whether there be any ſuch Fault in it; Your
Lordſhips, who are our Counſel, I ſuppoſe have never ſeen the Indictment,
and ſuppoſe there be Twenty Faults, we have not the advantage of them,
by not having a Copy, and how ſhall we come to have any Advantage, if
neither your Lordſhips, who are our Counſel, nor we our Selves can ſee
them. It may turn upon that.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, this Term is always a ſhort Term, and if I be Tryed

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                        <p>My Lord, there has been all the care taken that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Thing was capable off, to prevent any complaint of this kind,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53228:9"/>
Order was given, that my Lord and theſe Gentlemen ſhould have notice as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as was poſſible. As ſoon as ever Mr. Attorney General had had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of looking into the Evidence, notice was given them, that they ſhould
be Tryed, and that this was the day appointed for their Tryal. But there
ſhall be no contending in a Matter of this Nature, for a day. If it be deſired,
and the Court pleaſe to put it off till morrow, we are contented, but there
can be no reaſon to put it off for a longer time. As there is always a
tenderneſs to be uſed, and I know will be, and as far as I am concerned,
always ſhall be towards Perſons in theſe Circumſtances, ſo there is a regard to
be had towards the Government and the Publick. I am ſure if the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is againſt theſe Gentlemen is true, the Government is highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
that this Matter ſhould come to a ſpeedy Examination, and that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that enter into ſuch Deſigns be brought to Judgment: The Charge in
the Indictment is of ſuch a Nature as draws very great Conſequences along
with it, it concerns no leſs then the Life of the King and Queen, the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Fleet of the Kingdom, and the Invaſion of the Realm by the
Forces of a Declared Enemy. Theſe are the things that the Priſoners are
charged with, and certainly there ought to be no delay in the ſearching into
ſuch Matters as theſe. They have had a Weeks notice of Tryal already, and
for many days of that week at leaſt they have had as many Councel to aſſiſt
them as they deſired, and all the Sollicitors that they had a mind to, have had
free acceſs to them, ſo that they have wanted no opportunity to prepare for
their Tryal that Men in their Circumſtances could have. As to what has been
ſaid with relation to the Jury, the Law indulges them in the Number of their
peremptory Challenges without being put to ſhew Cauſe, and the Court hath
granted them at the very inſtant of their Pleading a Copy of the Pannel, and
there is a reaſonable time between this and to morrow for their making ſuch
Enquiry into the Jury as is juſtifiable and fit to be made. But if by time to
look into the Jury, it be meant, that there may be a time for tampering, that
I am ſure your tenderneſs of the Government will not permit, you will take
care as much that no ſuch thing be done, as you will, that they ſhould not be
ſurprized. If your Lordſhips are pleaſed, that the Tryal be put off till to
morrow, we will be ready to morrow to attend it.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, 'tis a very hard preſumption that Mr. Sollicitor

with the Jury.</p>

But I know not what your Lordſhip means by expreſſing ſuch reſentment, that

no pretence for them to put off this Tryal any longer, for there can be no

which was no day for Buſineſs, and we could not have our Order. On
Monday we could not have it till night; ſo that it was Tueſday before we
could get any Body to us. My Lord it is a Weighty concern, and all ſuch
haſty Proceedings were thought very hard in the late Times, and particularly
the denying Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> time, and 'tis one of the Reaſons given in this Kings
Declaration for his coming here into <hi>England,</hi> the hardſhips that the Law
laid upon Men in their Tryals, which he came to prevent.</p>

                        <p>The hardſhip that was upon Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> was, that he
was taken upon the Tueſday off from the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and tryed before that day
ſevenight, and that was hard indeed; but beſides, he was taken about his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
off from the <hi>Exchange,</hi> I know not whether you were about your Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
your Lawful Buſineſs, when you were taken, God of Heaven knows
that. And pray conſider here is a matter of very great conſequence on the
one ſide and on the other: For if Men be Plotting againſt the Government, to
give them time to carry on their Plots will be miſchievous on that ſide.</p>

I did humbly offer yeſterday, and that is, that my warning was ſo ſhort,
that I am not prepared for my Tryal. We had not above three or four days
wherein we might conſult about it, all the former time we have been kept

time to look into the Pannel of our Jury. The Pannel we had not till yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,

                        <p>My Lord, this is that which you inſiſted upon yeſterday.
Your Lordſhip then ſaid you wanted your Witneſſes, and your Lordſhip
did not then mention what Witneſſes you wanted, nor was any Oath made
of any one that you wanted; and therefore the Court over-rul'd you, and
wiſhed you to prepare for your Tryal, and would not put it off: For if it
ſhould not be to Day, but ſhould be put off till another time, it muſt be the
putting of it off till another Seſſions; for we are ſtreightened with it in point
of time, for the Seſſion can laſt no longer then <hi>Munday,</hi> and you have had
convenient Notice.</p>

                        <p>Truly, my Lord, I think it is hard when my Life and Fortune,
and all are concerned, that I ſhould be hurried on to a Tryal, only becauſe
the Court is ſtreightened in point of time; and yet that is the only Reaſon
that I can perceive, why ſuch haſte is made. I deſire a little more time to
prepare my ſelf; and I think it very hard I ſhould be denied; I muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

Defence as I would.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, I would humbly offer your Lordſhip one thing
before the Jury be called and ſworn. By the Law, theſe Gentlemen at the
Bar have the Privilege to challenge peremptorily to the Number of 35; which
is ſo great a Number, that if each of them ſeverally take advantage of it,
(as they may do by Law, and God forbid they ſhould be denied any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the Law gives them) it will be next to impoſſibile to have a ſufficient
Number of Jurors appear ſo as that we may proceed in the Tryal.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, all that I would know of them is, Whether they
intend to take the Advantage that the Law gives them, of ſingle and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Challenges; for then they muſt be tryed ſeverally: Or whether they
will be content that the ſame Perſons that are challenged by any one, ſhall
ſtand challenged for all three. I leave it to them to take their own choice;
let them do what they pleaſe in it.</p>

                        <p>My Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> tells you what the Law is,
that every one of you may challenge Five and thirty without Cauſe; and if
the Court ſhould proceed to try you all together, and every one of you ſhould
challenge Five and thirty, perhaps a ſufficient Number will be wanting to try
you, the Number challenged will then amount to 105 in all. If ſo be you
agree in your Challenges, that what one challenges ſhall be challenged by
the other two, then the Court will go on, and try you all together, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they will be forced to ſever you; therefore he deſires to know, whether
you will joyn or ſever in your Challenges.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, Cauſe is not to be ſhewn by the Kings Counſel
till all the Panel be gone through; and then, if there be not Twelve left to
try, then they are bound to ſhew Cauſe; that is the Law.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, it is a thing of a very tender concern to me; I
deſire to know, If it be not uſual that they ſhould aſſign the Cauſe, when
they Challenge any for the King: For if it be not according to Law, it
may be a prejudice to me; and I deſire I may have Counſel heard to that
Point.</p>

Tthere is not any more clear Caſe in all our Law, than that: If your
Lordſhip pleaſe, you ſhall have a Book to read, that the King is not bound

                        <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,
This is an Indictment of High Treaſon againſt my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> who is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by the Name of Sir <hi>Richard Grahme</hi> Baronet, and ſtands now Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
before you at the Bar; and the Indictment ſets forth, that the Priſoner,
together with one <hi>John Aſhton,</hi> and one <hi>Edmund Elliot,</hi> as falſe Traitors
againſt our Soveraign Lord and Lady King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> not
weighing the Duty of their Allegiance, the 29th of <hi>December,</hi> in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
year of their now Majeſties Reign, at the Pariſh of <hi>St. Clements Danes,</hi>
in this County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> did Conſpire, Conſult and Imagine to Depoſe
Their Majeſties from the Throne and Government of theſe Kingdoms, and
to bring the King and Queen to final Death and Deſtruction, and to Levy
War within this Kingdom, and procure an Invaſion to be made here; and
that to bring their Treaſons to paſs, they did prepare and compoſe, and
cauſe to be prepared and compoſed divers Treaſonable Letters, Notes, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandums,
and Inſtructions in Writings, which were to inform the French
King and his Subjects, and other Enemies of the King and Queen, of the
Number, Force and Condition of Their Majeſties Ships, and how ſome of
them were Mann'd, and the Names of ſeveral of the Commanders of them,
and how the Caſtles and Forts of <hi>Portſmouth, South-Sea</hi> and <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

this Kingdom were fortified, and how they might be Seized and Surprized
by the King's Enemies; as alſo to inform them of the time, places, ways
and means how they might Invade the Kingdom, Depoſe Their Majeſties,
and Fight with their Ships againſt Their Majeſties Ships, and cauſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
great Forces to be raiſed againſt the King and Queen, and fend Ships to
plague the City of <hi>London,</hi> and War and Rebellion within the Kingdom to
procure; and that they did knowingly and ſecretly prepare and conceal two
ſeveral Bills of Exchange for the payment of Money to the King's Enemies,
and got theſe Bills of Exchange, Letters, Notes and Memorandums into
their Cuſtody; and afterwards, the 30th day of <hi>December,</hi> for the Sum of One
hundred pounds, by them, or ſome of them paid, they did hire a Ship to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them and the ſaid Bills of Exchange, Letters, Notes, Memorandums, and
Inſtructions, into parts beyond the Seas, to, and among their Majeſties Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and did alſo prepare a Boat, which was to carry them to the Ship,
<pb facs="tcp:53228:15"/>
and accordingly they went into the Boat, and went on Board the Ship with
the Bills of Exchange, and Papers aforeſaid; and being on Board, they ſet
Sail, and made away towards <hi>France</hi> with thoſe Bills of Exchange and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
with intention to diſperſe them, and to perfect their ſaid Treaſons.
And the Indictment further ſets forth, that there was, and is a War between
Our King and Queen, and the French King, and the People of thoſe parts,
under his Dominions, who are Enemies of the King and Queen; the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
together with thoſe other two named before, as falſe Traitors, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the Enemies of the King and Queen, and to bring about this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
they did procure ſuch Bills of Exchange, Letters, Notes, Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dums
and Inſtructions, and did hire ſuch Ship and Boat to carry them and
thoſe Papers into <hi>France,</hi> and did go on board the ſaid Ship, and Sailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
for <hi>France,</hi> with intention to aid and aſſiſt the King's Enemies in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
and Intelligence, by thoſe Papers and Bills of Exchange, as I before open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto you, and this is laid to be againſt the Duty of his Allegiance, againſt
the Peace of Their Majeſties, Their Crown and Dignity, and againſt the
Form of the Statute in that Caſe made and provided. To this Indictment,
Gentlemen, the Priſoner Pleaded he is Not Guilty, and for his Tryal hath put
himſelf upon his Country, which you are; if we prove him Guilty, it is
your Duty to find him ſo.</p>

                        <p>My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury, the Indictment hath
been opened to you at large, and I do not doubt but you have obſerved it: It
conſiſts of two Parts, which are formed upon two ſeveral Branches of the
Statute of the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> 3. the one is for compaſſing and imagining the
Depoſing and Deſtruction of the King and Queen; the other, aiding and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
the King and Queens Enemies.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Treaſon, Gentlemen, conſiſts in the imagination of the Heart, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that imagination of the Heart can be diſcovered no other way but by
ſome open Act; therefore the Law doth require, that ſome Overt Act, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting
that Intention and Imagination, be aſſigned and proved. I doubt
not but you have obſerved that there are ſeveral Overt-Acts of both theſe
kinds of Treaſon, aſſigned in this Indictment.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, the general Deſign of the Conſpiracy (as will appear by
the Evidence) was this: The King and Queen were to be Depoſed, and this
was to be effected by a French Army and a French Fleet.</p>
                     <p>It will be eaſily Granted, that nothing more dreadful can enter into the
Imagination of an Engliſh-man, than the deſtruction of our Fleet, and
the Conqueſt of the Kingdom by the Arms of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet it will be part of the Evidence that we ſhall offer to you, that the
Priſoners, and others of the Conſpirators ſeem to be of another Mind, for
amongſt the Papers which were taken with the Priſoners, you will ſee one,
which is ſtyled, <hi>The Reſult of a Conference,</hi> wherein they pretend to ſhew
the poſſibility of Reſtoring King <hi>James</hi> by the Power of the French King,
and yet to preſerve the Proteſtant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of
the Kingdom. They themſelves went no farther than to think it poſſible,
and I believe it will be hard to perſwade any other Engliſh-man, that it is
poſſible, unleſs one Inſtance could be given, that the French King ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
his Arms for ſetting up any Body but himſelf, his own Religion, and
his own Government. I never heard that he did pretend to Form any part of
his Glories upon the virtue of Moderation, or Self-denial. And there can
<pb facs="tcp:53228:15"/>
hardly be imagined a greater Inſtance of Self-denial, than for the French
King, after he had deſtroyed the Dutch and Engliſh Fleets, and ſubdu'd our
Forces at Land, not to make uſe of his Succeſs, ſo as to add theſe Three
Kingdoms to his Conqueſts, and poſſeſs himſelf of the unconteſted Dominion
of the Sea for ever, but only to Intitle him at ſo great hazard and Expence,
to become a Mediator between King <hi>James</hi> and the People of <hi>England,</hi> and
by his Mediation, to eſtabliſh the Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberties of
the People; And yet as abſurd as this ſeems, you will find this to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of one of their Conferences. I did never think it was the part of any
who were of Counſel for the King in caſes of this Nature, to endeavour to
aggravate the Crime of the Priſoners, by going about to put falſe Colours
upon Evidence, or to give it more than its due weight; and therefore I
ſhall be ſure to forbear any thing of that Nature. But I think it my Duty, to
give you ſome Account of the Nature and Courſe of the Evidence to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to you, which conſiſting of ſeveral ſorts, it will be in ſome ſort ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to open it, that you may the more clearly apprehend it, and with
more eaſe make your Obſervations upon it.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, we ſhall produce in Evidence, as well living Witneſſes, as
Papers and Writings, which by a ſtrange kind of Providence were taken
upon my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> and the other two Perſons named in the Indictment
when they were Apprehended; and therein this Deſign that I have open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to you, will be made Evident beyond all contradiction.</p>
                     <p>As to the living Witneſſes, the courſe of the Evidence will be this.
One <hi>Nicholas Pratt,</hi> is the Owner of a Smack, called the <hi>Thomas and Elizabeth,</hi>
he does uſually entruſt his Wife <hi>Jane Pratt</hi> with the Hiring out of this
Smack; <hi>William Paceley</hi> is Maſter of the Veſſel, and has of late been made
a Part-owner, to protect him from being Preſs'd; for it is a Priviledge that
that the Owners of Veſſels claim, not to be Preſs'd.</p>
                     <p>Some time ſince, (the Witneſſes will tell you the preciſe time) this
<hi>Jane Pratt</hi> was ſent for to one Mr. <hi>Burdett</hi>'s Houſe in the City, where ſhe
met with Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> who deſired to know, whether ſhe could undertake
to Convey him and ſome others, with ſafety into <hi>France.</hi> She ſaid, ſhe
did not doubt but ſhe could do ſo; and thereupon Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> told her, That
he and his Friends were Merchants and Traders, and that they ſhould make
great advantage, to the value of a Thouſand pounds at leaſt, if they could
be there quickly; their Diſcourſe went no farther at that time, but Mrs.
<hi>Pratt</hi> was appointed by Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> to bring the Maſter of the Veſſel along
with her, for he had a mind to Diſcourſe himſelf with the Maſter, and they
were to meet at the <hi>Wonder Tavern</hi> in <hi>Ludgate</hi>-ſtreet; and becauſe there
ſhould be no miſtake about the Meeting, Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> gave the Woman a Note
of Direction in Writing, ready to be produced.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly by the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Pratt</hi> and the Maſter came to
the <hi>Wonder Tavern,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> met them, and there they Treated
of the Price to be given for the Hiring of this Veſſel to carry them to <hi>France,</hi>
and I think 150 Guineas was the Sum then inſiſted upon, but no Bargain
was made at that time, but there was a new Appointment to meet the
next day, which was the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Burdett</hi>'s Houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:53228:16"/>
The next day when ſhe and the Maſter came thither, they found there
together <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Ellyot,</hi> the two other Perſons named in the Indictment,
and there this Matter was treated of with great ſecreſie in Mrs. <hi>Burdet</hi>'s
Bed-Chamber.</p>
                     <p>And they came to an Agreement, that 100 <hi>l.</hi> ſhould be the Sum to be paid
to Mrs. <hi>Pratt</hi> for conveying into <hi>France Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Ellyot,</hi> and two other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
So the Contract was Originally made for others beſides Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>
and <hi>Ellyot,</hi> and the Money was actually depoſited by Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Ellyot</hi>
in Mrs. <hi>Burdet</hi>'s Hand, and a Six-pence was broken, one half of which
was delivered to Mrs. <hi>Burdet</hi> to keep, the other half Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was to take
along with him, and when the Maſter had ſafely landed them in <hi>France,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Aſhton</hi> was to deliver his half of the Six-pence to the Maſter; which being
brought to Mrs. <hi>Burdet</hi> either by him or Mrs. <hi>Prat,</hi> upon the joining of the
two pieces together, the Maſter was entitled to receive the Hundred Pounds.</p>
                     <p>The next Appointment was to meet at one Mr. <hi>Rigby</hi>'s. Houſe in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi>
and that was to be on the One and thirtieth of <hi>December,</hi> when
the Voyage was to be begun: And the Tide not ſerving to go through-Bridge
till late, the appointment was to meet the later. When they, Mrs.
<hi>Prat,</hi> and the Maſter came there, they found only Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ellyot,</hi>
but before that time care was taken to provide a Sculler at <hi>Surrey</hi>-Stairs to
be ready to carry them on board the Smack, and the Waterman was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to ſtay in a little Ale-Houſe thereabouts to be ready when he ſhould
be called.</p>
                     <p>About Ten a Clock at Night four Perſons came down together, and
went into this Scullen with the Maſter of the Smack, and made what haſte
they could through-Bridge till they came to <hi>Pickle-herring</hi> Stairs over-againſt
the <hi>Tower,</hi> where the Smack lay, and there went aboard the Maſter and
theſe four Perſons, my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> a Servant of my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s, Mr.
<hi>Aſhton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ellyot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Smack ſet ſail immediately after they were on Board, and their haſte
made them carry away the Watermans Coat which he had lent them whilſt
they were in the Sculler, and that accident was the occaſion of diſcovering
who the Waterman was that carried them from <hi>Surrey</hi>-Stairs.</p>
                     <p>After they were on Board the Smack, they were poſſeſſed with great
fear of being ſurpriſed, they knew the nature of the Buſineſs they were about,
and the danger they were in if they ſhould be diſcovered, and therefore
when they were to paſs by the <hi>George</hi> Frigat, a Man of War that lay in the
River, they deſired the Maſter to hide them, which he did by putting them
under the Quarter-Hatches, a place where they could not ſtand or ſit, but
muſt lie along on the Ballaſt. When they were paſſed by the <hi>George</hi> Frigat,
they quitted that place, but when they were near the Block-Houſe at <hi>Graves,</hi>
they grew apprehenſive, and they deſired to be hid a ſecond time, which
was accordingly done.</p>
                     <p>And they continued to lie in that place till they were taken, and it was
a happy thing they did ſo, the place was ſuch that they had not any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of throwing away their Letters and Papers, though they had made
preparation for it in caſe of any Accident, having tied them together, and
fix'd a piece of Lead to them, that ſo if they ſaw themſelves in danger of
being taken, they might eaſily ſink the Pacquet; But being ſo cloſe ſhut
up in this place, that they could not execute their purpoſe, the Papers were
taken, and will be offered to you in Evidence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53228:16"/>
Gentlemen, Captain <hi>Billop</hi> by the Order of a Noble Lord now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
was directed to uſe his utmoſt diligence to ſeize ſome dangerous
Perſons, of whoſe Deſign of going beyond Sea for ſome very ill
Ends, an Intimation had been given. He got ready a Pinnace well
Mann'd, and went in purſuit of them down the River, and both as
he went and return'd, he took care to ſearch ſuſpected Veſſels; when
he came to this, he demanded of the Maſter what Number of Men
he had on Board, pretending he came to Preſs Men; the Maſter told
him he had but three, and for thoſe he had a Protection. But the
Captain ſaid he muſt be better ſatisfied, and muſt ſearch the Veſſel,
and in the ſearch he found theſe four Perſons lying concealed in this
ſecret place, under the Quarter-Hatches.</p>
                     <p>As they were taken out one after another, one of the Seamen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> to take up a Bundle of Papers from off the Ballaſt,
and put it in his Boſom, and near the place where Papers lay, he
took up two Seals, which after proved to be my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Seals
when he was Secretary. Captain <hi>Billop</hi> being inform'd of this by
that Seaman, he put his Hand into Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>'s Boſom, and took
away from him the Bundle of Papers with the Lead fix'd to it.</p>
                     <p>When they were put on Board the Captain's Pinnace, they all
preſſed him much, that he would let them go on ſhore at <hi>Graveſend,</hi>
pretending want of Refreſhment, they not having eaten, and the
Night having been cold, but he did not think that proper, nor ſafe,
but told them, they ſhould go on Board the <hi>George</hi> Frigat, and refreſh
themſelves there.</p>
                     <p>When they came on Board the <hi>George</hi> Frigat all the three Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> in particular, were very earneſt with
Captain <hi>Billop</hi> to diſpoſe of the Bundle of Papers, mixing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Promiſes, with great Complements.</p>
                     <p>Not prevailing there, when they were return'd to the Pinnace,
they renew'd their Sollicitations, and one of them told him, it
would be eaſie to remove all Suſpicion by fixing the Lead to ſome
other Papers of little ſignifications, which were found in my Lord
<hi>Preſton</hi>'s Pocket, which he might produce, and they would without
difficulty paſs for the Papers that were taken.</p>
                     <p>But the Captain was too Juſt to comply with this Propoſal. When
they found he was not to be moved, you will find from the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
that their Promiſes were turned into Threats, and they uſed
another ſort of Language.</p>
                     <p>When they were brought to <hi>Whitehall</hi> Stairs, upon their Landing
they gave Money to the Maſter and the Seamen, deſiring them to
ſay, they were hired to go for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and not for <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, theſe things which I have opened carry a ſtrong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of Guilt, for <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> eſpecially one of that Quality of
my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> to go into the Country of an Enemy without any
manner of Paſsport, and in ſuch a manner as they could not expect
but to be ſeized for Spies, unleſs they were aſſured, that their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
was ſo well known there, that they ſhould be look'd upon not
as Perſons coming to get Intelligence, but to give it, unleſs they
were well aſſured of a good Reception, when they came there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53228:17"/>
But there is no occaſion to leave any thing to Conjecture in this
Caſe, what is contained in theſe Papers makes the Deſign of the
Voyage beyond diſpute. I think, Gentlemen, after you have heard
the Evidence, you will be very well ſatisfied, that my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>
and the other two who ſtand Indicted, were equally concerned in
the Papers; they were all alike earneſt to preſerve them from being
ſeen, they all ſollicited for the diſpoſing of them, and promiſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
if they might prevail.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, theſe Papers are of various Natures.</p>
                     <p>One I mentioned before, is Entituled, <hi>The Reſult of a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between ſeveral Lords and Gentlemen, both Tories and Whigs,</hi>
in which it was undertaken to prove the Poſſibility and Methods of
Reſtoring King <hi>James</hi> by a French Power, without endangering
the Proteſtant Religion, and the Civil Adminiſtration according to
the Laws of this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Another contains Heads for a Declaration to be prepared, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to be publiſhed when the French have had Succeſs at Sea, and
are Landing, and that is filled with ſuch Pretences as they thought
moſt Specious, and moſt likely to amuſe and delude the People.</p>
                     <p>There is another ſort of theſe Papers which conſiſts of Letters.
Theſe Letters are directed in Falſe Names, and are not ſubſcribed, and
it is not to be imagin'd it ſhould be otherwiſe. Yet, Gentlemen,
(though that is not the preſent Buſineſs) the Hands of the Writers
of theſe Letters are very well known, and the Subject Matter of
them will eaſily reveal to you for whom they were intended, for
though theſe Letters are moſt of them Written under divers Cants,
ſome under the Colour of Trade, ſome of them under the Colour
of a Law-Suit for the Redeeming of a Mortgage, others under the
Notion of a Match, and a Settlement to be made upon that Match,
yet the real Buſineſs is ſo plain, that you need but hear them read to
ſee through the Diſguiſe.</p>
                     <p>Though they begin generally in the Style of Merchants Writing
to one another, or the like, yet towards the end of the Letters you
will obſerve Expreſſions of Duty and Reverence (terms which do
not uſually paſs in a Correſpondence between Perſons of that ſort)
ſufficient to ſhew, that ſomewhat elſe was intended to be covered in
what went before.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, It will appear to you, that ſome of the Writers of
theſe Letters were of the Number of thoſe who were ſecured the
laſt Summer when the French Fleet was upon our Coaſts, and you
will obſerve they complain, that by reaſon of that Reſtraint, the
Deſign was very much hindred, though they have endeavoured to
redeem that loſs of time ſince their Diſcharge, and have carried on
the Buſineſs with more vigor than ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:53228:17"/>
In ſhort, The deſign of theſe Letters is to importune the ſetting out of
the <hi>French</hi> Fleet with all poſſible Expedition: They ſay they muſt not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſuch a fit Seaſon to be ſpent unprofitably; That the beſt time is between
this and the firſt of <hi>March</hi> to come to a good Market; and if they come
not before the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> all will be loſt. In another of their Letters
they ſay, If the Suit be well ſollicited and managed, it may come to a final
hearing before the end of <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term.</p>
                     <p>They complain that there are ſeveral indiſcreet Letters came from St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi>
that turn to the prejudice of the Deſign. Thoſe Letters are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
diſguis'd to deceive the People here, but ſpeak too plainly what is to
be expected from themſelves, and from the <hi>French.</hi> You will take notice,
that the Letters which you will hear, are all Bills with high Characters of
the Bearer: for which reaſon they write in ſuch general Terms, becauſe the
Bearer was intruſted with the whole. Some of the Letters ſay, no Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are or need be expreſſed, becauſe he will inform them of every thing.
Others, That they could not write ſo much as he could ſay; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was wanting but to allow him a full and a fit Seaſon to give an Account
of all the Buſineſs; and that they intirely depend upon his Account of them
and their Condition.</p>
                     <p>And, Gentlemen, in one of the Letters the Bearer is ſtyled a Lord; and
to whom can that be applied, unleſs to the Priſoner at the Bar.</p>
                     <p>In another Letter, when they ſpeak of ſending the Copper and the Linen
(the Goods pretended for carrying on the Trade) it is added, And what the
meaning of that is, they muſt refer to the Bearer, who was able to give them
a particular Account.</p>
                     <p>I have mentioned ſo much of the Papers, only that you might have a
general Notion of them; that ſo when you hear them read, you may more
readily make your Obſervations. I aſſure you I have been as careful as I
could, not to exceed the Truth in opening any part of the Evidence. But
it is your part to ſee whether what I have opened be made out in
Proof.</p>
                     <p>There is another Paper that gives an Account of their Majeſties Fleet to
be ſent out this Summer; and there is an Obſervation at the end of it, that
it was hoped it may be out in <hi>March.</hi> But you will find by other Papers
(and particularly by one of my Lords own Hand-writing) that he was of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mind, that the Fleet will not be out before <hi>June.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, the laſt ſort of Papers which I will mention to you, are ſome
<hi>Memorandums</hi> and Notes, written by my Lord <hi>Preſton;</hi> wherein he gives an
Account of ſeveral. Things of great moment; which as his memory ſerved
him, are put together without connexion or method, being only to remind
him of them when he ſhould have occaſion to mention them.</p>
                     <p>He therein gives an Account of the Number and Strength of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, how they are manned, and who are the Principal Officers and
Commanders, and in what time they will be out.</p>
                     <p>He likewiſe gives an Account of the Number and State of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fleet, and how that is to be divided and diſpoſed of.</p>
                     <p>And with relation to the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, there is a particular <hi>Memorandum,</hi>
That they muſt be out at fartheſt in <hi>April;</hi> That they muſt be out ſo as to
ſeparate the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet and ours; That they muſt be ſure to look in at <hi>Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>
as they come by, and ſecure what Ships ſhould be in that Harbour from
joyning the reſt.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a hint given of thoſe that were moſt likely to come in to them.
And there is Advice in what place their Fleet ſhould fight ours. They muſt
not come ſo high as <hi>Beachy,</hi> where they fought the laſt year, but rather chuſe
to fight in the Chops of the Channel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53228:18"/>
There is an Account of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> how fortified and garriſon'd, that it
had but 500 men; that <hi>Goſport</hi> had nothing but Palliſadoes about it; and
<hi>Southſea</hi> Caſtle very weak.</p>
                     <p>There are Memorandums of other Heads proper for a Declaration.</p>
                     <p>There are the Names of ſeveral Perſons, ſome of them with particular

                        <p>The Smack was hired of the Woman, and not of me; and
when I came up to <hi>London</hi> ſhe told me ſhe had got a Voyage over to
<hi>France,</hi> if I was minded to go; I ſaid, Yes: and ſhe appointed me to go
along with her to this Miſtris what do ye call um's Houſe, this Mrs. <hi>Burdet,</hi>
and when we came to this Houſe there was no body within but Mr. <hi>Aſhton:</hi>
preſently after came in Mr. <hi>Ellyot;</hi> after they came in they told us the
things were not ready yet, but they would be ready preſently to carry on
Board; when theſe things were ready, <hi>John Fiſher</hi> carried the Trunck down,
and the Porter carried the Hamper, and I went with them along to <hi>Billings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>
and carried them on Board; and when I carried them on Board I went
to <hi>Billingſgate</hi> again, and ſo we went along to this Mr. <hi>Burdet</hi>'s Houſe;
and ſo when we came up to <hi>Burdet</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Ellyot</hi> were not there
preſent, but we had been there but a little time e'er they came in, and
then they came and ſaid to my Owner and me, You ſhall ſee the Money
told; it was all in Gold but one Six-pence; there was Ninety three Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea's:
And, after the Money was told, there was a Six pence that was
broken in half, and the Guinea's he roulled up in a Paper, and gave them
to Mrs. <hi>Burdet,</hi> and bid her lay them up; and he gave her one half of the
Six-pence, and kept the other half himſelf; and when I brought that other
half that he had, or my Owner, then ſhe was to give the Money to her
or me.</p>

ſate down; and ſo in came two Gentlemen more, but what they were, or

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53228:19"/>
after this <hi>Ellyot</hi> and <hi>Aſhton</hi> came out of the Houſe and called me to go with them,
and after we were gone out Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> leaves <hi>Ellyot</hi> and went away from him,
and <hi>Ellyot</hi> bid me go along with him, ſays, come Maſter, come along with me;
he did not name any place whether they were to go, but it happened to be
<hi>Surry-ſtairs,</hi> and going down, he calls in at the corner Houſe, which is an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
for the Water-man, and bid me go before to the Water-ſide; and when

down through Bridge, and going through Bridge we came on Board the Veſſel,
riding juſt againſt the <hi>Tower</hi> almoſt, and we went all on Board; and when we
came on Board, my men were all aſleep, and being aſleep, I called them out of the
Cabin to hale up the Anchor; and there being very little Wind ſtirring, we could
not go very far, but came juſt below the half-way Tree, and then we ſtopt, and
I ordered to drop the Anchor for fear of the Veſſels in the River: and the next
morning about Eight a Clock we weighed our Anchor again, and went on till
we came near to the <hi>George</hi> man of War, and there they all of them hid.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Betſworth.</speaker>
                        <p>I was going over the Water from <hi>Surry</hi> Stairs about Seven or
Eight a Clock, and a Gentleman at the Stairs call'd Sculler, and ask'd me if I
would carry him down the River; ſaid I, how far, ſays he to the Tower; ſaid I
'tis againſt Tide, and I can't carry you down ſo low; he ſaid he would ſtay till
the Tide turn'd; ſaid I, if I be out of my Bed ſo long, I deſerve to be well
paid for it; If you will give me Half a Crown I'll carry you down; ſays he
I'll give it you; ſo then I came a-Shore, and he ask'd me what my Name was,
I told him <hi>Charles Betſworth;</hi> ſays he, will you be ſure to ſtay for us; Yes,
ſaid I, if you will be ſure to come: If I be not at the Stairs, I'll be at that Ale-houſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53228:20"/>
there in the Corner; ſo I ſtaid, and: carried over a Fare or two over the
Water; and about a Eleven a Clock, as I was ſitting in the Houſe, a Gentleman
comes, and calls <hi>Charles,</hi> and ſo out I went to my Boat, and took them in. There
was one man, as I ſuppoſe, in the Stern, and he that called me out followed me
down, and by and by came three more into my Boat; one of them had a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Cloak on, and the other a gray looſe Coat, and a red Bag, of the quantity of
a Peck; and ſo we put off, and rowed away; and juſt under the Temple Wall,
which was all the Words I heard from them, that I can remember; ſays one
Gentleman, When do your hear the King goes away? and another made anſwer
and ſaid, a <hi>Tueſday:</hi> So we rowed down through Bridge; and when we were
through Bridge, they asked where the Veſſel lay; and he that was in the Stern
ſaid, it was <hi>Southwark</hi> ſide, over againſt the Tower, and bid me row over thither.
And when we came juſt below <hi>Battle-Bridge,</hi> that man ſaid, that is ſhe that rides
a Head of us, and I look'd, and ſhe had a Pennant up; ſo they were put on
Board; and as ſoon as they were on Board, ſhe went off, and I rowed up to the
Bridge, and went through Bridge, and came up as far as and
there I ſtaid and took my Scull and my Staff out of my Boat; and when I took
them out, I miſſed my Clothes; ſays I, God bleſs me, I have loſt my Clothes; but
then I thought it was but a ſtill Tide, and therefore I would try if I could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them; for I thought they could not be got far, there being little or no
Wind; ſo I went down to the Place where the Veſſel lay, and ſhe was gone; and
I enquired of ſeveral Smacks that lay there, but could hear nothing, and I rowed
as low as <hi>Limas Reach;</hi> and about <hi>Black Wall</hi> and <hi>Limas Reach,</hi> I came up to a
Smack, that I ſuppoſed was ſhe, and I cry'd out, Ho the Smack, and they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
me So; I asked them if I did not bring a Fare a-board that Smack a while
a go; then they ſaid no; I told them I had brought a Fare on Board ſome Smack
that lay about <hi>Horſleydown</hi> and <hi>Pickle-herring Stairs,</hi> and they had got two Coats
of mine, which I had forgotten, and it had a Pennant up when they went on
Board, but this had none; ſo I rowed on further, till I came as far as <hi>Berking
Sherf;</hi> and I thought there being ſo little Wind that none could be gone beyond
me; and therefore waited to ſee a Smack with a Pennant coming down, but I
could not meet with it, and there I lay all Night in my Waſtcoat; and the next
day I came back to <hi>Greenwich;</hi> and as I came along, I went on Board ſeveral
Veſſels to enquire, becauſe I took her for an Attendant upon a Man of War, but
I could not hear of my Clothes, till laſt <hi>Friday</hi> was Seven-night, two Watermen
came, and brought me the Clothes I loſt.</p>

                        <speaker>Fiſher.</speaker>
                        <p>My Lord, and <hi>Mr. Aſhton,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Ellyot,</hi> and my Lords man, and the
Maſter came on Board between eleven and twelve: There were no more came
on Board that I know of; but we were aſleep when they came on board; and
immediately our Maſter ordered us to hale up the Anchor. Now there was but
little Wind ſtirring; and by that time we were faln down as low as half-way
Tree, it being ſtill Flood, we could go no farther: ſo there we were ordered to
ſtop, and we lay by till morning; and about eight in the morning we weighed
Anchor again, and about nine, when we came to the <hi>George</hi> Man of War they hid,
they deſired to go down into the Quarters, and we laid the Hatches upon them.</p>

                        <p>What kind of place is it that they hid in?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Fiſher.</speaker>
                        <p>They could not ſtand upright, nor ſit upright, but they muſt lie along
or lean upon their Elbows. So when when we were got below the Ship, they came
up again into the Cabbin: And when we came at <hi>Graveſend</hi> near the Block Houſe,
then they hid again till we were below the Block-Houſe; and then we ſpyed a
Boat coming, which made them to keep below; and there they continued till
Captain <hi>Billop</hi> took them.</p>

                        <p>Truly, I did not know where we were to go, till ſince we came on
Shoar. I underſtood nothing till they hid; and then indeed I thought we were

                        <p>May it pleaſe you my Lord, I know nothing concerning my Maſters
Buſineſs, but all that I know of this Buſineſs is, That they came on Board about
Twelve a Clock at Night, and I was then aſleep in the Cabin, and hearing ſome
come on Board, and my Maſter call, I looked out, and there were Three or four
Centlemen and my Maſter, and he ordered us to ſet ſail immediately, and make
our way down as faſt as we could; there was little or no Wind; ſo that when
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53228:21"/>
we came down to the half way Tree, we were forced to come to an Anchor,
and there we rid at Anchor till it was broad day, when there was a brave Gale
to the Weſtward, and by that time we got down to <hi>Long Reach;</hi> about Nine
a Clock we came to the <hi>George</hi> Frigat, a Man of War, and they underſtanding
that, deſired to hide theſe Gentlemen.</p>

                        <speaker>Amonds.</speaker>
                        <p>My Lord <hi>Preſton, Mr. Aſhton,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Ellyot,</hi> and the other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Amonds.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, that Gentleman was one.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>

                        <p>And ſo Sir, after we were paſſed the Frigat, they came up again,
and did not deſign to go down any more till they ſee ſome other danger. When
we came almoſt to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> they went down again: When we were paſt
the <hi>Block-houſe</hi> I was at the Helm, and they were reſolving to go to Dinner, and
bid that Man, my Fellow, to reach them ſome Victuals out of the Hamper: And
while he was reaching them ſome Victuals, I ſee the Pinnace coming towards us;
ſayd I, here is a Pinnace coming a-board; ſays my Lord and they, we muſt go down
again and hide, and ſo they did go down again; we apprehended that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a-Board to preſs us, and they had no mind to be ſeen. When the Pinnace came
near, they waved to us in this manner, as much as to bid us ſtay; ſo we laid
the Sail by, and ſtaid for them till they came up; and when the Captain came
on Board, ſays he, this is worth our coming on Board, here are a couple of
brisk Seamen will do the King Service; I muſt have them, I think; ſays he, I
hope not ſo, Noble Captain; ſays he, have you any thing to keep your ſelves
clear? Yes, ſays our Maſter? I am ſorry for that ſays the Captain; what is it?
ſays the Maſter, I have a Protection; ſays the Captain, let us ſee your Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
ſo the Maſter pulls out his Protection, and ſhews it: Well, ſays the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>I</hi> muſt look a little further, and away he goes into the Cabin, and takes
up the Hatches where theſe Gentlemen were; ſays the Captain; Hye, hye, who
is here? Turn out, ſays he; but I ſuppoſe they did not make ſo much haſt
as the Captain expected; ſo he called ſome of his men on Board; and when
they came on Board, my Lord came out, and the reſt of the Gentlemen; and
ſays my Lord to the Captain, <hi>I</hi> hope you will be ſo kind as not to take any thing
from us: Says he, <hi>I'</hi>ll meddle with nothing but Papers, 'tis Papers <hi>I</hi> look for,
and put his Hands in both his Pockets, and pulled out Papers, and put them
into his own Pocket, but whether they were new or old <hi>I</hi> can't tell; and there
was a Watch likewiſe, but that he gave my Lord again, and ſaid, <hi>I'</hi>ll meddle
with nothing but Papers: then he ſearcht <hi>Mr. Ellyot,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Aſhton</hi> was the laſt
that came out, and there was one of my Lords Watermen in the Cabin with him;
and, ſays he, an pleaſe you Noble Captain, That Gentleman puts ſomething in
his Boſom: Says the Captain, What did you put in your Boſom, Sir; nothing,
ſays he, but my Handkerchief.</p>

                        <p>About Two a Clock, or between One and Two, upon the laſt
of <hi>December,</hi> my Lord <hi>Danby</hi> came to me at one of the Doors of the Houſe of
Lords, and told me his Father would ſpeak with me; and he carried me to my
Lord <hi>Linſey</hi>'s Chamber, where immediately my Lord Preſident came, and told
me there were ſome Perſons that were going for <hi>France</hi> about Buſineſs of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Conſequence, and he deſired me to uſe ſome means to get them apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<hi>I</hi> then propoſed what <hi>I</hi> ſhould have to enable me for the Undertaking. My
Lord <hi>Danby</hi> ſaid there was ſuch a Boat, that he would procure for me, and my
Lord Preſident gave me a Letter to another Perſon, who was to inſtruct me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about this Matter: My Lord <hi>Danby</hi> got the Boat ready, and ſome Men and
Arms in it; but <hi>I</hi> thought there was not Arms enough, ſo <hi>I</hi> borrow'd ſome Arms
of my Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> and about Eleven a Clock as near as <hi>I</hi> remember we put off
from <hi>Tower Wharf,</hi> it being very calm; <hi>I</hi> thought we ſhould be ſwifter than any
Veſſel, and ſhould have the advantage of them all; and therefore run down as far
as <hi>Graves End;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> brought ſeveral Veſſels by the Lee, in which time <hi>I</hi> preſſed
ſome <hi>Barkin</hi> men, two or three of them; and amongſt them, one that knew the
Veſſels that lay in the River, having been on Board ſeveral; and we did board
divers, and took out ſome men, having a Preſs Warant; and he that <hi>I</hi> had taken
of the <hi>Barkin</hi> men, after we had paſſed by ſeveral Veſſels, ſeeing this Veſſel ſailing,
told me that was the <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> whereupon we made up to them, and
waving towards them, they ſtaid for us: when we came up, there was ſtanding
by the Maſter two luſty Sailors, and <hi>I</hi> told him <hi>I</hi> would take but one of them; he
ſaid he had a Protection; <hi>I</hi> bid him ſhew it me; when <hi>I</hi> was come on Board, and
had looked upon his Protection, <hi>I</hi> told him <hi>I</hi> muſt look a little further, and <hi>I</hi>
went down into the Cabin, and took up the Hatches, and there <hi>I</hi> found them all
four lying together.</p>

                        <p>I handed my Lord <hi>Preston</hi> up firſt, and after he came out of that
little place, which he was forced to creep out of on his Knees, I turned my Lord
about, and told him I muſt ſearch him; he ſaid, he hoped I would not meddle
with any thing; <hi>I</hi> told him <hi>I</hi> would meddle with nothing but Papers, ſo <hi>I</hi> put my
Hand in his Pocket and took all the Papers <hi>I</hi> could find, and put them in my own
Pocket, and taking out a Watch, <hi>I</hi> delivered it to my Lord again. The next
was Mr. <hi>Ellyot,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> ſearcht him, and found nothing at all upon him. After that
<hi>Aſhton</hi> came up, and one of my men told me that Gentleman had put ſomething
in his Boſom; whereupon <hi>I</hi> gave him a ſudden turn, his Back being towards me,
and asked him what was that he put in his Boſom? he told me nothing but his
Handkerchief, and pluckt his Handkerchief out; with that <hi>I</hi> clapt my Hand in
and got the Packet, and took it out, with the Lead fixt to it; <hi>I</hi> have the Lead
now in my Pocket.</p>

took all the People that belonged to the Smack with me: after <hi>I</hi> had brought

                        <p>It was a pretty while before we talked of any thing; the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our talk was, as <hi>I</hi> remember, they deſired to go aſhore at <hi>Graveſend</hi> to
refreſh themſelves, for it was cold, and they had not eaten any thing: it was my
Lord that deſired it; but <hi>I</hi> begged his pardon for that, and told him there was
a man of War that lay at <hi>Long-reach,</hi> whereas <hi>I</hi> believed his Lordſhip would be

he ſaid he was glad he was fallen into a civil Gentleman, and they ſaid they
were glad they were fallen into the hands of an acquaintance. <hi>I</hi> told my Lord
<hi>I</hi> hope he ſhould never find any thing otherwiſe than Civil from me; my Lord
was very civil to me in Complementing, and aſſuring me he would acknowledge

Packet, and throw the to'ther over-board. <hi>I</hi> told him he took the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

to be odd People, and very indiſcreet, that could not find out ſuch a thing as
that: After this was over, we had a little interval, and there was a Hamper in the

                        <p>I was in my L. <hi>Dunblain</hi>'s Barge, and I went down with this Capt.
<hi>Billop,</hi> and we were on board ſeveral Veſſels; and we light upon a Ketch,
where we preſſed ſome Men, we thought it had been only ſome Seamen
that were to be preſſed, we did not know of any thing elſe when we had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53228:24"/>
rowed down as far as you have heard. We rowed up again, and ſearched ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
little Veſſels and Smacks that were in the River; when a Fiſher-man
that we had preſſed, ſaid, That that was the Veſſel the Captain enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
And then the Captain bid us take ſome ſmall Arms; and I took a Piſtol,
and I went aboard. The Captain read the Protection, and then ſaid, he muſt
look further: When the Captain look'd into one of the Cabins, and took up
the Hatches, I ſaw a great piece of Roaſt-Beef, and my L. <hi>Preſton</hi> by it, and
a Mince-Pye, and a Fowl; and we took the Beef out, but my Lord's Man
ſaid, he miſſed his Knife, it lay upon the Bench: And then came my Lord up,
and his Man, and Mr. <hi>Ellyot;</hi> and when Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> (the Man with the Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes)
came up, he went down again and pretended to look for his Hat; but
when he was down, I ſee him cram ſomething into his Boſom, and I told the
Captain, I had ſeen him put ſome-thing in his Boſom; and the Captain took
him hold by the Buttons of his Coat and turned him about, and asked him,
what he put into his Boſom? He ſaid, nothing but his Handkerchief; and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it out of his Boſom, he ſhewed it the Captain: but the Captain put his
Hand into Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>'s Boſom and pulled out the Pacquet.</p>

                        <p>It was upon the Gravel, and there were a couple of Seals which

forgot the Seals.</p>

a black Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Ellyot</hi> I think they call him, had a pair of Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers

out, becauſe I was ſo ſharp upon him to make him come out: And when we

an Account, that he had not opened the Pacquet then, but only the ſmall
Letter or Note that lay apart from the reſt: But, my Lord, the Pacquet was
in the ſame condition when I came in again, upon the Table, as when I left
it; my Ld <hi>Nottingham,</hi> as I believe, had not opened that Pacquet, for I
found it juſt as I left it, upon the Table.</p>

                        <p>Gentlemen, the Paper we are now offering to you is that
which I mentioned before, it is the Reſult of a Conference; there were two
of them taken in this Bundle, the one of them ſeems to be the firſt Draught,
the other is a Copy more fairly written; but I think they are both in effect
the ſame; however they were both taken in the ſame Pacquet, and you ſhall
hear them read.</p>

                        <p>Certainly, my Lord's ſwearing to a Paper in this manner can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a good Proof: my Circumſtances, my Lord, are very hard, and your
Lordſhip, I have heard, ought to be of Counſel for me in any Point of Law;
and, my Lord, I humbly deſire to know, whether this can be a Proof of a
Paper, that he ſays was taken in a Pacquet, and yet he can't ſwear it?</p>

                        <p>My Lord, he does not ſwear that this was one of the Papers;
but the Queſtion is, Whether all theſe Witneſſes together do not prove it?
You ſee how the Evidence runs; All the Papers taken were delivered to my
Ld <hi>Nottingham:</hi> All that were delivered to him were ſent back by him ſealed,
and delivered to my Ld Preſident; my Ld Preſident brought them all to the
Cabinet-Council, and delivered them to my Ld <hi>Sidney,</hi> and this my Ld <hi>Sidney</hi>
ſays is one of thoſe Papers.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, I have a very great Honour for that Noble Lord,
and I am ſure, if he had not been upon his Oath, he would have ſaid that
which was truth; but in this condition that I am in, I muſt crave leave to
obſerve every thing I can for my ſelf, and I cannot but ſay theſe Papers are
very oddly managed, and delivered up and down from one hand to another;
I deſire your Lordſhip would pleaſe to obſerve that theſe Papers are here
brought after a very odd manner.</p>

                        <p>I do ſo, my Lord, and I hope your Lordſhip will adviſe me
whether you do think it a ſufficient Evidence and Proof of theſe Papers;
they are Papers that have been copied out, and ſent unſealed from hand to
hand by ſome Meſtengers from one to another, and which now appear to be
unſealed, and ſome of which he that took them cannot ſwear to.</p>

                        <p>That is my misfortune: but I am urging to my Lords the
Judges, whether this Paper ought to be read, and I deſire your Lordſhip to
adviſe me, whether it can be admitted as Evidence, being thus oddly proved?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Ld C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>It is Evidence ſurely, my Lord: but the Queſtion is, What
Credit the Jury will give to this Evidence, the Jury are Judges of that; but
certainly it is Evidence to have the Paper read.</p>

                        <p>Pray, my Lord, ſee how the Evidence ſtands about this
matter; firſt it is ſworn by <hi>Billop,</hi> that he took a Bundle of Papers, tho 'tis
true, the Particulars he does not undertake to ſwear to; Well, what is next?
why, ſays he, all that was in that Bundle I carried to my Ld <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and
I received from my Ld <hi>Nottingham</hi> all that I carried to him. What ſays my
my Ld <hi>Nottingham?</hi> he ſwears I delivered back again to Capt. <hi>Billop</hi> the ſame
Papers he delivered to me, and all and no more, ſealed up with my Seal. When
he has it ſealed up, what does he do with it? why he carries it to my Ld Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident.
Is there any poſſibility of creeping out of this Evidence? Well, he
delivers them to my Ld <hi>Sidney,</hi> and my Ld <hi>Sidney</hi> ſays this is one of thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers:
Can there be a plainer Evidence than this? when he ſays, all he had he
carried to my Ld <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and my Ld <hi>Nottingham</hi> ſwears all he did receive
he ſent back ſealed by him to my Ld Preſident, and my Ld Preſident ſwears
all he received ſo ſealed he gave to my Ld <hi>Sidney,</hi> and my Ld <hi>Sidney</hi> ſwears
this is one of thoſe Papers.</p>

take off the frightful Character we have of him, and ſhew us he has no ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
as returning our Offended K. a Conqueror upon us, but that he can and will
be our Friend and Mediator; upon which terms he will find that many Lords and
Gentlemen will ſpeedily ſhew themſelves to his Satisfaction; eſpecially, if he
makes haſte, and looſes no approaching Opportunity.</p>

3. If he incline to this ſort of Senſe, he muſt over-rule the Bigotry of St. G.
and diſpoſe their Minds to think of thoſe Methods that are more likely to gain
the Nation; for there is one ſilly thing or other daily done there, that comes to
our notice here, which prolongs what they ſo paſſionately deſire. The Methods
thought upon are theſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> To prevent dangerous and fooliſh Intelligence by forbidding all in that
Court to write any News hither, and that K. <hi>J.</hi> only have his Correſpondence by
whom to hear from, and ſpeak to People here; ſince Letters ſo often miſcarry,
and are filled with nothing but what we ſhould not hear; and what we have are
Arguments for the moſt part againſt the K's Reſtoration.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since there is a great Body of Proteſtants that never defected, and
that many Thouſands are returning, and that they are the Natural Weight and
Power of theſe Kingdoms, by having the Heads, Hands and Wealth of their
ſide, to the odds and advantage of at leaſt Two Hundred Proteſtants to one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick;
the K. may think of nothing ſhort of a Proteſtant Adminiſtration,
nor of nothing more for the Catholicks then a Legal Liberty of Conſcience; for
much e mutt is againſt all other Notions, to which all private Paſſions, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Frames in Government muſt yield or break. He may Reign a Catholick
in Devotion, but he muſt Reign a Proteſtant in Government. <hi>Cromwel</hi>
could not, yet on a broader bottom, with a Victorious Army, ſubſiſt or keep what
he had got.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He muſt give us a Model of this at St. G. by preferring the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
that are with him above the Catholicks; one being Loyal upon leſs tyes
of Intereſt, and to tell the Nation here what they are to hope for when he comes.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He muſt give Incouragement to Lords and Gentlemen here to
come to him, at leaſt Seven or Nine for a ſtanding Council, which will make us
here think he is in ſome degree ours again, and that we have a relation to him,
and ſome intereſt and ſhare in him, by the Men of Quality of our own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that are with him. This will incomparably faciliate the matter here, nor
will they, when they come, come empty, and in their own Names, which is ſtill
better, and will be more ſatisfactory there.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To induce this, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants ſhould be encouraged by an
Edict of Liberty from the K. of <hi>F.</hi> to have Chappels at their own Coſts, in
which to Worſhip God after their reſpective ways, by which that K. will
make us reflect upon his Conduct towards his <hi>Hugonots,</hi> rather to flow from the
hazard he thought himſelf in by their Antimon. and reſiſting Principles, then
a deſire of Perſecution.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Laſtly,</hi> All other requiſite Meaſures depending upon the acceptance this finds,
an Anſwer hereunto is impatiently deſired by thoſe that have Diſcourſed the K's
Buſineſs to this Maturity. So ended with an Vnanimous Conſent, both <hi>Tories</hi>
and <hi>Whiggs</hi> upon this Occaſion, that are in a way of cloſeing in his Intereſt.</p>

                           <p>That the King will return with a deſign of making an Entire Conqueſt of
his People, is ſo ridiculous as well as difficult, that it needs not be ſpoken to.</p>
                           <p>That the Kings Declaration be worded in General Terms, That he will Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
by the Laws, that they ſhall be the Rule of his Actions, that he will
Endeavour to ſettle Liberty of Conſcience by Law, that whatſoever things were
formly done by him, which occaſioned Jealouſies in the minds of his People, ſhall
be left to the determination of a Parliament, to be formerly and regularly called
aſſoon as is poſſible.</p>
                           <p>That he has given ſufficient Evidence of his unwillingneſs to bring an Army
of Strangers into his Kingdom, by refuſing the Succors of the King of <hi>France</hi>
offered him, and which were even ready to be Embarked upon the firſt Notice of
the P. of <hi>Oranges</hi> intended Invaſion.</p>
                           <p>That he brings with him ſuch an Army only as is neceſſary for his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and for the ſecurity of ſuch of his Loyal Subjects as ſhall reſort to him,
that he will diſmiſs them as ſoon as he ſhall have rid the Nation of thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
who have Invaded it, and trampled upon the Laws and Liberties of
his People.</p>
                           <p>The Kings large exerciſing his Diſpenſing Power gave the great alarm to the
People, and contributed moſt of all toward General Defection. Yet when
that Power came to be debated in the laſt Convention, there appeared ſo many
difficulties in the limiting of it, every Body (even the preſent Judges believing it
neceſſary, That a diſpenſing Power ſhould be in the K.) That it was let fall,
and that point remains as it was. And without mentioning that, or any other
particular, the K. can be in no danger by leaving all things which have been the
occaſions of Jealouſies to the determination of Parliament, where beſides the Kings
profeſſed Friends and Servants, there will not want others who will be glad of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity

                        <p>31 December.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>The Interruption of the former Correſpondency had a very ill Effect many ways,
but for that reaſon, no Opportunity ought now to be loſt, and I hope this will prove a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
one.</p>
                           <p>In Trade as well as in Government Schemes muſt be laid, for there is no living from
hand to mouth any more in Commerce than in the Politicks. Lay therefore your deſigns
probably, and purſue them diligently, and with Vigour, though it be a hazardous time, yet
by ventring boldly, where venturing is adviſeable, it often returns great profit.</p>
                           <p>There is nothing more to be ſaid, but to give the Bearer fit and full Seaſons to tell
what he knows, both as to Goods fit for our Market, and when and where to be ſent; the
Sea will quickly grow ſo troubleſome, that unleſs you diſpatch what you intend for us, you
will looſe a great opportunity of advantage. I hope the account he has to give of our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
here, with the Merchants that deal with us, eſpecially thoſe that have lately
brought us their cuſtom, will both encourage a larger Trade, and excite the utmost dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
I will ſay nothing of my ſelf, It ſhall be enough that I can live in the good Opinion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53228:30"/>
of one I bear ſo great a reverence and affection for; but for this honest Factor, I muſt
own I can hardly ſay enough, Truth and Boldneſs are excellent qualities in a Servant, and
he has ſhewn both, as Occaſion has required him to ſhew them.</p>
                           <p>I have but one word to add, and pray take it as the trueſt mark of unalterable reſpect,
chuſe well, but have to do but with a few, for a multitude may give, but can never keep
Counſel.</p>
                           <p>I ſhall with more impatience then becomes me, wait the reſult of this, and it will be a great
mark of goodneſs, to let us have it the beſt and ſafeſt way.</p>
                           <p>Once more, let not the Seaſon ſpend unprofitably, for a more likely one can hardly come
than between this and the 1st of <hi>March.</hi> Interpret this I pray, as no private Intereſt of my
own, or partial motion of any other Perſon. It is my Senſe, my Duty, and my Friendſhip,
which will not let me prevaricate, nor ſuffer thoſe I love and honour to looſe ſo happy and
preſſing an occaſion of advantage. With the beſt Wiſhes I cloſe up this, and am <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>This is Dated <hi>December</hi> 31. but is not directed to any
Body at all.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>IT is a preſumption incident to thoſe that are any where upon the ſpot, to think that they
know better then thoſe that are not, what is fitteſt to be done in any Occurrence. This
makes me ſay, That now is the time to make large advantages by Trading; the Sea being
freer then two Months paſt, or we can hope it will be two Months hence. This Gentleman is
well inſtructed in our Markets, and what the Goods are we want, and when and where they
ſhould be ſent: It is moſt earneſtly deſired that this happy opportunity may not be loſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by the late Vndertakers, and I would not for much, they ſhould receive the leaſt diſguſt.
They are ſomewhat poſitive in their termes; but they alſo ſay, they will be good and conſtant
Cuſtomers; and I have more than once ſeen the miſchief of over-rateing and over-ſtaying the
Market. Opportunities are to be uſed, they cannot be given by Men.</p>
                           <p>The Bearer needs nothing from me to recommend him, but he is deſerving in our Opinion
here, and many will take their meaſures by the uſage he finds there; and indeed the preſſing
posture of our Trading Affairs will not permit more Experiments. If the ſeveral Parcels
arrive not, that have been promiſed, before the 10th of <hi>March</hi> at furtheſt, (eſpecially the
<hi>Copper</hi> and <hi>Linnen,</hi> of which the Bearer will be more particular) I am ſatisfied we ſhall
looſe this Summers profit. I am the more preſſing, becauſe I am well aſſured of what I
write; and if ever I judged right it is upon this occaſion.</p>
                           <p>I have ſaid nothing of another Gentleman that takes this Opportunity to ſee thoſe parts,
but he has ſhewn a zeal and a ſincerity in this affair equal to moſt. <hi>Jo.</hi> is not yet gone, by
a misfortune, but he will follow with a good Poſtſcript in this affair. Of my ſelf I will ſay
nothing, I hope I need not, for no body without Vanity can be more ſincerely and affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Friend and Servant to the Company than my ſelf. I writ at large yeſterday, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
write what the hand that gives this can ſay; and therefore will write no more, but that
with the greateſt Reſpect, I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

favour, but it grieves me extreamly that there is not that left which can ſecure me from
being troubleſome to you; for that is the thing in the World I would not be. I have told my
Lord my condition. What I deſire of you he thinks very moderate, I hope you will. Pray
Sir be not backward in ſetling my little affair, for I have deſerved your Care. Your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and I muſt ſtarve, if this Government can make us. I hope our Intereſts are not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that is, you have an equal tenderneſs at leaſt for both. If you think fit to ſpeak what
I would have you to this Bearer, he will give me a juſt account of it. You know he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to be my Friend, and I believe him grateful, ſince he ventures ſo boldly for you. He
brings with him ſome merry Papers. Adieu, for I dare write no more; but pray ſend a
Meſſenger on purpoſe to me, that I may know exactly what you will do, and would have me
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53228:31"/>
do. If you ſend upon no other buſineſs there will be no danger. Pray Sir ask my Lord,
and he will tell you how I have been uſed, and upon what account; I believe you know it not.

that is not my fault, nor of thoſe I have acted with: Let it be looked into what has been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
both as to <hi>Engl. Scot.</hi> and <hi>Irel.</hi> and ſee if moſt of it is not come to paſs already, and the
rest will follow if not prevented. I wiſh it may alſo be conſidered what uſage we have met
with from men imployed, and how they have left your Buſineſs and Friends; how they mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it, you will know from all hands; things they could not do, nor durſt not undertake were
better undone then not done by them. Men in this Place, and in theſe Times, muſt have ſome
Courage as well as Sence to do any thing with People here. It is not my own ill uſage makes
me ſay this, but my concern for one I wiſh the beſt to in the World, and will give my proofs
of this upon all occaſions. I need not enlarge, ſince all our Grievances are known to him
that brings this. For my own part I will stay here, ſo long as I can be ſafe, if with ne're ſo
great trouble; but it would be ſome Comfort to know Men (when driven from hence) may be
ſo; therefore the reports of Peoples uſage are terrible, as well as of the indiſcretion of St.
<hi>Germ.</hi> Family, we feel the ſmart of it by ridiculous Letters falling daily into the hands of
the Government. Their Maſter and Miſtreſs are little obliged by it no more then we: If
there is any thing, Sir, you do particularly command me, or depend upon me for, let me
know it. I cannot undertake much, nor furniſh more. I have ſtill helped every Body, and
paid to every thing I could; and if a twelve month ago my condition was what I then repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
you beſt know if it has been mended. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and conſidering that of others, makes me
grow more contented; and if the proſpect of miſery to us all was any ſatisfaction, that is
now plainly ſeen.</p>
                           <p>Pray God bleſs us all, by reſtoring every Man his own, and you with long Life.</p>
                           <p>He that gives you this, hath furniſht for your uſe to me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Two Hundred Pounds,
which I deſire may be repaid.</p>

were none of them done in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and they are laid
to be done within this County; I find nothing of that kind proved upon
me to be done here, for any Memorandums that they ſay may be in that
hand, I hope the Gentlemen of the Jury will conſider, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
followed upon any of theſe things, that may be found in thoſe Papers:
And in the next place, I deſire to know, whether they are ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be mine; that is, whether ſimilitude of Hands is proof or not againſt
me in ſuch a caſe. I humbly offer theſe things to your Lordſhip, and hope

                        <p>Your Lordſhip obſerves none of the Witneſſes have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that I was going into <hi>France,</hi> nor knew any thing of it. I did not hire
the Ship, nor any thing of that kind; tho' I ſuppoſe if they had, it is not

                        <p>My Lord, as to the firſt matter that your Lordſhip makes
a Queſtion upon, Whether there be any act of Treaſon proved in <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi>
that does depend upon the Proof of your Lordſhip's being concerned
in the Papers, for if your Lordſhip had an intention in carrying theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
into <hi>France,</hi> which ſpeaks a deſign to Invade this Realm, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
took Boat in <hi>Middleſex</hi> at <hi>Surrey</hi>-Stairs, in proſecution of that intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there is an Overt-act in this County of <hi>Middleſex.</hi>

                        <p>No, my Lord; but if it be proved that your Lordſhip

to go with them into <hi>France,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> where-ever
your Lordſhip acted in order to that deſign, that is Treaſon, and there you

if your Lordſhip did go on Ship-board in order to it, your taking Boat in
<hi>Middleſex</hi> in order to go on Ship-board, is a Fact done in the County of

                        <p>I hope your Lordſhip, and the Jury will obſerve 'tis not proved,

                        <p>As to what I offer, that nothing has been proved in <hi>Middleſex,</hi>
I hope your Lordſhip will take it to be a Point of Law, and then it ought

                        <p>No, 'tis a Matter of Fact only; but if you pleaſe, the reſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53228:34"/>
of my Lords the Judges may give you their Opinion; for this is a Queſtion
upon a ſuppoſition that your Lordſhip was guilty of a Deſign of going into
<hi>France,</hi> and this with a purpoſe to depoſe the King, and alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
then the Queſtion is upon ſuch a Suppoſition that you were guilty
of that Deſign whether you were guilty in <hi>Middleſex</hi> or no.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>

                        </speaker>
                        <p>My Lord, they have not proved that deſign.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Holt.</hi>
                        </speaker>
                        <p>We do not ſay, it is taken for granted now, but 'tis a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
upon a Suppoſition. Now my Lord, I'll tell your Lordſhip in ſhort
my Opinion, the reſt of the Judges will tell you theirs, I am of Opinion,
if your Lordſhip had ſuch a Deſign to go with theſe Papers into <hi>France,</hi>
and theſe Papers were formed by you, or you were privy to the Contents
of them, then it is plainly proved, that you went into a Boat in the
County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> in order to carry on this Deſign, and that will
make it a good Indictment, and here is a plain Overt-act of High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in <hi>Middleſex.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>L. C. J. <hi>Pollexfen.</hi>
                        </speaker>
                        <p>I am of the ſame Opinion; for your Fact as to this
particular Point in Law ſtands thus: You are Indicted of High-Treaſon in
two Points; one is, For Conſpiring to Depoſe the King and Queen, and alter
the Government: and the other is, For Aiding and Aſſiſting the <hi>French</hi>
King, and his Subjects, declared Enemies, and in open War againſt the King
and Queen, and to invite the Enemies of the Kingdom to invade the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Now this Deſign, and this Help and Aſſiſtance, are written in theſe
Papers; for they are Inſtructions for the carrying on of this Deſign. You
my Lord are the Perſon that is charged to go with theſe Papers to help on
this Deſign; you began your Journey in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Evidence, you took Water at <hi>Surrey</hi>-ſtairs, which is in the
County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and every ſtep you made in purſuance of this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
is Treaſon, where-ever it was: So then here is a ſufficient proof of a
Fact in <hi>Middleſex.</hi>

                        <p>That, my Lord, is a Point of Law, and I humbly deſire your
Lordſhip, that I may have Councel in this Caſe. It is not proved by any
Body, that I ſaid I would go into <hi>France;</hi> and in the next place, it is not
proved that I had theſe Papers about me; there has been no Evidence given
that I did take Water with an intention to go with theſe Papers into <hi>France.</hi>

                        <p>Then, my Lord, what have I done? I have not done an thing
within the danger of any Statute upon which I am Indicted; beſides, my
Lord, what I have to offer further, is this, I think I ought to have two cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Witneſſes to prove every Fact, and I hope the Gentlemen of the Jury
will conſider, there is nothing but Suppoſition as to me; and I hope I and
my Family ſhall not be ruined upon a Suppoſition.</p>

                        <p>My Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> I am called upon, it ſeems, to give my
Opinion in this Caſe, but this I take it muſt be left to the Jury. What cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
they will give to the proof, your Lordſhip makes a Queſtion, as the
proof ſtands, Whether here be any thing done in this County; here are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
given to the <hi>French</hi> King how to Invade <hi>England</hi> and Carry on
the War againſt us. Theſe Inſtructions are contained in ſeveral Papers, and
theſe Papers in a Pacquet are carried to the Smack, which Smack was hired
to go to <hi>France.</hi> You are found taking water at <hi>Surrey</hi>-Stairs, which is in
the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> in order to go to the Smack: You did go to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53228:35"/>
Smack; the Papers were taken in your Company, and were ſeen lying by
your Seals; and the Witneſſes ſwear, they believe ſome of them to be your
Hand; you took care to deſire to have them diſpoſed of. Now how far
the Jury will believe this Matter of Fact, that is thus teſtified, is left to
them; this ſeems to be the Proof, and if the Jury do believe it, here is a
Plain Evidence of an Overt Act in the County of <hi>Middleſex.</hi>

                        <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, My Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> ſtands Indicted
for High Treaſon, in imagining and compaſſing the Depoſition, Death, and
Deſtruction of the King and Queen; and for that purpoſe, did write, or
cauſe to be writ, ſeveral treaſonable Papers and Letters, deſigned to go into
<hi>France,</hi> and there to correſpond with the <hi>French</hi> King and his Subjects, who
are Enemies to the King and Queen; and to carry with him thoſe Treaſonable
Papers and Letters, containing a Project and a formed Deſign how this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſhould be invaded by Foreigners.</p>
                        <p>There is another Treaſon in the Indictment mention'd, and that is for
adhering to the abetting the King's Enemies, there being open War declared
between the King and Queen, and the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
                        <p>You have heard, Gentlemen, a very long Evidence, Witneſſes have been
produced <hi>viva voce,</hi> and ſeveral Papers have been read to you; ſome of the
Papers that have been produced, tho' they may ſeem miſterious and cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet they are not ſo very obſcure and unintelligible, but if you conſider
them well, the meaning of them will appear. Others of them are more
expreſs, and do plainly demonſtrate a Deſign, that this King and Queen
ſhould be depoſed, and that there ſhould be another Prince ſet upon the
Throne, and reſtored to the Government of this Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, There are two other Perſons mentioned in the Indictment
with my Lord, and tho' my Lord is only now upon his Tryal, yet the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which doth affect them, doth alſo concern my Lord.</p>
                        <p>You have heard how there was an Intention of ſome Perſons to go to
<hi>France,</hi> and how Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> one of the two others that ſtands indicted with
my Lord, did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> with one Mrs. <hi>Prat,</hi> one of the Witneſſes, to hire a Veſſel
for that purpoſe, and it was by the means of one Mr. <hi>Burdett,</hi> that lives
in the City; they had a Meeting at <hi>Burdett</hi>'s Houſe, where they treated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Price that ſhould be given for the Hire of this Ship to go to <hi>France,</hi>
but at that time they did not agree. It was concluded, that the Woman
and <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Burdett</hi> ſhould meet at the <hi>Wonder Tavern,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dett</hi>
not being there, nothing was concluded upon then.</p>
                        <p>After that the Woman, Mr. <hi>Burdett,</hi> and <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and <hi>Elliott,</hi> met at Mrs.
<hi>Burdett</hi>'s; the Woman inſiſted at firſt upon 150 <hi>l.</hi> After they had been
treating for ſome time, the Bargain was made to go to <hi>France</hi> for 100 <hi>l.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then the next thing conſidered was, How this Money ſhould be paid;
By agreement, 93 <hi>Guinea's</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> which made up the 100 <hi>l.</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
in Mrs. <hi>Burdett</hi>'s hand; a <hi>Six-pence</hi> broken one part Mrs. <hi>Burdett</hi>
had, and the other part of the <hi>Six-pence</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> had; and when either
Mrs. <hi>Pratt,</hi> or the Maſter of the Veſſel did bring back that part of the <hi>Six-pence</hi>
that <hi>Aſhton</hi> had to Mrs. <hi>Burdett,</hi> the Money was to be paid.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:53228:35"/>
After this Agreement, they were appointed to go to the <hi>Seven Stars</hi> in
<hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> to the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Rigby,</hi> and there the Woman,
Mrs. <hi>Pratt,</hi> and the Maſter of the Veſſel, <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Elliot</hi> met, and they
were that Night to go away and to take Water at ſome place near to go
on Ship-bord; and having ſtayed there till it was about ten a Clock at
Night, then they went away into the <hi>Strand</hi> and ſo into <hi>Surry-ſtreet,</hi> and
took Water at <hi>Surry-ſtairs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But before that they came from Mr. <hi>Rigby</hi>'s, ſome Perſons went to
<hi>Surry-ſtairs</hi> to ſee for a Boat and met with that Fellow that was here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
who was a Sculler, and did hire him to go through the Bridge
when the Tide ſerved, and to carry ſome Gentlmen on Shipboard; they
agreed with him for half a Crown, and he was to ſtay in an Houſe near
the Stairs until they came.</p>
                        <p>And at the time appointed, Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> and the Maſter
of the Veſſel came to that place, and my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> and his Man with
them to take Water. My Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> was not at <hi>Burdett</hi>'s Houſe at the
hiring of the Ship, nor at Mr. <hi>Rigby</hi>'s; but it is proved by the Maſter of
the Veſſel, that he took Water with the reſt of them at <hi>Surry-ſtairs,</hi> that
he went with them on Shipboard, and was to go along with them.</p>
                        <p>Being on Board the Ship, they did appear to have ſome Apprehenſions
of Danger, and paſſing by a Man of War, my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> his Man, and
the other two went unto the Quarter-Hatches, where they lay down to
prevent themſelves from being taken or diſcovered; and they hid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time when they came near <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and coming up they ſeeing a
Boat coming towards them, they hid themſelves again. Captain <hi>Billop,</hi> who,
it ſeems, was ſent to apprehend them, pretended he was to Preſs Seamen, and
when he came on Board the Smack he ſaid he would Preſs the Mariners, who
anſwered they had a Protection: But he being upon his Search pulled up
the Boards of the Quarter-Hatches, and there was my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> and
the other Perſons lying down: It was not a place that was very proper for
Gentlemen, or indeed for any Paſſengers, to repoſe themſelves in; it was
an uneaſie place, no body could ſtand or ſit upright in it, nay there was
no convenient Place for lying down but they muſt lean upon their Elbows,
which poſture thoſe Gentlemen were in; ſo that their purpoſe was
plainly to conceal themſelves, and their concealing themſelves muſt be
becauſe of ſome Deſign they were about, which they would not have
diſcovered.</p>
                        <p>They being taken out from under the Hatches, one of the Witneſſes
tells you he ſaw a Pacquet lying there, and <hi>Aſhton</hi> pretending to fetch
his Hat, went down, took it up, and put the Pacquet into his Boſom;
and the Witneſſes informing Captain <hi>Billop</hi> thereof, he cauſed <hi>Aſhton</hi>'s
Coat to be ſearched, and from thence took the Pacquet and a piece of
Lead tyed to it, which was produced here in Court.</p>
                        <p>When they were bringing away in Cuſtody, they ſeemed all of them to
be very much concerned about this Pacquet; ſome of them, that is, <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and <hi>Elliot,</hi> would have had it thrown with the Lead over-board. My
Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> did not ſay ſo much, but Complimented Captain <hi>Billop</hi> in this
manner, He was glad he was fallen into the hands of a Civil Gentleman,
a Perſon of worth, and he ſhould always acknowledge his Kindneſs, and
would do him all the ſervice he could if he would diſpoſe of the
Pacquet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="66" facs="tcp:53228:36"/>
My Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> was ſearched at that time, and Letters of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
taken about him. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Elliot</hi> would have had Captain
<hi>Billop</hi> to take thoſe Letters which were taken in my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Pocket
and tyed the Lead to them and have thrown the Pacquet over-board, and
to report to the King and Council, That thoſe Letters were the Pacquet
that was taken with the Lead, and ſo have perſwaded him to be falſe to the
Truſt that was repoſed in him.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Elliot</hi> uſed many Expreſſions to induce him to that
Compliance; they told him the Government was unſtable, and every
Dog had his Day, and the Tide would turn; and that he would deſerve
very well if he would change ſides and go with them where they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that he had opportunity to get any Preferment he would have.</p>

                        <p>No, my Lord, I do not ſay you did; my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> did
not ſay any thing of all this, but only about diſpoſing of the Pacquet that
his Lordſhip ſpoke of to Captain <hi>Billop,</hi> and Complimented him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
him Kindneſs if he would diſpoſe of the Pacquet.</p>
                        <p>But, Gentlemen, as there was a Pacquet taken, ſo there were two Seals
taken at the ſame time and in the ſame place, which have been produced
and ſhewn to you; they lay both of them upon the Balaſt under the Quarter-Hatches, near the Pacquet: the one of them is the Seal of my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s
own Coat of Arms, the other Seal belongs to the Secretarys Office, which
Office my Lord once held in the late Reign.</p>

                        <p>Good my Lord, I will not do your Lordſhip any wrong;
I do not ſay that the Papers were taken about you; no nor the Seals; but
only that they lay upon the Ballaſt from whence the Pacquet was taken:
And I ſay further, That theſe Seals are not denyed by your Lordſhip to be
your Seals; the one is your own Seal of your Coat of Arms which was
taken at that time, and ſo I do not your Lordſhip any wrong, and by the
Grace of God will not.</p>

                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>It is no Crime, I hope, to have Seals.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>I do ſay, my Lord, the Papers were taken about <hi>Aſhton</hi>
and not about your Lordſhip; but they lay upon the Ballaſt where the Seals
were, and where your Lordſhip lay: But how far my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this matter, is to be conſidered by you of the Jury by and by.</p>
                        <p>Now, Gentlemen, you have heard how earneſt Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and Mr. <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liot</hi>
were; one of them, to wit, <hi>Elliot,</hi> wiſht a Thunder-Bolt might ſtrike
the Boat under Water as they were coming back; and when they came
through Bridge he wiſht that <hi>London-Bridge</hi> had fallen upon them and
knockt them upon the head.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>But I hope that is not to lye upon me neither, for I ſaid no
ſuch thing.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>No: But <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Elliot</hi> did ſay theſe things, and how
the caſe ſtands as to that in Relation to your Lordſhip is to be conſidered.
It is proved they afterwards gave Mony to the Seamen, half a Crowna
piece, to two of them, to ſay they were going to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and not to
<hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now Gentlemen, that my Lord was on Board this Veſſel, that my
Lord was under the Hatches, and that the Papers were taken in this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53228:36"/>
manner, is beyond all contradiction: So likewiſe that the Ship was hired
for <hi>France;</hi> that my Lord took Water at <hi>Surrey</hi> Stairs, and was taken in
this Veſſel in that manner that you have heard.</p>
                        <p>The next thing Gentlemen is about the Papers: I muſt tell you though
there are ſeveral of them that do ſeem myſterious, yet they are Papers
that do ſhew a very great deſign of Depoſing the King and Queen, and
a purpoſe of altering the preſent Government.</p>
                        <p>But Gentlemen, I will mention to you thoſe Papers that are very plain,
and leave you to conſider what conſtruction to put upon thoſe that are
obſcure. There is one Paper that ſeems to be inſtructions and heads for
a Declaration, that is to ſay, That the King of <hi>France</hi> muſt not come with
a deſign to make an intire Conqueſt.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, with ſubmiſſion to your Lordſhip, I hope you

to be mine.</p>

                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>No my Lord, I'll do your Lordſhip no wrong, but I
cannot ſpeak all my words at once.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>I am ſure you will not my Lord, but I beg leave to put your
Lordſhip in mind.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Well then Gentlemen the Paper begins,</hi> That the Kings
Declaration is to be formed in general Terms, that he will govern by the Laws,
that they ſhall be the Rule of his Actions, that he will endeavour to ſettle Liberty
of Conſcience by a Law, and that whatſover was done by him that gave any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of Jealouſy, ſhall be ſetled by Parliament. That he hath given ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Proofs and Evidence of his not being willing to bring an Army of
Strangers into the Kingdom, by refuſing the Succours the King of <hi>France</hi>
offered him, and that were ever ready to be Embarqued upon the firſt notice
of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s coming. That he brings ſuch an Army only as is
neceſſary for his own Defence, and ſecuring ſuch of his Loyal Subjects as ſhould
come to him; and that he will diſmiſs them as ſoon as he ſhall have rid the
Nation of thoſe Foreigners that had invaded us, and trampled upon the
Laws.</p>
                        <p>So that Gentlemen, here is a Paper in this Pacquet, that has plainly
laid open and proved the Deſign, and ſhews the meaning of it was to
ſeduce their Majeſties Subjects from their Allegiance; it was to be in
ſuch general Terms, making general Promiſes, hoping thereby that
People would be the more eaſily impoſed upon to renounce their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to their preſent Majeſties.</p>
                        <p>But Gentlemen, the Declaration imports farther, that the Realm was
to be invaded by Foreigners; and to palliate it, it is pretended that
Foreigners were only to be brought in to rid the Nation of Foreigners,
and you know who are meant by that: So that this Project was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to colour a Foreign Invaſion; and this Declaration was to direct
them how and upon what pretences they ſhould Invade this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, there is no manner of doubt but this is a Treaſonable
Declaration, and if any Perſon had this in his Poſſeſſion, and was going
into <hi>France</hi> to carry, with an intention there to make uſe of it, that
is Treaſon, though it be coucht under ſpecious Pretences of reſtoring
People to their Liberty: It was plainly a Deſign to Invade <hi>England</hi> by a
<hi>French</hi> Army.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>My Lord, that Paper was not found about me.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53228:37"/>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>No, no, my Lord, it was not; but good my Lord give
me your favour, I will certainly obſerve every thing that is ſitting; but
I tell you I cannot do it all at once.</p>
                        <p>Then Gentlemen, there is another Paper found in the Pacquet, that is
ſaid to be the reſult of a Conference that was had between divers Lords and Gentlemen, as well Tories as Whiggs as they call them, to prove
it poſſible to reſtore the late King by <hi>French</hi> Arms; and how this may
be effected, were Propoſals made: Yet ſtill it was pretended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Proteſtant Religion, and the Civil Adminiſtration according
to Law.</p>
                        <p>And that it might be brought to paſs, the Credulous were to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon, and made to believe that the <hi>French</hi> King would not
conquer <hi>England</hi> for himſelf; no, but he would conquer it for the
late King; he would be at that vaſt Charge, that great Expence of
Men and Arms to reſtore King <hi>James,</hi> and make no Profit of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                        <p>And it was propoſed how to ſeduce the People of <hi>England</hi> into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the <hi>French</hi> King kindneſs; He was to indulge the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
in <hi>France,</hi> and let them have the exerciſe of their own Religion
there at their own Charges; and this to ſatisfy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants,
that his Perſecution of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was not out of aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Proteſtant Religion, but only becauſe of their Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
and Reſiſting Principles. So that they were propoſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves what they were to do to make the People believe
the <hi>French</hi> King had no dangerous Deſign againſt our Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;
and if they could meet with Perſons to believe this, that
was a probable way thought upon in this Conference to get a great
many Adherents to the <hi>French</hi> King, thereby his Invaſion to be faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated,
and the whole Project rendred more ſucceſsful.</p>
                        <p>There is another thing Gentlemen, in this Paper, and that is this; they
complained of the miſmannagement of their Affairs at St. <hi>Germains;</hi> that
though they did earneſtly deſire the reſtitution of the late King, yet
there was always ſome Fooliſh thing or other that came from St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi>
that obſtructed their Deſign.</p>
                        <p>What that Fooliſh thing is, I can't ſay, it does not appear; but
whether it were not too great a Diſcovery of their Zeal for Popery,
and the advancement of the Popiſh Religion, is worth your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>And ſomething is to be done for ſatisfaction of the People as to that;
and it is adviſed that there ſhould be Seven or Nine, or ſuch a Number
of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men that ſhould go over, and be received into favour at St.
<hi>Germains,</hi> and they ſhould be of the Councel there, and theſe were to be
Proteſtants; and that was to be a colour and pretence that the late King
was reconciled to the Proteſtant Intereſt, becauſe he choſe Proteſtant
Counſellors, and had received them at St. <hi>Germans,</hi> and was adviſed by
them.</p>
                        <p>This, ſays the Paper, will make the World believe, he is ours, and
that we have gained him; which was to delude a great many of the
People of <hi>England,</hi> that they ſhould not be affrighted in caſe there ſhould
be ſuch an Invaſion of <hi>England,</hi> but invited rather, and encouraged to joyn
with the <hi>French</hi> when they came.</p>

But Gentlemen, the Three laſt Papers that have been produced to
you, are Papers that do ſomewhat more nearly concern my Lord
<hi>Preſton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Firſt Paper contains ſeveral Memorandums; It begins with Lady
<hi>D. 2000 l.</hi> who that Lady <hi>D.</hi> is, I muſt leave it to you to imagine, tho'
perhaps it may not be hard to gueſs.</p>
                        <p>It takes notice that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> were like to joyn; and theſe
Memorandums do alſo ſhew a deſign and purpoſe of ſomething to be done
for the prevention of that Conjunction. They ſeem alſo to be Inſtructions
to be made uſe of upon going into <hi>France</hi> to negotiate or tranſport ſome
matters of dangerous conſequence.</p>

theſe Memorandums are broken kind of Notes, incongruous and inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent.</p>

                        <p>Ay my Lord, they are ſo, they are but broken things;
but I ſay ſtill, they are Memorandums that were to be uſed for ſome
purpoſe: Now I leave it to the Jury to conſider of the matter of them:
What can be plainer than what is there expreſſed? The <hi>French</hi> are to
come in time, before the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> joyn; they are to watch
their opportunity and come betimes, and they are to fight at the Chops
of the Channel, and not to come ſo far as <hi>Beachy.</hi>

                        <p>The Paper mentions <hi>Gennings</hi> and <hi>Strickland</hi> and <hi>Trevannion,</hi> that
they were to come from St. <hi>Mallo's</hi> in one Night; the King (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the late King) was not to be on Board; and there were Ships to
lye at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> to plague <hi>London:</hi> It is eaſy to underſtand what they
meant. Among theſe Memorandums, it is made as a remark, that the
<hi>London</hi> Clergy are the worſt. It gives an account how <hi>Portſmouth</hi> was
fortified, and <hi>Goſport,</hi> and what number of Men were in them; and of
the ſtate and condition of our Navy; what rates our Ships were, and
how many, and who were to be the Commanders.</p>

                        <p>Gentlemen, my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> inſiſts upon it, that theſe Papers were
not found about him: It is true, they were not, but it does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow that they were none of his Papers: But you have Three
Witneſſes, Mr. <hi>Townſend,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bland,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Warr,</hi> produced to prove
theſe Papers to be my Lords Hand; Mr. <hi>Townſend</hi> ſays he was acquainted
pretty well with my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Hand; he was one of his Clerks in
the Office of the Wardrobe; he ſays he has ſeen my Lord write ſeveral
times, and does believe the Writing to be his Hand; and to the ſame
purpoſe ſays <hi>Bland;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Warr</hi> ſwears to one of the Papers, that he
believes it to be my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Hand.</p>

Gentlemen, there are other Papers which have been produced and read,
that are writ in Canting Terms, which yet plainly ſhew the general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
they tell the Party that Council are of Opinion, he has a very good
Title; they hope he will appear himſelf, and if the cauſe be well ſolicited
it may come to a hearing before the end of <hi>Eaſter Term.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is another matter mentioned in another Letter which is under
the diſguiſe of Trade, That the Goods muſt come before the firſt of <hi>March.</hi>
And another of them ſays, That unleſs the Copper and the Linnen come
before the tenth of <hi>March</hi> they ſhould loſe this Summers Profit.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, what can be the meaning of all this?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>I know not indeed, my Lord.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Truly, Gentlemen, I have not been able to take the particulars of every
Letter, but I muſt leave it to your Obſervation; only there is one of them
that makes mention of acquainting my Lord with condition of the Writer,
and direction is therein given to ſpeak to the Bearer; and what other
Lord was there, but he in the Company?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>I deſire to obſerve, my Lord, that I was not the Bearer.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>Truly, my Lord, I can't tell who was meant; I muſt
leave it to the Jury to judge of that; but there was no other Lord in that
Company.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>I give your Lordſhip thanks for obſerving that it was not
proved that they were taken upon me before; but I beg your Pardon
for interrupting of your Lordſhip.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>Interrupt me as much as you pleaſe, if I do not obſerve
right; I will aſſure you I will do you no wrong willingly.</p>
                        <p>Now, Gentlemen, the Queſtion is in the firſt place, Whether this be
Treaſon? and I told you before, without queſtion, if any Perſons do go
into <hi>France</hi> to Negotiate ſuch a deſign as this, or do purpoſe to go into
<hi>France,</hi> and do any Act in order thereunto, that is High Treaſon; and theſe
Letters do import High Treaſon as great as can be committed, a Treaſon
againg the King and Queen, a Deſign to invade the Realm, to ſubvert the
Government, to reſtore another Prince to the Throne by the aſſiſtance of
Foreign Force.</p>
                        <p>There was a Deſign to delude and impoſe upon a great many People,
and thoſe that would not be deluded into a belief by theſe fair Pretenſions
of Friendſhip, they were to be ſubdued by an Army of Foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Then, Gentlemen, the next Queſtion will be, how far the Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>
is affected by this Evidence, and whether you have ſufficient proof from
what has been offered, to ſatisfie you, that he is Guilty of this Treaſon or
no.</p>
                        <p>Firſt my Lord tells you, there has not been a clear proof that theſe are
the Papers that were taken; for (ſaith he) they have been conveyed from
hand to hand, and therefore poſſibly there might be ſome Alteration made
in them. You, Gentlemen, are to conſider, notwithſtanding this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
whether the Identity of the Paper be not proved.</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi>Billop</hi> tells you he took them, and in what manner; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
carried them to my Lord <hi>Nottingham,</hi> who laid them by for a little
while upon his Table, and Captain <hi>Billop</hi> withdrew (that is part of my
Lords Objection) while my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> examined my Lord <hi>Preſton:</hi>
after that, my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> called in <hi>Billop</hi> again, and <hi>Billop</hi>
ſwears the Pacquet was not opened, but remained intire in ſuch manner as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53228:38"/>
they were delivered to my Lord <hi>Nottingham;</hi> and ſo ſays my Lord <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham.</hi>
Then Captain <hi>Billop</hi> ſaw my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> open it at that
time, and he ſaw all theſe Papers every one put up again by my Lord <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham;</hi>
ſo that he could not be deceived: and my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
them to him, and he carried them to my Lord Preſident all ſealed
up with my Lord <hi>Nottingham's</hi> Seal: And my Lord Preſident tells you he
opened them, and brought them to the King, and had them back from the
King; but they were never out of his ſight while the King read ſome of
them, but he took them all and brought them to the Cabinet-Council,
where my Lord <hi>Sidney</hi> received all theſe Papers that have been read, and
marked them. You have my Lord <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Oath that theſe are the Papers
he had from my Lord Preſident; you have my Lord Preſidents Oath that
he had them from <hi>Billop</hi> ſealed with my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s Seal; you
have my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s Oath that he had them from <hi>Billop;</hi> and
<hi>Billop</hi> ſwears that they were taken in the Smack.</p>
                        <p>So that it is plain, if you believe this Evidence, that they are the ſame
Papers. Beſides, as to ſeveral of them, <hi>Billop</hi> marked them, and ſwears di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to them. If you believe theſe Witneſſes, as you have no reaſon, I
think, to the contrary; It is plainly proved theſe are the very Papers
which were taken from the Boſom of <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and taken up by him from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Quarter-Hatches in the Smack.</p>

                        <p>With humble Submiſſion, there is one thing that I think
the Jury ought to take notice of, That when the Papers were ſent from
Mr. <hi>Bridgman</hi> to my Lord <hi>Sidney,</hi> they were ſent by a Meſſenger.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>My Lord, you are miſtaken as to that Objection, for
my Lord <hi>Sidney</hi> did not ſend them to Mr. <hi>Bridgman</hi> by a Meſſenger, but
he delivered them with his own hand, and after he had ſet his own Mark
upon them; and Mr. <hi>Bridgeman</hi> ſays they were never out of his ſight, he
copied them all but two or three, the other Mr. <hi>Poultney</hi> copied in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and ſo he ſwears he redelivered them to my Lord <hi>Sidney.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>With humble ſubmiſſion, my Lord, if I remember right,
they were in a third hand.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>Never, never.</p>

                        <p>Did not my Lord <hi>Sidney</hi> ſay ſo, or Mr. <hi>Bridgman?</hi>

                        <p>No: neither my Lord <hi>Sidney,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Bridgman</hi> ſaid ſo;
I ſuppoſe the Jury are apprehenſive of the matter; I would not miſlead
them, I'll aſſure you, nor do your Lordſhip any manner of Injury in the

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>No, my Lord, I ſee it well enough that your Lordſhip
wou'd not; I am for my Life, and beg your Lordſhips pardon for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
of you.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>Gentlemen, the next thing is to conſider, Whether my
Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> be anſwerable for theſe Papers, or a Party in this Treaſon.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Gentlemen, I would have you to conſider that there was the hiring
of a Veſſel for <hi>France:</hi> It is true, my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> was not preſent at the
bargain; but you obſerve that my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> his Servant, <hi>Aſhton</hi> and
<hi>Elliot</hi> took Water at <hi>Surry-ſtairs</hi> on purpoſe to go on Board that Smack.</p>
                        <p>Now, Gentlemen, Whether or no you can intend any other ways than
that my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> was privy to the hiring of this Veſſel, though he was
not preſent at the hiring of it; for how ſhould my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> be ready to
take Water with them at <hi>Surry-ſtairs?</hi> Can you imagine my Lord came
there by chance, and took a ſuddain Reſolution? If you can imagine that he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53228:39"/>
came only to go on Shipboard without knowing the Previous Deſign,
truly you imagine a very great thing for my Lords advantage.</p>
                        <p>It is plain he went voluntary without Compulſion; truly, I think the
Evidence is very ſtrong to induce you to believe he was privy to this deſign,
and that he did know of hiring the Veſſel.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>I hope your Lordſhip will obſerve at the ſame time, that
I was never ſeen before we took Boat.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>My Lord I have obſerved it, and I lay that weight upon
the Evidence, that I think it will naturally bear, and no more; and leave it
to the Jury to conſider, whether your Lordſhip was privy to the Deſign or
no, when they weight the Circumſtances of the Evidence together.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>

Argument.</p>

                        <p>What weight the Evidence has they will conſider.</p>
                        <p>And then, Gentlemen, there is another thing that I would obſerve;
Why ſhould my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> a Noble Man, a Perſon of his Honour and
Quality, put himſelf in ſuch a place as he was found in, and that twice?
It muſt ſure be out of an Apprehenſion of ſome Danger As for the Seamen
they were ſecure enough; they were not frightned, becauſe they thought
they were protected, and my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> knew he was not lyable to be
Preſt; the Maſter of the Veſſel tells you they were fearful, and therefore
hid themſelves in a place they could not ſtand in, nor ſit in; there was the
the Gravel and Ballaſt, it was uneaſie to them, dangerous to their Health to
be there.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, why do Men avoid the light and put themſelves under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
unleſs they have ſome evil deſign? Perſons that are innocent ſeek not
obſcurity.</p>
                        <p>The Seals were found there, and my Lord does not deny they were
his Seals.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>I do not deny that, I hope it is no Crime to have ſuch
Seals.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>Ay, but ſays my Lord, that does not affect—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Papers were not found about me, but were found about <hi>Aſhton.</hi>
Gentlemen, if you can imagine my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> had a different Deſign from
the reſt of the Company that were with him, then you may acquit my
Lord, and find him Not Guilty. But it is left to you to conſider whether he
had not the ſame Deſign with them. Beſides there's mention made in one of
the Letters, <hi>My Lord,</hi> and there was no other Lord but he; and here are
Papers proved to be my Lord's own hand, containing ſeveral of the matters
of which he ſtands Indicted, and he would have had the Captain to have
diſpoſed of the Papers.</p>
                        <p>Now, Gentlemen, what account does my Lord give you where he was
going? it ſeems they did pretend at the time they were taken, and they
would have had the Maſter of the Veſſel ſaid, that their deſign was for
<hi>Flanders;</hi> but the Witneſſes tell you poſitively, That the Veſſell was
hired for <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Truly, Gentlemen, I muſt leave the matter to your Conſideration whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my Lord be Guilty of this Deſign or Not Guilty.</p>
                        <p>There is another thing that my Lord has urged (for I would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
omit any thing material on the one ſide or the other) he ſays his
Indictment is laid in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> but the Papers were not
taken there, the Ship they went on board lay at Anchor in <hi>Surrey;</hi> and
when they were taken it was in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> and ſo there is no
Proof of Treaſon in <hi>Middleſex.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="73" facs="tcp:53228:39"/>
Ay, but Gentlemen, give me leave to tell you, if you are ſatisfied upon
this Evidence, that my Lord was privy to this Deſign, contained in theſe
Papers, and was going with them into <hi>France,</hi> there to excite an Invaſion
of this Kingdom, to Depoſe the King and Queen, and make uſe of the
Papers to that end, then every ſtep he took, in order to it, is High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
where-ever he went; his taking Water at <hi>Surry-Stairs,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> will be as much High-Treaſon, as the going a Ship-board
in <hi>Surrey,</hi> or being found on Ship-board in <hi>Kent,</hi> where the Papers were
taken.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, I have failed of recollecting ſeveral of the Particulars of
the Evidence, becauſe they are many; and you will not depend upon my
Recollection of things ſo very incoherent as ſome Parts of the Evidence in
the Papers are, but upon your own Notes and Obſervations.</p>
                        <p>If you do think, having heard this Evidence, That my Lord was not
concerned in this Matter, That my Lord had no Deſign to go into <hi>France</hi>
with theſe Papers, but that he was an utter Stranger to all theſe things,
then you are to acquit my Lord. But if you believe my Lord was privy to,
and knew of the hiring of this Veſſel, and that he went to carry on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
conteined in theſe Papers; and that he wrote ſome of theſe Papers,
and with the others, he was acquainted, then you are to find him
guilty.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, if you pleaſe, I would obſerve one thing,
to the Jury.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Holt.</speaker>
                        <p>Ay, by all Means my Lord.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Pollexfen.</speaker>
                        <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I ſhall ſay but a few Words
to you, becauſe indeed my Lord has ſumm'd up the Evidence very fully,
for matter of Law: I am fully of Opinion there never was a more Black
nor Horrible Treaſon than is in this Plot that is now diſcovered; for I
think Engliſhmen have no greater Enemies than the French and the Papiſts,
and you ſee this is a Plot to bring in both; and therefore I think there was
never any thing of greater Conſequence to the Government and the Nation
than to have this Plot detected and puniſhed; tho' perhaps never any thing
was more improbable than this ſame Plot, that it ſhould ever take effect,
whatſoever they promiſed to themſelves, and their Deſire of having it
effected might perſwade them to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>But, Gentlemen, the thing that I would mention about the Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you now, is this; Here are three Papers that by three ſeveral Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
acquainted with my Lords Hand-writing, are teſtified, as they
believe to be his Hand-writing; if ſo, then there is an End of all, for
therein is a horrid deal of Treaſon conteined. If theſe Inſtructions, theſe
Memorandums, theſe Heads that were written down were my Lords, and
he did intend to go with theſe in a Voyage towards <hi>France,</hi> that will be
ſufficient of it ſelf, if there were nothing elſe in the Caſe, to maintain this
Indictment.</p>
                        <p>But, Gentlemen, you have in the reſt of the Papers, that were taken, a
great Character of the Bearer; that the Bearer had done great things;
that the Bearer could inform them fully of every thing; and there ſhould
be full and intire Confidence put in the Bearer, and a great many ſuch
Phraſes.</p>
                        <p>But, ſays my Lord, I was not the Bearer, it was Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
were found about; it does not appear directly who the Bearer was;
and they were not found about me.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="74" facs="tcp:53228:40"/>
Now, Gentlemen, pray let us look a little how this Evidence ſtands: Pray
where was this Bundle found? even upon the Gravel, where my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> lay; there was it found, and my Lord's own Seal with it.</p>
                        <p>How, in the Name of God, came my Lord's Seals to be found with other
Peoples Papers, if they did belong to any body elſe? How came they toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in that place? It may be he had a mind to leave his Seals behind him,
becauſe they would diſcover his Quality. But why ſhould my Lord <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>
have all this fear upon him? Why ſhould two Men go and take a Ship
for themſelves a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d two others; and when they come to take Boat, take in
my Lord and his Man, if they were not the two others that were deſigned?
and this to be done at Night in the Dark? Why ſhould my Lord be under
ſuch terrible Apprehenſions as to creep into a hole ſo unfit for one of his
Quality?</p>
                        <p>Why do you not hear from my Lord ſome good Account upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
my Lord and his Man were going to <hi>France?</hi> Or whether elſe my
Lord was really going? for ſomewhere or other it was plain he was going.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, no Man goes into an Enemies Country without ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
unleſs he go upon ſome ill Deſign: Fear ſeldom is without ſome Guilt;
and there appears, throughout the whole management of the Story, that
there was a great deal of Fear upon theſe Gentlemen.</p>
                        <p>Beſides afterwards, when he is taken, and the Letters taken with him in
the ſame Company, you hear what endeavours there were to ſuppreſs the
Truth, even by my Lord's deſiring, to have the Pacquet diſpoſed of; and
my Lords Man gave one of the Seamen half a Crown to ſay they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Flanders,</hi> not to <hi>France.</hi> I ſuppoſe the Man knew how unfit it was
to be known that they were going to <hi>France:</hi> And my Lords two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
ſpared for no Pains to get the Pacquet thrown over-board; tho' all
that my Lord ſaid was what great kindneſs he would do him when it lay
in his Power, if he would diſpoſe of the Pacquet; I ſuppoſe that is very
eaſily intelligible.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gentlemen, there is one thing which is mentioned in one of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Letters that I deſire particularly to obſerve to you, and that is all I
ſhall ſay to you; Here is a Letter in my hand that in divers places has ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
remarkable, it ſays,</hi> Your Daughter and I muſt ſtarve, if this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can make us: That the Party did net repine at all for having loſt all for
your ſake, which your favour had beſtowed. <hi>And in another place this Letter
doth ſay,</hi> Your Daughter grows very tall, and very pretty, as I am told. <hi>But
that which I chiefly mention it for, is, it's twice mentioned,</hi> My Lord will
tell you all my Condition, how I have been uſed; and I have told my Lord my
Condition: what I deſire of you, he thinks very Moderate.</p>
                        <p>And pray conſider and remember, that the firſt Article of my Lord's
Paper, that is taken to be under my Lord's own Hand, there is two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pound to the Lady <hi>D.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now if any body ſhould put theſe together, do they lack any great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
for? for my part I leave them to you.</p>
                        <p>Then in aother place, towards the end of the Letter, it is ſaid, <hi>Pray, Sir,
ask my Lord how I have been uſed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now this Letter being thus taken, and there is never a one of the reſt
that was a Lord, do you think any of the reſt was meant? I muſt leave it
to you.</p>
                        <p>If my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> had produced any Teſtimony to prove his own good
Carriage and Behaviour towards the preſent Government, it had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much for his advantage, and might have had great weight with you;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53228:40"/>
but when things appear only in this manner as they do now, I muſt leave
it to you.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, 'tis a Great Matter, and of great Moment; if thoſe that
Conſpire againſt the Kingdom, againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and againſt
the preſent Government, may do it with impunity, it will be worth the
conſidering what the Conſequence of that may be. Your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
require you to do Right and Juſtice on both ſides; and if you are
ſatisfied he is Not Guilty, you will find him ſo; if you are ſatisfied that he
is Guilty, you will find him ſo.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>My Lord, I only deſire the Jury may be informed that
I am a Proteſtant, that I was baptized in the Religion of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and have always lived in it, and hoped to dye in it. My Lord, 'tis
true, things have been urged with Severity againſt me that are a little hard
in making, that which I hope will amount to but a Preſumption, to be a
Proof; as in the caſe of the Letters that are written in a Cant, and my
Intention to go to <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe words in the Letter, where <hi>my Lord</hi>
the Bearer is named. But your Lordſhip obſerves, That that Letter is not
directed to any body, and that is full of Cant as well as all the reſt:
Why ſhould I be ſuppoſed to be the Bearer any more than either of
the others, and they were found about one of them? But, my Lord,
for the reaſon of my going beyond Sea, it was this; I deſigned to
go to <hi>Flanders</hi> or any place I could be driven to, and that ought
not to be wondred at; for really I who had lived quietly after the loſs of
my Places, upon this Revolution, and ſuffered great Inconveniences in my
Eſtate, and was retired to my own Houſe, with a Deſign to live a retired
life, was impriſoned twice in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and proclaimed a Traytor in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Market Town, without any Indictment; and my Impriſonment tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
greatly to the impairing my Health and my Fortune; all this made
me very uneaſie here: and, my Lord, I went under a fixed Reſolution to
go to <hi>Flanders</hi> or any place where I thought I could be quiet.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>

                        <p>My Lord, your Lordſhip ſhould have ſaid all theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for it is not the courſe to reply upon the Court; if you had had any
thing to ſay, you know we heard you out of Courſe, and I let you interrupt
me as much as you did think fit, though that has not been allowed at any
time before. But, my Lord, pray let me ſay one thing more: Suppoſe
your Lordſhip did think your ſelf hardly uſed, though I know not any
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53228:41"/>
reaſon you had to think ſo; yet your Lordſhip muſt remember it was in a

                        <p>No, my Lord, you give me no offence at all; but your
Lordſhip is not right in the courſe of Proceedings; I acquaint you with
it not by way of Reproof, but by way of Information.</p>

                        <speaker>Lord Preſton.</speaker>
                        <p>Then I hope the Gentlemen of the Jury will conſider,
that all that is alledged againſt me is but Preſumption; my Life and Fortune,
my Poſterity and Reputation, are all at ſtake; I leave all to the Jury's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
and the God of Heaven direct them.</p>

                        <p>If you go on thus to Reflect upon the Court, you will
make the Court to reflect upon you. The Jury hear how the Evidence
has been ſtated: I think it has been done very impartially, and without
any ſeverity to you: Why ſhould you think we would preſs the Evidence
further than it ought to go againſt you? You are a Stranger to moſt of us,
and I am ſure we do not deſire your Life; but ſtill we muſt take care that
Juſtice be done to the Government and the Kingdom, as well as to any
particular Perſon; and Evidence that is given muſt have its due weight
and Conſideration: If any one can deſign Innocently to go into <hi>France,</hi> at
this time of day, with ſuch Papers, and in ſuch a manner, that I leave to the
Jury's Conſideration.</p>

This is an Indictment of High Treaſon againſt <hi>John Aſhton,</hi> the Priſoner at

Traytor againſt their preſent Majeſties King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> his
Supreme and Natural Lord and Lady, not weighing the Duty of his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,

Intend to depoſe, and deprive the King and Queen, and to bring them to
Death and Deſtruction, and to ſubvert and alter the Government; and to
cauſe War and Rebellion within this Kingdom againſt their Majeſties; and to
bring theſe Intentions and Purpoſes to paſs, the Priſoner, with the reſt of

which were to inſtruct the <hi>French</hi> King, and other Enemies of the King
and Queen, of the number of their Majeſties Men of War, how they were Mann'd,

how the Caſtles and Forts of <hi>Portſmouth, Southſea,</hi> and <hi>Goſport</hi> were fortified,
and how they might be ſurpriſed by the King's Enemies, and of the Times,
Wayes and Means how they might invade the Kingdom, in order to depoſe

opened to you; and further to bring theſe Purpoſes, and Treaſonable Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

was to carry them ſecretly out of this Kingdom into <hi>France,</hi> with an intent
there to deliver theſe Inſtructions, and Memorandums, and Bills of Exchange
into the Hands of their Majeſties Enemies; and did hire a Boat to carry them
to the Ship, and did enter into it at St. <hi>Clements Danes,</hi> within your County,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53228:44"/>

is a War between the <hi>French</hi> King and our King and Queen, and that he and
his Subjects are Enemies to the King and Queen and their Subjects; and that
during this War, the Priſoner, together with the reſt that were before named,

                        <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the
Jury, The Priſoner at the Bar ſtands Indicted of a very heinous Offence, no
leſs than High-Treaſon, the greateſt Offence that can be committed againſt any
Humane Law. You have heard the Particulars in the Indictment read. I
will not trouble you with any Repetition, but go to open the Evidence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Steps that are obvious in the caſe. You have heard in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
the Deſign was to depoſe this King and Queen, which the Law expounds
to be to bring them to Death and Deſtruction: You have heard it was to
alter the Government, and cauſe a Rebellion in the Kingdom, and to bring in
Foreign Power; and theſe are laid to be the Heads of the Offences that the
Priſoner ſtands charged with.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Gentlemen, the firſt ſtep that was made in this matter was by the Priſoner
at the Bar; for there was one Mr. <hi>Burdett,</hi> which it ſeems had been one of
his Acquaintance, and had undertaken to bring him acquainted with a Perſon
that could furniſh him with a Ship; and in order to that, one Mrs. <hi>Pratt,</hi>
that had the management of the Smack which belonged to her Husband, ſhe,
by <hi>Burdett</hi>'s means was brought to <hi>Burdett</hi>'s Houſe, where met Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi>
the Priſoner at the Bar, and they had ſome Treaties about the hiring of a
Ship; the purpoſe declared by the Priſoner then was to hire a Ship to go to
any part of <hi>France,</hi> and he would give a conſiderable Reward for it; he ſaid
it was for himſelf and Three more. They did not come to any concluſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
hiring the Ship then; but there was an Appointment made to have the
Maſter of the Ship to meet with them at the <hi>Wonder</hi> Tavern in <hi>Ludgate-ſtreet,</hi>
and in order to that, <hi>Paſeley</hi> that is the Maſter, and the Woman came there,
and met with Mr. <hi>Aſhton;</hi> but becauſe Mr. <hi>Burdett</hi> was not there, they came
only to this propoſal, one Hundred and Fifty Pound was demanded for the
Hire of this Veſſel; but there being no concluſion then made, they thought it
better to do it at <hi>Burdett</hi>'s Houſe; and about a day after they came to Mr. <hi>Burdett</hi>'s,
and then it hapned that <hi>Ellyot,</hi> one of the Perſons that is Indicted, but not
one before you, came thither too; and at that time it was agreed to give one
Hundred Pound for the Hire of the Ship. Ninety Three Guineys were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
in Mrs <hi>Burdett</hi>'s Hands; and there was a Token paſt betwixt them by the
breaking of a Sixpence, one part whereof was to lye with Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and
the other with Mrs. <hi>Burdett;</hi> and whenever the Maſter of the Veſſel brought
back the broken piece of Sixpence that Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> had, then was ſhe to pay
the Money, that being the ſign that they had attained their Ends, and
were ſafely landed in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next ſtep they take, is this, They appoint to meet at the <hi>Seven Stars</hi>

in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> thither the Maſter of the Veſſel and the Woman were to
come, and that was near the time, that very day that they deſigned to go
dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and there was Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ellyot,</hi> but the other Perſon did
not appear as yet, there the Sea-men were Ordered to go along with them,
and thence they went down to the Water ſide, to <hi>Surrey Stairs,</hi> and the
Waterman was called, and in the mean time came my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> and his
Man to them, and they four did go in that Boat, by the Direction of the
Maſter, and were carryed on Board his Smack.</p>
                     <p>After they came on Board (for I would note the particular Circumſtances)
they were very apprehenſive of Danger, for they knew what they went about,
their own Guilt gave them Reaſon of Fear, and when they came near a Man
of War, which lay at Anchor in <hi>Long-Reach</hi> in the River, they deſired the
Maſter to hide them, that they might be ſafe from any Search, and they were
hid and put cloſe under the Hatches for ſome time; afterwards when they
came to another place of Danger, it was by the <hi>Block-Houſes</hi> at <hi>Graves-end,</hi>
(as they apprehended) there they deſired to be hid again, and ſo they were put
in that place where they were in very difficult Circumſtances under the
Hatches, and there they remained till a Pinnace, that had been ſent to enquire
after them, came and Boarded this ſame Veſſel.</p>
                     <p>Upon its Boarding of them, the Captain made a ſearch, and found theſe
Gentlemen, My Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ellyot,</hi> and I ſuppoſe his
Man alſo, all hid under the Hatches.</p>
                     <p>Then the next thing which is obſervable, Gentlemen, and the Great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that will ſhew where the Treaſon was, is this, there was a Bundle of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
that was on Board, ready prepared, if they had not been ſurprized, but
could have had an Opportunity for it, to have been caſt Over-Board, and there
was Lead fixt to it, to have ſunk it, and Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar,
was the Perſon that concealed this Bundle of Papers, betwixt his Body and
his Coat, and from thence it was taken by the Captain that took them.</p>
                     <p>When they were ſo taken, the Captain, according to his Duty, was bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Priſoners to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> they deſired to go on Shore at <hi>Graves-End,</hi>
but the Captain did not think that ſo fit, but carryed them on Board the
<hi>George Frigot,</hi> and then you will hear theſe Gentlemen did fall into a
Treaty with the Captain, to ſuppreſs theſe Papers, and one Inſtance I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
they did tell him, that ſince there were a parcel of Papers that he
had taken out of my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Pocket, he might take off the Lead and
fix it to thoſe Papers, and ſink the others; and what ſhould he have for it?
they promiſed him great Rewards, they told him he might be a Great Man,
he had an Opportunity of making his Fortune; and when that would not
do, they uſed many Threatnings to him, all which will appear in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Circumſtances that the Witneſſes will tell you of.</p>
                     <p>I come, Gentlemen, in the laſt place to ſhew you, That all the whole
Conſpiracy, all this Treaſon, did lye hid under this Bundle of Papers that
were taken from Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and ſo he might very well be afraid of having
them opened, for there you will find a formed Deſign, to alter this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by a <hi>French</hi> Power and Aſſiſtance; and they contain ſo many Particulars,
that in regard, I would not do the King's Evidence injury on the one hand,
nor the Priſoner on the other, I will forbear repeating the Particular Inſtances.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> You will have all the Letters and Papers Read, but in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
I muſt needs ſay, you will find it manifeſt, that there is a black and
wicked Conſpiracy to introduce a Foreign Power, to Eſtabliſh the Proteſtant
Religion, and that by a Popiſh Intereſt, and to ſettle our Laws, Liberties, and
Properties, by a <hi>French</hi> Army. And let them pretend what they will for
the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> when you hear theſe Papers read, no body will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53228:45"/>
it was to any other purpoſe, (if the Plot had taken Effect,) but to
have what Religion, what Laws, the <hi>French</hi> King had pleaſed to impoſe upon
us.</p>
                     <p>If the Priſoner be Guilty, Gentlemen, of theſe Matters, I know you will do
your Duty; but if he be not Guilty, God forbid that you ſhould find, him
Guilty.</p>

with Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> he hired the Veſſel; but firſt of all, he deſired us to

did meet there, and were there about an hour, or an hour and a half, and
Mr. <hi>Burdett</hi> did not come; and the next Morning, Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> deſired me to
meet him at Mr. <hi>Burdett's</hi> again; and the next Morning I met at Mr. <hi>Burdett's,</hi>

a 1000 l. is no great matter to the thing in Hand; for if I was minded to go
out of the Kingdom, it was neceſſary to uſe all Arguments I could, to perſuade
her to help me to go away.</p>

<hi>Aſhton</hi> nor <hi>Ellyot</hi> were either of them there; after a little while in came <hi>Aſhton,</hi>
and preſently after in came <hi>Ellyot,</hi> and he went up Stairs into the Bed-Chamber;
and being in the Bed-Chamber, they brought the Money out, rolled up in a half
ſheet of Paper, ſet up an edge, and told it out at the Window.</p>

                           <hi>Aſhton</hi> told the Money out; and after the Money was told, he pulled
out two pieces of a Six-pence, and when he had pulled out the two pieces of Six-pence,
he gives one half to this Mrs. <hi>Burdett,</hi> and the other half he kept himſelf;
and he bid her pay this ſame Money, when the other half Six-pence that <hi>Aſhton</hi>
kept came to this Woman, to match that which ſhe had; and after the Money
was told, we ſtayed but a ſmall while there, and came down Stairs; and when we
came down Stairs we went down to <hi>Billingsgate.</hi> I think <hi>John Fiſher</hi> was there,
and we carried away with us a Trunk and a Hamper; <hi>John Fiſher</hi> carryed the
Trunk, and another Man the Hamper; and after that we had carryed the things
on Board, I came up to the Houſe again; and after I came up to the Houſe, they
directed us to go to the Seven Stars in the little <hi>Piazza,</hi> there was a Note writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to direct us, which ordered us to go thither betwixt 10 and 11 at Night.
When we came there, I think there was neither of them there at preſent, but by
that time we had been there a ſmall ſpace, in they both came, and ſat down; and
a Gentleman came in and ſaid the Cock crowed; and therefore they ſhould have
no good luck. And then they talkt about Papers being toſſed in a Hat, I dont
know what, and in came two Gentlemen more, juſt before we went away, to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53228:47"/>
ſee them; and after thoſe Gentlemen had ſeen them, they ſtaid but a little while.
Says <hi>Ellyot</hi> to me, Maſter, come along with me; ſo I went along with him, and we
came to <hi>Surrey</hi> Stairs; and on the Corner on the left hand, there was an Ale-houſe.
He called the Waterman out of the Ale-houſe, and he bid me go before, and I went
down; and by the time that I had gotten down, the Waterman came and halled
his Wherry to, and I went in; and by that time I was gotten to the Stern,
down came <hi>Aſhby</hi> and <hi>Ellyot,</hi> and my Lord, and his Man.</p>

Wherry, and were ſeated, they bid the Waterman put off from Land, and ſo
we went through Bridge; and after we were through Bridge, we got on board
the Smack, and they got into the Cabin; and when they were got into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,
I called my Men, and bid them hale up the Anchor, and they did ſo; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be but little Wind, but that Tide we got below half-way Tree, and were
forc'd there to drop our Anchor, and ſtay till the next Morning: the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we weighed Anchor, and by that time it was Nine a Clock, we got to Long-Reach,
where lay the <hi>George</hi> Man of War, and there they hid.</p>

again, and remained afterwards in the Cabin, till we came almoſt to <hi>Graveſend:</hi> a
little before we came to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> they all hid again; and, when they were hid,
remained hid all, I think, but only <hi>Ellyot;</hi> I think, he popt up; and they were
reſolved to go eat their Victuals; but then I told them, there was a Barge a
coming, and ſo he went down again, and there they remained, till they were

Let me ſee it, ſays he: So I ſhew him my Protection, and he looks in it.
Well, ſays he, Maſter, I muſt look farther, and went to rights to the Place
where they lay, and found them lying all together. After they were taken, and
were come out, Captain <hi>Billop</hi> commanded them into his Boat, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

ſhoar at <hi>Hungerford</hi> Stairs; and when we came to <hi>Whitehall</hi> Bridge, the Gate was

                        <p>If it pleaſe your Lordſhip, I was going home from our Stairs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
7 or 8 a Clock in the Evening; that is, from <hi>Surrey-Stairs,</hi> and a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
called Sculler. Said I to him, Sir where do you go ſays he? As far as the
<hi>Tower,</hi> ſaid I. 'Tis againſt Tide, I cannot go; it will be ten a Clock before it
be high Water. Says he, will you go with us at that time? Said I, what will
you give me? Will you give me half a Crown? then i'll carry you down, for
I cannot ſtay out ſo late for nothing. Yes, ſays he, I will give it you. Then I
came and brought my Boat to the Shoar; he asked me then what my Name
was; I told him <hi>Charles Betſworth.</hi> Says he, will you be ſure to ſtay till we come?
Yes, ſaid I, if you will be ſure to come; and if I be not here, I will be at ſuch
a Houſe, an Ale-houſe, that was there by; the ſign of the <hi>Swan:</hi> So I ſtaid, and
carryed a Fare or two over the Water, and about 11 a Clock comes a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
down, and calls <hi>Charles;</hi> and I went out a doors down towards my Boat,
and there comes one Gentleman down, and a kind of a Seaman, as I thought;
and the Seaman went into the Stern, and the Gentleman ſate at the Back-board,
and there was three Gentlemen more came down the Stairs into the Boat; one
had a whitiſh Cloak, and the other a looſe Coat; and they brought a leather
Bag that would hold about a Peck; ſo I put off with them, and rowed down
the River, and all that I heard them ſay, was when we came under the
<hi>Temple;</hi> ſays one of the Gentlemen, when do you hear the King goes away?
Says another of them, he goes away a <hi>Tueſday;</hi> and when we got through Bridg,
one of the Gentlemen askt where the Veſſel lay, and the Man in the Stern
ſaid on <hi>Southwark</hi> ſide, over againſt the <hi>Tower,</hi> and when we came a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Battle-bridge</hi> near <hi>Pickle-Herring-Stairs,</hi> the Maſter ſaid, there lies the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53228:49"/>
and it had a long Pendant and a top Sail looſe; ſo they paid me before
they came on Board, and when they were got a Board, away rowed I; and
when I came to Land, and take out my Sculls and things, there I miſt my
Cloths; and I rowed after them, thinking they could not be got far; but when
I came to the place where they went on Board, the Veſſel was gone, and I
rowed down as low as <hi>Limehouſe-Reach,</hi> and in <hi>Black-Hall-Reach</hi> I overtook a
Veſſel, which I thought was the Veſſel. I askt them who they belonged to, and
they ſaid they came from <hi>Horſeliedown,</hi> and I made anſwer I brought two Fares
on Board a Veſſel at <hi>Pickle-Herring-Stairs;</hi> and had forgot to take my Cloths
that they had; they made anſwer, I brought no Fare on Board them, ſo I
rowed on farther beyond <hi>Barkinſhelf,</hi> and becauſe there was no Wind, I thought
none could have gone beyond that Place, and therefore reſolved to row back
again when it was Flood; and I rowed up to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> but could not meet
with the Veſſel; and I heard nothing of my Cloths, till laſt <hi>Friday</hi> was Seaven-night
I had my Cloths brought me.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, a matter of ſix Hours before they came on Board, my
Maſter carryed me a Shoar, and brought me to Mr. <hi>Burdett</hi>'s Houſe, and gave
me a Trunk, and I went with it, and another Man with a Hamper, and brought
them on Board; and about 11 or 12 a Clock, my Maſter comes and brings
Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and the other aboard; and he bid me go forward, and heave up the
Anchor, and ſo I did, and we went down the River; but we could go but a
little way becauſe there was no Wind; and when we came to <hi>Half-way-tree,</hi>
the Tide Turning, we were forced to caſt Anchor again, and ſtay till the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and in the Morning we weighed Anchor again about 8 a Clock, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
9 we came into <hi>Long-reach,</hi> where lay the <hi>George</hi> Man of War, and then
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53228:49"/>
Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and they hid; and when we came below them again, they came
up again till we came almoſt near the <hi>Block-Houſes</hi> at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and there
they hid again; and Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> I think came up afterwards, and bid me go
down to the Hamper, and fetch them up ſome Victuals for their Dinner, and
I went down and fetcht up ſome Beef, and Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> took hold of it; and I
took a Bottle of Wine or two out; and juſt before I brought all the Victuals up,
the Barge was ſpied a coming to us; and then he went down again: And there
they hid, and the piece of Beef was a top of them. Captain <hi>Billop,</hi> when
he came near, waved his Hat, to bid us lie by; and we did lie by, till he came
up to us; and when he came up to us, ſays he, Maſter, you have gotten a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of good likely Men, worth the coming on Board for, ſays the Maſter. I hope
Captain, you wont preſs them, ſays he. What have you to keep you clear, ſays
he? I have a Protection. Have you, ſays the Captain? Let me ſee it: So he
ſhewed him the Protection, and he read both our Names in it. Then, ſays he,
Maſter, I muſt look farther; and he went down to the Quarter Hatches, and
took them up, juſt where they lay. Firſt my Lord came out; and he ſearcht
them all, as they came out. Mr. <hi>Ellyot</hi> came out next, and Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> ſtay'd
within, being the laſt Man. And after he had ſearcht them, and done what he
pleaſed; he got all the Papers and Writings: then he commanded us all to go
into the Barge; and they came on Board the <hi>George</hi> Frigat in <hi>Long-Reach.</hi>
And at the Ship, Mr. <hi>Ellyot</hi> came to us; and bid us ſay, we were going for
<hi>Flanders.</hi> And after we came to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> gave me a half Crown

                        <p>My Lord, they came on Board about 11 or 12 a Clock at Night,
I was a ſleep in the Cabin, and heard a Boat coming on Board, and I turn'd out,
and before I could get out of the Cabin, they were got aboard, and I ſee no
Boat, nor nothing. So, ſays the Maſter, go forward and heave up the Anchor; and
after we had heaved up the Anchor, I goes into the Skip to tow the Veſſel down,
becauſe there was no Wind, and we would not let the Veſſel go foul on the Ships
that were in the River, and a little after we came on Board again; and when I
came on Board again, they were all on Board, all four. After that comes a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-man,
and I was at the Helm ſteering, and he called out to us! Oh hoe, ſays
he; did not I bring a Parcel of Gentlemen on Board this Smack? Not as I know
of, ſaid I, Says he, I carryed a Parcel of Gentlemen on Board ſome Smack, that
had a Pendant out, and I know not where it is; they carryed my Cloaths on
Board with them. Said I, I know nothing of it, nor I did not; for I ſaw neither
Water-man, nor Boat; ſo away the Waterman goes, and we went down the
River, and when we came to <hi>Half-way Tree,</hi> we came to Anchor, and my
Maſter went and laid himſelf down, the Tide being almoſt done, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Wind, and Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and they lay in the Cabin; and ſays Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>
to me, take care of us now, and we will take care of you hereafter; ſays he, we
ſhall help you to many a Freight, and many a Pound. Ay, ay, ſaid I, you will
be taken care of to be ſure at Day break, or when the Day comes on; about 8
a Clock, we hove up the Anchor again, and fell down as low as <hi>Long-Reach,</hi>
where the <hi>George</hi> Frigat lay; and when we came there, they went down to
hide in the quarter Hatches. I ſteered it down ſtill; and when we were got
paſt that Man of War, the Hatches were taken up, and they came up again
out of the Quarters, and ſate in the Cabin again, and we had a freſh Gale of
Wind, and run down to <hi>Graveſend</hi> quickly, and when we came near the Block-houſes,
ſaid I, we are almoſt at the Block-houſes; then ſaid they we will go
down again and hide a little; and ſo they did till they were paſt there, then
reſolving to go to Dinner.</p>

                        <p>After they were gotten up, and paſt <hi>Graveſend,</hi> this Man was ſent for
Victuals for them, and ſo he fetch'd them ſome Roaſt Beef, and ſome other things;
and juſt as the Roaſt Beef was going into the Cabin, ſaid I, <hi>Here comes a Barge off,
to preſs.</hi> So when I cried, The Barge was a coming, they took the Victuals down
into the Quarters, and there lay they, and the Victuals a top of them. And when
the Barge came near us, the Captain waved his Hat to command us to lie by.
Said I, <hi>We muſt lie by, for the Barge is coming up to us.</hi> And we clapp'd the Hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>-a-lee,
and lay by; and after we were laid by, the Barge came on Board us. Says
the Captain of the Barge, <hi>You have got a couple of likely, good Men, Maſter,</hi> ſaid he
<hi>Ay,</hi> ſays the Maſter; <hi>but I hope you won't preſs them.</hi> Says the Captain, <hi>Have
you got any thing to keep you clear? Yes, if it pleaſe you, noble Captain, I have
got a Protection. I am ſorry for that,</hi> ſays he, and comes on Board, for he ſtay'd
all this time in the Barge; and ſmiling upon him, he comes on Board, and, ſays
he, <hi>Come, let's ſee your Protection.</hi> And the Maſter ſhew'd it him, and he read
it. Says the Captain, <hi>I muſt look a little farther.</hi> And he goes into the Cabin,
and took up the Hatches, and there lay all theſe Gentlemen. They were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
longer a coming up than he would have had them; ſo ſays the Captain to
his Men in the Barge, <hi>Come on Board, and ſee who is here.</hi> And ſo ſome of his
Men did come on Board; and, to the beſt of my remembrance, my Lord was the
firſt Man that came up: And when my Lord came up, the Captain run his Hands
into his Coat-Pockets, to feel for Papers, as I ſuppoſe; and my Lord deſired the
Captain to be kind, and take nothing away. Says he, <hi>I'll take nothing but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
'tis Papers I look for:</hi> And he pull'd out a Watch, and gave it him again.
After that, <hi>Ellyot</hi> came out; and whether he found any thing upon Mr. <hi>Ellyot,</hi> or
no, I cannot tell. Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was the laſt that came up; and when he came up,
a Water-man of the Captain's calls to him, and ſays, <hi>That Gentleman that came up
laſt has put ſomething in his Boſom, but what I can't tell.</hi> So the Captain took
Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> by the Arm, and turn'd him about; and, ſays he, <hi>What did you put in
your Boſom?</hi> Says Mr. <hi>Aſhton, Nothing but my Handkerchief;</hi> and pull'd out
his Handkerchief, and ſhew'd him. Then the Captain put his Hand in, and pull'd
out Papers, with a piece of Lead tied to them. And that is all that I ſaw.</p>

to <hi>London.</hi> After we came up to <hi>London,</hi> they did not ſay any thing to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I was a rowing till then. It ſeems they did give them ſome Money, but
they gave me none, not till I came into <hi>Whitehall;</hi> and then my Lord's Man

                        <speaker>C. Billop.</speaker>
                        <p>The laſt of <hi>December,</hi> about Two-a-Clock, or between One and Two,
my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> came to me at one of the Doors of the Houſe of Lords, and
told me, his Father muſt ſpeak with me; and he carry'd me up to my Lord <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi>'s
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53228:51"/>
Chamber; and in a little time my Lord Preſident came there, and told me,
he heard there were divers Perſons that had Papers of dangerous Conſequence,
and were going to <hi>France,</hi> and deſired me to uſe my Skill for my ſeizing and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Papers. I began then to talk of what was proper for ſuch an Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
and I told my Lord, I thought the beſt way, was to go to <hi>Woolwich</hi> or
<hi>Dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ford,</hi> and to take a Man of War's Pinnace with us: Upon that, my Lord of
<hi>Danby</hi> being by, ſaid, he knew of a Boat that he could have, which was my Lord
Duke of <hi>Grafton</hi>'s; and my Lady Dutcheſs had lent it him, and he would go, and
get it ready: Upon this my Lord <hi>Preſident</hi> ſaid, he would give me a Note of
the Name of the Veſſel, and where ſhe went out; and likewiſe a Letter to another
Perſon, that would inſtruct me farther, and ſhew me the Veſſel; accordingly
my Lord Preſident gave me the Letter, and I went away to look for the Perſon,
but could not find him. My Lord <hi>Danby</hi> came to <hi>Tower-Wharf</hi> himſelf with the
Boat; and I left a Man there to bring me word, when the Boat came up at the
Place where I was; and Captain <hi>Stringer,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> came there to
me. After my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> had told me what I had in the Boat, I told him, I
thought there were not Arms enough; and therefore it were beſt to go to the Tower,
to borrow ſome Arms from thence: When we came to the Tower, my Lord <hi>Lucas</hi>
was not come in; and when I had ſtaid a little time, he did come in: And when
I had acquainted him with my buſineſs, he ſent for an Officer of the Guard, and
there we borrowed ſome Arms, a Blunderbuſs of his, and a Carbine, and the like;
and about Eleven-a-Clock, or ſomewhat paſt, we put off from Tower-Wharf.
It was calm, and we rowed down towards <hi>Graveſend;</hi> and we went aboard a
Veſſel or two, but was not willing to loſe much time, becauſe I was reſolved to
take them before they were gotten too far: So we rowed away for <hi>Graveſend,</hi>
where I refreſh'd my Men, and afterwards went down into the <hi>Hope;</hi> and I did
judge, that no Veſſel that could come from <hi>London</hi> that Tide could be a-head of
me. I went on board ſeveral Veſſels that lay in the River, in order unto the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Men; and I went on board all ſorts of Veſſels, becauſe I would give no
Suſpicion of what I was about; and having been on board of ſeveral, I preſſed two or
three <hi>Barkin</hi> Men; and one particularly, that knew all the Veſſels upon the
River; and I made him to row very near to me, that I might talk to him; I had
got the Names of a great many Smacks, and gave it out, that I would preſs a
Smack to carry for a Tender to my Ship, when the Fleet went out; and naming
this Smack that I was to go to ſearch, I told him, <hi>I heard ſuch a Smack ſailed
well, and I had Thoughts of preſſing her;</hi> he told me, <hi>She was old;</hi> but ſaid I, <hi>She
will ſerve a Summer well enough; and that is it I intend to preſs, if I can find her.</hi>
Says he, <hi>I'll ſhew you her, I know her when I ſee her;</hi> ſo we went on board ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Veſſels, as we went along. And as we were rowing along before, we came
to the <hi>Nest</hi> Point by <hi>Tilbury Fort,</hi> we ſaw ſeveral Smacks coming down the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and when we came about the Point, the headmoſt Smack of all, the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
lookt out, and ſaid, <hi>Yonder is the</hi> Thomas <hi>and</hi> Elizabeth. Then I called to
one of my Men to wave, and bring them to lie by, which they did, and they lay
by till I came on board. When I came on board, I ſaw two luſty Men ſtand by
the Maſter; ſaid I, <hi>Maſter, you have got two good luſty Fellows that would ſerve the
King; but I'll be kind and civil to you, I'll take but one.</hi> Says the Maſter, <hi>I hope
not ſo; for I have a Protection;</hi> and with that, I came on board, and took his
Protection in my Hand, and read it. As ſoon as I had read it, I ask'd him, if he
had no more Men upon Deck than what I ſaw. He ſaid, <hi>No; then,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I muſt
look a little farther.</hi> And I went into the Quarters, and took up the Scuttle,
and the Hatches, and I ſaw ſome Gentlemen lie. Oh, ſaid, I, <hi>What a pretty Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
is this? Where are we a going? Gentlemen, you muſt turn out.</hi> The firſt that
came to hand was my Lord <hi>Preſton;</hi> but I did not know him then, nor ſome time
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53228:52"/>
after I was in the Boat with him: So I took hold of him, and help'd him up; and
when he was up, ſaid I, Sir, <hi>I muſt ſearch you.</hi> Says he, <hi>I hope you will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from me. Nothing,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>but Papers:</hi> So I ſearch'd all his Pockets; and
as I found any Papers, I put them into my own Coat-pocket. And I took his
Watch, and pull'd it out, and gave it him again: After that I had ſearch'd him,
came up Mr <hi>Ellyot</hi> the firſt Man, and the next was Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> who crouded up
while <hi>Ellyot</hi> came up, in his Night-Cap. <hi>I think, Mr.</hi> Aſhton, <hi>you had your Night-Cap
on.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> goes down again, and puts on a Periwig, I think; but
coming up again, one of my Sea-men ſees him take ſomething, and put it into his
Boſom: He follows Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> quick, and pulls me by the Coat; and, ſays he,
<hi>That Gentleman has got ſomething in his Boſom:</hi> So I took hold of him, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him round; ſaid I, <hi>Mr.</hi> Aſhton, <hi>what have you got in your Boſom? Nothing,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>but a Handkercheif;</hi> and immediately he put his Hand into his Boſom,
and pluck'd out the Handkercheif, and ſhew'd me. As ſoon as he had pulled
out the Handkercheif, I put my Hand into his Boſom, and there I met with the
Pacquet that had the Lead affixed to't; and pulling it out, I clapp'd it into my
own Pocket; for I thought that was the Matter of Moment that I was to ſecure.
So I ordered them to go into the Boat, and the Maſter of the Veſſel to let go his
Anchor; and two Men I left in the Veſſel, whom I ordered to ſearch, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
what they found till farther Order; and I left two Muſquets with them.
And after we were in the Boat, they deſired to have ſomethings handed in, which
I gave Order for, a Hamper, and a Night-bag; and away we put off from the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
and rowed up; it was againſt Tide, and very cold Weather. In a little time
Mr. <hi>Ellyot</hi> called one of the Gentlemen, My Lord; then I whiſpered him, and
ask'd him who that Lord was, and he told me, <hi>It was my Lord</hi> Preſton. Then I
ſaluted my Lord; and my Lord was pleaſed to ſay, he was very well ſatisfied they
were fallen into the Hands of a Civil Gentleman. So rowing up againſt Tide,
and it being a Weſterly Wind, which blow'd very freſh, My Lord deſired that I
would let them ſtop at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> till the Tide turned, that they might refreſh
themſelves. I begged his Pardon, and ſaid, there was a Ship in <hi>Long Reach,</hi>
the <hi>George</hi>-Frigot, and we would ſtop there; and I did not doubt, but I would
command the great Cabin for his Accommodation; and there he might have any
thing that he wanted. My Lord ſeemed contented with it; but before we came
on Board the Man of War, there happened a great deal of Diſcourſe betwixt us of
ſeveral things.</p>

happened.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt. Billop.</speaker>
                        <p>Truly my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> being cold, and the Hamper ſtanding by,
ſays he, <hi>Captain</hi> Billop, <hi>we have not eaten, we will eat if you will.</hi> and there was
a piece of Bief at the top of the Hamper, and Bottles of Wine; and I opened
the Hamper, ſitting faireſt for it, and handed out the Beef, the Bread, and the
Bottles; and after we had eaten what we would, my Lord ordered the reſt to be
given to the Men that were the Boats Crew, and after we had done this, and
taken out a Bottle or two, and ſhut up the Hamper again, my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> drank
to me once or twice, and ſeem'd very well ſatisfy'd and pleas'd with his Uſage.
He told me he was ſenſible of my Civilities; and if ever it lay in his Power, he
would not forget me. So we drank again, and talk'd again; but before we came
to the Ship, My Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> told me, that if ever it lay in his Power, he would
be ſure to make an acknowledgment of the Civility I had ſhew'd him. And to
the beſt of my Memory, he had this Expreſſion, <hi>If there ever was any thing he
could ſerve me in, he would do it with all his Heart, if I would but diſpoſe of
the Packet.</hi>

                        <speaker>Capt. Billop.</speaker>
                        <p>My Lord, it was ſo many times over, and ſo much mixture
of Diſcourſe we had, that I am not able to tell the Particulars.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt. Billop.</speaker>
                        <p>I don't know that he uſed any more great Arguments, more than

                        <speaker>Capt. Billop.</speaker>
                        <p>He ſaid, 'twould do me no good to injure ſo many Gentlemen.
<hi>Prethee, Captain</hi> Billop, ſays he, <hi>throw it over-board.</hi>
                        </p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. S. Tremain.</speaker>
                        <p>What did he ſay farther?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt. Billop.</speaker>
                        <p>I'll tell you, if you'll give me leave. Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> did ſay, a little
after this, with a great deal of Inſinuation, <hi>Captain</hi> Billop, <hi>What if you ſhould
turn about, and go along with us? No, Mr.</hi> Aſhton, ſaid I, <hi>that I cannot do.</hi>
Says Mr. <hi>Ellyot, Prethee, throw the Packet over-board.</hi> This they did as we
came up the River; and 'tis the moſt that I can remember, till we came on
board the <hi>George;</hi> and when we came on board the <hi>George, Ellyot</hi> called me
into the Steerage, and deſired me, of all Love, that I would diſpoſe of the
Packet: And he ſaid, that now I had an Opportunity to make my ſelf as
rich, and as great, as I would, and no body could ſee it, if I did throw it away.
While I was in the Ship, Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> my Lord, and Mr. <hi>Ellyot,</hi> were with
me, in the Steerage. Said I, <hi>I ſhall be taken notice of, to be whiſpering; pray
forbear. Aſhton</hi> then ſpoke to me again, to deſire me to throw the Packet
over board; by this time the Victuals was handed in, and there we eat and
drank, and my Lord ſmoked a Pipe of Tobacco, before the Tide turned; and
when the Tide made, we went into the Boat again, and rowed up towards
<hi>London,</hi> and they were uſing theſe ſorts of Arguments over and over again.
And once Mr. <hi>Ellyot,</hi> I think 'twas, to the beſt of my remembrance, told
me, <hi>Now you have it in your Power to make your Fortune, and may be as great
a Man, and as rich a Man as you can deſire.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> ſaid ſome Words
ſomething to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Prethee,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>throw it over-board:
What Good will it do you?</hi> So I refuſing of it, as I did many times, Mr. <hi>Ellyot</hi>
told me, that I might take the Letters that were taken in my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s
Pocket, and tye the Lead to them, and throw the Packet over-board. No,
ſaid I, Mr. <hi>Ellyot, Sure, you would take the King's</hi> Council <hi>to be a very odd
ſort of Men, that they cannot find out ſuch a thing as this. Prethee, dear</hi>
Billop, ſaid he, <hi>throw it over-board.</hi> Many times whiſpering me in the
Ear; and ſo did Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> many times, ſaying, <hi>You may do us a great
Kindneſs in it.</hi> And we drank, and had ſeveral Intermiſſions; and they at
me again, and I denied them, and they deſiſted; and then they at it again:
And Mr. <hi>Ellyot</hi> then told me, <hi>Prethee, dear</hi> Billop, <hi>throw it over-board.</hi>
Said I, <hi>Mr.</hi> Ellyot, <hi>If I ſhould be ſo great a Villain to do ſuch a thing, if
ever it was your Day, would you truſt me again? Put it to be your own Caſe.</hi>
Says he, <hi>You have Gentlemen to deal withal. But,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I will never put it into
your Power.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ellyot</hi> ſeem'd to be angry at this, and ſaid, <hi>Every Dog had
his Day.</hi> Said I, <hi>I hope never to ſee it your day: But I pray, forbear this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53228:53"/>
Diſcourſe; let me beg that of you; for I do not deſire to be provoked to uſe
you otherwiſe than a Gentleman.</hi> And after that, they never urged me more
to throw the Packet over-board: But Mr. <hi>Ellyot</hi> was angry, and very much
diſturbed, and wiſhed a Thunderbolt might ſtrike the Boat, and ſink it. So
I brought them up, through <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> and they ſaid no more about the
Packet; but <hi>Ellyot</hi> wiſhed, that <hi>London-Bridge</hi> might have fallen on our
Heads. At length, I brought them to <hi>Whitehall;</hi> and I put my Man a-ſhore
at <hi>Hungerford</hi>-ſtairs, that he might get before, and give the Porter notice
at <hi>Whitehall-Bridge,</hi> that he might open the Gate. I brought my Lord
<hi>Preſton,</hi> and the reſt, to the Bridge; and while I was arming my Men, to
guard them up to my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s Office, I ſuppoſe they then took
the Opportunity to give the Men Money, getting near to them; I know
nothing of that: But I carried them up to my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s, and there
I delivered them, and the Packet to my Lord. After ſome time, the Packet
lay upon the Table, and my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> ſends me for my Lord <hi>Preſton.</hi>
When my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> came in, I withdrew without bidding, and the Packet
lay upon the Table, unopen'd: And when my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> came out, I went
in on my ſelf, and the Packet lay in the ſame Place and Poſture, and not open'd.
And I ſtay'd while Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was call'd in, and my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> ask'd
him a great many Queſtions.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. Aſhton.</speaker>
                        <p>Pray repeat thoſe Queſtions, Captain <hi>Billop;</hi> and what Anſwers
I made.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt. Billop.</speaker>
                        <p>Truly, my Memory does not ſerve me to remember all of
them, and I was in a very uneaſie Condition at that time, and would much
rather have been in my Bed, than any where elſe: For the Night before I
went down, I had a Plaſter of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Flies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ut to my Back, and they had
raiſed a great Bliſter, and it had not been dreſſed ſo long, that the Napkin that
was applied ſtuck ſo to it, that the Fleſh was jagged, and I was in a great deal
of Pain, ſo that I did not mind, ſo much as I ſhould have done at another time,
what was ſaid.</p>

                        <p>Then my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> ſent for Mr. <hi>Ellyot</hi> in, and ask'd
him whither he was going? And he ſaid, For <hi>Flanders.</hi> My Lord asked him,
what he was going there for? He ſaid, He was going to ſeek his Bread; he was
turned out of all at home, and he had rather go abroad to ſeek his Bread, than
ſtay at home to ſtarve.</p>

through Bridge againſt Tyde, my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> was with us; and when we
came to <hi>Tower Wharf</hi> there they went to the <hi>Tower</hi> for Arms, and we ſtayed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53228:55"/>
till Ebbing Water, and Rowed to <hi>Graves-end;</hi> and when we came to <hi>Graves-end</hi>
we went on Board ſeveral Ships, and I thought we were going a Preſſing; and
we ſtayed at <hi>Graves-end</hi> the time of the writing of a Letter, and then we went
both into the Boat again, and Rowed after a Smack that had gained of us, but
that not being the Smack we turned back again, and then it was high Water:
And when we came to the upper end of the <hi>Hope</hi> we ſaw ſeveral Smacks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and there was a Fiſher-man on Board that ſaid, that was the Smack the
Captain enquired after, that was coming down there; and when they came on
Board the Captain ſaid there were two or three brave Men, and he hoped he
could ſpare one of them; and the Maſter ſaid he hoped he would take none of
them becauſe they had a Protection, which he ſhewed to the Captain. Then
the Captain went in and bid me take ſome ſmall Arms and go on Board with
him, and told the Maſter he muſt look a little further; and the Boards were
taken up, and I ſaw a great piece of roaſt Beef, and under that my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Ellyot,</hi> and this Gentleman Mr. <hi>Aſhton:</hi> My Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> came up firſt,
and Mr. <hi>Ellyot</hi> next to him; and I ſee this Gentleman take up ſomething and
put it into his Boſom, and I told the Captain of it, and he asked him what it
was, and he ſaid nothing but his Handkerchief, and plucked out the Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;

                        <p>That was afterwards; but when the Captain asked him what he had
gotten in his Boſom, he pulled out his Handkerchief, and ſaid nothing but his
Handkerchief; but the Captain took the other Papers out of his Boſom and ſo I
went down and there were the Two Seals, and I took them up; and when I came
up <hi>Ellyot</hi> had a pair of Black Whiskers on, and he borrowed a pair of Sciſſers and
cut them off, and ſaid he ſhould remember me again if ever he lived, he ſhould
know me by my Tooth being out. And coming up into <hi>Long-reach, Ellyot</hi> was a
cold, and got to the Oar and Rowed, and ſaid you row as if you were Rowing
to Priſon; and he wiſhed that a Thunder Bolt might drop into the Boat, and
that <hi>London-bridge</hi> might drop down upon his Head. And when we came up to
<hi>Whitehall</hi> I ſtood a Guard over them.</p>

                        <p>Capt. <hi>Billop</hi> brought to me a Pacquet tyed about with a Packthread,
to which there was a Piece of a Leaden Pipe fixed, in which Pacquet there was
ſtuck in another Paper, I think there was but that one beſides the Cover, but
what it was particularly I do not remember, this Pacquet was laid upon the Table
while he was by; and I called in my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> not being willing to make
him ſtay, and after I had ſome Diſcourſe with my Lord to examine him what
Account he could give of theſe Proceedings; then I called in your ſelf Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi>
and Capt. <hi>Billop</hi> was by alſo, but the Pacquet ſo tyed with the Packthread I cut
open in <hi>Billop</hi>'s preſence with a Pair of Sciſſers; the ſame Papers that were in
that Pacquet, together with the little Paper that was ſtuck in, I tyed up, I am
ſure I ſealed them in a Sheet of Paper, and gave them back again to Capt. <hi>Billop</hi>
to carry them to my Lord Preſident.</p>

                        <p>The Papers that we now are going to read are theſe. Gentlemen,
here is a Letter of Recommendation in behalf of one Mr. <hi>Orbinet,</hi> which is a Name
they pretended of ſome Perſon that was at <hi>Paris,</hi> or to go there; and 'tis written
by one Mr. <hi>Dellivere</hi> to his Correſpondent there, and he tells him, the Bearer
had Something to diſcloſe to him, and that he might have an entire Confidence in
him: But the Letter of Recommendation alone, without a Sum of Money, they
reckoned would meet with a bad Welcome in <hi>France,</hi> and therefore they take 500 <hi>l.</hi>
with them, and here are Two Bills to pay it.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <stage>Then Mr. <hi>Humphrey Levermere</hi> was ſworn to interpret them, being in French,
(which he did) and read them as in the former Tryal.</stage>

of Ships in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to plague the City of <hi>London,</hi> how to manage this whole

called the Bearer; and it tells that he brings Papers with him, by which it is
plain, that you cannot imagine I could know any thing of theſe Papers. And
Gentlemen, it has not appeared by any Evidence that has been given, that I
knew any thing more, than that they were unfortunately found upon me: But

wherein my Lord is named, and called, my Lord the Bearer.</p>

                        <p>Pray my Lord, when that Letter was read on <hi>Saturday,</hi> how
was it conſtrued by the Court? How did they take it then?</p>

                        <p>We did take it then, becauſe my Lord was mentioned, that
he might poſſibly be the Bearer.</p>

                     <sp>

                        <p>It is very probable, and ſo it was underſtood then, that the
Lord mentioned in the Letters was my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> and ſo that my Lord was
the Bearer that could give an account of the Counteſſes Condition; and in the
beginning of thoſe Papers that are of my Lords Hand, there is mentioned ſo
much Money for the Lady <hi>D</hi>—which is my Lady <hi>Dorſet</hi> I ſuppoſe, that is
there meant, and that writ that Letter.</p>

naming my Lord, muſt be meant of my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> there being no other Lord
but he; and he likewiſe gave another reaſon, ſays he, they lay by my Lord's Seals

enforce it, that the ſame Man that ſaw me take them up, ſaw them lye by
the Seals, which were proved to be my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s, from whence your

                        <p>My Lord, upon the whole I have this to obſerve, firſt as to
my buſineſs of going into <hi>France,</hi> I muſt ingenuouſly own it, though I proteſt
to you I never own'd it nor named it to the Woman though ſhe had ſworn
it, but yet I do now. My deſign was to go to <hi>France,</hi> and I had very great
and good Reaſon for it, I think, I had endeavonred all ways I could in the
World to procure a Paſs to go to <hi>France,</hi> 'tis very well known, I did buſineſs
under Lieutenant-General <hi>Worden</hi> that died half a year ago, his Accounts are
now depending, and ſuch Accounts as may be prejudicial in ſome points to his
Family to whom I have always own'd and muſt a great Obligation, and
would be very glad upon all occaſions to ſerve it, and all the Branches of it;
this was not the whole nor the only deſign I had in going thither, but I had
likewiſe ſome buſineſs of my own, I have a conſiderable Sum of Money owing
me, if it be neceſſary to prove it, I can prove it by a Bond from a Perſon that is
there; a great Sum it is, a very conſiderable one to me at leaſt. And, my Lord,
I did think if I did not go my ſelf it was impoſſible for me to do any thing in
that Affair, and that was the true and only Reaſon of my deſign in going to
<hi>France,</hi> having been out of hopes of getting any other Convenience other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways;
this was not a Deſign juſt now formed, as if I were juſt now upon
ſome Plot concerning the Publick, but it has been my deſign ever ſince Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General
<hi>Worden</hi> died, and he upon his Death-bed ingaged me to do it;
and I once went down, hoping to have gone from <hi>Dover,</hi> and there I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
and taken. And, my Lord, I have uſed all manner of Endeavours
to go other ways, but they have always failed me, and this way I hoped
would have taken: my Lord, I do own I did hire the Boat, and I did pay
the Money, but with Submiſſion, I think that is not any manner of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Act, my Lord; perhaps it is an ill Act, but it does not amount in
leaſt to Treaſon going to the King's Enemies, ſuppoſe I went upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that is no manner of Treaſon in the World, carrying Papers to the
King's Enemies, except it be proved that I was privy to them, and knew
the Contents of them, if Lawyers inform me right, is not Treaſon; then what
remains? 'Tis true, I muſt own the Papers were found upon me, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53228:60"/>
there is no body that has heard the Evidence that has been given, but
muſt readily conclude that I found them in the place where the Sea-man ſays
I took them up; and beſides, my Lord, there is not any manner of proof ſo
much as aim'd at by the King's Council in all their Evidence, that I was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
to any one of theſe Papers; ſo that, my Lord, I think there is very little
proved upon me at all; I had the misfortune to be taken in this Company
that was going where theſe Papers were taken, it's true, but they have not
attempted to prove that I was privy to or knew any thing of them at all, nor
that I was more concern'd than that they were taken in my Stomach; this is
all I have to obſerve upon the whole; as to the buſineſs of the Indictment
there are great and grevious Aggravations in it, and ſuch as I am not able to
comprehend the meaning of, the Words confound me; and therefore I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
deſire your Lordſhip to tell me upon what Statute I am Indicted.</p>

                        <p>As to that of compaſſing the Death of the King and Queen, I
am ignorant of dealings in Law; but I conceive there are ſeveral Species of
Treaſon mentioned in that Act of the 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> III. and as to the imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Death of the King, that's only to be proved by ſome Overt Act: Now
I think nothing at all has been proved of any open Act conducing to prove
the imaginary or compaſſing the Death of the King or Queen, no manner
of Conſultation or Treaſonable Act at all, and therefore, my Lord, I do not
ſee that there is any great matter that is proved upon me, and I hope you are
of that Opinion too.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. Aſhton.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, I do mean <hi>Friday</hi> was Sevenight I was then a cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
I had not the opportunity or liberty of ſeeing any Chriſtian Soul, I
ſpake to him then, and told him, Mr. <hi>Bale,</hi> this is very ſhort notice; pray
be ſo kind as to move my Lord that I may have Council; truly he was Civil
enough, and ſaid, he would do all he could; ſays he, will you give me the
Names of your Council? ſo I gave him the Names of four, and of a Sollicitor;
but I never heard more of him in the matter: I did with all my Induſtry and
Skill give my Friends notice, but I was under great difficulty, for I had not
the liberty of Pen, Ink, nor Paper, nor a Man to ſend upon a Meſſage on
<hi>Saturday;</hi> I gave my Friends notice of it, upon <hi>Sunday,</hi> which was no very
good Day for buſineſs, they apply'd themſelves to my Lord <hi>Sidney,</hi> whoſe
Favour and Kindneſs I ſhall always own as long as I live, he gave me all the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53228:60"/>
diſpatch poſſible, and got me an Order to ſee my Wife that day, though it was
<hi>Sunday;</hi> the next day I made Application to have my Council come to me, that was
<hi>Monday,</hi> he with the ſame readineſs procured that, but it was <hi>Tueſday</hi> in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
before I could ſee any living Soul but my Wife and ſome of the Council that
I deſired would not readily come to me, and it was <hi>Wedneſday</hi> before I did ſee any
body of them, and ſo I had but <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday</hi> to conſult with them in.
On <hi>Friday</hi> I was brought here, and I endeavour'd to procure a Copy of the Pannel,
that I might inform my ſelf of the Characters of the Men that were to be my Jury;
and my Lord, I would deſire you to give me leave to clear one Point, which through
Inadvertency ſlipt from me about the time that I deſir'd to ſend to enquire about
the Jury. I did not mean as was apprehended, to ſend to them to take them off,
but I only meant to enquire after their Characters; this was done upon <hi>Friday;</hi> I
had not a Copy of the Pannel till laſt <hi>Friday,</hi> when we were Arraigned in Court,
it was Two of the Clock before the Pannel was given us, it was between Three
and Four when we came to <hi>Newgate;</hi> we were to come upon our Tryal the next
Morning by Eight of the Clock; ſo that before the Copies could be tranſcribed for
us, there were left but ſix Hours for us to enquire into the Morals of ſo many
Men, of whom ſome liv'd eight, ſome ten, ſome fifteen Miles out of Town; for my
part I was not able to enquire after any one, and that your Lordſhip may think by
my taking the firſt Twelve that appeared, and believing my ſelf Innocent of this
matter, I reſolved to put my ſelf upon my Tryal by any twelve indifferent
<hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men; I only beg if I have omitted any thing in reference to my ſelf, or
misbehaved my ſelf, with reſpect to the Bench, that you would pleaſe to ſet me
right, and conſider that I ſtand here for my Life; and to grant me your Pardon
for any thing wherein I have offended your Lordſhips, to whom, and to the Jury,
I refer my Cauſe; only I beg leave to call two or three Witneſſes, I know it hath
been allowed before in ſuch caſes, to give ſome ſhort account of my Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
becauſe it hath been reflected upon me that I was a Papiſt, becauſe I
deſigned to go into <hi>France;</hi> but I believe there is not any Man, whoſe Devotion
to the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, is greater than mine hath been, or
to whom that Religion is Dearer than to my ſelf.</p>

                        <p>I ſuppoſe, my Lord, that he calls me in as a Witneſs to his
Religion, and to his Morality, I think ſo; with my Lord's Permiſſion I will give
the trueſt Teſtimony I can: I have known him ſome time, he uſed to be frequently
at the Service of the Church in the Proteſtant part of the Family, at St. <hi>James</hi>'s,
where I was Chaplain; during the time I was there, I obſerved him to be a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Receiver of the Holy Communion; and as far as I could obſerve, lived
anſwerable to what he profeſſed to be, a Sincere Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and a Serious Chriſtian for his Sincerity and Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion: I
can give this Inſtance, he had an Aunt that had a Relation to that Family, one
Mrs. <hi>Du-pee,</hi> whom he thought did warp a little towards Popery, and he deſired
me, about five Years ago, to have recourſe to her, and deſired to know if ſhe
were diſſatisfied with any Point of Religion in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with which ſhe lived viſibly, and I would do my endeavour to ſatisfie her,
as I do not doubt but I could. She was deſirous to know who was the Perſon
that ſent me: I told her I came of my own Head in the greateſt part; but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
the Interpoſition of Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> for ſeveral Reaſons, and told her, I had
great Suſpition of her inclining the other way; and I had great reaſon for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of her Husband, who was a Papiſt, and the great Reſort of Popiſh Prieſts
to their Lodgings. She told me then, ſhe was ſatisfied in every thing, and if ſhe
had any Diſſatisfaction ſhe would ſend for me and give me an account. Some
Months after I came to St. <hi>James</hi>'s to wait, and obſerving her to be abſent more
than uſually before, from Prayers in the Chappel, I went to her, and asked her the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53228:61"/>
reaſon: She told me, it was becauſe ſhe was making ſome Linnen for her Maſter
King <hi>James,</hi> which was to be made in haſte: But ſhe then deſign'd to go for
<hi>Flanders</hi> quickly; and Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> about that time, or two or three days after,
told me his Aunt was gone to <hi>France,</hi> and ſpoke it with very great concern, and
that he believed, under the Pretence of calling over her Younger Son, ſhe was
gone to declare her ſelf a Papiſt, and he was very much troubled at it. This I
know for his Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion.</p>

                        <p>My Lord, I waited upon Major Gen. <hi>Worden</hi> when he was Sick,

                        <p>He has Sworn it, my Lord, that I did ſo, but as I hope for Salvation, if I
were to dye immediately, I do not know that I ſpoke to him of any ſuch thing; how
was it poſſible that I ſhould prevail with him? or how was it likely that I ſhould
force him to go along with us, when he had about twelve or fourteen Men with
him Armed, and we unarm'd?</p>

                        <p>Then, Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> there's another thing which you open'd, which I
would have you prove; you ſay you were to go into <hi>France</hi> upon the Affairs of
Col. <hi>Worden</hi>'s Family; firſt you ſay Col. <hi>Worden</hi> had a great account to make up;
how will you make that out?</p>

                        <p>My Lord, if your Lordſhip pleaſe, I will prove here in Court, though
it is a ſort of ſurprize upon me; that there is a great Account depending, I believe
I may appeal to Mr. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> himſelf, who knows that there is a Petition in the
Houſe of Commons, now depending, from the Queens Tradeſmen and Debtors,
whom ſhe owed 68000 <hi>l.</hi> ſhe did Aſſign the Arrears of ſome growing Rents for
the Satisfaction of this Debt; but the King and Government have not thought fit to
let it be applied to her uſe, or to the paying of thoſe Debts ſhe aſſign'd it to. Nay
it has gone further, I can appeal to ſeveral Perſons, there is one Man by chance in
the Court, that I believe does know that I promiſed and engaged, and actually have
paid a great part of this Debt; for believing that the Money was good upon the
Aſſignment, I have actually paid ſome of theſe Men out of my own Pocket, and
perhaps more than became me to venture; I think it may very well call my Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into queſtion.</p>

Lord Chief Juſtice, after he has ſummed up the Evidence. There's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing that I would put you in mind of, that you may give an Anſwer
to it. Captain <hi>Billop</hi> ſwears before the Papers were found upon you (and
it ſeems to ſtick upon you) when he was informed by the Sea-men, that you
had put ſomething in your Boſom, and he ask'd you what it was, you
ſaid nothing but your Handkerchief? Now, if you knew not what was in
the Papers, how came you to deny you had any thing in your Boſom?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. Aſhton,</speaker>
                        <p>For the ſame Reaſon that I would have endeavoured to
have had them thrown over-board, out of kindneſs to the Perſon with
whom I hapned to be taken.</p>

                        <p>Conſider Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> what a ſtrange many of things
you run upon: Firſt, you would have it believed, That you had a mind
to go into <hi>France</hi> upon your own account.</p>

after; and, that is the thing we would have prevail, and I hope ſhall
in all Caſes: If you are not Guilty, we hope it will prevail of your ſide,
if you are guilty we hope it will prevail on the other ſide. Now how
likely is it that you ſhould get into this ſame Company by chance without
a Previous Agreement; you ſent ſomething from <hi>Burdet</hi>'s, a Hamper and a

                        <p>Yes, the Leather Bag, I believe, but another thing is this,
That if it be poſſible you will do well to give an anſwer to, why did
you enquire for a hiding Place? Why did you ask the Maſter of the Ship
whether there was a convenient Place to hide in?</p>

actually had Paſſes, and were going to <hi>Flanders,</hi> yet were ſtopp'd and
brought to Town again. I believe my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> has bail'd many a

I cannot ſay in my own Name, becauſe I was ſure before hand,

                        <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of
the Jury: It falls out to be my Duty to Sum up the Evidence that has been
given, I opened the Cauſe at the beginning to you, and I opened it at large,
and many Particulars there were mentioned, and truly, I do not think
we have failed in the Proof of any one; I know you are Men of that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
that I need not, nor ſhall take upon me to repeat all the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Circumſtances, but as near as I can, I ſhall touch upon the Heads of
the Evidence, and do it with as equal regard to my Duty, and as much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
to the Priſoner as any one can do.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, In the Firſt place, you ſee what the Indictment is for; 'tis for a
High-Treaſon of a very Great Nature, no leſs then the Depoſing the King
and Queen and Subverting this Government, and that by a <hi>French</hi> Power
and Intereſt: If Inviting an Invaſion, and giving an Account of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and where the Strength of the Government lay, carrying Papers to Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite
the <hi>French</hi> to come and to incite this Nation into Rebellion, that ſo
they might depoſe this King, and ſet up the late King <hi>James</hi> again. If theſe
be High-Treaſon, as doubtleſs they are, then Gentlemen, how far forth
the Priſoner at the Bar had a ſhare in it, I muſt refer to you from what we
have proved.</p>
                        <p>He is the Man, it ſeems, that made the firſt ſtep, for you may remember
it was proved that he met this Woman at <hi>Burdet's</hi> in the City, for the hiring
of this Ship, and after Two or Three Meetings more, they come to a
Concluſion, and 93 Guinies and Six Pence are depoſited to make up a
100 <hi>l.</hi> which was the Price agreed upon, and that was actually paid by
Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> this is Sworn to be ſo.</p>
                        <p>The next thing is, to what purpoſe this Money was paid, and the Ship hired,
that is directly Sworn, it was to carry Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and Two or Three
more of his Friends, not naming of them, and they were to go to <hi>France,</hi>
one of the Witneſſes ſays, to any Port in <hi>France,</hi> it was not directly declared
to what Part. This I ſay was the purpoſe, for which the Money was paid,
and the Veſſel hired, and this was to carry you Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and Two or
Three more Friends of his into <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is true, Mr. <hi>Ellyott</hi> afterwards did meet Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and I think was
by at the Bargain making, or at leaſtwiſe, when the Money is paid, I
will not be poſitive in that, becauſe I would do him no wrong, he being to
make his Defence hereafter.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. Aſhton,</speaker>
                        <p>No, he was not by, I made the Bargain my ſelf.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mr. S. Thompſon.</speaker>
                        <p>Then afterwards I remember one Circumſtance when he
hired this Ship, he was to hire a Ship that had a Place to hide in, and ſo
he muſt needs know upon what Deſign, I ſay, by that he muſt needs know,
that there was a Matter of great Moment which he was to tranſact, for he
was to have ſuch a Ship as he might hide in.</p>
                        <p>After this Ship was hired then they met in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and there they
take Order with the Man to go down with them to the Stairs, where the
Water-men was called, indeed Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> did part from them in the
Way, but preſently after came to them at the Stairs, and there
came my Lord <hi>Preston</hi> and his Man, who together with <hi>Ellyott,</hi> that was
there before, I think before, all Embark't in the Boat, and were carried to
the Ship, and made all the haſt away they could for <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When they were there, and came to a Place of Danger, near a Ship of
War, there was care taken, according as they had enquired of the Maſter
of the Ship before, that they ſhould be hid, and hid they were.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards, when they were paſt that Danger, when they came to the
Block-Houſe at <hi>Graves-end,</hi> there they thought fit to hide again, and did ſo,
and there they concealed themſelves, till they were ſurprized in that Place
by Captain <hi>Billop.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="120" facs="tcp:53228:64"/>
My Lord, after ſuch time as Captain <hi>Billop</hi> had ſurprized them, he tells
you, how he came down after this Smack, you ſee what happened; my
Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> firſt came up, and after he had Search'd my Lord <hi>Preston, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyott</hi>
came up and he was ſearcht, and after Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was once come up,
he went down to fetch his Hat, and there was ſeen to take up this Bundel
of Papers, and there the Papers upon ſearch were found in Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>'s
Breaſt.</p>
                        <p>This being ſo found in his Breaſt, you have heard what applications were
made by this Gentleman, to get theſe Papers caſt Over-board, and what
Promiſes were made to the Captain, and what likelihood there was of making
his Fortune, if he would go along with them or throw away the Pacquet.</p>
                        <p>You hear, Gentlemen, that after they came to <hi>White-hall,</hi> one of the Men
Swear, that this Gentleman gave them Money, that they ſhould ſay, they
were not hired for <hi>France;</hi> but for <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe, Gentlemen, are the ſeveral Circumſtances that do appear in this
Caſe, which ſhew the mighty care and dilligence that was uſed to get thoſe
Papers ſuppreſſed that had been thus taken, or to get them again into their
own Cuſtody, and that is a Matter that ſhews how far this Gentleman was
concerned in this Deſign, and taking all theſe things together, I think
there can no greater Evidence be given, that Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
that he was concerned in the Meſſage, that he was to be ſent, and
all this buſineſs that was thus to be done, was as much Guilty, as my Lord
<hi>Preſton,</hi> who now ſtands convicted for it.</p>
                        <p>And the Court will tell you, Gentlemen, there are no acceſſorys, in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
all are Principals, though it be not actually proved, that this Gentleman
did not know all theſe Papers what they were, yet in Caſe he hired a Ship

                        <p>The next thing is this, that is to be conſidered, that after
ſuch time as theſe Papers came to be laid open, what is it that appear among
them? Truly I ſhall not take upon me to repeat ſo much as the ſubſtance,
much leſs the Particulars of the ſeveral Papers, but, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> muſt ſay, that there
does appear to be a Formed Deſign of Subverting the Government, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
this King and Queen, and of bringing us all into War and Rebellion
and Blood-ſhed, all this under a pretence of Eſtabliſhing the Proteſtant
Religion, and our Legal Government again (tho I can ſee no means they
had to depend upon for it) but by a Popiſh Intereſt and a <hi>French</hi> Power, and
how far that is poſſible or probable to promote ſuch an end by ſuch means,
I leave to your conſideration.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, you have heard all the Particular Papers read, here was the
Reſolution of a Conſult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Conference, where this Project was deſigned,
here were Heads of a Declaration, that was to be framed to make the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
believe, what mighty things ſhould be done upon their New Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you ſee, what Letters have been produced, and cannot but eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
what is the Import and Meaning of them. I reſolve, as I ſaid, not
to mention the Particulars, but there is ſcarce One Line among them, but
what is Treaſon, for it all tends to this Purpoſe and Deſign, to depoſe the
King and alter the Preſent Government.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="121" facs="tcp:53228:64"/>
Now upon the whole Matter, Gentlemen what this Gentleman has ſaid,
I confeſs to me ſeems ſtrange, he ſaid indeed at firſt, that he had no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at all, or that which was very weak, and ſo it ſhould ſeem, the Truth
was, for you ſee what his Defence has been.</p>
                        <p>He ſays, that he went into <hi>France,</hi> that he owns that he was going thither,
but what was it to do, it was to ſettle ſome Accounts with the Family of
Collonel <hi>Worden,</hi> and to receive a Sum of Money that was owing to him
by a Perſon there.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, if the Deſign had ſo much Innocency in it, certainly he might
have had a Paſs, at leaſt, there was no need of hiring a Veſſel at ſuch an
extravagant rate, there was no neceſſity of hiding in this ſecret manner, and
no neceſſity of impoſſible ſuggeſtions, and prefering Great Rewards for the
diſpoſing of, and concealing, theſe Papers.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, You will remember many Particulars more, which have
not ſlipt your Obſervation, I ſhall not take upon me to repeat them, but
leave them to your conſideration.</p>
                        <p>Only this, I muſt ſay, That this is a Treaſon of a very high Nature, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to depoſe a King that has ventured all he had, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> his Life has been
in Danger, and his Blood has been ſpilt to Eſtabliſh this Government, and
our Religion, and our Laws, and yet it ſeems there are Men that think this
may be better done by a Popiſh Intereſt and <hi>French</hi> Power, which I think
no body of either Wiſdom or Honeſty can imagin, or will engage in, and
therefore I leave it to your determination.</p>

                        <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you underſtand, that Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>
is now Tryed for High Treaſon, it is mentioned in the Indictment, to be
for Conſpiring the Death, and Depoſing of the King and Queen, and for
that purpoſe, he did endeavour to go into <hi>France,</hi> and to carry divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
in Writing, and ſeveral Memorials to ſhew how this Kingdom might
be Invaded by the <hi>French.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To prove this, the Evidence that has been produced and given by the
King's Council has been long, and conſiſts of Two Parts, Witneſſes, <hi>Viva
Voce,</hi> that have told you how Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> deſigned a Voyage to <hi>France,</hi> and
that he hired a Ship for that purpoſe, and ſeveral Papers were taken out of
his Boſom.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place, the Witneſſes tell you, that about the latter end of
<hi>December</hi> laſt, Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ellyott</hi> came to <hi>Bardett</hi>'s Houſe, where
they met with Mrs. <hi>Pratt,</hi> and <hi>Burdett</hi> having before that ſpoken to her about
a Smack that ſhe called the <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then there was a Meeting appointed between her and Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> at the
<hi>Wonder</hi> Tavern, where they did Treat and Debate about the hire of it,
afterwards they came back to <hi>Burdett</hi>'s again, and there the Agreement
was made betwixt the Woman and Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, to
have a Hundred Pounds. Ninety Three Guinies and Six Pence was fetcht
down by Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> and told out, and depoſited in the Hands of Mrs. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dett,</hi>
then there was a Six Pence broken, and one part Mrs. <hi>Burdett</hi> had,
and the other part Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> had, and when either the Maſter or Miſtreſs
<hi>Pratt</hi> ſhould bring the part of the Six Pence that Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> kept, to Mrs.
<hi>Burdett,</hi> the Hundred Pounds was to be paid.</p>
                        <p>And this Agreement being made, 'tis poſſitively Sworn, that they did
ask, whether there was a Hiding Place in the Veſſel? an Anſwer was made,
There was one, and thereupon a Note was given, that the Maſter and Miſtreſs
<hi>Pratt</hi> ſhould go to the Seven-Stars in <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="122" facs="tcp:53228:65"/>
Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night, they went there according to the Direction,
where meets <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Ellyott,</hi> but before that, there was a Boat hired at
<hi>Surrey-Stairs</hi> to carry them down to the Ship through Bridge, over-againſt
the <hi>Tower,</hi> but the Tide not ſerving till about Ten a Clock at Night, they
had agreed with a Water man for Half a Crown to carry them, and he was
to ſtay till the Tide ſerved. And when they went out from <hi>Rigby's</hi> they
parted, <hi>Ellyott</hi> and the Maſter went together, Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> did not go with
them, but came near about the ſame time to <hi>Surrey-Stairs,</hi> where they
took Water.</p>
                        <p>Being aboard, it was obſerved that all theſe Gentlemen were very time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and ſeemed to be much frighted at the ſight of any Veſſel, from
which there was any apprehenſion of their being taken notice of; and,
therefore they went down under the Quarter-Hatches, which is a Place very
inconvenient for ſuch Perſons, where none could ſtand or ſit upright, but
they were forced to lye upon the Boards, or upon the Balla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems ſome intimation was given that ſome Gentlemen had an intention
to go into <hi>France</hi> to proſecute ſome Treaſonable Deſign; And Captain
<hi>Billop</hi> being employed to purſue them, which he did in a Pinnace, when
he came near the Veſſel where they were, he called to the Veſſel, and
under pretence of Preſſing Sea-men, he went on Board; The Maſter of
the Veſſel ſaid he had a Protection from the Admiralty; ſo that there was
no cauſe for them to fear preſſing, nor indeed was there any for Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to fear it, they being not lyable to be preſſed.</p>
                        <p>When the Captain came near the Ship, and declared his intent of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on board, theſe Gentlemen were gone under the Quarter-Hatches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
Captain <hi>Billop</hi> coming on board, and ſpeaking about preſſing of the Men,
and ſaying, there was a Couple that would make good Sea-men for the
King; the Maſter ſhewed his Protection, and then the Captain ſaid he
would ſearch further in the Ship, and ſo he did, and then he pulls up the
Boards, and there he finds all theſe Gentlemen, who were called up one
after another, and ſearcht by the Captain.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, There is one of the Witneſſes tells you, that when they were
come up, he ſaw a Pacquet that lay in this very place under the Quarter-Hatches,
unto which was tyed a peice of Lead, which Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> takes up
and puts in his Boſom, with which the Captain being acquainted. Inquiry
is made by him, what Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> had there? Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> ſaid it was his
Handkerchief, and nothing but that which he pulled out: But Captain
<hi>Billop</hi> puts his hand in his Boſom between his Coat and his Body, and
takes out the Pacquet, and carried theſe Gentlemen on Board the <hi>George</hi>
Frigat, where they ſtayed till the Tyde ſerved to bring them to <hi>White-hall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But before they came on board the Frigat, Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was very importunate
with him to throw this Pacquet into the Water; when they were on board
the <hi>George</hi> Frigat, and in the Cabin alone, they continue their importunity.
Now, ſay they, we have you here, and you are alone, pray will you
throw this Pacquet over-board; and particularly, Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> ſaid it would

                           <pb n="123" facs="tcp:53228:65"/>
Truly, Gentlemen, my Memory will not ſerve me to repeat all the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
but I queſtion not your Notes will bring them to your Minds. Mr.
<hi>Ellyott,</hi> it ſeems, was ſo mightily concerned at their being taken with theſe
Papers, that when they ſhot <hi>London-bridge,</hi> he wiſht the Bridge might
have fallen upon them and knockt them on the Head; and, when they
were got through, he wiſht a Thunder-bolt would fall down into the
Boat and ſink them: That, indeed, was Mr. <hi>Ellyott,</hi> and not Mr. <hi>Aſhton;</hi>
but Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was as much concerned about diſpoſing of the Pacquet as
Mr. <hi>Ellyott.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At <hi>White-hall</hi> this Pacquet is opened, and you have ſeveral Papers
produced in Evidence and read to you, you have heard what Evidence
has been given, that theſe are the very Papers that were in the Pacquet
thus taken.</p>
                        <p>Firſt of all Captain <hi>Billop</hi> tells you he carried them to my Lord <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and that they lay there in his Office; he withdraw indeed while my
Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> examined my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> but the Pacquet was not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in the interim, but there was only a Paper ſtuck on the out-ſide
that my Lord had taken off before the Captain returned into the Room,
and there the Pacquet remained intire. He ſays, my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi>
opened the Pacquet and put up all the Papers that were in the Pacquet
in his preſence into a Cover again, and ſealed them up with his Seal. My
Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> ſays poſitively, he did put up all the Papers that were in
the Pacquet again, all and no more, except the Cover, and that he ſealed up
and delivered it to Captain <hi>Billop.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Captain <hi>Billop</hi> ſays, he took theſe very Papers from my Lord <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
and as he received them, carried them without opening to my Lord
Preſident.</p>
                        <p>My Lord Preſident ſays; he lockt them up unopened in a cloſe Cabinet
in his Cloſet-room, where no body comes; there they were that Night,
and the next Day he carried them intire to the King, and ſome of them
were read by the King, in the Preſence of my Lord Preſident; and, they
were all taken away again by his Lordſhip, no more nor no leſs; and, my
Lord Preſident brought them all to the Cabinet-Council, where they
were read, and were delivered to my Lord <hi>Sidney.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My Lord <hi>Sydney</hi> ſwears, theſe Papers now produced, are the ſame Papers
he had from my Lord Preſident, and my Lord Preſident ſwears, that they
are the ſame he received by <hi>Billop</hi> from my Lord <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and my
Lord <hi>Sydney</hi> markt them.</p>
                        <p>So that there can remain no doubt of theſe being the ſame Papers, that
were contained in the Pacquet, that was taken out of the Boſom of
Mr. <hi>Aſhton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then, as to the Matter of the Papers, I think it is plain beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
that the Import of them is Treaſonable: They ſhew a Deſign
of invading the Kingdom by a Foreign Force, and of Depoſing the King
and Queen from the Government, and of ſetting the late King upon
the Throne.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:53228:66"/>
It is agreed, as it is mentioned, at a Conference, between ſeveral Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Gentlemen, that were of the Whigg and Tory Party, as they
call them, that the late King was to be reſtored, though by a <hi>French</hi>
Power.</p>
                        <p>It was impoſſible for them to effect it, by going plainly to work, and
ſaying in plain Words, the <hi>French</hi> ſhould invade us. It was to be done in
this manner.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>French</hi> King muſt pretend by all means to be our Friend and a
Mediator, betwixt the late King and the People of <hi>England,</hi> and this was
out of deſign, plainly to get a Party of the Kingdom, to joyn with them;
the moſt credulous and inconſiderate ſort of People; who when they
ſhould be ſeduced into a Belief of the <hi>French</hi> King's great Kindneſs. It
was not doubted but there would be a Conjunction between them and the
<hi>French</hi> Forces, to reſtore the late King.</p>
                        <p>And to procure ſuch a Perſwaſion in the People; the <hi>French</hi> King was
to ſhew himſelf kind to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, to appear and act another
part than he had formerly done; he was to permit them the Exerciſe of
the Proteſtant Religion, thereby to perſwade many, that his Perſecution
of his own Subjects, the Hugonots, was not out of any Averſion to the
Proteſtant Religion, but only to their Antimonarchical and Reſiſting
Principles.</p>
                        <p>Then an Inconvenience is to be removed; for they complain, that they
are too full of Bigottry at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> and too bare-faced: For they
make an open Profeſſion of Popery, and ſpeak truly what they do intend;
but ſay they, if they will have the Deſign take effect, they muſt be more
Cloſe and Secret: For the Folly and Bigottry at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> was a very
great Obſtruction. Therefore, they propoſed, that ſome Perſons might
be ſubſtituted as Agents to Correſpond here, that underſtood the Temper
of the Nation, and what would eaſilieſt prevail with the People: And a
Model was to be framed at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> the Proteſtants are to be ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
careſſed, Seven or Nine to be of the late King's Councel, that ſo we
might believe, that he was ours in Intereſt again, and that we have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to him.</p>
                        <p>And if things were carried with ſuch cunning and ſubtilty, they hoped
to delude a great many People over into the Intereſt of the late King;
but, if they went bare-faced, it would cauſe ſuch great Jealouſies, that
they muſt totally deſpair of Succeſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="125" facs="tcp:53228:66"/>
Yet they did not hope by theſe Artifices to obtain ſo many Friends
here, as might have been ſufficient to accompliſh their Deſign; but they
muſt have recourſe to a forreign Force, particularly a French Force.
For ſays one of the Papers, <hi>Vſe Foreigners to expel Foreigners;</hi> that is,
Uſe <hi>French</hi> Foreigners to expel <hi>Dutch</hi> Foreigners, who are our Allyes,
and are falſly accuſed by them to have trampled upon the Rights and
Liberties of the Nation.</p>
                        <p>There is one Argument uſed to encourage People to aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi>
in the Invaſion of their own Country, which I cannot omit, namely,
<hi>That as ſoon as the</hi> French, <hi>with a conſiderable Expence of Men and
Mony, had reſtored the Proteſtant Religion, the late King to the Crown,
and the People to their Liberties, then he would withdraw all his Forces,
and reap no Profit or Advantage by his Succeſs.</hi> I muſt confeſs, this
carries ſo little of Perſuaſion in it, that it is ridiculous to think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to impoſe upon any number of Men. But notwithſtanding the
weakneſs of their Arguments, it is apparent they were in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt;
the Papers give an account to the <hi>French,</hi> in what ſtate and
condition our Forts were, Portſmouth <hi>not man'd with above 500. and</hi>
Goſport <hi>how weakly fortifyed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was a happy juncture between this and the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> when
Advice is given to make uſe of the Opportunity. For Men cannot
give, but Men may uſe Opportunities, and ſomething was to be done
forthwith, and the Goods muſt be got in readineſs, particularly the
Linnen and the Copper are mentioned, which are myſterious and dark
Expreſſions, and you may put a Conſtruction upon them as well as I;
for they are written in a ſtyle of Trade, as if there were a Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
between two Tradeſmen, and the Linnen and the Copper are
ordered to be brought before the 10th. of <hi>March.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But however obſcure ſome of theſe Expreſſions are, there are others
that are more plain,</hi> That the <hi>French</hi> Fleet muſt be out in <hi>April</hi> at
fartheſt, and are to come before the Conjunction between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Jennings, Strickland,</hi> or <hi>Trevannian</hi> are to come from
St. <hi>Mallo</hi>'s in one Night, and to fight the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet in the Chops of
the Channel, and not to come ſo high as <hi>Beathy,</hi> where they came the
laſt Year.</p>
                        <p>And there is an account given, in what condition and ſtate our
Navy was, how many Ships, what Rates, how Man'd, and who the
Officers; and then as the <hi>French</hi> were to be in readineſs to come in
<hi>April,</hi> ſo they ſay our Fleet was not to be out till <hi>June.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, There are a great many other Particulars; but theſe are
enough, nay half of them were enough to make any Man guilty of
Treaſon, that was concerned in them, or that had a hand in carrying
or making uſe of them.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, there are other Letters which can import nothing, but the
Writer was of the late King's Intereſt; one directed to Mr. <hi>Redding,</hi>
the other to Mrs. <hi>Redding;</hi> and theſe were to go to <hi>France</hi> to let them
know how zealous he was in his Duty, and how the intereſt of the
young Maſter increaſed. The Letters have theſe Expreſſions: <hi>That
though the Family were decreaſed, yet our Intereſt is increaſed, which
is yours, and I ſpeak in the Plural Number, becauſe I ſpeak the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of my elder Brother, and the reſt of our Relations, and deſire them
to believe they were zealous and cordial in their Duty to Mr.</hi> Redding.
Now what Interpretation you will make of this, I'll leave to you.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="126" facs="tcp:53228:67"/>
Then there is another Letter to Mrs. <hi>Charlton,</hi> and another to
Mr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> and divers other things that have been read, and amongſt
the reſt, hath been read the Heads of a Declaration at large, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what ſhould be done, and what Methods ſhould be taken in order
to the reſtoring the late King, and depoſing this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And there is alſo mention made in a Paper, how divers Perſons,
who were to be pardoned, as particularly,</hi> all Juſtices of the Peace
actually in Commiſſion are not to be excepted; Outlaws are to be pardoned;
Chimney-Money to be taken away; and all that come in within One and
Twenty Days are to be forgiven.</p>
                        <p>So that it is plain, theſe Letters import a Deſign to depoſe the King
and Queen, and the Kingdom to be invaded by Foreigners, only a little
to colour the matter, not to loſe the pretence of a Proteſtant Intereſt
altogether, there was to be 5 or 6000 <hi>Swedes</hi> to be made uſe of in
the Invaſion.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, if there was a Deſign of an Invaſion, be it by Papiſts,
or by Proteſtants, if any Act was done tending thereunto, it is High
Treaſon within the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. For purpoſing and intending to
depoſe the King and Queen, manifeſted by any Overt-Act, hath been
always held to be High Treaſon.</p>
                        <p>This, Gentlemen, is the Sum and Subſtance of the Evidence that
has been given at the Bar.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> ſays for himſelf, it is true, ſaith he, my Deſign was to go
to <hi>France,</hi> I was ſo unfortunate as to have the Papers taken about me.
I did take them up; but, ſays he, it is not at all proved that any one of
the Papers that are now produced are my hand: Which is true: There
is no ſuch Proof.</p>
                        <p>The next thing is, that Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> being ask'd, What occaſion he had
to go to <hi>France?</hi> He ſays, he had formerly a Relation to Coll. <hi>Worden,</hi>
and did tranſact and had the Management of his Affairs, which were very
great. Coll. <hi>Worden</hi> died half a year ago, and he enjoin'd him upon his
Death-bed to go into <hi>France</hi> about ſettling ſome Accompts of his, and he
was deſired by the Family of Coll. <hi>Worden</hi> ſo to do.</p>
                        <p>This Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> alledges; but he has not proved it. 'Tis very ſtrange,
that if Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was to go to <hi>France</hi> to negotiate that Affair for Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Worden</hi>'s Family, none of that Family ſhould be produced to prove,
that Coll. <hi>Worden</hi> gave him ſuch Directions, or that the Family deſired
him to go into <hi>France</hi> upon that account.</p>
                        <p>Then Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> hath endeavoured to give another reaſon for his
Voyage into <hi>France;</hi> he affirms, he had ſome Affairs of his own with
relation to the late Queen, he was concerned for her, and ſhe did owe
Monies here, and he paid ſeveral Debts to Tradeſmen, particularly <hi>400l.</hi>
ſhe owed to the Coach Harneſs Maker; and he having paid it, went
over to reimburſe himſelf: The Tradeſman was produced, and he ſays,
Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> did pay the Mony a Year ago; but whether Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>
had Effects from the late Queen, or paid it out of his own Pocket,
does not appear; Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> ſays, he paid it out of his own Pocket,
which is very extraordinary, that he ſhould be ſo kind to pay what
he was not obliged to pay, and have no ſecurity to reimburſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                        <p>So that, Gentlemen, you had beſt conſider whether there be any
thing at all ſaid or proved, that can juſtifie Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>'s going to <hi>France,</hi>
or whether there be any good reaſon offered for it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="127" facs="tcp:53228:67"/>
Then <hi>Aſhton</hi> has called Witneſſes to prove, that he was alwaies a
Proteſtant, though he did live in a Popiſh Family, where they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Papiſts and diſcountenance Proteſtants; for which he had the
ill will of thoſe he did depend upon.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, all that is agreed, and it is not a queſtion in this Caſe;
whether Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> be a Proteſtant or a Papiſt; but the Queſtion is,
whether he be guilty of High Treaſon, from which the being a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
does not ſecure a Man.</p>
                        <p>But Gentlemen, if Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> had no Knowledg upon what deſign
the other Perſons were to go into <hi>France,</hi> though he had actually gone
into <hi>France,</hi> it had been a Crime in this Juncture of Affairs, yet not
High Treaſon; but to go on into <hi>France,</hi> and carry a Treaſonable
Scheme of a Deſign and Project of an Invaſion, that is Treaſon.</p>
                        <p>Now the Queſtion is, whether Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> went with ſuch a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
or not, you are to conſider; I would not lead you into any
ſtrain of the Evidence, but only ſtate it how it ſtands. It is plain he
was concerned all along in hiring the Smack, and as the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
obſerved to you, the Price was ſomething extraordinary, they
were to pay <hi>100l.</hi> for the Voyage, to which was added ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the Woman, that if ſhe performed this Voyage well,
ſhe might get <hi>1000l.</hi> before <hi>Lady Day,</hi> and the Mony was paid by
Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and he was taken aboard the Veſſel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was much concerned to ſecure the Papers, by taking them
out of the place where they lay, upon the Ballaſt under the Quarter-Harches,
and after they were taken out of his Boſom, he was very
importunate, and ſo often with Captain <hi>Billop</hi> to throw them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.</p>
                        <p>And why ſhould he be ſo earneſt and concerned, unleſs he very well
knew and was acquainted with the contents of thoſe Papers.</p>
                        <p>And he gave one of the Seamen <hi>2s, 6d.</hi> to ſay they were bound for
<hi>Flanders:</hi> Unleſs it was a matter of great Importance he went about,
and that was not fit to be known; why ſhould he deny it, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to have it concealed? An <hi>100l.</hi> to be paid for this Voyage, was,
upon a joint Account, as well for my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> as for <hi>Aſhton</hi> and
<hi>Elliot;</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> did pay the Money, and he does not make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
whoſe it was.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, it reſts upon you to conſider the Evidence you have heard,
whether it is ſufficient to induce you to believe Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>France</hi> with theſe Papers, to carry on the Deſign of Depoſing
the King and Queen, and invading the Kingdom: If you are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in your Conſciences that he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

On the other ſide, if you are ſatisfied that he is Guilty, I do not
queſtion but you will find him ſo.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>L. C. J. Pollixfen.</speaker>
                        <p>Look you, Gentlemen of the Jury, My Lord
has rightly repeated and ſtated the Evidence to you, I ſhall only ſay
but a very few Words to it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> as at firſt he did, ſo in his Defence has complained of
a very ſpeedy Tryal, and would inſinuate ſomething of Favour that
he might find for that Reaſon. It does appear he had notice of his
Tryal ſufficient, and had Time enough to prepare for it: But there
is one thing extraordinary has happened to his Advantage, which I
would deſire may be taken notice of. If he had been tryed on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday,</hi>
perhaps he had had more reaſon to complain than now he has;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53228:68"/>
for he has now (and you ſee he uſes it, and wiſely enough too) the
Advantage that happened to him upon my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Tryal; and
he has had time ſince <hi>Saturday</hi> to prepare for this days Work, ſo that
there is no hard Point upon him as to that Matter, but he has had
pretty good Fortune therein.</p>
                        <p>Next he does inſinuate that he is a Proteſtant: Gentlemen, the Law
does not diſtinguiſh between a Proteſtant Traytor and a Papiſt Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
if he has committed ſuch an Offence, as by the Law is High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the Law does not diſtinguiſh, nor may we. And Proteſtants
may ſerve Papiſts Deſigns, though they do not directly intend it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Evidence to prove him a Proteſtant is nothing before you;
for the Matter is only whether he be guilty of this Crime or not.</p>
                        <p>In the Tryal of my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> then the Labour was, that My
Lord was not the Man that was concerned, as the Bearer of this Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
of Letters or Writings wherein the Treaſon is contained; but
then it was Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> the Pacquets were found about him; but now
it is not Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> but my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> and this is now the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
before you, that he ſtands upon.</p>
                        <p>But if ſo be they were all concerned in the Carriage and tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Buſineſs, then they are all alike guilty of Treaſon, and
therefore they cannot ſhuffle it from one to another.</p>
                        <p>Now there appears ſome Reaſon why they would not all agree to
be tryed together; for now it is but turning it from My Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>
upon <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> upon my Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> and <hi>Elliot</hi> upon
either of them, and ſo by this means all might eſcape, if this were
ſufficient to ſerve their turn.</p>
                        <p>But the Queſtion before you, is, whether all theſe Perſons are not all
in all equally concerned, and 'tis the Evidence that muſt be your Guide
and ours; for it is not Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>'s Affirmation, that he had Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to go into <hi>France,</hi> and he happened unluckily to fall into theſe
Mens Company, that will be a ſufficient Excuſe, unleſs he prove it.</p>
                        <p>It had been an eaſie matter for him to have proved, if he had been
going into <hi>France</hi> upon Buſineſs for Colonel <hi>Worden;</hi> but at length
that is turned off, and then the pretence for going is, to recover ſome
Mony he had owing to him there, and that he had payed for another
Perſon. Had he Paper of Inſtructions of this kind? Had he any one
Witneſs of this thing?</p>
                        <p>The Merchandize that he carryed out with him is of another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
Where were the Notes or Bonds that he was to recover? Where
is the Accompt that he had to make up with any body beyond Sea?
There is no manner of Evidence of any ſuch thing.</p>
                        <p>Next Gentlemen, do but conſider, if the Man were ſo innocent as he
would inſinuate, as if he had not gone with the reſt upon this Errand,
how came the Man to have ſo heavy a Concern upon him? Why
ſhould he go to take up theſe Papers, if they were not his Brats? Why
ſhould he clap them into his Boſom, if he knew nothing what was in
them? Why was his concern ſo great to have them thrown overboard?</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, if you expect that the Hearts of Men ſhould be proved
otherwiſe than as Men, gueſs by one anothers meanings; by their Actions
'tis impoſſible to convict any Man of a Crime; for if his own Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall be a Defence, he will never want a Defence to keep himſelf
from being convicted: But that is not what the Law gives credit to;
it muſt be Proof and Evidence that you are to judg upon. But of
all he pretends to he proves nothing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="129" facs="tcp:53228:68"/>
How came he acquainted with my L. <hi>Preſton?</hi> Sure he was a Man ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
known in the World? Why ſhould he go with him and Mr. <hi>Ellyott?</hi>
Are they not all known? Are they not Perſons much of the ſame Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and much in the ſame Imployment?</p>
                        <p>He had been taken a little before, he ſays himſelf, and was hindred from
going; and he had ſtrange ill luck, if there was nothing elſe in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
than what he pretends.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, in ſhort, if you do find by the Evidence, that he was going upon
a good and an honeſt Deſign, and that he knew nothing of the Danger that was
in theſe Papers, and that theſe Perſons were in, by reaſon of theſe Papers, and
yet would go about to have theſe Papers concealed, and endeavour to have them
thrown away, without knowing what was in them: Theſe are Evidences that
will be good for you to go by, if you have any ſuch; but to take his Affirmation,
becauſe he ſays it, when he proves nothing, that is no Evidence to go by.</p>
                        <p>I leave it to you, as my Lord has done. If you are ſatisfied upon that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that he is guilty; I doubt not you know and will do your Duty, and will
find him ſo; and if you have no ſuch Evidence, or any to prove the contrary,
that he is not guilty, then you ought to find him ſo too.</p>

Treaſon aſſigned in the Indictment. My Lord, it is a Treaſon of a very heavy
and black Nature, 'tis of ſuch a Nature, that if I had been conſcious to my
ſelf to have deſerved, I ſhould be very willing to undergo that Judgment that
is like preſently to paſs upon me. It is to endeavour to bring in the King
of <hi>France</hi> to Conquer and Invade this Kingdom; 'tis a thought I always ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred;

endeavour any ſuch thing; I muſt appeal to your Lordſhip, though now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it is too late, whether the Treaſon that is laid againſt me has been
perfectly proved; for in the Caſe of proving Hands, and particularly in the
Caſe of Collonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> It was diſallowed that compariſon of Hands ſhould
be Evidence; there ought to be at leaſt one if not two Evidences to prove
the writing of it. My Lord, I know this is too late, I ſhould have offered
this to the Jury before, but being in the Crowd and in great diſorder by
ſtanding ſo long, I had not ſtrength or ability enough to urge it as I ſhould.
I have nothing more to ſay in the Caſe but ſubmit to that Judgment that

there ſhould be no Interruption of Juſtice. And the Sentence that the Law has
declared ſhould be pronounced in this Caſe, is this:</p>
                     <p>That Ye do reſpectively go to the place from whence Ye came; from thence
to be drawn upon a Sledge to the place of Execution, to be there hang'd up
by the Neck, to be cut down while Ye are yet alive, to have your Hearts and
Bowels taken out before your Faces, and your Members cut off and Burnt,
Your Heads ſevered from your Bodies, Your Bodies divided into four Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Your Heads and Bodies reſpectively to be diſpoſed of according to the

Proofs of thoſe Deſigns which by theſe Letters will appear to

hereby, and by the late Diſcovery, the Induſtry of thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

they give themſelves great encouragement to believe they ſhall be

any future Deſigns againſt the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom.</p>

                        <p>WE did by the Earl of <hi>Melfort,</hi> Our Principal Secretary of State,
ſignifie to Your Holineſs the Joy We had in Your Promotion to the
Sacred Chair. And thoſe Letters which Your Holineſs did with Your own
Hand write Us, were ſuch Teſtimonies of Fatherly Love, and of Your Tender
Compaſſion for what We ſuffer, that they have leſſened the ſenſe of Our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
and have proved of real Conſolation to Us. The only ſource of all
theſe Rebellions againſt Us is, That We embraced the Catholick Faith; and do
not diſown, but that to ſpread the ſame not only in Our Three Kingdoms, but
over all the disperſed Colonies of Our Subjects in <hi>America,</hi> was Our deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
To manifeſt this, there will need no other proof, than to ſee how
lately We have proceeded in this Kingdom; for as We have frequently beaten
the Rebels in ſmall Parties, (which might have been one complete Victory, if
they had not obſtinately declined to give Us Battel); ſo We have ſtill turn'd
all to the advantage of Religion, and hope very ſoon to ſee it here firmly
eſtabliſhed: Nor will it look hard, if but aided by ſome Subſidies, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
the ſame in Our other Dominions, as ſoon as by God's favour We ſhall be
reſtored, ſeeing Our People do ſo ill bear the Uſurper's Yoke, and ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
long for our Return. It would promote this Work, if a general
Peace were ſettled among the Catholick Princes, or a Truce at leaſt, in
caſe the time be too ſhort for the other: for this would put an end to thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
begun in <hi>Germany,</hi> and where the Hereticks lie now gnawing in the
very Bowels of the Church. But what need We ſpeak on this Subject, where
the things themſelves are ſo loud, and implore Your Aid? The Apoſtolick
Zeal of Your Holineſs muſt find out Remedies fit for theſe Evils; and in
full confidence hereof, We beſeech God to give Your Holineſs a long and happy
Reign: And We being, with all Love and filial Obſervance proſtrate at Your
Feet, do beg Your Apoſtolical Benediction.</p>

                        <p>SInce the laſt Poſt, not having had any new occaſion of demanding
Audience of the Pope, I went to the Cardinal <hi>Ottoboni,</hi> whom
after four or five diſappointments, I at laſt found, and informed
him of the matter, and begged his aſſiſtance with the Pope, for all thoſe
Reaſons which your Majeſty has already ſeen, and what elſe I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
                        <p>The Cardinal ſeemed much more willing to enter into the Matter than
formerly; was very glad at the News; told me, that he had ſeen Your
Majeſties Letter to the Pope, all of your own hand; That it was all
their concerns; that he was but the Pope's Miniſter, and ſo could anſwer for
nothing, but informing him Right, and that he promiſed to me he would
do with as much affection to your Majeſties Intereſt, as I could do if I
were there. He complained (in confidence) to me, that the Pope
had ſome about him who were not ſo affectionate, and that ſo he
often left him well inclined, and found him changed at next meeting;
but that in this he would do all that was in his Power. He ſaid,
he doubted not that I was informed of the Emperor's proceedings, how
angry he was at the Pope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I told him, That for thoſe about the Pope, if any of them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
his inclinations, I humbly conceived it to be his fault, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the double Authority of Miniſter and Nephew, might eaſily make
the Palace too hot for any who would oppoſe him, eſpecially in things
ſo juſt, and, indeed, ſo neceſſary for his Intereſt. That I was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
informed of the Emperor's H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ffing; but withal, knew how little
that would ſignify, if he took the right way, which was to aſſiſt the King
to his Throne, who would be in a condition to bring Europe to Peace on
juſt terms, and not only to aſſiſt the Pope, but to profit his Eminence and
all his Family; That I knew what a King of <hi>England</hi> could do, and
what the Generoſity of this King would do to ſuch as obliged him, as
his Eminence might do in this Conjuncture; That the Emperor was loſt
however to them, and that made it the more neceſſary to hold in with
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53228:73"/>
ſame, ſo as to have a Friend in time of need; That if this was true,
I informed him of the neareſt way to put himſelf above what the Houſe
of <hi>Auſtria</hi> could do, was to puſh on the Wheel that went eaſilieſt, and
then the King on his Throne, that Family would not talk ſo high.</p>
                        <p>I had all the ſatisfaction in words I could deſire; but in effect, I
believe nothing will be done till the news of the Riſing come, and then I
am very confident ſomething will be done; ſo I pray God we may have
the news of it ſpeedily: And if it be not diſpatched hither before this
come to your Majeſties hands, I would humbly beſeech your Majeſty to
get the M. C. King to ſend an Expreſs with it hither, that we may make
the greater impreſſion with it; in the mean time, I ſhall (after the
Poſt comes) endeavour another Audience, that I may ſtill be keeping
them in mind of what it's ſo much their duty to do however.</p>
                        <p>I am ſorry, that on this important occaſion, I ſhould be ſo little uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to ſo good a Maſter; but it is God's will, and I muſt ſubmit to it.
I am told, how true I know not, that in <hi>Ireland</hi> they begin to be ſorry
for their injuſtice to me; pray God it be true, and that my Example may
hinder them from falling in the like with Mr. <hi>De Lauzune,</hi> who will
certainly carry higher than I did with them; and therefore I have ſome
Reaſons to fear, from the Humours he has to do with. I have written
to all my Friends to do their beſt to keep peace; and that all may prefer
the King's Service to their own private Intereſt, which I hope in God they
will do, and that all ſhall go well. I am ſorry to hear that there was
not preparation made for the reception of the <hi>French;</hi> the King could do
no more but ſend a Lieutenant-General, E. <hi>Dover,</hi> to take Order; but
alas, the negligence of the Servant makes the Maſter ſuffer; and it
will never be well till theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

I doubt not this has been, if the Story be true, that the fault was ſo
great; and the worſe the matter is repreſented in <hi>France,</hi> the more the
King's Honour is concerned, not to ſuffer it to paſs unpuniſhed; one
Example or two is neceſſary for the recovering of the Kingdoms; for
there is not one thing I stand ſo much in fear of, as negligence in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting
the King's Orders. Forgive me, Madam, for medling in this
matter, but I'll ſwear I cannot help it; I muſt be concerned, when I
hear of any thing by which the King is prejudiced, either in his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or Service.</p>

upon the King, your Majeſty, and the Prince; and that you may
happy together for many years in your own <hi>England;</hi> and that all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
