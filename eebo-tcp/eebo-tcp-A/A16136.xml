            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Some will needes affirme, that at the beginning he that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pope, deſigned and ordained his ſucceſſour: and that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> after this maner eſtabliſhed Saint <hi>Clement,</hi> to governe and rule the Church after him. But that ſo reſting without an other example, and not being followed afterwards, one can make no rule nor order of it, the ſame hauing taken no effect: becauſe Saint <hi>Clement</hi> ſucceeded not Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Linus,</hi> and after him <hi>Cletus</hi>: and Saint <hi>Clement</hi> was but the third after Saint <hi>Peter</hi>: We likewiſe find it written, that <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus</hi> were alſo choſen by Saint <hi>Peter</hi>; not for ſucceſſors,
<pb facs="tcp:24983:5"/>
nor to be intentiue on prayer and preaching, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue pontificall iuriſdiction, but onelie for ayde and aſſiſtaunce in externall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters. And that Saint <hi>Clement</hi> woulde not embrace this eſtabliſhment, ſo much in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, as by diuine inſpiration, for feare leſt the example of ſuch a nomination ſhould bee drawne to a cuſtome in ſucceeding times, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the power and authoritie of the Church might bee diminiſhed in chooſing or inſtituting of a Paſtor: As alſo by the Canon of the Apoſtles 76. And by the Counſell of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Chap. 23. it is not lawfull for a Biſhop, being at the point of death, to chooſe and appoint in his place a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour. By which, it may be gathered, that this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was vſurped by ſome Biſhops, of whome there are diuers examples. Certaine it is, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Saint <hi>Clement,</hi> all the Popes were made and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the voyce and ſuffragation of the Clergie and Chriſtian people of the Cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the Biſhoppes of other Prouinces that then were there. The which was obſerued till the ſchiſme that fell out betweene <hi>Damaſus</hi> and <hi>Vrſicinus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare of our Lord, 369.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Damaſus</hi> being then choſen Pope, by one part of the people and Clergie, and <hi>Vrſicinus</hi> by another, and both of them ſupported by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites: they both were deſirous to hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this dignitie, which cauſed great factions and ſedition, and went ſo farre, that they came to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blowes: So that one day, there was an hundred ſeauen and thirtie dead bodies left in a Church; for which cauſe, the Emperour afterward interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:24983:5"/>
his authoritie, in caſe of any ſuch ſciſme here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ordaining him, whom he would haue to be Pope. And in this ſort was <hi>Damaſcene</hi> eſtabliſhed by the authoritie of the Emperour <hi>Vaelentinian.</hi> And not long after, there occurred the like diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, betweene <hi>Eulalius</hi> and <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> and great ſedition was raiſed within the Cittie of <hi>Rome</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this occaſion, and <hi>Symmachus</hi> the Gouernour not being able to appeaſe or ſet downe anie order for the ſame, in the ende by the meere authoritie and power Imperiall of the Emperour <hi>Honorius, Boniface</hi> was made Pope. This dignitie hauing bene before, as it were ſequeſtred for the time, by the Emperour, and committed to the Biſhop of <hi>Spoleti,</hi> that then was during the feaſt of Eaſter. And ſo there grew then diuiſion betweene <hi>Syma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> and <hi>Laurentius</hi>: the which king <hi>Theodorick,</hi> making knowne, in an aſſemblie helde at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> hee confirmed <hi>Symachus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And afterwardes the cauſe of ſciſme ceaſing, to preuent the tumult and diſorder that might grow thervpon, the Emperour was alwaies wont in ſuch elections to bee preſent. And it came to this point, that an election of the Pope, made by the people and Cleargie, was not auayleable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were ratified and confirmed by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: in that hee elected, durſt not proceede to his conſecration, without the Princes will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, vnto whom, for the right, and prerogatiue of confirmation, a certaine ſumme of money was giuen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:24983:6"/>This maner of proceeding continued, while the daies of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the 3: who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mooued by the good and holie life of <hi>Pope Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict, 2.</hi> which was in the yeare, 686. he ſent vnto him a conſtitution, by which it was ordained &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that whoſoeuer afterwards ſhold be choſen, by the cleargie and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently to bee reputed for the true Vicar of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> without attending therein the authoritie of the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acque</hi> of <hi>Italie,</hi> reſident in <hi>Ravenna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in the yeare 773. Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> the firſt, in the counſell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> wherin there was 153.

But pope, <hi>Leo S.</hi> hauing bin maintained in the ſeate with armes, by the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the 1. in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his benefit, and being offended with the in conſtancie &amp; mutability of the people, he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all the authoritie of creating and making popes, vnto the perſon of the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the 1. about the yeare, <hi>963.</hi>

                  <hi>Othos</hi> ſucceſſors vſed this authoritie and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge til the time of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4.</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. called before <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi>: who was choſen in the yeare 1073. ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the ſame prerogatiue again, vnto the clergie, and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and preſently after, pope <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchall 2.</hi> hauing remiſed it into the handes of the Emperour, <hi>Henry</hi> 5. hee incontinently after reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the ſame againe.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1509. Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> 2. in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Latran.</hi> 4. made a Decree touching the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Popes, importing thus much: that firſt the Cardinall Biſhops would treate amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the election, conferring afterwardes with the other Cardinalles about the ſame, and ſo the election by them made, to be approoued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto by all the people, and cleargie of <hi>Rome,</hi> vſing theſe words: <hi>Vt Cardinalis Epiſcopi diligentiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſime ſimul de electione tractantes, mox Chriſti clericos Cardinales adhibeant: ſic<expan>

<pb facs="tcp:24983:7"/>
Conclaue, in the towne where the precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pope ſhould depar: ſo that no body might goe in, nor come out, or conferre, by letters, meſſengers, or otherwiſe, with the ſame Cardinalles, while they had created a Pope, to whome they brought, and deliuered their ordinarie refection at a window: And if in the ſpace of three dayes ſithence their entrance, they had not agreed vppon an election, it is ſaid, that for fiue daies after, they were to haue but onely one diſhe at dinner, or ſupper: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, if they yet continued longer without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an election, they were to haue nothing giuen them, but bread, wine, and water, while they had choſen a Pope: After the deceaſe of the pope, they were to deferre their ſeſſion for 10. dayes, to expect, and attend for the abſent Cardinalles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they entred into the Conclaue: Although notwithſtanding, entrance was not forbidden the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo they came afterward, the matter being yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and not treated of. The ſame was confirmed by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 5: who by his conſtitution forbad that ſuch a forme ſhould not be corrected, changed, nor altered by the Cardinalls in <hi>Sede Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cante,</hi> and that nothing might be added or taken from it, in any ſort whatſoeuer: But by a <hi>Bull</hi> of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 6. there was ſome moderation, as wel for the forme of the Conclaue, wherin they were permitted to make ſeparations, &amp; to furniſh celles for eache Cardinall, with tapiſtries onely, as for the meate they were to haue brought them. It remaineth therfore, that wee a little more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie touche the forme, and order, which is vſed at

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the forme, and order, which they vſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in at this preſent, to the election of a Pope.</head>
               <p>PReſently after the Pope is departed, yea and euen when they ſee, or that they haue aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement from the Phyſitions that hee is at the laſt caſt, the Cardinalls which are then in <hi>Rome,</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together in the priuy Conſiſtory, to conſult for the gouernment of the towne, and to prouide for the affaires of the vacancie: &amp; then the ſeate being vacant, they are apparelled in <hi>Coqueſts Rochettes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mozzettes</hi> without Copes, in ſigne of Iuriſdiction, the people of the towne all in armes, guarde at the gates of the Cittie, the Cardinalls Pallaces, and in other quarters.</p>
               <p>The day after the Cardinalles reaſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame place, for the like effect, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of ſuch affaires as then occurre, as alſo to prouide, for the preparation &amp; adopting of that which is neceſſarie for the holding of Conclaue.</p>
               <p>Afterwards they carrie the corps of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Pope ordinarilie into <hi>S. Peters Church,</hi> except the departed pope, made choice of his ſepultur in ſome other place. Therto all the Cardinalles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially aſſiſt, which are at the aſſemblie: the dead body is reueſted with Pontifical ornaments, &amp; laid vpon a bedſtead in the Church, or ſome chapell of the ſame, where the people come &amp; kiſſe his feete.</p>
               <p>In the daies following, the Cardinalls ſolemnize
<pb facs="tcp:24983:8"/>
the Popes obſequies: and there is a convention in the veſtrie of <hi>Saint Peters,</hi> wherin the Princes Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors do vſe to enter, making their remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; motions touching the Election to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. During the vacancie, the great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain gouerns <hi>Rome.</hi> But ſo ther is no expedition nor diſpatch of any thing admitted in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Chancerie, while there be a new Pope. And in briefe, as ſoone as the Pope hath yeelded vp his breath, the Vice-cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celer taketh the <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Seales,</hi> cauſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> publiquely to be broken, raſed out, &amp; that ſide to be taken away of them, wheron the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Popes name was written, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſealed withall.

               </p>
               <p>Nine dayes after the Popes death, they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the <hi>Maſſe of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and beeing fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſinging the <hi>Hymne, Veni ſancte Spiritus,</hi> they enter into the Conclaue.</p>
               <p>The Conclaue at <hi>Rome,</hi> is in a place ioyning to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Churche, within the Popes Pallace, in <hi>Sixtus</hi> his Chapell, as bigge as a great <hi>Church,</hi> where is portraied the laſt Iudgement, and it was the excellent worke-manſhip of <hi>Michael Angelo</hi>: which chapell they ſet forth after the manner of a
<pb facs="tcp:24983:8"/>
Domitorie in Convents, but that there are many great allies, and ſome more leſſe, &amp; narrower, and with the order of celles, or little cabinets, wherin the Cardinalls lie. To the which Conclaue, the chappell of <hi>Pauline,</hi> &amp; the great Royall Hall abutt, and are adioyning, beeing as it were a part of the ſame. The gates, lower windows, and all acceſſes, are ſo mured, and cloſed vp, that one cannot talke, or communicate with any of thoſe within.</p>
               <p>When they are entred into the Conclaue, they aſſemble together in the chappell <hi>Pauline,</hi> where they conſult of all things which concerns the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Conclaue, &amp; the ſame day, they take the oaths of the Officers, deputed for the guard of the Conclaue, as well of thoſe without, as of them within.</p>
               <p>At the beginning, after they are entred, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claue remains open, for ſome little time, and then Princes Ambaſſadours vſe to go in, and make their recommendations, and ſollicitations in fauour of him, or them, whom they knowe to be beſt liked, and affected by their Princes.</p>
               <p>After this, the Conclaue is ſhut, and then no man may any more goe in, nor communicate in any ſort, with any one without, neither by letters, meſſengers, nor otherwiſe: nor likewiſe go out, till there be a new Pope created, except ſome Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall chaunce to arriue, who alwayes during the Conclaue, may haue free entrance.</p>
               <p>And yet this is to be obſerued, that all Cardinalls are not priuiledged to enter in, except they be By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts, or Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, at the leaſt, for Cardinals
<pb facs="tcp:24983:9"/>
Subdeacons, haue no voice therin, nor are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any entrance: And yet we finde that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> beeing but a Subdeacon, entred into the Conclaue of <hi>Sextus</hi> 5. by reaſon of a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or briefe that hee had from <hi>Gregorie.</hi> 13. by meanes of which, it was graunted him, and the which hee ſhewed and preſented, when they would haue denyed his entrance.</p>
               <p>Euery day the neceſſarie prouiſion is brought them, which they giue them in at a window, or by the wicket of the gate, before which there is treble garde, wherof the neereſt to the gate, conſiſtes of the Prelates that are in <hi>Rome,</hi> who looke that none may communicate with thoſe that are incloſed in the Conclaue, and for this cauſe, they ſearche the Veſſells and platters, to ſee whether there bee not any letters hidden in the ſame.</p>
               <p>Euery Cardinal within the conclaue, can haue no more, but two men to ſerue him, whom they call <hi>Conclauiſtes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conclaue being cloſed, the day following the Deane of the Cardinalls after the celebrating of Maſſe, adminiſtreth the holie Communion to all the Cardinalles.</p>
               <p>After this the <hi>Conclauiſtes</hi> aſſemble together, in the <hi>Chapell Pauline,</hi> before the maiſter of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, who taketh notice of them, and ſees whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not execute their appointed number.</p>
               <p>Alſo at the beginning the maiſter of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies reades the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius 4.</hi> wherein it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the Cardinalls entring into the Conclaue, ſhould bee ſworne.</p>
               <p>Euery daye in <hi>Paules Chappell,</hi> one of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls
<pb facs="tcp:24983:9"/>
celebrates the <hi>Maſſe</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſo they proceede to the election of the Pope: which for the moſt part alſo is performed after two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, one by Scrutinie, &amp; the other by Adoration.</p>
               <p>The ſcrutenie is held after this ſort: euery Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall writes within a certaine billet of paper, his voice and choice, and at the end of Maſſe, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it into the great challice of Gold, which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the Altar: Then al the billets are pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth vpon a little table, which for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is ſet before the Altar: There are three of the Cardinalls, which in the ſight, and preſence of all the reſt, vnfold theſe little rulles, or billets, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing aloude his name, who hath ſubſcribed to euery of them, and the Cardinalls write &amp; ſet downe in a ſheet of paper, the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the voices which euery one hath, to know who hath moſt.</p>
               <p>Where by the way we muſt note, that to chooſe, &amp; create a Pope, there muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre two thirds of al the Cardinals voices in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>claue by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Pope <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, 3.</hi> ſet down in the Chap. <hi>Licet de vita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da de electione,</hi> in the Decretals: For if in ſuch a ſcrutenie, ther is not any one, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the two thirds accur; at the ſame inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they caſt al the billets into the fire, &amp; by this means the affaire is referred ouer to ſome other time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make and recommence an other ſcrutenie in the ſame forme: the which, by reaſon of this, vſeth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated &amp; reiterated many times, while theſe two thirds occurre in one perſon. The which falls out very ſeldome, by way of ſcrutenie: ſo as they are vrged to haue recourſe to adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb facs="tcp:24983:10"/>
the want of voices in ſcrutenie is ſometimes ſupplied by the <hi>Acceſsi,</hi> ſo called: which is, when thoſe that gaue their ſuffragation &amp; voice by billet to ſome other, they now giue it to him whom they ſee to haue moſt voices, &amp; ſing theſe wordes; <hi>Accedo ad Cardinalem talem</hi>: from whence that word of <hi>Acceſsi</hi> came. And to the ende that no fraud may be committed herein, he that giues his voice by ſuch Acceſſion, ſayes; Let them looke on my billet, which hath on the toppe ſuch a deuiſe: And that by this, on may know that he had nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated an other: And this is for feare, leaſt it ſhould happen, that he which had giuen his voice by bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to one, might giue it again by this forme of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to an other: which would be two voices in one mans perſon, inſtead of one.</p>
               <p>The billets they vſe, are made after his faſhion: The Cardinall that giues his voice, takes a leafe of paper, folded into diuers plightes, and vpon the laſt he writes his owne name: and in the two firſt, he cauſeth the Cardinalls name to whom he will giue his voice to be written by his <hi>Conclauiſe,</hi> in this maner: <hi>Ego Eligo in ſummum pontiſicem Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendiſſ. Dominum meum Cardinalem. N.</hi> Afterwards they chooſe the billet at both endes: vpon which they alſo ſet ſome deuiſe at the Cardinalls plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that without vnfolding the ſame, it may bee known, by the external deuiſe.</p>
               <p>There is yet an other kind of ſcrutenie, which they call open, or <hi>apertis vocibus,</hi> which is, when the Cardinalls being aſſembled together, declare aloude him, whom they chooſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:24983:10"/>The other maner, which is Adoration: is, when the Cardinalles being aſſembled together in the Chappell, turne towardes him, whom they deſire to be made Pope, doing reuerence vnto him, and bending the knees very lowe, and when they ſee that the two thirds are gone to this maner of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration, The Cardinall thus adored, is made Pope.</p>
               <p>And though this maner of Election, be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that which is called by the auncients, and in the cannon law, <hi>per inſpirationem,</hi> and that they ſay, it is the way of the holy Ghoſt, which was, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all with one voice without any treatie, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ſcruteny, and without any formalitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, as it were by diuine inſpiration, to ſay, that ſuch a one muſt bee made Pope, it being thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually deſigned by euery one.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this forme of Adoration is not eſteemed by many, ſo lawfull, and auaileable as ſcrutenie: becauſe by meanes of contentions, and partialities, there may be ſome fraude or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence committed therein, in that the weaker ſide may be drawne to Adoration by the example of thoſe more mightie, and thoſe fearful, induced by them more reſolute. And oftentimes it hapneth, that thoſe who would haue conſented to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome one, by free voice, ſeeing this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and violent concurrance in Adoration, they ſuffer themſelues to be caried away with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of this ſtreame. That by this they may demonſtrate, how they haue a part in ſuch an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and they will not bee the laſt herein, for
<pb facs="tcp:24983:11"/>
feare of diſpleaſing and incurring his diſpleaſure who ſhould be choſen.</p>
               <p>All this is performed in <hi>Paules</hi> Chappell, in the ordained place, for the Popes Election. Ther was heretofore a third manner of the Popes Election, by forme of comprimiſe: &amp; this was, when all the Cardinalls vppon ſome amongſt them, to whom they wholy referred themſelues, for the chooſing and Electing of him, whom they ſhould iudge moſt capable: but this faſhion, though it be one of the three manners of Election approued of in the Chap: <hi>Quia propter, de Electione,</hi> in the Decretalls, is more vſed at <hi>Rome</hi>: wherof ſome giue this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe this power of nominating a Pope af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the 5. being giuen to <hi>Baltaſar Coſſa,</hi> then Cardinall of <hi>S. Euſtachio,</hi> hee made himſelfe Pope, ſaying: <hi>Ego ſum papa.</hi> And he was called <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 23.</p>

               <p>VVHen the two thirds of the voices concur in one perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be it by ſcrutenie ſecret, or open, by meanes of Acceſſe, or by way of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he out of doubt is truly Pope. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other Cardinalls alſo, vſe to giue their conſent thereunto. And then the chiefe Cardinal Biſhop, all the other being ſet, pronounceth, and declareth in the name of all the Colledge, that he chooſeth ſuch an one for Pope. And dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth of him how he is affected, and willing to vndertake the ſame, which he hauing declared, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Election, all riſe vp to gratifie him: and at the ſame inſtant, putting on his <hi>Rochet,</hi> they cauſe him to ſit downe in a prepared ſeate, which is placed before the table, neere the Altar, they giue him the fiſhers ring, &amp; cauſe him to deliuer and make knowne, by what name he wil be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>This forme of changing name, was brought in, receiued and vſed, ſince the time of Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 12. who was choſen in the yeare, <hi>155</hi>: he being before called <hi>Octauian</hi>: yet diuers aſcribe this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to Pope <hi>Sergius,</hi> 2. who was in the yeare, 844.</p>
               <p>Hauing therfore declared what name he wil take vpon him, he vſeth to ſubſcribe to the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:24983:12"/>
which had bene agreed vppon, and ſworne vnto, by all the Cardinalls, before the election, &amp; to ſigne certaine ſupplications, and requeſts.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the chiefeſt of the Cardinal Deacons, opening a little windowe, from whence the people which attend, may ſee, and be ſeene, he ſhewes forth a Croſſe, pronouncing theſe words, with a loud voice; <hi>Annuncio vobis gandiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> magnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Papam habemus.

               <p>This being done, he is diſveſted of his common garments, which belong to the clearks of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and reveſted with all the habits Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and cauſing him to ſit vpon the Aultar, all the Cardinalls a rowe doe him reuerence, in kiſſing his feete, hands, and mouth.</p>
               <p>During this entercourſe of Ceremonie, all the gates of the Conclaue are opened, the barres, and walls which cloſed and mured the paſſages, gates, and windows, are broken down, &amp; ouerthrowen: &amp; the Souldiers entering confuſedly, as it were by force, take &amp; pill whatſoeuer they meete withal in their way.

               <p>At the ſame time, the newe Pope is carryed into <hi>Saint Peters</hi> Churche, followed with the Channons and Singing men of the ſame Churche, which ſing; <hi>Ecce Sacerdos Magnus?</hi>

               <head>The election of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 11. placed at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Cathedrall ſeate.</head>
               <head type="sub">With a liſt of ſuch Cardinals as were there, and aſsiſted at this ſolemnitie, and of all the reſt that haue place in <hi>Rome Conclaue.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Ope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8. called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hippolitus Aldobrandin,</hi> Cardinall of Saint <hi>Pancrace,</hi> &amp; great Penetentiarie, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deceaſe of <hi>Innocent</hi> the ninth choſen Pope, the thirtie day of Ianuarie, 1592. He held the ſeate for the ſpace of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres, one Moneth, and fiue dayes. A father verie memorable, and recommendable for his great piety, deuotion, and charity, with other high and rare vertues, as alſo for his ſingular prudence in the management of affaires: He departed the third day of March about ten a clock at night.</p>
               <p>After his deceaſe, all ceremonies and ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties requiſite in ſuch a caſe, as well for his buriall, as others, were obſerued, with many aſſemblies, and congregations in the vſuall places.</p>
               <p>The Conclaue was ſo prepared, that there was no Celles in <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth his Chappell, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was woont to bee: but all the Celles and Chambrets were addreſſed and prepared in the greateſt part of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Pallace: That is to ſay, in the firſt, ſecond, and third hall, within the
<pb facs="tcp:24983:14"/>
hall of the Conſiſtorie, <hi>Leonine,</hi> and <hi>Gregorian,</hi> and in the moſt of the chambers of the Pallace.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals entred into the Conclaue, the fourteenth of the ſame Moneth of March, and there was of them to the number of three-ſcore and one. The Scrutenie was diuerſe times ſet on foote, and many Cardinals propounded. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, my Lord Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> who at the beginning had thirtie voices, and in the daies following, they amounted to the number of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or eight and thirtie, which was not yet a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient number to make the two thirds: although it was a thing which he no wayes contended after, but on the contrarie eſtranged himſelfe from it as much as might be, doing whatſoeuer hee could to hinder this proceeding. There was alſo ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers propounded, againſt whom, excluſions and oppoſitions were made: But the firſt day of Aprill, when they came to mention my Lord Cardinall of <hi>Florence,</hi> there was preſently ſuch a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, &amp; conſent on all parts, that without making any ſcruple or doubt in the matter, they being in <hi>Paules</hi> Chappell, the place ordained for ſuch electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons euery one ran to adoration, and it was begun by my Lord Cardinall of <hi>Ioyeuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And at ſo great a promptitude, alacritie, and harmonie of all willes, that we neede not to doubt but it was a verie diuine inſpiration: euen they themſelues, who (as was ſuppoſed) would haue beene ſome obſtacle, and that had attempted and made ſhew of ſome ſuch matter, concurring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with their full conſent, becauſe there was no
<pb facs="tcp:24983:14"/>
bodie, that would either heare or adheere vnto them. And thus the ſame day, being the firſt of Aprill, about ſeuen a clocke in the dawning, my Lord Cardinall of <hi>Florence,</hi> or <hi>de Medices,</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Pope, and tooke vpon him the name of <hi>Leo</hi> the eleuenth.</p>
               <p>SInce the publiſhing of this Relation, newes is come by diuerſe letters of the death of this <hi>Leo:</hi> and of an other Election in hand: who (as it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) was made away by poyſon: but becauſe there is yet no vndoubted certaintie of the ſame, I would bee loath to publiſh any priuate aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or to ſet that for infallible truth, which is onely grounded vpon ſurmiſes: wherefore it will bee better to attend ſome further aduertiſement, when I wil be readie (curteous Reader) to acquaint thee withall. In the meane while be ſatisfied with this which hath beene deliuered by an eye witneſſe.</p>
