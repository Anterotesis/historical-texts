            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Courage, but no Justice so often exposed their lives: To prevent which for the future, provident Law sett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> suitable Revenues to defend Your Authoritie, and therein shewed that the safety of the King and Law were inseparably joyned.</p>
            <p>It is to our <hi>IAMES'S</hi> that we owe the great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Laws, and so there lyes a special obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Your <hi>Majesty</hi> to cherish them as their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, to maintain them as Your surest and least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive Guards, and to look on them as the only Counsellours that can neither be byassed by partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor interest.</p>
            <p>But because Your <hi>Majesty</hi> has a special esteem for <hi>Heroes,</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi>; Allow me to represent to you that all those eminent <hi>Romans,</hi> who conquered the World, were raised by Pleading, and the Command of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were rewards bestowed by the suffrages of the People on those who Pleaded best for them; nor did <hi>Cesar</hi> (as their Story observes) take him to the Camp, but because he loved rather to be first there, than se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to <hi>Cicero</hi> at the Bar, where if he had stayed, he had not destroyed his native Countrey, which <hi>Cicero</hi>

who continued to Plead, so wisely preserv'd. That is the most generous heart, which is warmed by Reflection, elevated by the hopes of Fame, and used to Victory; And no Reflections are so strong as those of men always imploy'd in reasoning; Fame has no such Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet as Eloquence; nor can Courage give so many and solide Victories as Reason does, and such Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage does the love of Justice inspire in those who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore it, that our Profession has had its own Martyrs too, who dar'd to die for it, without being diverted by action, from looking fixedly on the terrours of death, or comforted by the hopes of escaping it, as Souldiers in Battels are. The vertuous <hi>Papinian</hi> is a glorious instance of this, who being chief Minister of State to his Emperour, after he had illustrated the Law by many learned Volums before he attained to the age of 36. choosed rather to die than justifie a barbarous act even in his Prince &amp; Master; This only use of our Reason we want under Your <hi>Majesties</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Reign, you being more unwilling to command what is unjust, than any of Your Subjects would be to suffer.

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 4.</note>THese who refuse to assist the King, to punish notor Rebels, are by this Act punished as favourers of them. Notor Rebels, are only such as are denounced Rebels, or against whom there are Commissions of Fire and Sword granted by the Council, or these who have risen in open Rebellion, though there be yet no legal dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence against them; as was decided <hi>February</hi> 1680. and these who refuse to assist against such, are punishable as favourers of such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; that is to say, as Art and Part of their Crimes; as is clear by the 29 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 3. <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. where favourers of Rebels, are declared pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable, as Art and Part; and consequently, the staying from the Kings Host, after open Proclamation, commanding all Heretors to go thereto, is punishable as Treason: and it is clear by the <hi>Journal Books,</hi> that this Crime has been punished by Forefaulture, <hi>Jan.</hi> 9. 1577. and the 21: of <hi>April</hi> 1599. Likewise, I find <hi>Andrew Naiff</hi> in <hi>Baldordy,</hi> pannalled for Treasonable abiding from the Kings Host, at the Raid of <hi>Bigger,</hi> 1568. And yet I find, that Absents from the Host are Bail'd, <hi>March</hi> 15. 1576. though Treason is not of its own nature Bailable; and that these Pannals, who are doom'd to have lost their Estates and Goods, after much debate, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>quoad</hi> their Persons only warded during the Kings pleasure: And His Majesty, by His gracious Letter <hi>Nov.</hi> 1679: allowed such as were absent from the Host at <hi>Bothwel</hi>-Bridge, to be only fined at most, in two years valued Rent.</p>
               <p>This Act was also the foundation of all our old Proclamations, whereby all the Heretors, betwixt sixty and sixteen, were charged to come to the Kings Host, when our Kings were either engaged
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59223:6"/>
against their Enemies at Home or Abroad; at which occasions, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retors and Liferenters, whether Men or Women, holding immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the King, were cited; and they cited and brought out their Vassals: and therefore it was a good defence that they held not of the King, as is to be seen in the <hi>Journal Books, Feb:</hi> 19: 1600. But now the Council commands all Heretors by Proclamation, to go to the Host, under the command of such Captains as are named in the Proclamation. This Obligation and Statute, is not now taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the late Act, giving His Majesty the Militia, as was found by the Privy Council <hi>October</hi> 1677: and by the Justices in <hi>March</hi> 1680. so that Heretors must attend either, but not both in the same Countries: so the last Act abrogates not the first, and that being given as a favour, were none, if it took off the first, which is greater, and arises from a feudal obligation, or at least is due to the King as King, and without which the peace of the Country could not be maintained: and by the <hi>Act</hi> 25: <hi>Sess:</hi> 3: <hi>Par:</hi> 1: <hi>Car:</hi> 2: after the Militia is granted, the Parliament in the same Act, makes a further tender of all their Lives and Fortunes, betwix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sixty and sixteen, when they shall be called for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secundo,</hi> It was found that this Crime was not punishable now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the punishment exprest in <hi>Chap:</hi> 15: <hi>Stat: Alexander</hi> 2: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Thane was only punishable in six Cows, and a young Cow: an Ochiern in fifteen Ewes, or six Shillings: and a Labouring Man in one Cow and one Sheep: for that Statute is justly abrogated by this Act that is posterior; the Remedies in that Statute having been probably found ineffectual because of their meanness. This Ochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern is by <hi>Skeen</hi> called a Freeholder; but I find by many old evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that an Ochiern is a Chief of the Branch of a great Family, who has a considerable command; and it is the corruption of the <hi>Irish</hi> Wochteran, which signifies still in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> a Master or Superior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertio,</hi> It was found, that though such as were above sixty, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low sixteen, were not obliged to go to the Host themselves, because of the 23. <hi>Stat:</hi> K. <hi>Will:</hi> (and this is sustained <hi>Feb:</hi> 21: 1600:) yet their Age did not excuse them from sending, which clears, why <hi>David Lawson</hi> was convict for byding from the Raid of <hi>Dumfries,</hi> in Regent <hi>Mortons</hi> time, though he was alleaged to be past sixty five.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quarto,</hi> That such Burgesses as had Lands in the Countrey, were obliged to send one for these Lands (though it was alleaged that Burgesses did not usually keep Horses) except they had been commanded by the Town where they lived, to serve there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quinto,</hi> That the Captains under whom they were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go to the Host, could not warrand them to stay at home; because this Feudal obligation could not be dispensed with by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who were only impowered to command: but if they came once out, and were listed; it was found, that the Captains might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to return home, upon occasion of sickness, or for other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, of which he was a competent Judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sexto,</hi> That the King needed not prove that the Pannels came
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59223:7"/>
not to the Host, that being a Negative; but that it was necessary for the Pannel to prove that he was at the Host.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Septimo,</hi> That the King was not obliged to prove the Pannels to be Heretors, but that they were obliged to renunce any Heretage they had, in favours of the King, if they denied they were Heretors; even as in other cases, the King is not obliged to prove that any were his Vassals, but they behoved to disclaim, upon their hazard: and of old, the notoriety of their being Heretors, was refer'd to the Assize, without any further probation, as <hi>June</hi> 12. 1557. and some times to the Pannels oath, as in the case of <hi>William Wallace, July</hi> 2. 1600,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Octavo,</hi> That not only such as were Heretors by being actually In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft, were to send to the Host, but that appearand Heirs, and such as possessed the Lands, were to send; it being unreasonable, that the appearand Heir's lying out, and not entering, should prejudge the King more in this case, than it does as to the casuality of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Though by the Civil Law the owners be lyable for the Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers fault, in so far as concerns the prejudice done in the Ship; yet it seems hard, that an owners escheat shall fall for the Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers taking in Tallow, else Rich men would not be Owners, and Skippers might Maliciously ruine their Owners, and therefore it seems that by Masters here should only be mean'd Skippers, and by the Civil Law, the Skipper was call'd <hi>Magister Navis.</hi>

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 50.</note> wherein any man is Indyted to be upon his Assize, seems to be founded upon the suspition that arises from an Interest they may have, in having the Pannel Convict, since a part of his Escheat belongs to them; and therefore I think this should not be extended to exclude any such Officers within the Shire, as may expect no share, such as Commissars, &amp;c. The second part of the Act which discharges those who Indyte a man to be upon his Assyze, extends also against Informers, and these who gave advice for raising the Libel; but from this part of the Act it clearly appears, that it is not generally true, that when a penalty is adjected to an Act, the deed is not null, though the penalty be due, for it is here forbidden, that any Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciar, or other who Indyts a man, shall be on his Assyze, under the penalty of ten pounds: and yet certainly this Act would sett the informer from being on the Assyze; and though to this it may be answered, that this is unlawful by the Law of Nations, prior to all Law, and so this Law is only declaratory; yet that cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged as to discharging Officers within the Shire, to be upon as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syzes, it may be also alleadg'd, that this Penalty is only irrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in case any should pass on such Assyzes, without being known to be such. But I do really believe, that we in our Parliaments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered not the subtile distinction betwixt Acts, which proceed <hi>pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam irrogando,</hi> and these which proceed <hi>actum irritando vide</hi> Obs: on the the 216 <hi>Act Par:</hi> 14 <hi>Jac:</hi> 6.</p>

And yet by the present custome of the Admirality, though no Living Creature escape, the Admiral secures only the Goods, and restors them, if the true Owner claime them, and prove his Propertie within year and day, being repayed of his Salvage, for which we have no positive Statute; And it seems we have borrowed this from the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>anno</hi> 1226. cited by <hi>Curick tit.</hi> 9.

And I likewise believe, that even after the Year is Elapsed, the true Proprietar may recover his Goods, if he prove the Propertie, and if his Goods be extant; for 1. That which is mine, cannot be taken from me without my own fact and deed. 2. There were as good reason for the King to seize upon Goods that were Robb'd by Land, for the Proprietar quytes his Goods as unwillingly in the one case as in the other, 3<hi>ly.</hi> Even in Goods that are thrown over Board for the securitie of the Vessel; the Law presums no design in the Proprietar to quite them; as <hi>de relicta § Fin.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> 3. That though this Act appoints Advocats to give their Oaths of Calumnie, if their Client be absent, yet that only holds in matters of Fact, as to which the Advocat is not obliged to swear, if his Client be present, but as to alleageances in point of Law, the Advocat is obliged to swear though his Client be present.</p>
               <p>Thir Verses are taken out of <hi>Hostiensis tit. de jur.

               <p>I have heard it debated in the Process, <hi>Keith</hi> contra <hi>Purves, March</hi> 1684. That an Adocat was not obliged to give his Oath of Calumnie, whether he thought the Right upon which he Debated was really to the behoove of the Earl of <hi>Marshal,</hi> but only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that the Advocats had good reason to Debate it was not to his behoove, because their Client said so to them; But if this be allow'd, an Oath of Calumnie will signifie nothing, for Advocats may alwayes find <hi>subterfuges</hi> to depone, that they have good reason to urge such a thing, for they may think their Clients Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sufficient warrand for them, though they are convinced the same is palpably false; whereas the true Design of the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was to debar Advocats from proponing Defences, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in Pleas which they thought unjust and Calumnious.</p>

               <p>The reason why in the former Act and this, the Advice of the King's Council is still exprest as necessary, was, because the King was then Minor, and His Person had been several times sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd.</p>

For though the Rubrick sayes, that <hi>the Buyer shall keep the Tacks,</hi> yet the Act bears, <hi>in whose hands soever they come</hi>; and as no Tacks-men craved ever a Confirmation to Defend against Forfaulting; So it would shake louse all poor Labourers Securities, if they were not Secure against such delinquences; and might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably prejudge much the Kings interest, by tempting them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Master, if they knew that they behoved to be Forfault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Crime. This Decision agrees with <hi>Craig, pag.</hi> 206. and a Decision 1570. <hi>Hume</hi> of <hi>Manderstoun</hi>; But the Council did justly think, that this Decision could not defend the Tacks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a Castle from giving it up to the KING, since Fortalices are not made for labouring the ground, and therefore also Summar Warnings are allowed from them on six days.</p>

And a Tack set from 5. Years to 5: years. upon payment of the old Dutie, was not sustained against a Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular Successor, 26. <hi>July,</hi> 1631. But Tacks are valid, though they bear no special time of Entrie, since the present time is in the Construction of Law presumed to be the time of Entrie in that Case, 4. <hi>December,</hi> 1629. As also since a Tack must have a certain Tack-Dutie, as well as a certain ish; Therefore, where the Tack con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not a certain Tack-dutie it is not valid against a Singular Successor, and thus a Tack bearing, that a Tacks-man should retain the Annualrent of 600. merks, for the Tack-dutie would not have been valid against a Singular Successor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, in that case, there would nothing have been payable to the Singular Successor, yet if the least <hi>superplus</hi> had remained over the payment of the Annualrent, though it had not exceeded one pennie, the Tack would have been valid, because there would have been in that case a Tack-dutie, 15<hi>th June,</hi> 1664. <hi>Thomson</hi> contra <hi>Reid</hi>; and for the same reason, a discharge of the Tack-dutie before hand, though for an onerous cause; and though the discharge was in the bodie of the Tack, will not Defend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Singular Successor; and this very Statute bears, that these Tacks shall be valid to the Tennent for sicklike Maill as they took them, for 31. <hi>January,</hi> 1627. <hi>Ross</hi> contra <hi>Blair</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it being controverted whether a Tack set to a Creditor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was to have Retention of the Tack-dutie, aye and till he were payed, and relieved of the Sums due to him, should be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against a Singular Successor, it was found, 11<hi>th. December,</hi> 1671. <hi>Currie</hi> contra <hi>Oliphant,</hi> that the Tack was to be sustained, because the Retention was to be allowed, by an expresse Clause in the Bodie of the Tack it self, and not by a Paper a part, and because the Tacks-man was to pay a dozon of Hens, and another of Capons by and attour the Sums that he was to retain, and was to relieve the Setter of the publick Burdens, which was to be in place of a Tack-dutie; but though this may hold where the Tack bears
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59223:24"/>
the Sums expresly, whereof the Tacks-man is to have Retention; yet it were very dangerous to allow Tacks bearing only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; that the Tacks-man should retain his Tack-dutie till he were payed, and Relieved of what Sums were due to him, and for which he stood engaged; and if this were allowed, no Singular Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor could know even by Production of the Tack whether there were any superplus due, which might be in place of a Tack-dutie, and it cannot be denyed, but that the first design of this Statute, was to continue Tacks, the Tacks-man paying the true Dutie, and therefore this Act sayes; They shall be valid for sicklike Mail as they took them for, and <hi>Craig pag.</hi> 205. sayes,
<q>Si assedatio facta fuerit, nec certam contineat mercedem, non valet ex jure &amp; si eadem merces assignata sit calono, assedatio non valet;</q>
And therefore a Tack for 36. <hi>lib.</hi> of Dutie, bearing, That the Tacks-man should retaine the Tack-dutie for Reparations, was not sustained, in so far as concerned the Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though the Reparations were necessary, nor is there any ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite <hi>Hypothetick</hi> in our Law for Reparations, as in the Civil Law; but if the Singular Successor had known of such a Clause, in the Tack, the Lords inclined to think that the same had been obligator against him; and yet a Singular Successor is not obliged to consider a prior Seasine, except it be Registrated, or a prior Disposition, nor any Assigney a prior Assignation 5. <hi>February</hi> 1680. <hi>Rae</hi> contra <hi>Finlason.</hi>

Lord <hi>Lee</hi> contra <hi>Mark Porthouse,</hi> but it is yet so to be understood, as that the Land set in Tack, must be valued according to what it was worth when the Land was Wodset; for if the Land be improved by the Wodsetter, it were unjust, that the Wodsetter should lose thereby, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Wodsetter improving Land, will not lose his Tack, though the Land become worth more than twice the Tack-dutie, and though it would seem, that there is a contradiction in this Act because it sayes in the first Part, <hi>That if any man has Wodset Lands, and syne takes them for long time after the Land be quit out, for half Mail, or near there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that these Tacks shall not be keeped, but if they beset for the very Mail, or near thereby</hi>; yet the answer is, that this Law was so worded, to show that the Parliament designed, that Tacks after Wodset should not be keeped after Wodsets are Redeemed, except they be set for a Tack-dutie, somewhat proportionable to the worth of Land; and because this could not precisely be determined, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by comparing these two expressions; It is clear, that such Tacks after Wodsets are to be sustained if they be set for more than the half of the Real-dutie, though they be not for the full Dutie.</p>

But to this it is answer'd, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Act</hi> needed not secure against the Granters, for they were ever, and still are Sufficient against them; and this <hi>Act</hi> runs not against singular Successors, but in general, declares such Tacks null, as Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant and Usurary, and so should be null against all; but if there be a valuable consideration to clear, that they are not Forc'd and Exorbitant, they will be sustain'd, as in the case, <hi>Polwart</hi> contra <hi>Hume, January</hi> 21. 1662. where it was found, that a Tack for a Dewty, far within the worth, to be granted after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, was valid, because it was by one Brother to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who might have given it for a Patrimony, and the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who got the Wodset, was excluded by a Liferenter thirty six years.</p>
               <p>Thir Tacks who are to begin after the Redemption of Lands Wodset, are valid against singular Successors, though they be not cloathed with Possession, prior to the singular Successors Right, because they are a part of the Reversion, and not because they could not begin till the Lands were Redeem'd; for if that were a good reason, then a Tack whereof, the Entry is deferr'd, for several years, should be valid against the singular Successor, who had got a Disposition of the Lands, long after the setting of the Tack, though before the Tack was cloathed with Possession, which is not true; and if it were true, since Tacks are not to be registrated, no man should know with what Tacks Lands are burdened, for this can be known no otherwise but by Possession.</p>
               <p>These Tacks which are to follow Redemption, are valid, though they be not contained in the Wodset, if they be of the same Date with the Wodset and Reversion, as <hi>Hadingtoun</hi> Observes; but in this case it may be doubted, whether these Tacks ought not to be Registrated, since all eeks to Reversion are to be Registrated, or else how can a singular Successor know them; and yet it is otherwise in Tacks, which are to follow Redemption of Annualrents, for as an Annualrent is different from the Land, it being but a Servitude upon the Land, so the Possession of the one cannot in Law be constructed to be the Possession of the other.</p>

made before the Dissolution, are declar'd null by the 236 <hi>Act</hi> 15 <hi>Par. Ja.</hi> 6. This was so decided, <hi>February</hi> 25. 1669.

That Decreet bearing this Interpretation of all former Annexations is Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and it is appointed, <hi>That</hi> Orknay <hi>shall not be Dissolv'd without the Advice of the whole Parliament, and for great and weighty Causes,</hi> relating to the publick interest of the whole Kingdom, to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered before the Disposition, least by a previous Disposition, the Parliament should be pre-determined in their deliberation; and therefore it would appear, that where there is a Disposition grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before Dissolution; not only is that Dissolution null, as being <hi>filius ante patrem</hi>; so that it could not make the preceeding Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to Convalesce, even from the date of the Dissolution: But that a posterior Disposition, relating to that Dissolution, would be null, since by the first Disposition, the Parliament is once pre-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the Deliberation; and therefore it would be fit, that such Dissolutions should expresly bear this difficulty, and dispense therewith, <hi>per expressum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is here also fit to observe, that Dispositions of Rights, made of annex'd Property, in the Kings Minority, though Ratified in Parliament, and after the Kings Majority, are null; albeit any other Deed done by a Minor, in his minority, is valid, if Ratifi'd in Majority; For though it may be alleadg'd, that the reason of this Speciality is, because Ratifications pass in Course, and the Grounds are not considered, as ought to be in Annexations. Yet the true Reason of the Speciality must be, that it is easie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ratifications of such null Rights; and therefore the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to preclude all from seeking them, has declar'd, <hi>That they shall not be valid when obtain'd</hi>; or else, because a lawful Dissolution is pre-requisit, and ought to preceed a lawful Disposition of annex'd Property; And therefore, though the Ratification might supply the defect of the prior Disposition, yet it cannot supply the nullity arising from the want of the former Dissolution.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59223:32"/>
                  <hi>be Set for the Policy of the Realm</hi>; because, as I conceive, the Kings Vassals being thus freed from the Labouring of their own Lands, they might be the abler to serve the King in his Wars; and the Land likewise be the better Laboured, by these Sub-feuars, who could attend the Labouring thereof. Upon which Words, <hi>Our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord, shall Ratifie and approve the said Assedation.</hi> It was Debated, whether a Sub-feu, set by vertue of this Act, did fall under the Forefalture of the Vassal, though it was not Confirm'd in the Person of the Sub-vassal; and it was alleadg'd, that the Sub-feu could not be quarrell'd; because the King by this <hi>Act,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invited men to take Sub-feus, it was not just, that the Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given by a publick Law, should become a snare; and having promis'd to ratifie and approve the Sub-feu, that promise being insert in this publick Law, was equivalent to a Confirmation; and therefore should defend against a Forefalture, as well as a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation could have done; and though these Words were alleadg'd only to import a <hi>promise to Ratifie,</hi> which did imply, that appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation should have been made for a Confirmation. Yet to this it was answer'd, that this was an Invitation, and the Words sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd thereto, must therefore be considered as a present Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, especially, seing there is no time prefixt for craving of a Confirmation, nor any irritancy annex'd to the not craving thereof.</p>
               <p>It was likewise urg'd, that by the 91 <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 6. <hi>Ja.</hi> 4. This Sub-feuing should be no cause of Forefalture; and that since this <hi>Act</hi> would defend against Ward and Recognition, it should much more defend against Forefalture upon Treason, for that being a most personal crime, of which, not only the Sub-vassal is innocent, but oft-times concurs with the King, against his own Supe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sal himself is somewhat accessory, because he receives the Right, upon which the Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is infer'd.</p>
               <p>And whereas it was urg'd, that by the 37 <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 2 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. The Sub-vassals of the Kings Vassals, who were Forefalted at that time, are secured, if themselves were innocent; which <hi>Act</hi> had been unnecessary, if this <hi>Act</hi> had secured them, and that <hi>Act</hi> is declar'd to have been only Temporary, <hi>&amp; pro eâ vice,</hi> by the 201 <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 14 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>To this it was answer'd, that by this <hi>Act,</hi> such Sub-feus are only allow'd, as are set for the just avail, and all other Feus might have been quarrell'd; and therefore that <hi>Act</hi> was made to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Sub-vassals of Forefalted Persons, whose Rights might have been quarrell'd upon that head, or else that <hi>Act</hi> has been made <hi>ad majorem cautelam,</hi> and to prevent all debate, which is most usual.</p>
               <p>Upon this Debate the Lords found, that this Sub-feu fell not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Forefalture, this general Law being equivalent to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <hi>February</hi> 12. 1674.

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59223:32"/>It has also been Debated, whether Wodsets Feu'd out are secur'd against this <hi>Act,</hi> as well as Lands irredeemably Dispon'd, and I think they are, since a Wodset Right is as properly a Feu, as an irredeemable Right.</p>
               <p>What is meant in this <hi>Act</hi> by the <hi>competent avail</hi>; for which Ward Lands may be feu'd, is dubious, but the <hi>just avail,</hi> for which the Kings proper Lands may be feu'd, is by several Acts of Parliament, declar'd to be the Retour-dewty, or new extent; and therefore I think that the <hi>competent avail</hi> here, must also be interpreted to be the Retour-dewty, and in <hi>January</hi> 1680. betwixt the same par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it was found, that though the competent avail be the Retour-dewty, exprest in his Service; yet the Sub-vassal getting a part of the Lands feu'd to him, he ought to pay no more for the competent avail, but his proportion of his Superiours Retour-dewty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that if a Charter was given him blank by his Superiour, which he fill'd up himself with a special <hi>Reddendo</hi>; the Charter was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore null, and he was only lyable in his just proportion of the said Retour'd-dewty, and the Vassal, if he pleases, may by a Process against his Superiour, get this competent avail, to which his share should extend, determin'd, and that being specifi'd in his Service, will thereafter become his Retour-dewty, though ordinarly the Sub-vassal, to prevent expence, or by mistake uses to Retour the Dewty that was payable by his Superiour, especially if the difference be not great.</p>

               <p>OUr Laws and Acts of Parliament, have granted to His <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Majesty, the Custom of all Goods, exported or to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, as is clear by the 251 <hi>Act</hi> 15 <hi>Par. Ja.</hi> 6. The Words being, <hi>That His Majesty, with consent of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Council and Estates; have ordain'd that all Cloath, and other Merchandice, brought into this Realm, shall pay Custom,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore the King being, as to this, founded in the Rule, all must be lyable, except where there are clear exceptions derogating from the general Concession.

               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:59223:35"/>By the foresaid <hi>Act</hi> 251 <hi>Par.</hi> 15 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. Customs are to be paid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the King, according to the use of any other Kingdom, But so it is, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y the use of other Kingdoms, and particularly of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the Nobility, Barons and others, pay Customs for all imported Goods.</p>
               <p>The Customs being granted for the Defence of the Kingdom,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and the Support of His Majesties Royal Dignity, it is just that the Nobility and Barons, should rather pay than any others, since they are of all others most concerned, to maintain the one, and support the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> being a Countrey, that has no Consumption, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Goods, save within themselves, if the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> should not pay, they might bring home all their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and so there should be little or no Customs due to the King.</p>
               <p>They might colour the Trade of Merchants, by granting simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat Commissions, for bringing home, the Goods of Merchants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> their names, which would occasion much Perjury, and at least put the Customers to a Process, and Suspend the payment of the true Customes, till that were clear'd by Process.</p>
               <p>When this Kingdom thinks fit, to guard against the importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any forraign Goods, they do this by imposing great Customs,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> as was lately done by imposing 80 <hi>per cent.</hi> upon all <hi>English</hi> Cloath. But so it is, that if this exemption were allow'd to the Nobility and others; these Prohibitions would be useless and ineffectual, for those Prohibited Goods might be brought in by them, and so our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactories, could never be encouraged, nor could we force other Nations, justly to ballance their Trade with us, or keep our Money within our own Countrey.</p>
               <p>If these Exemptions were allow'd, there could be no possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of lessening and curbing the Luxury of the Nation; For the Nobility and Gentry, might still wear what they pleas'd, at least it would be an encouragement to them, to bring home things superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they being free from Impositions, whereas their being burdened with Custom, would discourage them to bring home su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perflueties.</p>
               <p>The Exchequer has in their Tacks been in use to set the Customs with express order, to allow no exemptions, and the Customers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> have exacted Customs from the Nobility and Gentry, which proves the Kings Possession, and the acquiescence of those, who plead the exemption.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is pretended, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Customs are regularly a Duty, impos'd upon Merchandice and Traffique; But what Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen, import for their own use, is not Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, nor Commerce. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.

               <p>It is answered, that as to the first, Custom being impos'd for the uses foresaid, the payment should be regulated, by the reason that imposed the Imposition, and not by the nature of the Traffique; and if that were a good reason, neither Merchants, Burg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though that were generally true, as it is not, yet the Laws and Customs of this Kingdom, should alter the case here, as it does in other Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>To the 2<hi>d</hi> it is answered, that 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. There is a great difference in our Law, betwixt these, persons being free to Trade, and so not lyable to the pains of un-free Traders, and their being free from paying of Customs; and the first two Acts cited, do certainly Militate only in the first case, by granting them a freedom to Trade, but not a freedom from paying of Customs. And as to the 251 <hi>Act</hi> 15 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r. Ja.</hi> 6. It does not grant an exemption from Customs. And albeit it may be urg'd, that the first part of that Act having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Customs on all, and this being an exception, it must be an exception from the Rule, yet consequential Arguments, should not take away express Laws, nor is this an exception, but rather a Cautionary Reservation, and these use to be insert <hi>ad majorem Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telam</hi> and should never be extended beyond the Terms of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. But so it is, that the Reservation is not conceiv'd ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, but only conform to the Laws and Liberties, granted to them before. And therefore since it cannot be subsumed, that there are any former Laws, granting this exemption from Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, it must be restricted to the priviledge of their b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing free, from the pains of un-free Trading only. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that the former Laws, allows them only the liberty from being punish'd as un-free Traders, as to what they import by their own Servants, for their own privat use, and as the return of Commodities of their own product, exported by them. Nor does the 143. <hi>Chap. Leg. Burg.</hi> extend further than to exeem Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, from in-land Customs, due to Subjects. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The time of that Act, the Customs were justly impos'd, upon exported Goods, But thereafter His Majesty was graciously pleas'd, to lay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the Customs upon the imported Commodities; and so having very much freed the Barons of a Duty, that burdened their product, it was not reasonable, that their product and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Goods should be both free. Likeas, so convincing was this Argument, that albeit some shadow of an exemption, was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, when the Customs were imposed, upon their product by the first Constitution, in that Act 251. yet when this burden was transferred, by the Act 1670. from the export to the import, the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59223:36"/>
Barons did require no such exemption, nor does the Act bear any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And so this Act is innovated, by the said posterior Act.</p>
               <p>As to the Excise, there can be no pretence, for any exemption from it, since there being no such Duty extant, the time of the Act 251. That Act cannot be extended to the Excise; And whereas it is pretended, that by the <hi>Act</hi> 3 <hi>Sess.</hi> 2 <hi>Pa. Ch.</hi> 2. This exemption is renewed after the imposing of Excise.</p>
               <p>It is answered, that the said Act <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. does not express any such priviledge, but only says, <hi>that the Regulation of the differences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Burghs Royal and Burghs of Barony, introduced by that Act, shall be but prejudice, to the Noblemen, Prelats and others, of their priviledge of importing any of the Goods, allowed to be then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, for their own and families use allenarly</hi>; Which can only be interpreted, to relate to their freedom of Trading, that being the only design of the whole Acts, in which there is no design of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricting or innovating any thing, with relation to Custom or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.</p>
               <p>And thereafter since at all times, the King is founded <hi>quoad</hi> the payment of Customs; much less ought we to Debate this with him at this time, when His Majesty is content to lessen his uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Right in the Customes, for the enriching these who contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert this his Right, by consenting at their desire to discharge, more imported Goods, than would pay him more Customes then he can expect from these not exeemed.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding of these Reasons, yet by the present Tacks, Noblemen and Gentlemen, are exeem'd from paying Customs for what they bring for their own use, but they are not, exeem'd from Excise, nor the additional Duties, because these were granted to the King, in contemplation of what the King lost by the want of the Custom due to him, upon Goods now prohibited, <hi>vid.

Likeas it was wont to be of before,</hi> That the King Himself may be Judge as he pleases; but though the King did call an Action to be judg'd before himself, that was depending before the Lords; yet His Majesty was thereafter pleased, upon a Representation of the Inconveniences that would arise, to refer it back to them; and some interpret this of the Kings power, when he is sitting in his Judicatures; though I think the Act will not bear that gloss: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59223:38"/>
that Charge, by electing other Judges, yet they did not debar themselves from that power; and therefore we use to say, that all Jurisdiction in <hi>Scotland</hi> is cumulative and not privative; but if the King take the Cognition of any Cause, He will try it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Forms of that Court, where it should have been decided; and therefore if He be to Try a Criminal, the Pannel will be allow'd to hear the Witnesses Depone against him, and the matter of Fact will be judg'd by an Assyze. If it be alledg'd, the meaning of this Act is only that the King may Try any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on He pleases in His Council, that is to say, His Session, (for of old, the Session was call'd His Council, and yet they are call'd His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and Session) To this it may be answered, this A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t appoints that Causes should be first Try'd by the Judge ordinary, and if he either refuse to Judge, or Judge wrong, the Council is to Judge, not the Cause, but him, and this induc'd some to urge, that the absence from the Host could not be pursu'd before the Council, though the punishment was restricted to an arbitrary punishment; for which they brought these Reasons: 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That this would confound the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and limits of all the Judicatures, which are the great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of our Law, and which is contrary to this Act. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It is the great security of the People, that when they are Try'd for Crimes, they should be judg'd, not only by the learn'd Judges, as to Relevancy, but by their Peers, whom they may judge again as to the Probation. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Advocats are to be heard before the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Court, but not before the Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Debate is to be there in Writ, which obliges a Judge to do justly, and the Probation is to be led in presence of the Pannel. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Before the Council the Crime may be refer'd to Oath, which is not suitable to the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Law, even where the punishment is arbitrary, except the Party be by Act of Parliament, oblig'd to Depone, as in the case of Conventicles. 5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. There are no Exculpations before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which are necessary in Crimes. 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Several Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appoint, that cases may be pursu'd before the Criminal Court, or Council, when that is intended, and which were unnecessary, if all Causes might naturally be pursu'd before ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>It being likewise Debated from this Act, that a Judge for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unjust Decreet, might be pursu'd before the Council in the first instance for oppression, the Council did in <hi>January</hi> 1682. find, that a Sheriff, or other inferiour Judge, could not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For in effect all these are Obligations.</p>
               <p>Whereas the <hi>Act</hi> says, <hi>except document be taken thereupon</hi>; the meaning is, that Diligence upon the Writ, that is, to prescryve interrupts Prescription; and thus Horning upon a Bond, or Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon an Action interrupts, <hi>July</hi> 6. 1671. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>rae</hi> contra <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>donald</hi>: and payment made by the principal Debitor, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The form and stile of Decreets of Compryzings of old was shortly thus; the Clerk of the Compryzing, who was ordinarily the Sheriffs Clerk, did extend a writing upon Parchment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all the particulars of the procedor, to wit, that the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor having obtained a Sentence before the Sheriff, decerning his Debitor to pay a certain sum, and there being no Moveables to pay it, the Sheriff came to the ground of the Land with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of most knowing Persons within the Shire selected for that effect, and there measured off some aikers for the Money, and Sheriffie corresponding, each aiker paying so much victual, and the victual being valued to a suitable Rate, redeemable always by the Debitor within the time contained in the Act of Parliament; and which Writing is Seal'd with the Seals of the Judge, and of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</p>

If the King were seeking this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty by the Debitors Death, the Comprizer would exclude him, by alledging that the Debitor was Denuded, and it were unjust, that by this means, the King should want his casualty from both. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The King falls all other casualties by the Compryzer, such as Recognition, Liferent Escheat, and the Compryzer by being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, can do all Deeds that other Proprietars can do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should be lyable in all other casualties, as they are. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.

To this it was replyed, That though a Comprysing resemble <hi>pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus praetorium,</hi> yet it is truely an alienation, and this Statute ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the Land to be sold to the Creditor; and by the whole Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Comprisings, it is clear that it is a judicial Vendition made under Reversion, and so resembles more a legal Wodset; and therefore as in Wodsets, the Wodsetters Marriage would fall, so ought the Comprizers, and its being a legal Vendition and Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation appears from this also, that it falls under Recogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and Recognition presupposes still <hi>alienationem dominij.</hi> The Lords upon this Debate (which clears much the nature of Comprisings) prefer'd the King, for they found that the Compriser being Vassal, the Marriage fell by his Death, he having died before the Comprysing was redeem'd, and therefore it may be doubted, whether the Compriser will have his relief, for the damnage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by this casualty from his Debitor, before the Lands can be redeem'd from him, since it fell by his fault, in not paying him; nor is the Debitor much prejudg'd, for if the Lands had not been Compris'd, this casualty might have fallen by his own Death, and the inconveniency urg'd from the multitude of Marriages, that would fall by the great number of Comprizers, is of no w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

refused to consider the Probation it self, and the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the Writs produc'd, but remitted the same to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; though it was alleadg'd, that it being objected here, that the Writs produc'd for Probation were vitiated, the Lords could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge this as being <hi>species falsi</hi>; but withal, the Lords declared, that if the Inquest desired to know whether the Papers were vitiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would give them their opinion therein. The Lords of the Session themselves have been sometimes the Inquest, as in Serving King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the First, Heir to Queen <hi>Ann</hi> his Mother, and King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second, to the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi>; though it was alleadg'd that this was inconvenient, because no other Judge could reduce their Verdict; but certainly, either the Parliament might have reduc'd it, and found them guilty of Error, or the Lords of the Session might have reduc'd their own Verdict, upon new Probation; for in this case they proceeded, not as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judges, but as Members of Inquest.

               <p>It is likewise observable from this Act, That the Assyzers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting wilful error, shall first be called before the King and His Council, who shall give them a great Assyze, and therefore His Majesties Advocat having pursued an assyze of Error in <hi>July,</hi> 1681. He first called the Persons who had committed the Error before the Privy Council, and asked at every man Judicially, whether he owned his Verdict, or not, and these that owned not the Verdict, were not insisted against Criminally, but when this Cause came to be called before the Justices. It was alleadged for them, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That the Verdict bearing only, that the major part had assoilȝed <hi>&amp; non constabat,</hi> who had assoilȝed, and who condemned, which should hold much more after the Act of Regulations, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1672 by which it is appointed that the assyzers should mark in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, who assoilȝed or condemned, to the end it might be known who should be pursued for Error, but this was repelled, because the King being prejudged by the Verdict, their giving in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict made all Criminal, and such as were free should prove their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, for else it should be impossible for the King to be able otherwise to prove the guilt, which should hold much more now, because the Assyzers had, by the Regulations, an easie remedie for preventing this, <hi>&amp; sibi imputent,</hi> who did not mark who assoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zied, and who condemned; and though these Regulations intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that, as a further remedie for clearing this matter, yet that was not necessary; for there were Assyzes of Error, before Assyzers were ordained to be so marked. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. It was alleadged, that this was not wilfull, nor by partial means, which partiality behoved necessarily to be proven by the words of the Act, but this was repelled, because the Error being clear, the Error behoved neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily to be wilfull, and by partial means, nor was it possible to prove these occult qualities otherwise than <hi>ab ef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

By this Act, Assyzes of Error are only to be allowed, where the <hi>Persons Indited are shown before the Assize,</hi> in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syze of Error, but so it is, the persons assoilȝed by the former as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syze were Forfaulted in absence, and were neither then nor now shown to the Assyze; and the reason of this speciality, is, because,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59223:46"/>
if the Persons assoilȝed were present they might prove their own innocencie, and so clear likewise these who assoilȝed them, but this was repelled, because, by these words <hi>Shown before the Assyze</hi> is only meaned, that their Designations and not their Persons should be shown to the Assyze of Error, for else there could be no Assyze of Error in Forfaulters in absence, and though the Persons were present, they would not be admitted <hi>hoc ordine,</hi> to clear their own innocence, and the Assyzers should have assoilȝed, or condemned according to the Probation then led.</p>

               <p>It was argued from this Act, in the case of the Town of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgow</hi> against <hi>Borrowstounness,</hi> that the Burrows Royal had the only priviledge of having all Goods Liver'd and Loadned at their Ports; and which is likewise clear by <hi>Act</hi> 88 <hi>Par.</hi> 6 <hi>Ja.</hi> 4. and by <hi>Act</hi> 152 <hi>Par.</hi> 12 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Without this priviledge, the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows were not able to pay the sixth part of the burdens laid upon them, in contemplation of their Trade, since a Clandestine Trade
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59223:53"/>
without this might be carry'd on by the Burghs of Barony and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, who, since they may retail publickly, might have the same priviledge as they, if they had likewise power to import publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. This was most convenient for securing the Kings Customs; because where ever there is Livering allow'd, the King must have Waiters, and upon which consideration, the Magistrats of Burghs Royal are by the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> appointed to assist the Kings Customers; and whereas it was pretended, that the priviledge of Commerce was <hi>inter regalia,</hi> and consequently the King might grant a free Port to any Burgh he pleas'd. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The priviledge of a free Port was different from that of Livering, and Loadning. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The Acts of Parliament cited, did only discharge Strangers to Load and Liver, which is yet more clear by the <hi>Act</hi> 120 <hi>Par.</hi> 7 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. To which it was reply'd, that the King and Parliament, having former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted the sole power of Loadning and Livering to free Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, it was no diminution of his power to assert, that he could not give a new grant of that to any, whereof he was formerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested. To the 2<hi>d</hi> it was reply'd, that the sole priviledge of a free Port granted by a King to a Burgh of Regality, or Barony, can extend no further, than that thereby they may have the priviledge of bringing into their Port, the Goods proper only to be sold by them. To the 3<hi>d</hi> it was reply'd, that this Act discharges Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and others to Liver at any place, except at the Ports of Burghs Royal; and though in that 120 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 7 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. This Act is repeated, as relating only to strangers, yet in the next line, Strangers and others are in that 120 again discharged; Likeas by the Acts of Parliament, the sole priviledge of <hi>losing</hi> and <hi>loosing,</hi> is declar'd to belong only to Burghs Royal, which in Sea-faring Terms, signifies <hi>loadning</hi> and <hi>un-loadning.</hi>

We observe both in our Plate and Coyn, the same Standart with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; but the Standart of the <hi>French</hi> Plate is finer than their Coyn, to discourage their Subjects from having much Plate, and encouraging them to bring it to the Mint, for current Money. The reason that is alleadg'd, why this alley is allow'd to both Gold and Silver is commonly said to be, because they are not malliable without some mixture of Copper, but the contrary will appear to these, who use to refine Silver with Lead, and Gold with Antimony, by which, Gold and Silver may be brought to the exactest fineness, without all mixture, and they are then most malliable and soft; but the true reason why the Copper is added, is, because without it, both Gold and Silver would be too soft, and so too much subject to wearing and loss, as appears in the <hi>English</hi> Rose-nobles, and the double of <hi>Hungarian</hi> Ducats, and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Cequins; for which cause the Emperor now adds more Copper to his Ducats; and the <hi>English</hi> make no more Rose-nobles, or any other Gold so fine.</p>

The reasons of which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision were 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That Appanages given to Children, do in their own nature imply to be only Temporary, and whilst the Child exists to whom it is provided for an Appanage; and therefore since we have not the foundation of the Principality it self, we must construct it to have been thus erected. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. By this <hi>Act</hi> it is ordain'd, that when there is no Prince, the Vassals of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality shall come to Parliament, and none can come to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> such as hold of the King; and that same <hi>Act</hi> says, <hi>till the King have a Son,</hi> who shall be immediat betwixt the King and them, which clearly demonstrats, that till there be a Son, they hold immediatly of the King. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. This is yet more clear by the 16 <hi>Act</hi> 1 <hi>Par. Ch.</hi> 1. and the 58 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. Whereby Lands holding of the King and Prince, are <hi>aequiparate quoad</hi> all legal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. When the Kings comes to any Estate <hi>jure privato,</hi> by Succession or Forefalture, these Lands alter their nature, and the Vassals hold of the King as King, and are not consider'd as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Subject as formerly; and therefore the same should hold when the principality by the not existing of a Prince, returns to the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59223:55"/>
Crown. 5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. By an express Decision observ'd by <hi>Dury.</hi> It is found, that whilst there is a Prince, the Lands of the Principality hold of the Prince, but when there is no Prince, they hold of the King. 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi> When there is no Prince, the King Dispones the Casualties, and sometimes the Lands, as he does these of his own Property, and it were absurd to assert, that when there is no Prince, the King Dispones as Administrator, for else he behov'd to be comptable; nor can there be an Administrator where there is no Pupil: but the King is term'd sometimes an Administrator <hi>ex errore stili,</hi> or <hi>ad majorem cautelam,</hi> or else the King is truly made to Dispone both as King and Prince to keep up the Principality as a distinct Fee and Erection, lest otherwise the knowledge of the Lands might perish, the Erection being lost. 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.

               <p>The Sheriff of the Shire, or Baillies are warranted to take Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Superior or Donatar, that they shall not waste nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Lands during their right which our practique extends also to Liferenters, who are bound to find Caution to keep up their Liferent Houses and others in the same condition wherein they found them, and this is conform to the common Law; and all this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is learnedly treated, <hi>Christin. ad leges Mechlin. tit.</hi> 14. And the way how this Caution is to be found, is fully cleared, <hi>Act</hi> 15. <hi>Par.</hi> 4. <hi>Ja.</hi> 5. where this shall be explained: This Act is founded upon <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>l. Malcolm</hi> 2. by which there is a mutual Contract betwixt the King and his Vassals, in which that King <hi>Distribuit totam terram Regni Scotiae hominibus suis &amp; omnes Barones concesserunt Wardam &amp; rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium de Haerede cujuscunque Baronis defuncti ad sustentationem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Regis.</hi> And though <hi>Arnisaeus de potest.

Yet I know no man would refuse Land upon this condition; and it is presumable that whilst the Vassal is a Pupil, he will only need an Aliment, but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59223:56"/>
yet I confess that according to the very Text of the Feudal Law, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils are neither obliged to serve by themselves, nor substitutes, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Feud. tit.</hi> 26. <hi>cap.

Tho posterior custume introduced the necessity of Substitutes, <hi>Gloss. in dict:</hi> §. <hi>Si quis.</hi> To which we by the foresaid Contract have added that the Superior shall have the Feu, and not be obliged to accept even of a Substitute.</p>
               <p>It is the received practice of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the Liferentrix should entertain the Heir if she Liferent his whole Estate, which is only founded upon a consequence from this Act, and the paritie of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but in my judgement, this practice is neither warranted by this Act, <hi>Argumento Legis,</hi> nor is it founded upon the Principles of, nor suitable to the Analogie of Law, for as to the Act of Parliament it (being joyn'd with the <hi>Act</hi> 15. <hi>Par.</hi> 4. <hi>Ja.</hi> 5. whereby it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained) ordains that the Donatar to the Ward shall find Caution not to destroy the Biggings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As also that he shall entertain the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Whatever may be said to oblidge a Mother <hi>jure naturae</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain her own Children; and I think this Aliment has been at first founded on that Principle of Justice, whereby <hi>Donatores, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troni &amp; Parentes,</hi> were only lyable <hi>in quantum facere potuerunt,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Lawyers <hi>Exceptio competentiae,</hi> yet there is no reason that a Life-rentrix should be oblidged to entertain an appearand Heir, who is a meer stranger; and this <hi>jus naturae</hi> oblidges the Mother not only to entertain the appearand Heir, but all her Children, as was found in the case of the Countess of <hi>Buchan</hi>: And albeit the Act of Parliament speaks only of Heirs; yet by our Law, even appearand Heirs will get an Aliment allow'd them, though thereafter they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, but it is less clear, if it will be allow'd them after they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>July</hi> 16. 1667. <hi>Hamilton contra Symington</hi>: And yet in this case they are but meer strangers, and can no more be called Heirs, or appearand Heirs, after Renunciation; as also, though this Act mentions only Ward Lands, yet it is <hi>ex praxi</hi> extended to others who have no Ward Lands, the 22 <hi>Feb.</hi> 1673. <hi>Finnay contra Oliphant</hi>; And though both the Rubrick and the words of the Act provide only Aliment for Minors, yet it is extended to appearand Heirs, who are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors, as in the case of <hi>Rig contra</hi> the Lady <hi>Carberrie</hi>; nor will it be sufficient that the Life-rentrix offer to entertain the appearand Heir in the Family with her, as <hi>Durie</hi> observes, the 14. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1627. <hi>Noble contra</hi> his Mother; nor is this only extended where the Mother Liferents all, but it is even extended to the case where all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors Estate, beside what is Life-rented, is not sufficient to pay the debt, and is affected by legal diligences; as was found 13 <hi>Feb.</hi> 1662. <hi>Antonia Brown contra</hi> her Mother; but it may be very well doubted whether this last Decision may be extended where the debt is only personal, and I find the Lords did refuse to decide this point in a case debated 1667. betwixt the Lady <hi>Staniehill</hi> and her Son, though the Son there alleadg'd that he sold his Land to hinder Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising, and if it had been Comprized she would have been lyable. And this Action for Alimenting the Heirs was still sustained against both the Grand-Fathers Relict, and the Fathers Relict <hi>pro rata,</hi> of their Life-rents which they had of the appearand Heir; albeit it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg'd that the Mother having a nearer relation, and being the Wise of him who spent the Estate, should be only lyable, or at least first ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, 12. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1677. Laird <hi>Airdrie contra</hi> the two Ladies; but yet I find the Grand-Father was found lyable in no proportion with the Mother, where he had only reserv'd a mean proportion to himself, when he did Infest the appearand Heirs Father, 7. <hi>July,</hi> 1629. It may be doubted whether a Husband marrying the Life-rentrix, having given her a provision in contemplation of this Joynture will be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Aliment, since he is a meer stranger, to which all that can be answer'd is, that he was oblidg'd to know it was lyable to this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and if he will be found lyable, it may be doubted if he will not be free from the provision given in contemplation thereof; <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam causa data causa non sequuta.</hi> As also, it may be doubted whether
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59223:57"/>
the pursuing such an Action as this will infer a Passive Title, seing the appearand Heir is thus <hi>lucratus,</hi> but yet I think it will not, since he reaps thereby no advantage which would have accresced to the Creditors to whom no part of his Aliment would have belong'd; and even appearand Heirs renuncing, will have right to an Aliment, as is observed before.</p>
               <p>The Civilians think that a Mother is oblig'd to Aliment her Child till it be past three years of age, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>C. de Patr.

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 65.</note> whereas all Summonds were to be executed upon 21. days, by the 6 <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 1. <hi>Ja.</hi> 3. which is the Act here related to, though not cited; and by an Act of Sederunt 21 <hi>July,</hi> 1672. this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is extended to recent Intrusions, which is a kind of Spuilȝie in immoveables.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. That since the Parliament thought that the former Act of Parliament could not be derogated from without an express Statute, it may seem strange why the Lords do priviledge any Summonds by their own power, or if they had power, why they did not make actions of recent Spuilȝie and Intrusions to come in upon 6 days, as well as Exhibitions, Poynding of the Ground, and other less favourable Causes? to which nothing can be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but that there was an old custome for the one, but not for the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 2. That the last words of the said Act, <hi>viz, That there shall be no exception dilator admitted against that Summonds, it being lawfully indorsed,</hi> seem to imply that the Judge should grant no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation, though that properly cannot be called an exception dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or else that the Judge should restore <hi>spoliatum ante omnia,</hi> and admit no exception upon property nor compensation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but these are not properly dilator defences, or that the not continuation of the Summonds upon 21 days warning, should not be objected, but that is likewise unnecessary, since the first part of the Act did that sufficiently; and so these words with that sense had been superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and therefore I rather incline to think that these words were only designed to show the Parliaments great desire to have recent Spuilȝies dispatch'd, though ill exprest; it may be doubted whether recent Spuilȝies being only such as are raised within 15 days after the Spuilȝie is committed, Sabbath or Feriot days should be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst the 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 3. That it may be argued that Spuilȝies regularly cannot be pursued before the Sheriff, or else why is it allowed here as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to recent Spuilȝies, that they may be pursued before the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59223:61"/>
and it seems the reason why Spuilȝies regularly should not be pursued before Sheriffs, is because the dammages in Spuilȝies must be taxed by an Oath <hi>in litem,</hi> and that is <hi>nobilis officii,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot be administrated by any inferior Judge, nor can these inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Judges modifie what is sworn by an Oath <hi>in litem,</hi> that being yet <hi>nobilioris officii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BY this Act the Sheriff is to have 12 pennies of every pound, as Sentence-money, which was called <hi>Sportulae</hi> by the Civil Law,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 66.</note> and this Sentence-money is still in use.</p>
               <p>THis Act appoints every Lord and Laird to have a Cuningare; but it may seem strange why none are allow'd to have Dove-coats,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 74.</note> except they have ten Chalder of Victual in Rent; and yet men are commanded to make Cuningars, since Cunins may prejudge Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as Doves do; which makes <hi>Craig,</hi> as I conceive, doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Vassals may have a Cunigare, except the same be granted to him: But though the Superior grant Cunigars with the clause <hi>cum Cuniculis Cuniculariis,</hi> the former doubt remains, for the Superior cannot prejudge third Parties. To which these answers may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie.</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That it was necessary by this Act once to invite men to plant Cunigars, whereas Dove-coats were frequent before the Act 1617. that restricts them.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. This command is only to Lords and Lairds, which implyes men of Estates, but is not given to all the Lieges; and I doubt not but if an Heretor of ten Chalders of Victual, or thereby, should plant a Cuningar, but his Neighbours might by common Law, and an Argument drawn from the Act 19. <hi>Par.</hi> 22. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. force them either to inclose their Cuningar, or to give it over.</p>
               <p>BEfore this Act the Heir could not have been pursued for any debt till the Executor was first discust;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 76.</note> but by this Act the Heir is made lyable to the Creditor after his <hi>annus deliberandi</hi> expires, both as to Heretable and Moveable debts, which was very just, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>quoad</hi> the Creditor, they all represent the Defunct, but yet he will get his relief of all Moveable debts from the Executor, as far as the Inventar extends; and if he be served Heir within the year, the Creditor will get action against him for heretable debts, even within the year, for by entering Heir he renounces his benefit of deliberating, and if he possess the Estate, he ought to pay the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retable debt; but though he enter Heir within the year, he should not be lyable for Moveable debts by this Act till the year expire, since as to these he has no benefit by entering, and though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the benefit of deliberating, yet he does not renounce the benefit of this Act, <hi>Hading.

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Quaeritur</hi> if the Executor be discust, and found insolvent, may not the Heir <hi>eo casu</hi> be pursued within year and day, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59223:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
seems strongly founded upon the reason and decision of this Act: And yet by the present practice, the Heir enter'd is lyable even for moveable debts, tho pursu'd within the year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> Though by this Act the Executor is bound to find Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to relieve the Heir of all moveable debts, yet there is no Law obliging the Heir to relieve the Executor of Heretable debts, but <hi>de practica,</hi> the Lords sustain <hi>ex paritate rationis,</hi> actions against the Heir for relieving the Executor of all Heretable debts, 7. <hi>March,</hi> 1627. <hi>Faulconer contra Blair, vid.

               <p>Though by this Act all the Standarts of Weights and Measures, are ordain'd to remain at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; yet by Act of Burrows they have been divided thus; The Standart of the Stone-weight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains at <hi>Lanerk,</hi> because the chief Commodity of old that was weighed by the Stone-weight, was Wool, which was paid in to the King at <hi>Lanerk,</hi> and was therefore call'd <hi>Lanae-Arca.</hi> The Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dart of the Pynt or Jugg, was left at <hi>Stirling,</hi> because the Kings Court recided there.

               </p>
               <p>The Time of Labouring is not determin'd by this <hi>Act,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords have special regard in this to the Custom and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of each respective Country, as was decided <hi>November</hi> 15. 1627. So that tho they were labouring, yet if it was not the season of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, they have not the priviledge.</p>
               <p>But if the Debitors Labouring be ended, though the Season of Labouring be not generally ended in the Country, yet his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Goods may be poynded, <hi>November</hi> 22. 1628. <hi>Spootswood h. t.</hi> tells us that <hi>a paritate rationis,</hi> this priviledge was extended to a going Salt-pan, <hi>sed leges in privilegiis non sunt extendendae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Debitor have no other moveable Goods; the Creditor may poynd even Labouring Goods, by the words of this <hi>Act</hi>; for it seems the Parliament thought it not just that a man should lose his Debt altogether, and though the priviledge here granted may seem only a delay, yet by abstracting the Goods, during that Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension, he may be totally frustrated.</p>

               <p>When the Crowner got the Porteous Roll, containing the names of those who were to be cited to the Justice-Airs, he was obliged to cite them at their dwelling houses, and Paroch Kirks, by this Act; for by the word, <hi>Arrestment</hi> in this Act, and many of our old Laws, is meant Citation; but if they can be apprehended personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this manner of citation is unnecessary, though that be not here exprest. By the present Practique, if they cannot be apprehended per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally, they are to be cited at their dwelling houses, and at the Mercat Cross of the Head Burgh of the Shire where they live.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this Act if the persons to be cited can be found, the Crowner is to take Surety of them for their appearance, which the Sheriff yet does; but if they be not <hi>Streinȝieable,</hi> that is to say, if they cannot be apprehended, then the Crowner was to arrest their Goods, like to the <hi>annotatio bonorum</hi> in the Civil Law.</p>

               <p n="4">4. If the King has no Castles within that Shire, they were to be deliver'd to the Sheriffs, who are bound to keep them securely.</p>
               <p>By this Act the Crowner is to be answerable for the Caution he takes; for the Act says, <hi>That they shall take sicker Surety, sik as they will stand for to the Kings Grace</hi>; and it is pretended that the Clerk of the Justiciary is not bound for the Surety he accepts, though the Crowner and Sheriff be, because the Crowner is oblig'd to know who are <hi>Solvendo</hi> in the Shire, which the Clerk of the Criminal Court cannot know through all <hi>Scotland</hi>; but I think that both are equally oblig'd, <hi>viz.</hi> to do exact diligence to know the solvency of these they take; and since the punishment of taking insufficient Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not here exprest, it seems to be Arbitrary, and in effect to take Surety that is notorly insufficient, seems the same guilt with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Malefactor escape.</p>

If the Complainer would attach the Tennent, &amp; the Master be required to deliver him up, whether he liv'd in the Shire with the Tennent, or not, he was to be punish'd as Art and Part, in case he refused to deliver him up; and by this Act he is only to pay the Unlaw. But this last Act is not well observ'd, for now no man is lyable for his Tennent, except Highland Heretors, and Chiefs of Clanns, who are to find

Caution to the Council for that effect, <hi>vid. Acts</hi> 92, 93, 94, <hi>&amp;c. Par.</hi> 11. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. But by this Act it is clear that the King may make Masters still lyable for their Tennents who live upon their Ground, and that in any Court, though this Act appoints them to be presented to Justice Airs, since <hi>eadem est ratio,</hi> and this Act was adduc'd for justifying the Proclamation that appointed Masters to be lyable for their Tennents, <hi>vid.

It may be doubted what this unlaw is, since in Justice Airs if the Tennent was absent, he was ordinarly denunced Fugitive; for the Justice Court does not unlaw an absent Defender, and therefore by this unlaw may be mean't what the Tennent would be unlaw'd in, if he had been present, <hi>vid.

               <p>These Acts are also extended to all such as have Life-rent Tacks from the Heretors, without payment of any considerable duty, though the words of this Act run only against such as have Liferent Infeftments; but this Act should not be extended to such as have Liferent-Tacks, for payment of an equivalent Duty, <hi>Qui sunt

In that case it was also found, that this Act did oblige Donatars of Liferent-Escheats, to find Caution to maintain the Houses, Orchyards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which fall under his Gift; but <hi>quid juris,</hi> if the Fisk retain Liferents so faln in his own hands, <hi>&amp; peregr. de jur. fisc. tit.</hi> 1. <hi>num.</hi> 35. is of opinion, that <hi>usufructu sisco legato siscus non satisdat de utendo fruendo arbitrio boni viri</hi>; but it is hard that the Heir should be in a worse case by the Crimes of the Liferenter, or their going to the Horn, so that his Estate should be thereby expos'd to mis-managment: and albeit where a Liferent is left to the Fisk, Caution may seem to be remitted by the intention of the Party, yet that should not be extended to the case of its falling to the Fisk, without his consent, and it rather seems, that since a Donatar is ty'd to find Caution, that therefore the Fisk should.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In all cases where Treason is to be pursued after the death of the Committer, it is necessary to call the appearand Heir, because his right as appear and Heir, is to be forefaulted by the sentence; but though it is ordinarly believ'd that the bones of the Committer must be raised and brought to the Bar; yet this is not necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> That the Common or Civil Law is a sufficient warrand to sustain Actions in this Kingdom, because of its great equity, except where the same is over-ruled by a contrary Law or Custom.</p>
               <p>The Civil Law to which this Act relates, is <hi>l. ult, ff. ad l. Jul. maj. Extinguitur crimen mortalitate nisi sorte quis Majestatis reus suerit.</hi> It has been much doubted amongst Lawyers how far the Delict or Crime of the Predecessor should infer Action against their Heirs, which may be resolv'd in these conclusions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all corporal punishment expires with the Committer, <hi>nam noxa caput sequitur, instit. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>tit de nox, Act.</hi> 8. <hi>per tot. &amp;</hi> §. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to any Civil conclusion, <hi>&amp; quoad interesse pecuniarium</hi>; the Civil Law did only sustain restitution against the Heir in two cases, <hi>viz. If either Litis-contestation had past in the Defuncts own time, or if the Heir had got advantage by the Crime or Delict of his Predecessor,</hi> as if for instance, the stollen Goods, or the Money conceal'd by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor had remain'd with him, §. <hi>Non autem omnes</hi> 1. <hi>Instit. de perpet. &amp; temporal. Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By the Canon Law the Heir was lyable to refound the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage done by the Predecessor, though there was neither <hi>Litis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi> past in his time, nor did any advantage remain with his Heir, <hi>cap: ult. ext. de sepult. cap. in literis ext. de rapt.</hi> And though the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Canonists seem to the Lawyers of this age more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, they thinking <hi>Litis-contestation</hi> but a subtilty, yet I conceive
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59223:73"/>
that there was very much reason for the Civil Law to require <hi>Litis-contestation,</hi> since if the Defunct himself had been pursu'd he might have alleadg'd many things which might have defended him that were unknown to the Heir; as for instance, he might have alleadg'd that the Sheep alledg'd to be stollen were intrometted with by the Owners warrand, and might have cited Witnesses who were present, which the Heir could not know, and yet our practice follows the Canon Law, as more conscionable.</p>
               <p>I find that in the 5. Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> it was after debate found that <hi>Origin</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> might be Anathematiz'd after their death, though <hi>Vigilius</hi> then Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> maintain'd, <hi>neminem post mortem condemnandum,</hi> and this occasion'd a great Schism.</p>
               <p>There is interpos'd betwixt this and the next Act a distinct Act in the Black Impression, whereby the King and Parliament ordain several Acts past in the last Parliament to be now pronounc'd and authoriz'd by his Grace and the three Estates, which has been left out, because the way of authorizing Acts now, is only by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties touching them with the Scepter, and if they be Voted in a former Session, they may be touch'd without any new Vote or Act; but if they were past in a former Parliament, they must have a Vote, else they cannot be call'd the Acts of the present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>

The King Revocks all Tacks and Assedations made for longer space than five years; which Article is also repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 31 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 11 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. and the reason of it is, because there is too great a restraint laid upon the King, by these long Tacks, hindering Him thereby to improve His Property, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty; for which Reason likewise, long Tacks set by Tutors, are not allow'd, and though this may seem only to extend to Tacks sett by Kings in their Minority; Yet by the same Reason, and upon the same Act, a Tack of the Customs set by the King in His Majority, to <hi>Fleming</hi> and <hi>Peebles,</hi> was Reduced before the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, <hi>November</hi> 17. 1634. because the Tack was sett for seven years. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The King here Revocks all Rights made by Him, by evil or false Suggestion, or by expreeming of a false Cause, though or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly false Narratives do not Reduce Deeds betwixt Majors; this Lawyers terms <hi>ex suppressione veri &amp; expressione falsi</hi>; and this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Revocation, agrees with the Civil Law, <hi>Vid. tit.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59223:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that no Deed done by a Minor in his Minority, is Revockable, except Lesion could be alleadg'd; yet <hi>Craig</hi> is of opinion, that the very setting of a Tack is a Lesion, though it be not set under the true value, <hi>Minorem enim laedi puto quod rei suae liberâ administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione prohibentur lib.</hi> 2. <hi>dieg,</hi> 10.</p>

These base Infeftments are introduced with us contrary to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Feudal Law, which allows no Feudal conveyance without the Superiors consent, and were introduc'd rather by accident than upon design.

               <p>Base Infeftments, though yet wanting possession, are preferable to posterior Arrestments, but they are not preferred to posterior Life-rent Escheats, except they attained possession <hi>in cursu rebellionis, Feb,</hi> 21. 1667. <hi>Miln contra Clerkson</hi>; and before this <hi>Act</hi> of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1540. they were still preferr'd to posterior publick Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But by this <hi>Act</hi> it is statuted that publick Infeftments cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Possession for year and day shall be preferr'd to base In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments not cloathed with possession, though prior, which <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptione juris &amp; de jure,</hi> are by this declared to be simulate Rights.</p>
               <p>But though this <hi>Act</hi> requires that the publick posterior Infeftment be granted for onerous Causes, yet a publick posterior Infeftment, though gratuitous, will be preferr'd, 3 <hi>March,</hi> 1626. <hi>Law con.

               <p>And likewise, if other diligence was done, or the time was so short that a years possession could not be attain'd, then a Terms pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session was sustain'd; or though there followed no possession at all, the base Infeftment will be preferr'd to a posterior publick Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interveening, before the possession could be acquir'd, 13 <hi>Feb.</hi> 1624.

Lady <hi>Craig contra</hi> Lord <hi>Loure</hi>; and in our Law the Husbands possession is accounted the Wifes possession whether the Husband possest by himself, or by Wod-setters, or Comprizers deriving right from him, though it was alledg'd that this was not the Husbands possession, they having possest <hi>proprio jure,</hi> which priviledge is not only introduc'd <hi>ob savorem detis,</hi> but because she could not possess, for which reason likewise a base Infeftment for relief is preferr'd to a posterior publick Infeftment upon a Comprizing, albeit the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner was only charged to make payment, which was found a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent distress, 28 <hi>July,</hi> 1625. As also, after a solemn dispute, the Lords did prefer a prior base Infeftment for warrandice, though not cloathed with natural possession to a posterior publick Infeftment, 9 <hi>January,</hi> 1666. <hi>Brown contra Scot.</hi> But here the Infeftment of warrandice was given <hi>simul &amp; semel</hi> with the Infeftment of the principal Lands, so that there remains still a doubt as to Infeftments of warrandice given <hi>ex intervallo,</hi> but Infeftments for relief were not found sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloath'd with possession, by payment of the Sums for which they were granted as Infeftments of warrandice are by possession of the principal Lands, because it was alledg'd that it was more natural that the possession of one Land should cloath the Infeftment of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than that possession of Annualrents should cloath an Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Land, and that there might be greater collusion in payment of Sums, than in possessing of Lands, because Creditors might alter their Sums, and take new Assignations, or retire old Rights, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as no man could quite his principal Lands, 26 <hi>June,</hi> 1677. <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond contra</hi> the Tennents of <hi>East-barns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a Fathers possession as Life-renter was not sufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a base Infeftment given to the Son to a posterior publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment granted to a second Wife, or to any Creditor the like in a base Infeftment granted by a Good-sir to his Oye by the Daughter, which was not found sufficient, being cloathed with the foresaid Civil possession of the Good-sirs reservation of Life-rent to exclude a posterior publick Infeftment, 17 of <hi>July,</hi> 1635. And this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session by the Husband, or Father, or Disponer, is called <hi>possessio per constitutum,</hi> and is not favourable in a competition with other Creditors, and therefore a Factory granted by the Father to the Son to uplift the Mails and Duties of Lands dispon'd, to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den base by the Son of the Father, was not found sufficient to cloath the Sons Infeftment, though there were several Processes intented upon the Factory, 10 <hi>July,</hi> 1669.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Act</hi> requires natural possession, by labouring the Land, or Civil, by uplifting the Mails and Duties; and before Registers were invented, that kind of possession was only able to put their Creditors in <hi>mala fide,</hi> but though Civil possession hath been found sufficient, such as obtaining of Decreets, and payment of Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, albeit the same had no relation to the Infeftment of Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59223:77"/>
but was only relative to the Bond whereupon the Infeftment followed; yet the setting of a Back-Tack by the accepter of a Wodset, hath not been found sufficient to maintain a base Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except payment of the Back-Tack-Duty had likewise fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, so that it appears that <hi>possessio Naturalis vel Civilis sufficit sed non illa quae a doctoribus dicitur civilissima,</hi> as is a Back-Tack.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>Act</hi> also, such as make double Dispositions to defraud their Creditors, shall be declared infamous, and shall be punished in their persons and Goods at the Kings pleasure, and this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is extended against such as make double Assignations, and the 140 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 12 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. bears, <hi>That no Dewty shall be Dispon'd to two sundry persons, which is Crimen stellionatus by the Law,</hi> and though this <hi>Act</hi> does not make double Dispositions to be <hi>crimen Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionatus,</hi> yet it is so in effect; but the Civil Law distinguisheth thus, <hi>l.

               </p>
               <p>Though by this Act Superiours receiving double Resignations are guilty and punishable as said is, and seing to receive such Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is a great prejudice, because it puts the Parties to great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and that the Superior is presum'd to get, and may get advantage by accepting such double Resignations, or contributing to the making of such double Rights, therefore they ought likewise to be lyable in Damnage and Interest to the Party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.</p>
               <p>BY this Act it is Statuted, that a Charge to enter Heir,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 106.</note> may be directed against the Successors of the Defuncts (they being of perfect age) to enter to their Lands, within fourty days, Year and Day being first past, after the Decease of the Predecessor, and a Comprizing being led upon their failȝing to enter, the same shall be as valid as if they were Infeft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> Though this Act bears the being of perfect age, yet Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors may be validly charged to enter Heir <hi>de practica</hi>; but seing this Act is only made against such as may enter, but wilfully ly out: It might have been doubted whether Minors in Ward-Lands may be Charged to enter Heir, for these cannot enter till they be twenty one years compleat; but by our constant Practique they may be Charged, since this is necessary for compleating the Creditors Diligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> That this Act does not appoint that generally such Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should pass against the appearand Heir, as if he were entred, but only that his Land may be apprized; and therefore <hi>quaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> what execution may be gotten against his moveable Heirship, and it may be urg'd that the same may be affected, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functs other moveables; for though they be Heirship, <hi>respectu hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redis,</hi> yet they are but moveables <hi>respectu Creditoris,</hi> for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come only Heirship after they are drawn; and yet it hath been found, that the moveable-heirship may be adjudg'd, and by that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59223:78"/>
Decision it would appear, that they can only be affected by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising; but there is a Warrand wanting in this Act for apprising them; there is an Act of Sederunt <hi>anno</hi> 1613. allowing Charges to enter Heir, to be rais'd within the Year and Day, but the Summons thereupon must be execute after the Year and Day expire, but not till the fourty days expire after the execution of the Charge; but this <hi>annus deliberandi,</hi> being introduced in favours of the appearand Heir, he may omit the same, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunce within the year if he pleaseth; Neither can an Adjudicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on following within the Year be challeng'd <hi>ex eo capite, July</hi> 14. 1631. albeit that the said Act appoints, that a Charge to enter Heir may be rais'd after Year and Day expire, after the Defuncts Death; Yet the Year and Day must only be computed from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearand Heirs birth, if he was <hi>posthume Spots. tit.</hi> Heirs, <hi>Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoun</hi> contra <hi>Houlerton, &amp; de jure civili posthumus non habetur pro nato cum de incommodo ejus agitur l. etiam §.

If the Incumbents survive <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> they have right to the preceeding half year by their own right, and to the next half year by their Ann; but if they survive <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> they have right to the whole year (<hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>January</hi> to <hi>January</hi>) by their own Right, and to the half of the other year as Ann; and though it may seem incongruous, that a Minister living till the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59223:80"/>
last day before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> gets no more than he who lives till the day after <hi>Whitsunday</hi>; Yet this is regulated in this case, as it is in all Liferents, and this is allow'd them for the support of their poor Families, for that <hi>Act</hi> declares that the same shall belong to their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, without necessity of a Confirmation; and though this <hi>Act</hi> declares, that the <hi>Ann</hi> is to belong to their Executors, yet in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that is not well exprest, for it belongs to their nearest of Kin and Wife, though they be not nominated, nor Confirmed Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. If there be Bairns the Ann is equally divided betwixt them and the Wife; but if there be no Bairns, it is divided equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Wife and nearest of Kin, she having right in that case to a half, and not to the whole, because the Ann was of old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd in favours of the nearest of Kin, as appears by this Act, for Church-men had no Wives under Popery, when this Ann was introduced, <hi>June</hi> 24. 1663. <hi>Elizabeth Scremgeor con.</hi> the Executors of her Husband.</p>
               <p>Though this Ann falls to Bishops and Ministers, who die Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents, yet it belongs not to such as renunce voluntarly their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as was found in Bishop <hi>Lightoun</hi>'s case; and neither Manse nor Gleib fall under the Ann, for the last Incumbents Executors have no right to the Gleib, except the same was Sown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Decease, <hi>July</hi> 6. 1665. <hi>Colvil contra</hi> the Lord <hi>Balmerino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason why <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and not <hi>Martinmas</hi> is made the Term in this case is, because Ministers Stipends are payable out of the Teinds, or by somewhat which is come in place of them; and therefore <hi>Michaelmas</hi> should have been the ordinary Term, and generally in payment of all Stipends, the Terms of <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Sowing is then ended, and <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> because the Corns are then separated from the Ground, are the legal Terms for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Stipends.</p>
               <p>The foresaid <hi>Act</hi> allows an Ann to Bishops, though the <hi>Act</hi> of the General Assembly, and the Kings Letter in <hi>anno</hi> (by which Anns were first establish'd as they now are) did not mention them, and under the Bishops Ann falls only the Quots of such Testaments as were actually Confirm'd in his Lifetime, or during his Ann, <hi>July</hi> 6. 1676. Captain <hi>Wisheart contra</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>: By the Canon Law, the Annat was a <hi>quota</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Pope and Colledge of Cardinals, by every Intrant, out of his Benefice, <hi>Vid. Tush. concl.</hi> 329. But a Casualty like ours is payable in the Protestant Churches of <hi>Germany, Vide Carpzov. jus consistoriale tit. de decimis.</hi> It may be doubted whether that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim <hi>annus inceptus habetur pro completo,</hi> does yet hold good in other Beneficiary cases; for though it be altered by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>quoad</hi> Annats; yet where there is no Act of Parliament, why should not the old Rule hold. But I rather think that the Act extends to all Benefic'd Persons, albeit the Rubrick mentions only Bishops and Ministers, and so there are two Errors in the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the said 13 <hi>Act,</hi> one, in that it mentions only Bishops and Ministers; another, in that it mentions only their Executors, and not their Relict, or nearest of Kin; and the Rubrick should have
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59223:80"/>
born, <hi>Act Regulating the Ann of Benefic'd Persons,</hi> which shews also how weak the argument is, <hi>a rubro ad nigrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ancient Bishops allow'd sometimes the uplifting of the first years Rents of Benefices, for assisting Christian Princes against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, but the Popes thereafter reserv'd them to the use of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, upon pretext to supply the general necessities of the Church. Pope <hi>John</hi> 22. <hi>extravag. suscepti. de elect.</hi> was in this follow'd by <hi>Boniface</hi> the 9. who stated them in an ordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, till the Council of <hi>Basil</hi> oppos'd the same; and still many Learn'd Doctors of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church it self condemn'd them as Simoniacal, whereupon the <hi>French</hi> Kings did by Concordats, force the Pope to pass from the same in <hi>France.</hi> They were call'd Annats, Anns, or Annals, because they were <hi>fructus primi anni</hi>; and it seems with us, they were not at the Popes disposal absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, else this Act of Parliament could not have dispos'd upon them. But it seems our Kings have in Parliament assum'd to themselves, what others settled by Concordats with the Popes, as may appear in all the <hi>Regalia</hi> throughout the whole old Acts of Parliament. The whole Doctrine of Annats is excellently Treated by <hi>Antonius Nassa de materia annatarum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I conceive our Ann which is a half Years Stipend, comes from the <hi>Saxon</hi> reform'd Church, wherein <hi>ultra Salarium quod defunctus Aecclesiae minister promeruit ex singulari beneficio viduae ac liberis dimidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us gratiae annus assignetur Carpzov.

                     <hi>Item,</hi> Extract of the Burrow of <hi>Diep,</hi> consenting to the Registra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the saids Letters in the great Council, all dated in <hi>anno</hi> 1635.</p>
                  <p>Conform to these priviledges, the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> did in <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1586. discern the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation to have right to all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and to be capable of Employments, and free from all Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, whereupon the learned Mr. <hi>Servin</hi> that famous Advocat has written a learned Book, maintaining the saids Priviledges, to which he has annexed the said Decree and Sentence. Likeas the saids Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges are acknowledged by <hi>le Bret,</hi> in his Book concerning the Prerogatives of the Kings of <hi>France, cap. Naturalization,</hi> and many other <hi>French</hi> Lawyers, and by <hi>Favin</hi> in his above-cited Theatre.</p>
                  <p>By vertue of which Rights and Priviledges, the <hi>Scots</hi> have been alwayes esteem'd as Naturaliz'd in <hi>France,</hi> and have enjoy'd all the Priviledges due to the Natives, until of late, that there being 50 <hi>Sols per</hi> Tun imposed upon forraign Bottoms, some of the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Rouen</hi> were charg'd for payment thereof, whereupon <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>math, Blackburn</hi> and <hi>Pringle,</hi> having been pursu'd in the <hi>Cour des aides,</hi> they were not only in <hi>July</hi> 1649. absolv'd from paying any part of the said Taxation, but the Collectors were ordain'd to restore unto them what they had exacted upon that head: As also, there being a <hi>Scots</hi> Vessel consign'd to Mr. <hi>Pringle,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1663. and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charg'd for the said 50 <hi>Sols per</hi> Tun, he was freed from the said Taxation by the Parliament of <hi>Rouen</hi> after full debate, upon 16 <hi>June,</hi> 1663.</p>
                  <p>On our part likewise the <hi>French</hi> enjoy all the Priviledges of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and possess Lands and Heretages, and are as capable of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession as the Natives are, nor pay they any Taxes, being declared free conform to the said Treaties by several Acts of Exchequer in <hi>Scotland,</hi> though the <hi>English</hi> have impos'd a <hi>Crown per</hi> Tun to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense that 50 <hi>Sols.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all which it appears most just and reasonable that the <hi>Scots</hi> should have all the Priviledges of the Natives of <hi>France,</hi> because,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The same have been granted to them by solemn Charters and Concessions, which though it had been free to the <hi>French</hi> King to have at first granted, yet being granted, he was not thereafter by the principles of Justice free to have recalled the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though meer gratuitous priviledges might be recalled, as they cannot, yet renumeratory priviledges granted for Services done, as these Charters can never be recall'd without an open violation of Justice; and it is undeniable that <hi>Scotland</hi> has spent more blood and money in the <hi>French</hi> service than all those priviledges were ever
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59223:87"/>
worth, and it's known that the last Concessions were granted to the <hi>Scots,</hi> for giving Q. <hi>Mary</hi> in Marriage to the <hi>Dauphine</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> whereby if he had had Children, <hi>Scotland</hi> it self had been annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>France</hi>; and because the <hi>Scots</hi> did refuse her to K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6 of <hi>England,</hi> they were thereupon invaded by the <hi>English,</hi> and their Nation was almost ruined.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though renumeratory Concessions might be quarrell'd, as they cannot, yet mutual Treaties and Contracts can never be abrogated nor taken away without the consent of both the Parties Contracters.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Scots</hi> being secured by Decisions of the Supream Courts of <hi>France,</hi> as said is, they have thereby the greatest security that the Law of any Nation can give.</p>
                  <p>As these reasons may convince any man that it were against the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of <hi>France</hi> to take away the priviledges of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, so the principles of prudence and policy seem very much to oppose the taking them away, for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What can any other Strangers expect from Concessions, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Contracts, when so old and well deserved priviledges are questioned, it being very well known to all Nations that <hi>Scotland</hi> has deserv'd extraordinarly of <hi>France,</hi> and this Alliance has been famous beyond all the other Alliances now known in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation have upon this account refused all other Alliances, to their great loss and prejudice, in so much that they have oft times suffered their Kingdom to be invaded, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rass'd and ruin'd by the <hi>English,</hi> because we preferr'd the <hi>French</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance to theirs, and as our Countrey-men have alwayes been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to spend their lives for the <hi>French,</hi> so within these 50 years we have lost 100000 men in their service, who did not amongst them all bring home 20000 Livers to this Kingdome; and it's very well known how ready we are to own the <hi>French</hi> interest in all Courts and Countreys where we live abroad.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> may come to divide by the failure of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Line in <hi>England,</hi> and so it still seems pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the <hi>French</hi> King not to extinguish his interest in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas it may be pretended that we have forfeited our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges by declaring War against the <hi>French,</hi> to this it is answer'd, that 1. The denouncing of War by us was only the effect of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary obligation upon us as being a part of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and not a War enter'd into by <hi>Scotland</hi> upon any National account. 2. By Treaties following upon the War, all things are restor'd to the former condition they were in, except in so far as former Treaties were innovated by express conditions; but so it is there is nothing inserted in any of those Treaties to the prejudice of our former Leagues and Priviledges, and therefore they must revive and return to the same force and vigour they were in before the War.</p>
                  <p>I find this Act Registrated and Recorded in the Books of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59223:87"/>
Sederunt, and generally it is observable, that most of the publick Papers, whereupon any legal Debates or Securities might depend, were inserted in the Books of Sederunt, which was somewhat like the <hi>French</hi> Custom of verifying in the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> (that is the same with our Session) the Kings Edicts, and thus the pacification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Regent and the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1572. and many such Papers are inserted there; and of old even publick accidents were likewise insert, such as Ecclipses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Patronages in <hi>Scotland</hi> are either Laick or Ecclesiastick; all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages are accounted Ecclesiastick, which either belong to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick persons, or which have flowed from the King (though by Infeftment) since the Reformation, in so far as concerns these Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, wherein the King succeeds in place of the Pope, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation, was accounted universal Patron; Laick, Patronages are such as have been Disponed before the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by His Majesty, and these pass by Infeftment, or have been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Laick persons since, and these must be now obtained by a Signature from His Majesty, even by such as either contribute, <hi>dotem, sundum, edisicationem.</hi> The words of the Concession are, His Majesty grants <hi>advocationem, donationem &amp; jus patronatus Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae de,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is expedient to know the differences betwixt the old Laick Patronages, and these which are Dispon'd by the King since the Reformation, because by the Act of Annexation, <hi>July</hi> 1587. all

Kirk-lands, are annexed to the Crown, and an exception is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made of Lands which pertains to the Benefices of Laick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages, which exception is only extended to Laick Patronages, which were lawfully established before the Reformation; which is also conform to the Canon Law, by which the Pope may prejudge an Ecclesiastick Patronage, but cannot a Laick, <hi>Bevg. de union. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neff.</hi> §. 3. <hi>num.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>After one is prefer'd by the Patron, he hath only <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> but his Collation and institution which is given him by the Church-man, to whom the Presentation is directed, gives him <hi>jus in re</hi>; but if the Benefice to which the Patron presents be a Benefice without Cure, that is to say, having no care of Souls, as Provestries, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendries, <hi>&amp;c. eo casu,</hi> there needs no Collation or Institution, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 11. 1632.

                  <hi>Selden</hi> in his Treatise of Tithes, asserts that the Right of Investiture, was at first reserv'd by Lay Patrons in the Foundations, and that the Gleib and Tithes were at every Vacation confer'd by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons to the new Incumbents, by some Simbole or Ceremony, not differing from our Seasines; and it is probable that for some ages after <hi>Charles Martels</hi> Reign it was so, because Tithes were then Transmitted by Laical Infeudations; and I have seen several Rights of this nature in the Chartularies of our Abbacies; and though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards this was condemn'd by many Councils, yet Kings reserv'd to themselves the vacant Fruits of Bishopricks, as being Founders and Patrons of these Benefices; and with us this Clause, reserving to the Patrons power to retain these Stipends during the vacancy, seems a vestige of their old pretension; but I shall examine all this very fully in my Treatise of Tithes.</p>
               <p>If the Bishop refuse to admit one presented by the Patron, then recourse must be to the Arch-bishop, and if he likewise give not redress, then the Council will give Letters of Horning to Charge the Ordinary to receive the person presented; and by that Act the Bishop may refuse to admit a person, who hath not reserv'd to himself a sufficient Maintenance in setting Back-tacks of his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage to the Patron, which paction is accounted Simoniacal, and the Lords of Session declar'd only Judges competent thereto, though by the <hi>Ch.</hi> 2 <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>R.

Nor do we read that any Kings were Crowned, except <hi>Joash,</hi> in Scripture, and <hi>Clovis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> was the first that was Crowned; nor are any Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this day, neither is a Coronation Oath requisite, <hi>Sisenandus</hi> being the first who in the 4 <hi>Tolletan</hi> Council gave such an Oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Christians, as <hi>Trajan</hi> was the first among the Heathen Emperors, <hi>Gregory</hi> was the first of our Kings, who <hi>anno</hi> 879. gave the first Coronation Oath, having embraced the Christian Faith, in which he was very zealous, swore to preserve it; but this Oath was not made to the people, for they were not present, but to GOD; nor could he, as <hi>Blackwood</hi> observes, <hi>Apol. pro Regib. c.</hi> 26. bind his Successors, <hi>quia par in parem non habet Imperium,</hi> nor could he bind himself for them to the people, <hi>quia Cliens jurat Domino non Dominus Clienti, tit. de formâ fidelitatis, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Feud.</hi> Likeas it may be said that this Act being made in the King's Minority, and being prejudicial to the right of Blood in his Successors, it falls under his Revocation, made <hi>Par.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. whereby he expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocks every thing which might hurt the priviledge of the Crown, which this <hi>Act</hi> 8 would do, if Kings were thereby debarr'd from Succession, for differing in Religion from their Subjects: This is contrary to the Confession of Faith, which tyes us to obedience to our King, though an Heretick; and since private Subjects are not debarr'd upon this account from their property, the King ought not to be debarr'd from the exercise of his Government, which is his Property, and that Kings cannot be debarr'd by a Statute, is clear by all the Doctors, <hi>in Can. qui jura distinct.</hi> 8 <hi>Aecurs. in l.

Some are also of opinion, but injustly, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation is to a King the same thing that Investiture is to a Subject, and therefore as Heirs may continue the possession of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors before the Infeftment, but cannot sell, excamb, or do any other deads of property till he be Infeft, so though a King before he be Crowned may do these things that are necessary for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent administration, yet he cannot hold Parliaments, dispone upon annexed Property, and do any other deeds which require the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Royal Power, till he be actually Crowned: And whereas this Act ordains that all future Kings shall take this Oath at their Coronation and the recept of their Princely Power, which implyes that they should take this Oath before they can admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat: It seems that this implyes a contradiction, for they must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrat in appointing the Coronation, and ordering all things thereto relating; and our King did govern long ere he was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but these words are exegetick only of the Coronation, and by them is meant the recept of his Authority in the Coronation.

               <p>By the 46 Act it is also observable that all the Church-men were then only to give their Oath, for acknowledging and recognoscing His Majesty and His Authority; the Oath of Supremacy having come in only by the 1 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 18 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6.

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 48.</note> and no Kirk mans Manse or Gleib could be feu'd, yet an Heretor to whom a Vicars Gleib was feu'd a year before that Act, was allow'd repetition, <hi>Feb.</hi> 12. 1635.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota.</hi> This Decision is otherwise related by mistake in the <hi>observ.</hi> on the said Act.</p>
               <p>The Manse comes from the Latin Word, <hi>Manere, vid. Seldens</hi> History of Tithes, <hi>pag.</hi> 52. By it we understand the Ministers Dwelling-house, and if the Parson or Vicar had a Dwelling-house or Manse, it belonged to the Minister, but if there was none of these, no other House could be design'd, though it stood within the precincts of an Abbacy, <hi>February</hi> 11 1631. Minister of <hi>Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keithing</hi> contra <hi>John Keir.</hi> If there be no such Parson or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars Manse, the Heretors must build one by the 31 Act of Parliament 1644. but thereafter by the 21 <hi>Act</hi> 3 <hi>Sess. Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. The value is declar'd to be from 500 merks to 1000 pounds, so that the Minister may build a Manse to himself, and he or his Executors will get repetition of what he bestows in building, not exceeding 1000 pounds; but if the Minister build only to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of 500 merks, he will not have action against the Parochion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for more, though not exceeding 1000 pounds, upon pretence that he might have built to that value, <hi>January</hi> 8. 1670. <hi>Charters contra</hi> the Parochioners of <hi>Curry:</hi> Where it was also found, that the Reparation or Building of the Manse, affects not singular Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, and is not <hi>debitum sundi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By that Act likewise it was found, that since Manses are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be built by the Heretors, that therefore Liferenters are not lyable, which Decision may be very dangerous to Ministers, since it may oftimes disappoint, or at least for many Years suspend their Relief; as for Instance, if a Father should denude himself of his Estate, in favours of his Son an Infant, reserving only his own Liferent, and it may be doubted whether such Liferenters <hi>per re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servationem,</hi> may not be lookt upon as Heretors in this, as they are in some other cases; and yet though Liferenters were not bound to build Manses, yet they were found lyable to repair them, these being but <hi>minores impensae,</hi> which required to be presently done; but neither Heretors nor Liferenters will be oblig'd to pay what is to be bestow'd upon Building or Repairing, nor to stent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for that effect, if they have materials of their own. It has been also found that Manses are to be built and repaired where they were burnt or wasted <hi>casu fortuito.</hi>

               <p>A Gleib is that portion of Land that is to belong to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <hi>Gleba terrae,</hi> or a little piece Land, and is by this Act to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend four Aikers of arable Land, or 16 soums Grass, where there is no arable Land, <hi>Act</hi> 7 <hi>Par.</hi> 18 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. These four Aikers are to be design'd out of Lands formerly belonging to the Parson or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car; and if there be none such, they are to be design'd out of Abbots, Prioresses, Bishop, Friers, or any other Kirk-land lying within the Bounds of the Paroch, <hi>Act</hi> 161 <hi>Par.</hi> 13 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. which

order is exactly to be observed in the way set down by this Act, as <hi>Dury</hi> observes, <hi>July</hi> 13 1636. <hi>Halyburton</hi> contra <hi>Paterson</hi>; yet I find that Bishops Lands were design'd before Abbots Lands, because that Bishops have greater interest in the Cure; and albeit it may seem that the designing the most ewest or nearest Lands to the Manse for a Gleib be in favours of the Minister, and for his ease; yet the Lordsfound a Designation null at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Heretor, whose Lands were designed, because there were other Lands nearer to the Manse, for else any Heretors Lands within the Paroch might be designed for a Manse out of prejudice.</p>
               <p>By the 116 <hi>Act</hi> 12 <hi>Par. Ja.</hi> 6. It is ordained, that Ministers who are provided to Churchs, where there was no Parson or Vicar for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, such as Cathedral Kirks, or Abbacies, shall have a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Manse within the precinct of the Cathedral or Abbay, except the Heretors of the precinct provide them to as good a Manse, and as commodious.</p>
               <p>These Designations are to be expede according to this Act, by the Arch-bishop, Bishop, Super-intendent, or Commissioner who shall give their Testimonial, how he and two of the Parochioners have design'd such four Aikers, presently possest by such a man; upon which Designation, with a Supplication from the Minister, the Lords of Session are ordain'd to grant Letters of Horning upon ten days, which is renew'd by the 21 <hi>Act</hi> 3 <hi>Sess.</hi> 1 <hi>Par. Ch.</hi> 2. By which it is also appointed, that such Designations of Manses shall be by such Ministers as the Bishop shall appoint, and two or three of the discreetest Heretors.</p>

But the true reason is because the excommunicat person cannot be <hi>bonâ fide possessor,</hi> since he is so frequently cited.</p>
               <p>BY this Act the Arch-Bishop or Bishop may appoint persons for Taxing the Parochioners, for repairing of Churches,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 54.</note> if the Parochioners Elected to Tax, refuse, upon which Act the Lords are ordain'd to grant Letters of Horning, which is extended to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of Kirk-yard-dykes, by the 232 <hi>Act</hi> 15 <hi>Par. Ja.</hi> 6. But it may seem reasonable that the Patron should repair the Church, since the care of the Edifice belongs to him, <hi>&amp; ejus est incommodum cujus est commodum,</hi> yet our Law burdens not the Patron, But the Parochioners because they get the advantage in it of the Word and Sacraments; for which reason also the Canon Law burdened them in the last place, if there were not a fund for that effect, or if <hi>fructus residui ex beneficio,</hi> were not sufficient, <hi>vid. Paul. de citad. de jur. patr. art.</hi> 5. But for this reason, all who are Parochion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers should be lyable to repair; and yet the Heretors are only lyable, and it would seem that these Heretors should be first lyable, who have bought in their own Teinds, since they have most advantage by the Benefice, the Rents of which Benefice were by the Canon Law burdened with these reparations.</p>
               <p>By this Act also, if any intromet with the Stones or Timber of a demolish'd Church, the Bishops Decreet is equivalent to a Decreet of the Lords of Session, but this is in <hi>Desuetude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Act also the parsons of the paroch should furnish Bread and Wine to the Communion, how oft the same shall be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, and it seems that by the word, <hi>Parson,</hi> should be mean'd either <hi>Rector Ecclesiae,</hi> for he is called the <hi>Parson,</hi> or all the persons who are Parochioners, and which seems reasonable, because they
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59223:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
partake of the Sacraments; and yet Heretors are only lyable, 2. It is clear from these word, <hi>That what is due for Communion Elements should only be due when the Communion is given,</hi> but yet Heretors are lyable yearly, though the Communion be not given, but it should be then given to the poor in that case, and not to the Minister.</p>

               <p>Since the Act of Parliament requires malicious desertion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Divorce, it may be doubted whether Citations at the Peer and Shore of <hi>Leith</hi> to those that are out of the Countrey, or at the dwelling house to these that are within the Countrey be sufficient, since they may be so cited without being malicious deserters; and it were hard that a man being taken with Pirats or Robbers, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily absent without knowing of any such Citation, should for
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59223:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
4 years absence lose his Wife; and though in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church where there is no dissolution of the Marriage this might be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, since upon his return he might recover his own Wife, yet it is most dangerous with us, and though these Citations be sufficient in other cases, yet there is no parity of reason for their being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent here, where malice is required, and where the loss is irreparable. It may be also doubted if a Wife remaining in her Husbands House, but refusing him all access to her, may be said to have diverted, and I conceive she may, for all the reasons in the one case conclude against the other.</p>

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 66.</note>THough by this Act it is declared only that in the competition betwixt such as have obtained Confirmations from the King, the last Right first Confirmed shall be preferr'd, yet this holds also in Rights, holden of other Superiors, because if the Right be given to be holden of the Superior, <hi>&amp; a me,</hi> it is no compleat Right till it be confirmed, and the first compleat right is to be preferr'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> From this Act that the Lords of Exchequer ought not to refuse to grant Confirmations, <hi>&amp; de praxi,</hi> if they refuse, the Kings Vassals protest that their refusal shall not prejudge his right. But I find that where many Creditors were confirmed in one day, the Lords preferr'd them according to their diligence, and there having taken Seasine, and not according to the date of presenting the Signatures, since neither were negligent, nor had used precipitation, for they shun'd to determine that the Exchequer had not preferr'd or brought in all justly, for that were to make the two Courts interfeer, 6 <hi>December,</hi> 1678. <hi>Mill contra Pasoules</hi>; But in the competition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Confirmations, the Lords found that the first who had past the Seals was to be preferr'd, and that the preference of the Confirmation was to be judged by the passing the Seals, and not by the date of the Signature, since it is not the Signature, but the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that preferrs, because a Charter first past the Seals, though upon a posterior Signature, will be preferr'd as the more compleat dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the Seal being in place of the King's Subscription, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the date of the Charter is not still to be looked to, since the Charter bears still the date of the Signature, and the date of the passing of the Seals is proven in our Law by an attestation under the hand of the Keeper of the Seal; for though that attestation may seem to be the testimony of only one Witness, yet it is <hi>actus officii,</hi> and the Minut-Book is a sufficient check upon his attestation, 26 <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> 1680, <hi>Clackmannan contra</hi> Earl <hi>Wigtoun.</hi>

                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59223:99"/>It is also observable from this Act that albeit the Keepers of the Seals are discharged to pass double Confirmations of Rights of the same Lands, yet <hi>de praxi</hi> the Exchequer and Seals pass very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such double Rights <hi>periculo petentis,</hi> and though where the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of the first Right cannot instantly exclude the second, as by clearing that the granter was denuded, and so the second Right was null. There may be some pretext for granting such double Rights, <hi>periculo petentis,</hi> the Exchequer not being Judges competent to the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of double Rights, yet where the first can clearly and instantly exclude the second, there is no reason for passing the second, for by passing such double Rights, the first is put to the necessity of a Reduction, since no Right once passed under the Great Seal can be annulled by way of exception, but only by way of reduction; and since the second right, though null, may be the foundation of a Prescription, and will establish a full right in the obtainer, if he continue 40 years in possession.</p>

               <p>BY this Act the pains of breaking Law-burrows, is to be divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equally betwixt the King and the Party injur'd;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 77.</note> and the reason of this is, because the King is injur'd by the breaking of the Law-burrows; The Charge of Law-burrows being in His Majesties Name; and though ordinarly the Party Charged finds Caution of Law-burrows; yet if after the Charge any prejudice be done, the party Charged is lyable, because the Charge is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd, <hi>July</hi> 8. 1628. <hi>Semple contra Cuninghame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The civil Action whereby this breach of Law-burrows is pursu'd, is call'd <hi>An Action of Contravention,</hi> and must because of this Act of Parliament, be rais'd at the Kings Advocat's instance, as well as at the instance of the party injur'd, and the pursuers Title is the Charge, if no Caution be found, or the Extract of the Bond of Cautionry, if Caution be found; the ordinary Deeds whereby Contravention is infer'd, are beating or stricking the party to whom the Lawburrows is found, or his Servants, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Servants or Tennents were beat upon a special account, no ways relating to the Master; which speciality must be proven, or else its presum'd to have been on the Masters account; and for the same reason it is, that though the stile of Letters of Law-burrows bear, <hi>That the Complainer, his Men, Tennents and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall be Skaithless in their persons, Lands, Heretages, Goods and Gear</hi>; Yet the taking of two Horse from the pursuers Tennents, was not sustained to be a Contravention, because that was not done on the Masters account, nor was the Tennent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pursuer, <hi>January</hi> 28. 1632. <hi>Grant</hi> contra <hi>Grant.</hi> Nor was for the same cause, the breaking up the Tennents House, and taking some Goods out of his Chest, found a Contravention, <hi>February</hi> 9. 1633. <hi>Lindsay</hi> contra <hi>Denniston.</hi> But since it was not a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, because the Master was not concerned in the Injury as these Decisions bear, I see not how the Tennents concourse could have altered the case, <hi>quoad</hi> the Contravention, though in both cases the Tennent may pursue damnage and interest.</p>
               <p>All Lawyers are clear, that there must be clear grounds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury alleadg'd, and therefore feeding bestial upon controverted Lands, is not sufficient, <hi>December</hi> 20. 1592. But in mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traventions upon that head; The Lords allow'd both parties to turn their Libel in a Molestation, and granted Commission to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59223:101"/>
Witnesses <hi>hinc inde, January</hi> 24. 1663. <hi>Rouchlay</hi> contra <hi>Wood.</hi> Nor would the Lords find that pasturing upon waste High-land-ground, should infer contravention, except it had been done by the Masters Command, or frequent herding to his knowledge, <hi>July</hi> 8. 1664. Earl of <hi>Airly</hi> contra <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>intosh.</hi> But yet if Deeds of Violence be done, even upon debateable Lands, that will infer Contravention, such as the hoching of Oxen.</p>
               <p>This <hi>animus injuriandi</hi> is so necessary, that Deeds done by drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-men, are by many Lawyers thought not to infer a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, <hi>Christin. Tit.</hi> 4. <hi>Art.</hi> 8. and the adulterating the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Wife, will not infer a Contravention, because this is not done <hi>animo injuriandi,</hi> but <hi>animo libidinoso Christin. Art.</hi> 7. He likewise thinks, that threatning real injuries is sufficient, and <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> is a great breach of the Peace, especially when it is by a man who uses <hi>minas prosequi,</hi> but verbal injuries, <hi>per se,</hi> are not thought sufficient by Lawyers, nor have we any Decision sustaining a Contravention on that head.</p>
               <p>Since by this Act the King and the Party have different inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, therefore Imprisonment or paying of a Fine to the King by prior Sentence, will not exclude a pursuit of Contravention at the parties instance, <hi>March</hi> 20. 1623. <hi>Futhie</hi> contra <hi>Carmichael,</hi> and <hi>January penult,</hi> 1622. <hi>Johnston</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Westnisbit.</hi> And certainly that Decision related by <hi>Hope tit. contravention Forrest</hi> contra <hi>Turnbul</hi>; Where it was found that the Kings Advocat could not insist alone in a Contravention, if the party injur'd discharged the Deed, though after the intenting of the Cause, is an illegal Decision; for seing the King is injur'd <hi>crimine fractae pacis,</hi> and that by this Act the King has right to the half of the penalty, and had formerly right to all by the 5 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ja.</hi> 3. The party cannot Discharge the Kings part. Contravention is a penal action, even at the privat parties instance; and therefore <hi>titulus coloratus,</hi> will defend against it, and thus a Contravention being libelled, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd from the casting of a Ditch, whereby the pursuers Land was overflow'd. The Lords found that a consent from the pursuers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though he was but Liferenter, did defend against that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>January</hi> last 1633. L. <hi>Weyms</hi> contra L. <hi>Gairntilly,</hi> Without prejudice to pursue an Action of Damnage and Interest; to which the Lords turned this Libel, without necessity of a new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. And this action is likewise elided for the same reason, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Dissimulation; and therefore a pursuit of Contravention, founded upon cutting of Trees in the pursuers Wood, was elided by the same pursuers granting Licence thereafter to the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders to cut in the same Wood; which posterior Licence the Lords found did infer a presumptive Remission, <hi>January</hi> 11. 1633. <hi>Denniston</hi> contra <hi>Lindsay.</hi> Nor is this Contravention infer'd by Injuries, done upon provocation or self-defence, but though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation seems to be good against the provocker, yet it seems not to be good against the King; and it may be doubted whether
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59223:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the penalties of the Acts of Parliament may be sought, by and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour the damnage and interest, or if the damnage is to be a part of the penalty.</p>

Subscription also by the Initial Letters of the Subscrivers Name, is sustain'd, if the Subscrivers be prov'd to have still Subscrived so, these Instrumentary VVitnesses are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd to have been chosen by consent, and therefore Sons, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be VVitnesses; and it may be doubted if VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may be VVitnesses in VVrits; but it is still sit to choose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrested VVitnesses, for if the Granters own Relations be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and one of two of them deny his Subscription, the writ will be reduc'd as null, though not improven as false, as was found in <hi>Nimmo</hi>'s case.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59223:103"/>
taking an obligation for them in Writ, and the presumption lyes for their being yearly pay'd, and that which was <hi>praesumptio hominis,</hi> is after the current of three years made here <hi>praesumptio juris &amp; de jure &amp; lex statuit super prasumpto.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 3. It may be doubted whether this Act ordaining Merchant Accompts to prescrive in 3 years, doth reach to Compts owing to Strangers, for they seem not oblig'd to know our Law, and this would ruin all Commerce <hi>&amp; locus contractus semper attendendus.</hi> But it was found that this <hi>Act</hi> does extend to all Merchant Goods, as well when sold in gross as by retail.</p>
               <p>It may be doubted whether these two last Acts run against Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, since it is provided expresly that Prescriptions against Spuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies and Ejections shall not run against them, which shows that if this had been design'd in the other Prescriptions, the same Clause had been renew'd, since it was under consideration, and so seems not to have been forgot only, and there seems to be some reason for this, since Minors are prejudg'd by Spuilȝies and Ejections, and so Prescriptions in these should not run against them, but in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings the hazard is only that a new Warning must be used, and in <hi>other the like debts,</hi> the only loss is that the debt cannot be prov'd by Witnesses after three years, and so since these prescriptions did little hurt to Minors, it was not necessary to stop their course. It is also observable, that though all these Prescriptions run in 3 years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if actions be once intented, they stop the prescriptions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after Spuilȝies, Removings, or Aliments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not prescrive in less time than 40 years, as all other debts do; and till then vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent profits are due, or the like debts may be prov'd, as if the action had been pursu'd within 3 years, 26 <hi>January,</hi> 1622. <hi>Herring contra Ramsay:</hi> As also by our late Decisions, if the Pursuer has continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to employ a Merchant the currency of that Compt, and trust will preclude the prescription, so that many former years preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the three last may be craved, though this Act ordains all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Compts to prescrive within that time, but if a Bond be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for these posterior years, it is thought that cannot be called a current Compt, and it may be debated whether in Law one or two Articles will make a current Compt, and if it do, there may be many wayes taken to elude this Act, <hi>vid.</hi> 16 <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> 1675. <hi>Somer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We call him a Titular who has the Title of a Benefice, <hi>&amp; qui est in Titulo,</hi> and thus the Seculars who had right to the Teinds due formerly to the Church, are call'd the Titulars of the Teinds, and by the old Canons it is clear; that <hi>quaedam beneficia a titulo pendent quaedam a reditu,</hi> and these Tithes are in the Ecclesiastick History said to have had their Origine, either <hi>ab intitulatione in Codicem &amp; matriculam cujuslibet Ecclesiae un de intitulari dicebantur in Canon.

It might seem more convenient that the Gift should rather have been burdened with it, as in other cases.</p>

                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 2. Though by this <hi>Act</hi> it be declar'd that the Debt shall be pay'd out of the Offenders Moveables, yet that does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the party offended to do Diligence against the offenders real Estate, for what sums the Lords shall modifie.</p>

That Arrestments may be made, not only in the hands of these who owe any thing to the Debitor; But Arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be even made in the Debitors own hands, which though it may seem strange, yet it is done to the effect, that if the Debitor shall be found to have alienated any of his Moveables so arrested after the arrestment is laid on, he may be pursu'd for breaking of Arrestment, and punished conform to this Act.</p>

this <hi>Act,</hi> that the designing to exclude one of the three Estates, was the chief design of the Act, though such as impugn the power of the Parliament in general, so far as relates to Cases Spiritual, do likewise commit Treason; and as in the former Act, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of the power of the Council, is declared Treason; so in this Act, the controverting the power of the Parliament, is much more Treasonable; and yet it is controverted, whether the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Branch of the Parliaments power be Treasonable, such as is the quarrelling the Power or Constitution of the Articles; or whether the Subjects may appeal from the Session to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

In all which, the Parliaments Authority may be alleadg'd not to be controverted; but the question seems to reach only to the controverting, its fundamental powers, and if such Cases as these were Treasonable, the people might be discouraged to enquire even into what were otherways lawful; and whatever may be said against such Debaits, when they are meerly factious, and officiously mov'd, and prosecuted by such as have no interest; yet such Debates in Parliament may be alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not Treasonable by the 40 <hi>Act</hi> 11 <hi>Par.

dispersed a Petition that reflected upon the Government; in which Process, it being fully Debated that <hi>dolus malus</hi> should be found in such cases, where the design of defaming makes only the Crime; this was repelled, because where the words may of their own nature, move dislike of, and Sedition against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the design needs not be proved; for if the people be irritate, the Author ought to be punished, and this Law consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the effect, and not the design, and he ought to blame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who meddles in matters of Government without his Sphere.</p>
               <p>It was likewise alledged in this Process, that a Petition to the King Himself, could not be interpret a misconstructing; but this was also repell'd, because both by the Common Law and ours, it has been found, that great affronts have been put upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by way of Supplication.

The Subjects are discharg'd to take or renew the Covenant, which is a Bond or League, upon their highest peril, and I wish the Act had determined what was the highest peril, for generally Lawyers do not extend such Statutes to Death.</p>
               <p>I find that the Nobility and others having enter'd into Bonds amongst themselves, whereupon His Majesty was surpriz'd at <hi>Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> there are several Acts of Council, and particularly a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, issu'd out in <hi>April</hi> 1582. discharging all such Bonds so enter'd into, and that none enter into such Bonds for the future, and that gave occasion to this Act, which says, that <hi>these Bonds have given occasion to a great part of the Troubles that have occurr'd since</hi>; The Certification in that Proclamation, is under the pain of being <hi>repute favourers and partakers with the Conspirators a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst His Highness Majesty.</hi> The Act here related to is the 43 <hi>Act</hi> 6 <hi>Par.</hi> Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> but that Act properly extends only to Bonds of Man-rent, but not to Bonds of Combination, as this does, so that this Act should rather have been founded on the 30 <hi>Act</hi> 2 <hi>Par.

               <p>There is in that Proclamation, and this Act, exception made of Bonds enter'd into with the Kings consent, which was added, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Nobility and Estates at the Kings desire, entered in a League and Bond for preservation of Religion, which is Registrat in the Council Book, <hi>June</hi> 8 1585.

Charges without previous tryal, and yet if the Chief Officers of State, or at least four of them concur, it would seem that by that Act, even such Charges are yet lawful, and where the King or Magistrat has previous informations of Crimes latent, it were against the interest of the Common-wealth, that they should not be allowed to clear these by particular Interrogators.</p>
               <p>It was urg'd from this part of the Act, that no man could legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Imprisoned, even by a warrand under the Kings own hand, and that this was very just in it self, since as Liberty is very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the best part of Property, it was sit to secure it so, as that none could take it away, but these who will be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the King could not in Law be made answerable; and therefore it was justly by this Act appointed, that no man could be imprisoned by any Letter, even under the Kings own hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were subscrived by the Officers of State, who should be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable; to which it was answered by His Majesties Advocat, that this Act did not debar the King from granting such privat warrands under his own hand, for there might be some cases which he could impart to none of his Officers of State, as for instance, if all his Officers were upon a plot against him, or if the Crime were the being upon a Plot with a forraign State, which the King were not yet in a condition to resent, though he might justly apprehend his Subjects who were in accession to it; but the design of this part of the Act was only to discharge the passing ordinary Letters in common course under the Signet, except in this Method, and it might be much rather retorted, that since only Letters under the Signet, are discharged to be past, except in this method; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore privat warrands from the King himself, are not discharged, for if the King and Parliament had designed any such thing, they would have expresly discharged all warrands under the Kings hand, which is not done in this Act, and it is clear by the 184 <hi>Act</hi> 13 <hi>Par. Ja.</hi> 6. That the King may give Warrands out of his own mouth, to apprehend Rebels, or others whom Magistrats are obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
               <p>I find also that this Act was past formerly in the Privy Council the 23 of <hi>June,</hi> this year, 1585. and there the Act bears, <hi>To have been made to prevent the obtaining of unformal Letters at the importunity and malice of privat persons,</hi> which clearly evinces that it was not design'd to preclude the King from securing such persons who he had reason to believe were obnoxious to the Government.</p>
               <p>It is observed in the Acts of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> that the King 8 <hi>June,</hi> 1581. by his Letter ordain'd several Advocats to be imprison'd <hi>indicta causa.</hi>

               <p>By the second part of this Act Writers to the Signet are ordain'd to keep the old Style unalter'd, for Arguments brought from Style are a great part of our Fundamental Law, and in all our Decisions <hi>Argumentum a Stylo</hi> is still very strong, as from the wills of Inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Interdictions, from the Forms of the Chancery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet in some cases this Argument is not concluding, and thus Gifts of single Escheat bear all Moveables present and to come, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they give only right to what Moveables the Rebels have or shall possess within a year after rebellion; and though by the Style of Gifts of Wards the relief is discharged, yet that discharge will not be valid.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59223:118"/>
the King did begin to erect some of the Temporality of their Benefices in Lordships, which He Dispon'd to several Noblemen, who were most active in the Reformation; Or to these whom He resolv'd to oblige by their Interest, to be active in it, and these were called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. The reason whereupon this <hi>Act</hi> is founded, is, that the former Kings having mortifi'd a great part of their Revenue to Church-men, and having thereby impoverish'd themselves and their people, it was therefore just, that the ends for which these Mortifications were made, being declar'd unlawful, the Benefices should return; by this reason such Mortifications as were made by privat Families, should have returned to them; whereas here all returns to the King: But in Law these Religious Houses being demolish'd, all ought to have fallen in to the King; for <hi>qua nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius sunt ea sunt domini Regis</hi>; and these were such, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to the old Proprietars, since they were once Dispon'd; nor to these Houses, since they were extinguished, and that being found a false Religion, what belong'd to it, did by the Law fall under Confiscation.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 3. From these words in the Clause of Annexation, <hi>viz. All and sundry Common-lands bruiked by Chapters of Cathedral Kirks, or whereof they have been in possession as Commonty</hi>; That Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Church-lands, is very often repute a sufficient Right, and to be <hi>loco tituli,</hi> For understanding whereof, it is fit to know, that both before and after the Reformation, a Churh-man being in possession by the space of seven years, though without a Title, has the benefit of a possessory Judgement, so that his Right cannot be quarrelled without Reduction; nor needs he produce a Title, as Laicks are oblig'd to do in possessory judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>July</hi> 18. 1671. Earl of <hi>Hume contra</hi> the Laird of <hi>Rislaw.</hi> And if he be thirteen years in possession, that possession is to him in place of a Title, for by a rule of the Chancery (as we believe) <hi>docennalis &amp; triennalis possessio habetur protitulo</hi>; though I find no such Rule in the <hi>Roman</hi> Chancery, but yet these thirteen years induce only a presumptive Title, which does not exclude the true Proprietar, if he can instruct that the Benefic'd person possessed either by a redeemable Right, and produce the Reversion, as was found in the case of <hi>Francis Kinloch, contra</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blane, July</hi> 11 1676. Or by a precarious Right, as was found in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59223:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the case of a Minister, who had casten Peits for thirteen years by tolerance from the Heretor, and though there be no difficulty where the Right mortifi'd does expresly bear, that <hi>it is Redeemable or Precarious</hi>; yet in absolute Rights, there is greater doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after thirteen years they can be qualifi'd by correspective Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations.</p>
               <p>The reason of this priviledge given to Church men, is, that they being imploy'd in Divine Matters, are ignorant and careless of their Right, especially since their Rights are not to descend to their own Heirs.</p>
               <p>It is fit here to take notice that by a vulgar error <hi>triennalis possessio</hi> was thought to give the benefit of a possessory judgement, 12 <hi>March,</hi> 1629. <hi>Marshal contra</hi> the Laird of <hi>Drumkilbo,</hi> and <hi>decennalis</hi> of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titory, and thus did they interpret the former rule. At the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation also the Popish Clergy did either send their foundations to <hi>Rome,</hi> or did by collusion with the Laicks interested, or in hatred of the Reformed Clergy, destroy their Rights; and therefore by an Act of Sederunt 16 <hi>December</hi> 1612. It is declared that ten years possession before the Reformation, or 30 after the Reformation, should be a sufficient right either to Church-men, or to the King's coming in their place, by vertue of this Act, and conform thereto the Lords decided <hi>July</hi> 5 1626.

                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 4. That because the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy were put from their Benefices, therefore they are by this Act freed from any warrandice they had given for Church Lands dispon'd by them; and by the 110 <hi>Act</hi> of the same Parliament, what is here Statuted as to the warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Lands, is there extended to Tacks, Pensions, and Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and so these two Acts are not absolutely co-incident, and the last unnecessary, as they would seem to be, and though this was done <hi>in majorem cautelam,</hi> yet by the common Law they would not have been liable in warrandice, since no man is liable in warrandice where the eviction proceeded upon a supervenient Statute, for no man can warrand against a supervenient Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 5. That notwithstanding that the Church-Lands are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, yet there is a dissolution in the same Act, warranding his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to Feu any of the saids Church-Lands during his own time.</p>

                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 6. That though by this <hi>Act</hi> all prior Dispositions made of Church-Lands by his Majesty to Lords of Erection are excepted from the Annexation, yet the Superiority of all the Erections both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after that <hi>Act,</hi> are annexed to the Crown, by the 10 <hi>Act Par.

                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 7. That the Spirituality of Benefices, <hi>viz.</hi> their right to the Teinds is expresly declared not to be annexed, but to remain with Church-men as formerly; for though by the 149 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 13 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. it be said that the Teinds of <hi>Dumfermi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:59223:119"/>Where Stock and Teind are promiscuously Feued, it is declared by this <hi>Act</hi> that his Majesty remains Superior both as to Stock and Teind, the Church-men having only right to the tenth penny of the Feu-duty, the other nine belonging to his Majesty for the temporality being only annex'd to the Crown, and the Teinds being reserv'd to the Church, it was very just that where a duty was payable out of Church-Lands, <hi>cum decimis inclusis,</hi> the King should only have right to a ninth part of that duty, and the tenth should belong to the Church-man or Titular, in contemplation of the Teinds; but still <hi>decimae inclusae</hi> are so fully exempted from all Ecclesiastick pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that though there be not sufficiency of Teinds in the Paroch, yet <hi>decimae inclusae</hi> are never burden'd with the payment of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Stipends, though Ministers Stipends be the constant burden of all Teinds; and for the same reason it was found 21 <hi>January</hi> 1633. that no Valuation could be led of Land Feued, <hi>cum decimis inclusis,</hi> and not confirmed before this <hi>Act,</hi> and that Laicks might prescrive a right to them, but not to other Teinds, which shews that <hi>decimae inclusae</hi> are never lookt upon as Teinds.</p>
               <p>For understanding the origine and nature of <hi>decimae inclusae</hi> with us, it is fit to know that by the Canon Law the Parson or Incumbent and the Paroch Church were founded in the right of all the greater Tithes, called <hi>decimae praediales,</hi> and that it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any man to abstract their Teinds from it, <hi>cap. de decimis</hi> 16. <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. And albeit the Popes did pretend that since the Bishops had the management of the Teinds, they as universal Bishops might by their supereminent transcendent right appropriat them to the use of Monastries, Monks being the best of the poor, and Teinds being naturally burden'd with the maintainance of the poor; yet our King's who in all the tract of our Parliaments own'd their own <hi>Regalia,</hi> and the Episcopal Order against the invasions of the Popes, did by the 7 <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 2. <hi>Ja.</hi> 4. declare it a point of Dittay, that is to say, Criminal for any man, to take a right of Teinds from any, save the Parson, Vicar, or their farmers, so far they acknowledg'd the Parochial Churches to be founded in their right to the Predial Teinds.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding whereof, the Popes to get the Monks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend immediatly upon them, did grant to those Monks, exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from payment of Tiths, for they as well as others paid to the Parson or Incumbent, till Pope <hi>Paschal</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi> granted those exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but these exemptions did thereafter so far diminish the provision of the Parson (very many Lands, being either mortifi'd to them, or bought in by them) that <hi>Theodosius</hi> and other Emperours were forc'd to make Laws against exorbitant Mortifications; and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> was forc'd to limit the exemptions to four Religious Orders, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stertians, Hospitalers, Templars,</hi> and Knights of St. <hi>John</hi>; still al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing all of them Exemptions for their <hi>Novalia</hi> or Lands, first cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by themselves; But Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, in the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Council, thereafter ordain'd, that even these four Orders should pay Tiths for what Lands they should acquire after that time;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59223:120"/>
which I, the rather observe, because it has been decided by our Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>July</hi> 15. 1664, <hi>Thomas Crawford contra Prestoun Grange</hi>; that Lords of Erection succeeding in place of the <hi>Cistertian</hi> Monks, should be free from Tiths, as the Monks were without adverting whether these Lands for which exemption was pleaded, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd on their Monastries, after the year 1120. and it seems that this Exemption should not be allow'd to these Monastries, since they were not allow'd to the Temple-lands with us, and that such priviledges are due to neither, because this was a personal privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge given to the Monks, as the Poor, and so should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to the Lords of Erection. The Monks being thus Masters of many Tiths, feu'd out their Lands and Tiths promiscuously, for the encouragement of the Labourers, who have alwayes thought it a loss and a slavery to wait till their Tiths be drawn.</p>
               <p>Laicks also enjoy'd Tiths, and alienated them as their own He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retage, for many ages together, it being generally believ'd, as <hi>Selden</hi> contends, that the Tiths were not due to Church-men, they having Right only to a Maintainance, <hi>jure divino</hi>; though others ascrive these Laical Infeudations to a corruption begun by <hi>Charles Martel</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who to gratifie and pay such as were to assist him in the Holy War, Dispon'd to them the Tiths <hi>consentientibus Episcopis,</hi> who knew that if the <hi>Saracens</hi> prevail'd, Religion would be destroy'd, and he promising to restore them; But after this time it is undenyable that <hi>de facto,</hi> Teinds were Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon'd to, and by Laicks, till the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council 1169. in which the Canon was made, <hi>prohibemus ne laici decimas cum animarum sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum periculo detinentes in alios laicos possint aliquo modo transferre. Si quis vero perceperit &amp; Ecclesiae non reddiderit Christiana Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura privetur</hi>; But yet before that time, Laical Infeudations were Discharg'd, <hi>per Concilium Turon</hi>: 1096. Though we in this Nation consider only the Discharge, in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
               <p>It remains clear from these Informations, that our <hi>decimae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusae,</hi> are in effect the same with the <hi>decimae infeudatae</hi> in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, and these are call'd <hi>decimae inclusae,</hi> where the Stock and Teinds were never separated, but were feu'd joyntly before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council; but yet it seems that all <hi>decimae infeudatae,</hi> are not esteem'd <hi>inclusae</hi> with us; for in a Case betwixt <hi>Monimusk</hi> and <hi>Pitfoddels,</hi> Teinds were found not to have the priviledge of <hi>decimae inclusae,</hi> though Transmitted by Infestments, and call'd <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimae inclusae,</hi> because there was separat a <hi>Reddendo,</hi> paid for the Teind and Stock, and so it could be known to be different from the Stock, albeit it was contended that <hi>decimae inclusae</hi> and <hi>infeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datae,</hi> were <hi>pares termini,</hi> and a different <hi>Reddendo</hi> did not evince that the Teinds had ever been separated from the Stock, but only that there was a different Duty, as is in Lands of the same hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oftimes, and it may in general seem strange, why we should add, since the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, for that Council did find that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59223:120"/>
Laicks before that time were incapable of any Right to Teinds; and therefore all Feus of Teinds, whether before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council or after, should be null, and this Error it seems has been occasion'd by our concluding, that because Laicks were declar'd uncapable of them by that Act, therefore they were capable of them before it; and yet with us a Laick cannot prescrive Teinds, because he is not capable of them; and <hi>Balsour</hi> tells us a Decision wherein not only alienations of Teinds, but even Tacks of Teinds for three nineteen years, were accounted alienations, and so null, for else Discharging alienations might have been eluded by setting long Tacks: But now Teinds pass by Infestments, as the Stocks does, since the Surrender, and His Majesties Decreet thereupon, wherein every man may buy his own Teinds, and so may set as long Tacks of them as he pleases, or Feu them out <hi>cum decimis inclusis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be alledg'd this tenth part payable to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick person for Teinds, may be made liable to Ministers Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, since this tenth part must be constructed as Teinds, and so should be lyable to all the burdens of Teinds; but to this it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, that these <hi>decimae inclusae</hi> are consider'd as a part of the Stock, and so no more liable to Ministers Stipends than the Stock is; this division of the Feu-Duty doth not alter the nature of the <hi>decimae inclusae,</hi> but is only insert to regulate the way of payment of the Feu-Duty, even as if after a Feu granted of Stock and Teind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously for a Feu-Duty, the Church-man should dispone nine parts of the Feu-Duty, and reserve only the tenth to himself, that tenth part could not be liable to Ministers Stipends. 2. Since this <hi>Act</hi> by the death of the Titular both Temporality and Spirituality came in his Majesties hands, and so were dispon'd to the Lords of Erection, and return'd to them without this distinction of nine or tenth parts.</p>
               <p>Though by this <hi>Act</hi> Teinds are declared the Spirituality of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, yet they may be sold, and are appointed now to be sold by the Parliament 1633. and the Heretors are to be infest in them as in their other Lands, which seems inconsistent with their being the Spirituality of Benefices, and the Patrimony of the Church; but it may be answer'd, that they are even in that case burden'd with pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ministers Stipends till they be competently provided.</p>

That Lands belonging to the Benefices of Laick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages, are excepted also from this Annexation, by which are meant only such Laick Patronages, as were lawfully establisht be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation, and not such as were Dispon'd by the King to Laicks, and to which he had Right, as coming in place of the Pope, who was Universal Patron <hi>in dubio,</hi> before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for these are still accounted Ecclesiastick Patronages, since they were so originally, and so ought not to have been excepted from this Act, but whether all the other Patronages, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed formerly to Monasteries, were annexed to the Crown by this Act, was fully Debated, <hi>November</hi> 1677. in the Case of <hi>Steuart contra</hi> the Laird of <hi>Watertoun</hi>; and that they were annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was urg'd, because by the first words of this Act, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all Profits, Emoluments, whatsoever belonging to them were annexed, and there being nothing that the King and Parliament was more concerned in, than to have the Patronages depend upon the Crown, thereby to prevent the influence that Schismatick privat Patrons might have; It was most reasonable to think, that when all things belonging to Monasteries, were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd, these should have been annex'd. Likeas, Sir <hi>Thomas Hope</hi> among other Rights crav'd to be reduc'd, crav'd likewise that all the Rights made to the Lords of Erection of the Patronages belonging formerly to Monasteries, should be reduc'd as contrary to this Act, upon which Reduction the Lords of Erection did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Rights to these Patronages, and in the Kings determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination upon that Submission, His Majesty determined that the Lords of Erection should have only Right to the converted prices of their own feu Mails, and feu Ferms of their Superiorities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was likewise there contended, that the saids Patronages were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise annexed by the 13 and 14 Acts of the first Parliament <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>To which it was answered, That Patronages were never annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as parts and pendicles, but where it was design'd they should be annexed, they were still annexed <hi>per expressum,</hi> as in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexation of the Abbacy of <hi>Dumfermling, Act</hi> 189 <hi>Par.</hi> 13 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. and it were absurd to think, that since the foresaid general Clause did annex things of the meanest consequence, such as Service of Tennents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it would have omitted things of so great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59223:122"/>
as were the Patronages of many Monasteries; nor did any of the Leiges who had Right to such Ecclesiastick Patronages from the King, crave ever a Dissolution of them in Parliament, which certainly they would have done, if they had looked upon them as annex'd, nor were they annexed by the 13 and 14 <hi>Acts Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. Because these Acts do not mention Patronages <hi>per expressum,</hi> nor can they be comprehended under the general word, <hi>pertinents,</hi> exprest in these Acts, for the reasons foresaids, and to evidence that His Majesty had determined nothing as to the Patronages belonging to the Lords of Erection, His Majesty does in the 1 <hi>Parliament</hi> 12 <hi>Act Ch.</hi> 2. express these words, <hi>Likeas, also the the remanent points of our said Commission anent the patronage of Kirks, &amp;c. are not yet begun to be Treated</hi>; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Debate came not to a Decision.</p>
               <p>What the condition of our Teinds is since this Act, shal be Treated fully in my Treatise of Teinds, as also whether the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of paying Teinds proceeds from the Moral, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial or Common Law is not agreed to, but the most ordinary opinion is, that they are due to Church men, before any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Law, and the <hi>quota.</hi> of Tenths proceeds from positive Law, and D. <hi>Thomas part.</hi> 3. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 6. makes the Tenth to be due, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as all <hi>Digits</hi> under ten, are imperfect, and do tend to ten as their perfection; so man being naturally lost, we pay our Tiths to these Ministers by whom our perfection comes; and thus some School-men conclude, that Tiths flow from the Moral Law, in so far as they are a necessary Maintainance for Ministers, from the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Law, in so far as concerns the number of ten, and Ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial in so far as concerns the foresaid Typicals, nor can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd that <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Teinds (before any positive Law (to <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> though the Learned <hi>Selden</hi> Interprets this place only to be the Tenths of what was taken by the War, and that from <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> and from <hi>Heb. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 2. and the <hi>Greek</hi> word there us'd, does properly signifie spoils, call'd by <hi>Sulpitius Severus deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam praedae</hi> but yet I see not why that alleadg'd Custom among the <hi>Jews,</hi> of giving <hi>the Tithes of their Spoils,</hi> could have proceeded from any other ground, than that which was common to all Tithes, nor can I believe <hi>Selden,</hi> who asserts that Tithes were not paid in the primitive Church, till the days of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> for if we do not controvert the Truth of all Authority, we will find the payment of Tithes much older.</p>
               <p>Teinds were likewise accounted Spirituality by the <hi>Canonists, vid. Rebuff. Quaest.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>How these Teinds came to belong to Monastries, may be doubted, since naturally the Curats of the respective Parochs, are founded <hi>in jure communi quoad</hi> the Right to their predial Teinds, so that they need not prove their Right thereto, and this was very just, because they having the Cure of Souls ought likewise to have had that which was given as an encouragement of that Cure; and though to this the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59223:122"/>
answer be, that the Pope who had only Right to alienat such Teinds, did use to give them to Monastries, <hi>nam licet ille jus divinum tollere non potest tamen modificare potest,</hi> yet I conceive that our Kings, and even our Laicks, with the consent of our Kings, did think they could bestow the Teinds belonging to these Kirks, whereof they were Patrons upon Religious Houses, whereof I have seen very many Instances in our old Charters, one whereof, I shall set down for an Example, <hi>Alexander Dei gratia Rex Scotorum, &amp;c.

               <p>The form prescribed to molestations by this Act, is, that the Lords shall direct Letters to the inferiour Judges upon 15 dayes warning, who shall continue their Courts from 8 dayes to 8 dayes, and these inferiour Judges having discust the points of Law, they shall choose an Assize, the most part whereof shall have 4 Ploughs of Land, or 300 Merks of yearly Rent in the same or Neighbouring Parochs, if there be mutual pursuits, the Judge shall discuss both together, and choose an Assize out of the Assizes cited by either party equally, and the Odd-man to be choos'd by Cavil; if the Judge or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar be suspect, the Lords shall grant Commission by their own Act, or by a Commission under the testimony of the Great Seal to unsuspect Judges.</p>

               <p>The Action of Molestation is the same with us, that <hi>finium re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundorum</hi> was by the Civil Law, and what can stop Perambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our Law, are set down, <hi>Statut.

               <p>Upon the 19 of <hi>February</hi> 1680. The Lord Register <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> Sir <hi>William Primerose</hi> It was found that the Registers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put, called the Clerk for the Notars was Deprivable, for not calling in the Prothecals of Deceassed Notars, by the space of five years, to which the Lords found him actually oblig'd, though it was alleadg'd, that by these Acts he was only oblig'd to receive the Prothecals, when they were brought in, but not to call for them, nor was it possible for him to know when Notars dy'd, and therefore by this Act, Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ordain'd to acquaint him of the Death of Notars, within their Jurisdictions, for it was urg'd that the Obligation to bring in the Prothecals, being committed to this Clerk, and he being only intrusted with it, the Act would be elusory, if he were not oblig'd to do Diligence, since none else could do it, and he might easily inform himself, at least once a year.</p>
               <p>It was also Debated, that by this Act the Clerk to the Notars was oblig'd to understand sufficiently the Office of Notary, though it was answer'd that he was no further oblig'd than to draw a Bill for their admission, and the Clerks of the Session are not oblig'd to understand the Civil Law, which they are oblig'd to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The Lyon is Constituted by this Act sole Judge to the faults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Messengers, and to their Cautioners, whom they find for their good behaviour at their Entry; which power is Ratifi'd by the 125 <hi>Act</hi> 12 <hi>Par.

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 47.</note> for Protections against Execution of the Law were so call'd then. This Act is renew'd, 13 <hi>Act</hi> 23 <hi>Par. Ja.</hi> 6. By which the Granter is declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lyable for the Debt, and by the 9 <hi>Act</hi> 3 <hi>Par. Ch.</hi> 2. These Acts are Ratifi'd; and because the last Act related only to the Session, therefore the Privy Council, Session, Commissioners of Justiciary, and Exchequer, are declar'd lyable, if they grant Protections, except to such as are Cited to answer before them; and so the Act protects not pursuers, for they are not Summon'd; and if pursuers were protected, any man might raise a summons and thereby grant himself a Protection; but yet if the interest of the Common-wealth require that a Crime be prosecuted; I think they may after inquiry, secure the pursuer during the dependence; for though His Majesties Advocat may pursue without an Informer, yet an Informer helps much.</p>
               <p>Albeit that Act Discharges the granting Protections, and makes the Granters lyable; yet the Contemners of the Protection are punish'd; and a Writer to the Signet was Suspended in <hi>November</hi> 1678. for causing apprehend a person, notwithstanding of the Lords Protection; albeit it was there alleadg'd, that though Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections might be granted by the Lords, upon depending Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, yet these Protections could not extend to secure them against delivering of Papers, which are in their own power; and though a Protection granted by the King for Debt, does not secure against things that are in the Receivers own power, as Exhibition of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet if either the King or the Lords grant expresly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections against all Cases whatsoever, then it will secure even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such Exhibitions, until the same be expresly re-called,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59223:126"/>
though it seems that by that <hi>Act,</hi> Judicatures have only power to grant Protections to such as are Cited before them, during the time wherein they may come and return to obey the Judicature, in cases wherein their personal presence is necessary for the Administration of Justice, not exceeding a month in all. It is also clear, that even the Defender may be apprehended, if he get not a Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for this <hi>Act</hi> does not protect, but is only a warrand for granting one. And there is lately an <hi>Act</hi> appointing Protections that pass under the Kings Hand, to pass the Great Seal, <hi>per sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Council to prevent the granting of Protections, whereby the privat interest of the Subjects was so much destroy'd, and the execution of Law eluded, did by an Act in <hi>January</hi> 1678. and sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all of them, declare that whoever voted to any such Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, should be lyable to the Debt; to elide which, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after changing the name of Protections, granted Licences to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to stay in the Countrey free from all Execution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King by His Letter in <hi>July</hi> 1679. did Discharge the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to grant any Licences or Protections, except conform to these His Laws; and the 9 <hi>Act Par</hi> 3 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Ordains all such Licences, Protections, &amp;c.</hi> to be sign'd, and the Signers to be lyable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may be likewise doubted, whether the Commission of the Kirk can grant Protections, since there is only allowance by this <hi>Act</hi> granted to the Privy Council, Session, Exchequer and Justice Court, but since the 61 <hi>Act</hi> 1 <hi>Par. Ch.</hi> 2 Declares that the <hi>Acts, Decreets and Ordinances of that Commission shall have the strength of the Acts</hi> and <hi>Decreets</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> they are really a Commission of Parliament: And therefore as the Parliament can grant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections, so can they, especially since without this they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erce well the Jurisdiction intrusted to them by the Parliament, and it seems inherent in all Courts, that they should be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect all whom they Cite; and it is clear by this <hi>Act,</hi> that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Courts of <hi>Scotland</hi> have power before this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> to grant Protections: for this <hi>Act</hi> reserves only their former power, but grants them no new power.</p>
               <p>These Protections are thought the same with the <hi>induciae moratoriae,</hi> granted by the Civil Law <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>C. de precibus Imperator. &amp;c.</hi> which are not valid by that Law, <hi>nisi idonea fideijussio super debiti solutione praebeatur.</hi> But I think these to be rather Suspensions, and that Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in Suspensions with us arose from this.</p>

               <p>FOr understanding Ecclesiastical Pensions, it is fit to know, that of old when the present incumbent was sickly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 62.</note> the Synods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him to resign his Benefice, reserving to himself a Pension or portion out of it, as is clear by <hi>Balsamon ad Synodum Ephesinam</hi>; but thereafter the Pope having reserv'd to himself the power of burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Benefices with Penesions, men did by Simony impetrat from the See of <hi>Rome</hi> immoderat and causless Pensions, though it was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that there could regularly no Pension be granted but for one of three reasons: 1. The favour of the resigner of a Benefice, that he might after the resignation live suitably to the Character he once bore. 2. That when two Benefices were excamb'd, the greater Benefice might be burden'd with a Pension in favours of the lesser. 3. When there was any debate concerning the Benefice, it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to burden the same with a Pension. But notwithstanding of this, Pensions increased so far as to be complain'd of as a Harvest without Sowing; and our Law did take very much pains to lessen Pensions, and by the 1 <hi>Act</hi> of K. <hi>Ja.</hi> 1. his first Parliament, in the Black Acts which is not now Re-printed, the King reserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the cognition of Pensions obtain'd at <hi>Rome.</hi> And by the 4 <hi>Act</hi> of the 1 <hi>Par.</hi> K. <hi>Ja.</hi> 3. it is appointed that no Pension be purchased out of any Benefice without consent of the possessor, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry just in it self, and was made to exclude the Popes power, who pretended that he could Arbitrarily impose any Pension he pleas'd, as is clear by <hi>Gigas de pensionibus Ecclesiasticis, Quaest.</hi> 4. By this Act it is declar'd that the principal gift of Pension being improven, all Confirmations and Decreets following thereon shall fall in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. By the 29 Act of this Parliament it is likewise appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Pensions shall not be prejudg'd by the Act of Annexation, they being lawfully authoriz'd by Decreets, or Possession, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the 137 <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 12. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. It is ordain'd that all Pensions not authorized by Decreet, or Possession in the lifetime of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, alledg'd disponer thereof, shall be null; and by the Canon Law Pensions imposed upon Benefices of Cure, <hi>extinguuntur morte gravantis</hi>; but the reason given by this Act is, because such Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not so confirmed in the granters lifetime, are null of the Law, and may be presum'd to be false. Another reason that may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is, because the Incumbent having no power over the Benefice but during his life, it were unjust that any burden granted by him should last longer than his life, and if it lasted longer it would
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59223:128"/>
prejudge very much the care of Souls, because the burden of a Pension would discourage the Intrant; and the reason why it is presum'd to be forg'd is because it is very probable that if it had been a true Pension it had been own'd during the lifetime of the granter. By the 207 <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 14. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. all Pensions and Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions out of the Temporalities of vacant Benefices since the Act of Annexation, are declar'd to be null, which shews that Pensions were never consider'd as solid and unquarrellable rights.</p>

               <p>THis Act is Explain'd fully <hi>crim. pract. tit.</hi> Assizes; but it is fit to add that His Majesty having written a Letter in <hi>anno</hi> 1683. desiring the Justices to Examine Witnesses in Treason,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. That this would ingage Witnesses to adhere to the Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that might be Elicited from them by the too great zeal of His Majesties Servants, or the influence of others. To which it was answer'd, that as to the first, the Depositions to be taken in that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59223:132"/>
previous Tryal, were not to be made use of to the Assize, which was all that was discharg'd by this Statute.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>second,</hi> It was not to be imagin'd that the Judges, to whom only this was to be intrusted, would prejudge any Pannel, or be corrupted by any influence; and before the Witnesses De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon'd these Depositions should be destroy'd, so that the Witnesses could be under no apprehensions upon that account, and the people were in a better condition by this Letter than formerly, for it was securer to trust previous examinations to the Judges than to the Kings Advocat who did alwayes Examine alone formerly, and this would prevent unjust trouble, when there were no Witnesses who could Depone against the persons accus'd through error or malice.</p>
               <p>THis Act is also Explain'd in the Title Assizes: But it is fit to add that <hi>Blair</hi> and others being Convict of Error for assoilȝying some Traitors wrongously,<note place="margin">

               <p>It may be also doubted whether such Verdicts can be reduceable, for though the Act declare that the Assizers may assoilȝe, if any speak to them, yet if they and the Justices proceed, it seems not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellable, or at least before the Session; for I remember that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices having declar'd a Bond of <hi>Glenkindies</hi> forefaulted, for not producing some Witnesses against himself; the Lords declar'd that the Justice-court being a Supream Court, their Acts and Sentences were not quarrellable before the Session, <hi>Queritur,</hi> if both these may not be quarrell'd before the Parliament; and I think they can not, except the Decreets of the Session can.</p>

               <p>It has been doubted whether the Council could in other cases not warranted by express Acts of Parliament oblige the Subjects to give Bond to live peaceably conform to Law, and particulary that their Tennents should not keep Conventicles, but should go to Church, and pay 50 pound <hi>Sterling</hi> for every Conventicle kept upon their Ground, or should present their Delinquents; and it was alleadg'd that the Council cannot, because regularly one man is not lyable for another mans Crime, nor can this inversion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Natural Liberty be introduced by a lesse power than a Parliament, nor had Acts of Parliament in this case been necessary, if the King and Council could have done the same by their own authority; but yet since the King has by express Act of Parliament the same power here that any Prince or Potentat has in any other Kingdoms, and that Government belongs to him as Property does to us, nor can the peace be secured otherwayes than by allowing him to take all courses for securing the peace, and preventing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, that therefore this joyned with the practice of the Council is a sufficient warrand for exacting such Bonds, the practice of our King and Council being the best interpreter of the prerogative, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the things for which Band is to be taken, are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to express Law; and it is implyed in the nature of alledgiance that Land-lords should entertain none but such as will live regularly, and if they transgressed, the Master could not in common Law thereafter recept them without being lyable, as we see in Spuilȝies; or if the King pleased he might denounce the transgressors Rebels, and so might put the Master <hi>in mala fide,</hi> and though there be no such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Laws warranding the taking of such Bonds, yet it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

It was declared that such as are free Barons might elect or be elected, though they were not actual Residenters, and that notwithstanding of this Act which is thereby abrogated as to that point, and most reasonably, for their interest in the Shire ceases not by their not residence; and conform to this Act the Convention decided in all Elections, <hi>June</hi> 1678.</p>

                  <hi>Nota,</hi> All Elections are to be subscrived by six Barons at least, and though in controverted Elections these who have six will be preferr'd to these who have five, and if neither of the Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have six, a new Election will be order'd, because both are unlawful; yet if all the Barons were cited, and fewer than five were only present, a Commission by these five may seem sufficient, because the absence of Barons should not prejudge the Shire; yet in

the Convention 1678. many inclin'd to think that a new Election should be order'd in that case, because of this Act, and that that Shire ought not to have a Vote who would not send legal Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>Though by this Act the Missives for calling Parliaments or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions (which are here called General Councils) should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to such as were the last Commissioners, in place of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, yet now they are ordinarly directed to the Sheriffs, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to any the King pleases, as in the Parliament, 1661.</p>
               <p>By this Act the Commissioners are to be choos'd at <hi>Michaelmass</hi> Head Court, and failing thereof at any other time the Free-holders meet, or when his Majesty requires them; and therefore it may be doubted if every Shire are obliged to choose at <hi>Michaelmass,</hi> since that seems to be ordered here, and the other dyets are only order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be failing of that Head Court: But yet many Shires in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> use not to choose at <hi>Michaelmass,</hi> but delay Elections till they be required.</p>

               <p>It is to be remembred that where there are Elections at <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass,</hi> the Shire cannot choose of new, as was found in the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 1678. in the case of the Shire of <hi>Perth,</hi> and ordinarly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations bear as it did there, that the Shire should choose where they had not formerly chosen at <hi>Michaelmass,</hi> and so these Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made without warrand; but it may be doubted whether such Elections would be invalid if the Proclamations mention'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as to this point it was there alledged that the Shire might make a new Election, because the Commissioners then chosen were denuded, and were become no Barons; to which it was answered, that this should have been represented to the Council, who would have ordered a new Election, but the Shire could not proceed to elect by their own Authority contrary to the Proclamation.</p>

That the Acts 1584. against the Discipline of the Church, should be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and the present Discipline establish'd. 2. That the Act of Annexation should be abrogated, and the Patrimony of the Church restor'd. 3. That Abbots and Priors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor none having Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from them should Vote in Parliament, as Representing the Church. 4. That the Land should be purg'd of Blood.</p>
               <p>The King rejected the second and third, but in complyance with the first Article he did, because of his present difficulties, as <hi>Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> observes, allow the present Church Discipline by General Assemblies, Synods, and Presbyteries; but yet he does not here expresly abrogat Episcopacy, only the Presentations are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to be directed to them, but to Presbyteries; which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations are again restor'd to Arch-bishops and Bishops by the 1 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 21 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6.

               <p>By this Act the Collation and Deprivation of Ministers is declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to belong to the Church <hi>jure divino</hi>; but these words, <hi>or any siklike essential Censures, having warrand from the Word of God,</hi> are too general and may be abused.</p>
               <p>This Act is now abrogated totally in all its Heads, Clauses and Articles, by the 1 <hi>Act</hi> 2 <hi>Sess. Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. which seems too general; for though this Act establishes Presbytery, yet there are many Clauses in it in favours of the Protestant Religion, and to which no answer can be made, but that, what this Act has establish'd in favours of the Protestant Religion, was formerly establish'd by other Acts, but the truth is, these Acts are not so full as this.</p>

               </p>
               <p>By this Act though the persons be depriv'd, yet it is declar'd that their deprivation shall not be prejudicial to Tacks lawfully set by them before their deprivation, and the Lords do expone the word <hi>lawfully</hi> so, as to extend to the Setter himself, so that his Successors can only quarrel these Rights upon such reasons as the Setter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self could have quarrelled them, <hi>Vid.

               <p>These Erections likewise of new Patronages, are extreamly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious to the people, because one Gentleman has thereby right to force a Minister upon all the other ancient and great He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retors of the Paroch. Likeas, by being Patron, he comes to have interest in all their Teinds; and since the great design of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and surrender, was, that every man might have right to his own Teinds, this could never have been fully done, except the Patronages had been surrendered, for the Patron still would be in effect Titular, by getting Tacks.</p>
               <p>Likeas, by the submission, as in the beginning of it, they submit, as having, or pretending right to the Parsonage, Vicarage, or Patronage of Kirks pertaining to the Erections, so in the words of the Submission, they submit how they may be Denuded in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties favours <hi>omni halili modo,</hi> of all and sundry Tiends, which they have of any other mens Lands, by whatsoever Right or Title they possess the same; and because His Majesty will take into His Princely Consideration, what satisfaction they shall have for their Tacks, Rights, and Patronages, according as His Majesty shall find the validity thereof. Therefore they submit, and His Majesty considers in the Decreet-arbitral, all the Patronages as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and the reason why he determines nothing, especially for the Patronages, is, because considering all the Erection together, he determines satisfaction for that which is the true pecuniary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, nor needed the <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament express Patronages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it only expresses these things, for which a pecuniary interest was to be given; or these Rights which were to be salved, but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages was neither of these: But the <hi>Act</hi> having annexed all the Superiorities of Kirk-lands, and Pertinents thereof, pertaining to whatsoever Abbacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Tenor of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties general determination, and the conditions therein exprest, it has thereby annexed all the Patronages, and it is observable, that though reservations are made, yet there is no reservation of Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages.</p>

That the Tenor of a Decreet of Forfalture, pronunced upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission granted to the Earl of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> could not be proven, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Process were produced, whereupon it proceeded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to this <hi>Act,</hi> since all that the Witnesses could prove, was, that they had seen such a Decreet, which is not sufficient, for else an unjust Decreet of Forefalture might be pronunced and lost, to the end the Tenor thereof might be proven without any possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of quarrelling the VVarrands, whereupon it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>It may be doubted what is meant by that part of the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which belongs to the King; and I conceive that when such Commissions of Justiciary are granted, the whole Escheat belongs to the King, and the Commissioners have only Right to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Expence <hi>tanquam mandatarii,</hi> except a particular <hi>Quota</hi> be condescended on in their Commission, though some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that these Commissioners have right to the same <hi>Quota</hi>'s that Sheriffs have, since they are Sheriffs in that part,</p>

and the Debitor suffers the day of payment to elapse; it seems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, that for Debts which may be very small, he should be oblig'd to send to these remote and dangerous parts, to Charge the Debitor personally, and the Debitor may constitute a Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to pay, <hi>&amp; sibi imputet,</hi> that he did not pay, and it is presumed, that at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which is <hi>communis patria,</hi> every man hath a Procurator, else Citations at the Peer and Shore of <hi>Lieth</hi> upon sixty dayes, where the man is in the <hi>Indies,</hi> were as unlawful as this is, and the performance as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding of this Act, I find that a Charge of Horning upon six days, by a consent in the Clause of Registration, was sustained, though the person Denunced offered to prove that he could not obey the Charge, he living in so remote a place, <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> 1675. <hi>Meldrum contra Tolquhon:</hi> and though by this Act it be appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Denunciations upon such unlawful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations shall be null, and that the users shall be oblig'd to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunce, and Charge of new, according to the custom of the Realm; yet I see not how this can be, for the Clause of Registration insert, being upon six dayes, or a shorter time, cannot be a sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, to Charge upon more dayes, and so that new Charge would want a warrand, except this Act of Parliament shall be said to be the warrand thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. That here the Subjects are obliged, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desired by the Magistrate, to search for, and apprehend Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and so the Objection against the Bond appointed by the Council, <hi>January</hi> 1678. Wherein it was asserted, that no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Subject was bound to take, or search for Rebels, was a most illegal Objection, expresly contrary, not only to this Act, but to the true interest of the Common-wealth, which obliges every man to do his utmost endeavour to keep the Countrey quiet: Nor can there be any thing more reasonable than that these who enter in a Society shall promote the good of the Society, by all possible means, and that these who have the protection of the Law, should persecute all such as oppose it; and this Duty to the King, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such as are Rebels to him, seems to be implyed in the very nature of our Allegiance. But it may be argued, that this should only be extended to such as are Traitors, or at least to such as are Intercommuned, which is contrary to the express words of this Act, whereby all men are discharged to reset Traitors, or Rebels, contemnantly remaining at the Horn, so that the resetting all who remain at the Horn, is here punished; and this Act being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, as the Act bears, as a further addition to the former Law, must be extended against all Rebels, for the Common Law did formerly reach this far against the resetting of Traitors, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communed persons, <hi>vid. Act</hi> 97 <hi>Par.</hi> 7 <hi>Ja.</hi> 5. And whereas it may be pretended, that this Act obliges only the Lieges to assist Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats in taking such persons. It is answered, that that was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently secured by former Laws, and this Act obliges all the Lieges simply.</p>
               <p>BY this excellent Act,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 145.</note> it is provided that all Gifts of Escheat taken simulatly, either by the Rebel himself, or by others, to the behove of the Rebel, shall be null, for else the falling of their Escheat would be no punishment to Rebels, nor discouragement from Rebellion.</p>
               <p>This simulation may be prov'd, either directly by the Oath of the Donatar, or may be inferred from presumptions, as all other Frauds and Simulations are, since the design of Fraud and Dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, being to palli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t and cover a Cheat, if presumptions were not sustained to astruct the Simulation, it could never be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The first Presumption is, that the Gift is granted to the Children of the Rebel, and if the Children be <hi>unforis familiat,</hi> it is concluded to be a simulat Gift <hi>presumptione juris</hi>; and yet if a Child <hi>in familia,</hi> have <hi>a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culium</hi> of his own. It may be alleadg'd that his Father as Administrator, being Debitor to him, he has taken his Escheat in his Sons Name for his security, but though the Children be <hi>forisfamiliat</hi>; yet by this Act of Parliament, there lyes <hi>presumptio juris</hi> against them, if this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel continue in Possession; and therefore the Children must prove that they have it for an onerous Cause, and thus is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that Decision of <hi>Dury, March</hi> 20. 1623. Lord <hi>Keith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra

Denbolm</hi>; Where it was found that no Contingency of Blood, no not the being a Son, was sufficient to infer Simulation; but if this were sustained simply, as ordinarly it is, then Creditors may be easily cheated, and the Donatar might still continue to have the advantage of the Escheat, though not the possession of the Goods.</p>
               <p>Likas, by this Act of Parliament, it is expresly provided that the Thesaurer may intromet with the Goods, if they be in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Rebel, his Wife, or Bairns, which shews that the Parliament lookt upon this as a presumption to infer Fraud.</p>
               <p>The second Presumption is, that the Gift was exped upon the Expence of the Rebel, though the Donatar was Creditor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in so far as the Donatar made use of the Gift, being Creditor for his own security, <hi>March</hi> 11. 1624. And if yet the Creditor was only Creditor, by buying of Land from the Rebel, and knew that there was a prior Right granted to another person. The Lords Declared that his Gift should not prejudge that prior Right, <hi>June</hi> 22 1669. And if the Rebel did once take the Gift blank, though he thereafter filled up a lawful Creditors Name therein, the Rebel procuring the Gift so upon his own expence, this will infer it to be simulat, and extinguish the Right, though the Donatar was truely a lawful Creditor, <hi>December</hi> 17. 1670. <hi>Lantoun contra Scot.</hi> By which it may be concluded, that though originally the Rebel may exped a Gift upon his own expences, for the behove of a lawful Creditor, where the Rebel takes the Gift himself, and thereafter fills up a lawful Creditors Name, that will not make it reconvalesce, <hi>nam quod ab initio vitiosum est tractu temporis non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test convalescere.</hi>

               <p>The third Presumption is the Rebels retaining Possession, but how long Possession would be sufficient to infer this Simulation, is <hi>in arbitrio judicis,</hi> for the suffering the Rebel to remain some time in possession is no presumption, even against a Son, since the Donatar must have some time to pursue, and recover Decreets, but if the Donatar suffer him to continue very long, this is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptio juris &amp; de jure,</hi> for though there were no Simulation in the the case; yet the negligence of the first Donatar would make place for a second, and even the Donators suffering the Rebel to possess three years, has been found to be <hi>presumptio juris,</hi> for infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Simulation, <hi>June</hi> 1666. <hi>Oliphant contra Oliphant.</hi>

And His Majesty by His Gifts to His Work-men, declares them to be exeem'd, conform to these Acts, whereupon the Council in <hi>anno</hi> 1680. did find they should not be stented; and all these priviledges are again Ratifi'd in the Parliament, 1681. But there being a Declarator rais'd of these priviledges before the Lords of Session in <hi>anno</hi> 1684. It was objected, <hi>first,</hi> That because these Acts being made in favours of the Kings Servants, whilst our Kings liv'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and they actually ty'd to Service, the saids Acts should not now take place, but should cease with the Service, whereupon they are sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though Wrights, Masons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who are actually at present ty'd to serve, may plead this priviledge, yet the same cannot be crav'd by the Kings Barbers, Shoe-makers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who never serve.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The said Exemption could extend no further than to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the imployment they had from the King; but if the Kings Smith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have from the people, the imployment that other poor Smiths should have, it were not just that he should be exeem'd, which were to make them pay the value of the Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that should be put upon him.</p>

Though these Exemptions could secure against Impositions laid on by the Town, yet they cannot secure against Impositions laid on in Parliament by voluntar offers, made by the Subjects themselves, in which those Trads-men must be considered as volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Offerers, as well as others, since they are re-presented in Parliament as well as others: And in which Act, Colledges and Hospitals are only exeem'd, and not they; this Debate is as yet come to no Decision.</p>

This Act of Parliament has likewise been extended, not only to Suburbs, but to all who were within the Liberties and Priviledges of Burrows Royal, though the saids places be not properly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, and that the Act of Parliament discharges only the exercise of such Crafts in Suburbs adjacent to the saids Burrows, <hi>July</hi> 7. 1671.

               <p>It may be doubted whether, since this Act of Parliament allows only the Provost and Bailies, or the Officers to intromet with, and Escheat the materials so wrought, if therefore the Crafts-men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Towns may intromet, they being neither named in this allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and because they are too interested to have had this power committed to them.</p>
               <p>It may be also doubted whether, though they may Escheat the Goods, when they are actually taken, if they may by vertue of this Act, pursue the Un-free-men; for though there be no such warrand in this <hi>Act</hi>; yet it seems that without they have this allowance, the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge granted by the Act, would be useless, since it would put them to keep more Servants to catch the Inbringers, then the Priviledge deserves.</p>

               <p>By this Act also, a power is granted to the Magistrats of Burghs, to cause repair Burnt and Waste Lands; but yet ordinarly the Magistrats of Burrows use to give in Petitions to the Council, craving liberty to force the Heretors of such Burnt Lands, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair their Burnt Lands themselves, or else to sell their part, and when there are many small Heretors concern'd, the Council grants Warrand to the Magistrats to regulat their Venditions, though I know it hath been alleadg'd that the Council could not do this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was an Inversion of Property, and that this was only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to the Parliament; and yet the Council have still been in use to do so for the common good of the people, nor is any man a loser, since he may repair by himself, and if he will not, he gets his just price. This was granted to the Magistrats of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1678. <hi>publice enim interest ne civitatis aspectus deforme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; ideo constitutum est, l.</hi> 4. <hi>C. de jur. reipub. aream col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsam posse a fisco distrahi si proprietarius monitus eam reficere non curaverit, vid. l.</hi> 46. <hi>ff. de dam. insect.</hi> I have seen a Decreet in <hi>anno</hi> 1636. at the Town of <hi>Edinburghs</hi> instance, against several Heretors, before the Lords of Session, for ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heretors of these Houses (upon which the <hi>Trone-Church</hi> now stands) to denude themselves of their Right in favours of the Town, <hi>ob utilitatem publicam,</hi> and to appoint four for them, and four for the Town, for valuing the Lands, that the price may be pay'd accordingly.</p>
               <p>But to prevent all such Debates, it is appointed by the 6 <hi>Act</hi> 3 <hi>Sess.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59223:151"/>
even for beautifying the Town, but the Privy Council has since this Act, granted a Warrand to force privat Heretors to sell and accept their price, for making the Entry to the <hi>Parliament-House</hi> more large and convenient, though it it was alleadg'd that this could not otherwise be done than after three years, and in the way prescriv'd by the Act of Parliament, which has made no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any such case as this, and if the Council could do this, they might as well have made the Act of Parliament it self; for the power granted to Magistrats by Act of Parliament proceeds upon the same motive of publick Good.</p>
               <p>It might likewise have been alleadged that whatever the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil might have done in cases of absolute necessity, as if the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-House</hi> had wanted an Entry altogether; yet they could not invert Property meerly for the conveniency of enlarging the Entry, beyond what formerly serv'd in our Predecessors time.</p>

they are turn'd in Acts of Parliament, without mentioning that they had been Acts of Sederunt formerly, as uses to be done when the Parliament Ratifies such Acts; it seems that it was rather the Exchequers part than the Sessions, to have Regulated the Kings Revenue and Property, whereunto all the above cited Acts relate; but about this time, I find in the Sederunt Book, several Acts ingrossed, bearing to have <hi>been made by the Lords of Secret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, Session, and Exchequer, met together,</hi> which is like the several Chambers whereof the Parliaments of <hi>France</hi> consist, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen all together when any solemn arrest, or Decision is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunced <hi>in purpuris,</hi> as they call it; and these Acts being Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of what was Law in relation to the Kings Property: It was more proper for the Session to have made such Acts, than for the Exchequer, who raise the Kings Rents conform to Law, but declare not what is so.</p>

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59223:153"/>
upon Clauses in Infestments cannot be purg'd at the Bar, because they are incurr'd by paction betwixt parties, which the Lords can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter; for the Superiour having given out the Feu upon that express condition, it is not just to alter what was expresly Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst parties, <hi>December</hi> 1. 1664.

               <p>If offer was made of the Feu-duty, but refus'd, yet this will not be sustain'd when Reduction is pursu'd <hi>ex hoc capite,</hi> except it be instantly offered of new at the Bar; nor will a Term be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for purging, as was found in the former case, in which the Lords also inclin'd to think that compensation will not be sustain'd to take off this irritancy; for though Compensation <hi>tollit debitum,</hi> yet there is a reverence due by the Vassal, and which is considered more than the value of the Feu-duty it self; but yet if the Vassal come and offer humbly to his Superiour, before the Term of payment, Compensation of as much as is due to him in payment of the Feu-duty, <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> if this will not be sufficient, it may be doubted whether a minor will be restored against the not payment of his Feu-duty, since it is not just that the Superiour should be prejudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the minority of his Vassal, or that the nature of the Feu should be thereby inverted; and it may be also doubted whether this irritancy will be incurr'd by him who was hindred <hi>vi majori</hi> from payment, as by being taken and detained Prisoner, or carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remote Countreys, since by the Feudal Law in other cases, this does excuse <hi>a mora,</hi> and from all the incon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So much use the Lords to favour the Vassal against such severe irritancies, that a Retour bearing in the first part of it, an irritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for not payment of the Feu-duty <hi>si petatur tantum,</hi> they allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Vassal to purge, though in the posterior part of the Retour, these words were omitted in the Clause irritant it self, <hi>February</hi> 18. 1680.

and reasonable, though they be not thereto empowered by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Acts of Parliament, and therefore they are ill Subjects, and worse Lawyers, who allow the King to do nothing but that for which he can shew an Act of Parliament; since his being an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarch implyes this innate Power; and therefore it follows by a better consequence, when any thing is contraverted, that the King may do the thing in controversie being reasonable, if his power be not as to that point restrained by a particular Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>It is likwise very observable that this power of absolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy does not flow from the people, but is his own Right, for no Act of Parliament grants the King any Prerogative, but only declares by way of humble acknowledgement what his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were, <hi>principibus,</hi> says <hi>Tacitus, summum rerum judicium dii de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt, subditis obsequii gloria relicta est, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Armal. vid. observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> on the 15 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. where our Parliament acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that our Kings hold their Crowns from God immediatly, <hi>Vid.

               <p>I know some pretend that the Kings power is here declar'd to be absolute only in opposition to the Pope, and implyes no more but that he did not depend upon the Pope; but this is very groundless, for he is here declared absolute in relation to his laying on of Customs, in which the Pope is no way concern'd; and generally the Kings power in relation to Ecclesiastick Rights, is said, to be supream not absolute; and in Civil Rights, is said to be absolute, and not supream.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 277.</note>THere are two ways of Levying Subsidies in <hi>Scotland</hi>; the one is by Taxation, which was the old way, and which Taxation was uplifted according to the Retour: The other is by way of Cess, in which the Subsidie is uplifted according to the late Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein every mans Land Rent was given up, as presently possess'd.</p>
               <p>The Subsidie granted by this Act, is by way of Taxation, and the old way of uplifting Subsidies by Taxations, may be fully here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in seen, and which is very fit to be Read upon that accompt; and in which it is evident that the Clergy pay'd the one half, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Erections; but in <hi>anno</hi> 1666. a proposal being made that the Subsidie then offered, should be uplifted by way of Cess, and not by way of Taxation.</p>
               <p>These ensuing Reasons were represented against that proposal, and which I have here insert, because they tend very much to the clearing many of our old Laws and Customs.</p>
               <p>The Reasons were, 1. That the Rule and Way for uplifting Taxations has in all ages been according to Retours, and the Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rolls until these late unhappy and irregular times; from which it is humbly conceiv'd a Rule and Presedent ought not to be taken. It is beyond all question, this being the good old way, though it were upon no other account, ought not to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the danger and inconveniency of the alteration of ancient Laws and Customs, being so great and obvious from the late experience of these Kingdoms, that this age needeth not to be put in mind of the same, but may be a sad remembrance to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The foresaid way is only now the legal way wherein Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can be uplifted at this time, seing the same is determined and authoriz'd by ancient and uncontroverted Customs in all ages, and beyond memory, and by the Law of Nations, and the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law of this Kingdom; ancient National Custom is Law, and of as great force as Statute, and is the great Basis and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Power, and Rights, and Property of the Prince and People, which for the most part are warranted and secured by the Common Law and Custom, and not by express Act of Parliament and Statute.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This way of uplifting Taxations and the proportions of the same, payable by the respective Estates, is designed and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by express Laws and Acts of Parliament, so that the same cannot be altered but by a Parliament, which only has power to repeal as appears by the 56 <hi>Act Ja.</hi> 3 <hi>Par.</hi> 7. intituled, <hi>These Retours should contain the Old and New Extent</hi>; and the Act 229. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6 <hi>Par.</hi> 14. Ordaining all Feu-lands annex'd, and other Feu-lands vvhatsomever to be retour'd, and vvhen any Taxation or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post is to be rais'd, that the Feuers shall be charged according to the Retour; and by the 229 <hi>Act Ja.</hi> 6 <hi>Par.</hi> 14. Ordaining His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Property to be Retour'd, and such Lands as are dissolv'd
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59223:157"/>
and dismembered from Baronies to be Retour'd, and charged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Retours, in order to the payment of Taxation, and divers others, and in special all the Acts of Parliament concerning the granting and uplifting Taxations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas it is pretended by the Heritors of the Western Shires, that their Retoures are higher than in other Shires, and that it should be a more equal way that the Taxation should be uplifted as C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sses, according to the Valuation, without respect to Retours; these Gentlemen have no reason to complain, being their own Deeds, procured by them, upon the verdict of their own Friends and Neighbours <hi>per fideles homines patriae,</hi> and according to which they have pay'd not only Taxations, according to the old extent; but His Majesties Casualities of None-entry, Relief, and siklike, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the New Extent contain'd in the said Retours, and has been also in use to uplift the like Casualities from their own Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, according to the said Retoure; That the Retours should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together taken away, both as to Old and New Extent, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that they will not desire, seeing if their Retour should be lessened, as to the New Extent, it would be an irrepairable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to His Majesty, as to his ordinary Benefite and Casualities of None-entry, Relief; and siklike a prejudice to themselves, as to the same Casualities due, and payable to themselves by their Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, and what incongruity should it be, that the same Retour should be altered as to the Old Extent, and should be stated as to the New, and that it should be still a Rule, as to their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and benefite, and not as to the payment of the Taxation to his Majesty, as it has been in all ages, it being also considered, that they cannot say that the Lands are valued unjustly by their Retours, and extend to more than the true value, the time of the Retouring of the same, and since that time they cannot deny that they are improven for the most part above any proportion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The interest, and consequently the way of proceeding of Lawful Princes; and Usurpers being so different and opposite, that as Princes are <hi>patres patriae,</hi> and do cherish and intend the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing of their Subjects; so by the contrary, it is the interest and practice of Usurpers <hi>deglubere,</hi> to squize and oppress the people, that they should not be in a capacity to shake off the Yoke: it is neither the honour nor interest of the Countrey to take a pattern and rise from the Usurpers to overturn the ancient Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, especially in the matter of Taxations, seeing the necessity and fatal course of these times, in order to maintaining of War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his gracious Majesty, and his blessed Father did not only require a Taxation, which was an easie burden to the people, and were chearfully granted, and oftimes offered to his Majesties Royal Predecessors as an aid and subsidie, when their occasions did call for the same, but the Usurpers were driven to exact a considerable part of every persons Estate, as a constant Tribute, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Taxt and Loan Maintainance, Cess and such like burdens, which cannot be remembred without horrour; and in order to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59223:158"/>
the same, to introduce a new way by Valuation, whereas his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is to have an ordinary Taxation; and therefore there is no reason but that the same should be rais'd in that good old and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, that has ever been used in the time of his Majesties Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Royal Predecessour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The way of Cess, both as to the manner and thing is so hateful to the Body of the people of this Kingdom, that though exhausted in a low condition, they did offer, and chearfully grant to His Majesty a constant yearly Taxation and Annuity, during His Majesties Life, of 40000 pound Sterling, upon consideration expresly mentioned in the said <hi>Act,</hi> that His Majesty had signified His Royal Resolution, not to raise any more Cess, it cannot be expressed how great dissatisfaction and apprehension it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in the hearts of the people, if that unhappy way of Cess should be reviv'd, under what name or notion soever, now after His Majesties Restitution, and that the people had just reason to think themselves secur'd by the ancient Laws and Custom of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and His Majesties gracious Resolution so recently and solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed by His Majesties late Commissioner in Parliament, and recorded in a Printed Act, being the 14 of His Majesties late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and first Session thereof.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Western Shires, being only five, and the remnant Shires who plead for the good old Way, according to the ancient Laws of the Kingdom, being five times more, it is humbly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, that the interest and number of so many other Shires should weigh down the pretences and desires of so few Shires, for a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation contrary to the Law and Liberty of the Kingdom; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also considered, that though the Loyalty of some Noblemen and Gentlemen within the said Western Shires, be above all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be more eminent, that there are so few of sound Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples there, yet to speak modestly, the generality of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of these Shires has not been so forward to desire or promote His Majesties Restitution and Interest, that now after His Majesties happy Re-establishment, they should obtain what they could never effectuate in any time, and should be gratifi'd to the prejudice of other Shires of undoubted and constant Loyalty, and the overturning the ancient Law, and Way of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As to the pretence of inequality in the old Way, it is to be considered, that though an Arithmetical proportion and exactness is not to be expected in any Way; Yet there is more reason to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume for the justice and equity of a legal way, venerable for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, warranted by express Laws and immemorial Custom, which for any thing known, had its beginning in the time of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and has been continued in the best, most peaceable and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est times, notwithstanding any endeavours to the contrary, than for a way contriv'd and hatch'd in the Heart and fury of Trouble and Distempers, and brought forth and obtruded upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey with so much partiality and factiousness, that it is well known that the Shires, and persons who were in opposition to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59223:158"/>
had so great and prevalent interest for the time, that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luations, both as to the <hi>Quota</hi> of Shires, and proportions and Rents of private persons were carry'd on by the instruments and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, most inequally to the advantage of their party, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident prejudice and pressure of whole Shires, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who were sincere, or had the least Affection for the Royal Interest.</p>
               <p n="9">9. By the Common and Feudal Law and Law of the Kingdom, where the Heir of the Vassal Dieth, not Entered, the Superiour during the None-entry, has right to the Duties of the Land holden of him, and when the Heir of Ward-lands doth Enter, the Superiour hath Right to the Duties for a year, under the notion of Relief, which in both these Cases of Relief and Non-entry, are payable accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Retoures and the New Extent; if the old way of Retoures should be altered in relation to the payment of Taxations, why not in order to None-entries and Relief, so that they should be payed, not according to Retour but Valuations, there being no reason that the saids Casualities are not exacted in rigour: but the ancient Law and Custom for Retoures. How dangerous the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative may be, if the way of Retoures should be altered, even to those who are for Novations, and what Combustion and Disorder it may occasion in the contrary, it is so apparent, that it needs not to be represented.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Whereas it is pretended that the Lords and others of the Clergy, will have prejudice by the Old Way, both as to their own proportion, and the proportion of the Vassals, and that they are in another condition than formerly, by reason that their Rents are impaired by Valuations and Ministers Stipends, it is humbly conceived with all tenderness and respect to the reverend Clergy, that whatever others for their own interest, do suggest under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of theirs. The Lords of the Clergy and others, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to contribute, and be Taxt for His Majesties Service, as the other Estates, and as to the pretended way of paying Taxation according to the Valuations in these late times, they cannot be Taxed in that way, because the Rents of the Bishops being for the most part in these times of Usurpation, mortified to Universities and other pious uses, they were not valued, nor lyable to Cess and such like burdens; it must then follow, that either they must be Taxed in the old Way, or else not at all as to the proportion of the Clergie, it is designed by all the Laws concerning Taxations, and it is not higher than it was at any time, since Taxations were granted to His Majesties Predecessors; and it is to be observ'd in all Acts of Parliament concerning Taxations. The Lords of the Clergie do in the first place, before the rest of the Estates, make a chearful offer of the same proportion without any grudging, and though there needs no reason to be given for clear Law and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; yet that the said proportion is Defin'd, and settled upon good Reason, it is obvious, seing the same is impos'd in order, both to their Spirituality, consisting in Tiths, and their Temporality
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59223:159"/>
consisting in Lands and others; and it is known that the Tiths are more than the fourth part of the Rent of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities and Church-lands will extend to a considerable part of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at least to a fourth part.</p>
               <p>The Clergie having their Benefices and Living, not in Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the other Estates, but of His Majesties immediat favour and grant, and for their lifetime; so that it is not strange, that upon the considerations foresaid they pay'd such a proportion of the Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the case is not altered upon the account of Valuations and Ministers Stipends, that course for Valuation of Tiends, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Stipends being procured, and taken at the earnest desire of the Reverend Bishops and Clergy; so that it ought not to be represented, as being to their prejudice; and <hi>de facto,</hi> the Reverend Bishops and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nisters, have no prejudice by that course, by reason the Bishops and Ministers, and Benefic'd persons (who ought only to be looked upon as Clergie) are secur'd by divers provisions contained in the Acts of Parliament anent the Valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tiths, and in special, that what they were in possession of actually and really the time of the Submission, made by them, should remain with them <hi>in quantitate &amp; qualitate,</hi> unpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>judged by any Valuation, so that the Valuation and augmentation of Stipends being only in Relation to, and affecting the Spirituality and Tiends; the case neither is, nor can be altered as to the Clergie, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing secured by the saids Provisions, and the burden of augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Stipends, and prejudice by Valuations, doth only ly upon the Lords; and Titulars of Erection, and Tacks-men of Tiths, as the case is not altered in relation to Benefic'd persons; so Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiary Ministers cannot be prejudg'd by the good old Way, seing by an Act of Parliament 162 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6 <hi>Par.</hi> 13. They are freed and exempted of all Taxations and Impositions, the burden of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Clergie doth not ly upon them, but for the most part upon the Vassals, and Tacks-men against which they have by the Law a present and summar way of Relief, as to the Lands and Temporality of the Clergie, they are the same, and in the same case as in time of former Taxations; and that the Vassals of Erection, or of Church-men, should be in better case than formerly, as to the payment of Taxation, It is contrary to Law and Reason, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>res transit cum onere &amp; causa</hi>; and that Lay-men acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lands from Church-men, should have more case of Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to such Lands, than other Church-men had, when they possessed the same, is inconsistent with Law, and with the Respect and Priviledges belonging to that Sacred Order.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Whereas it is pretended, that since His Majesties Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the said Act of Parliament containing His Promise and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, not to raise any more Cess: A Taxation hath been pay'd to the Lords of Session in the way of Cess, that pretence is of no weight, it being considered that the said Taxation is granted, not to His Majesty, but for an honorary allowance to the Lords of Session; and by an Act of the same Parliament, wherein His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59223:159"/>
Declar'd that no more Cess should be rais'd; so that the said Act being in the same Parliament, and it being an exception from the said Act, <hi>firmat regulam in non exceptis,</hi> and shuts the Door as to the future, upon that manner of Raising of Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

               <head>King <hi>JAMES</hi> the sixth, Parliament <hi>17.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere have been two Commissions granted for considering of an Union betwixt this Kingdom and <hi>England,</hi> one in this year 1604. and another in <hi>anno</hi> 1670. Betwixt which there are only these two differences; that in this Act the Names of the Commissioners are set down, and they had no other Commission but the Act of Parliament; but in the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission 1670. the persons were nominated by his Majesty, under His Great Seal; the nomination being refer'd to the King by that <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament.</p>
               <p>The second difference is, that in this Commission 1604. their power is limited with this provision, <hi>viz.</hi> not derogating any wayes from any Fundamental Laws, ancient Priviledges, Offices, Rights, Dignities, and Liberties of this Kingdom: but the other has no such exception; and yet it may be doubted, whether by vertue of the last Commission, those who were Commissionated, could have derogated by their Treaty, from any of our Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws, ancient Priviledges, Offices and Dignities?</p>
               <p>That the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> could not consent to an Union of Parliaments, though all its Members were admitted, without at least Consulting the Shires and Burghs, which the respective Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament represent, may be thus urg'd; all Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the frailty of their Representatives, and that some ages and generations do too easily quite, what is fit and necessary for secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Liberty; have therefore thought fit to declare some Fundamentals to be above the reach of their power; and that Parliaments cannot overturn Fundamentals, seems clear, not only, because these were not Fundamentals, if they could be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, that being the true difference betwixt Fundamental and other Laws; But if a Parliament should enslave their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to a Forraigner, the people might by a subsequent Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on disown the Perfidie; or if two of three Estates should by plurality exclude the third, surely their Exclusion would be null; and that the Constitution of a Parliament is a Fundamental, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not only from the Nature and Weight of that Priviledge; but likewise from this Commission, <hi>anno</hi> 1604. wherein it is call'd Fundamental, and looked upon as unalterable; nor is it imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, how the Parliament cannot invert the Constitution of one Estate, and yet can invert and alter the Constitution of the whole: and by our Statutes it is Declared <hi>Treason, to endeavour to lessen the power of the three Estates of Parliament</hi>; and it cannot be said, that their power is not lessened, when they cannot make one Act or Statute by their own authority, or when others have more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in, and influence upon their Determinations, than they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have; and when, from being absolute, they become sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59223:163"/>
to another; and a Parliament has but some such power over the people, as the Magistrats and Council have over a Burgh; for the Parliament is but the great Council of the people and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and it is most certain, that the Magistrats and Council of a City or Town, could not consent to Incorporat with another Town, and consent to the eversion of their own, without the full consent of their people whom they Govern.</p>
               <p>Commissioners for Shires and Burghs, are the same with us that <hi>procuratores universitatis</hi> are in the Civil Law; and Procurators <hi>eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am cum libera,</hi> could not alienat the Rights of their Constituents, without a special Mandat for that effect, <hi>l. procuratori ff. de procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi> nor can they exchange nor transact upon what belongs to their Constituents (which is our case exactly) <hi>l. mandato generali ff. de procurat.</hi> and if we consider the Commission whereby they sit in Parliament, we will find it does only empower them to Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in Parliament their Constituents in every thing, which shall be advantagious for them: From which Commissions I argue, first, That this is but <hi>mandatum generale</hi>; for it empowers them only in general Terms and bears no Warrand to Treat with <hi>England,</hi> of an Union of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>no l. §. qui assidua ff. de aedidit. edict. &amp; non comprehendit ea quae sunt usui re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionis repugnantia</hi>; it empowers not such as have it to do things extraordinary, and which, it is probable, the Constituents would not allow, <hi>l. ut si filius ff. de donationibus, l. indebitum ff. decon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict indebit &amp; cap. generali de reg. jur. in sexto</hi>; but in such cases, as Lawyers observe, and Reason Teaches, the Constituent is to be Consulted, and a special Mandat is required; as is clear by the Laws above-cited. Our Commissioners for Shires and Burghs, sit by vertue of Commissions, and as they need a Warrand to sit, so cannot they exceed it when they sit, and are not arbitrary; Nor could the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as now Constituted, resign their Parliamentary power over to the Council; Nor does their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion empower them to ordain, that there shall be no future Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and when they exceed their Commissions, they are no more Members of Parliament, and therefore what they do, is null.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By these Commissions, the Commissioners for Shires and Burghs, are only empowered to Represent them in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi>; which presupposeth that there must be a Parliament, and consequently that they cannot exstinguish, or innovat the Constitution of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi>; for how can they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Shires and Burghs in a Parliament, which is not; and certainly the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> can be said to be no more, when they make but a part of the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; for <hi>Scotland</hi> cannot be called <hi>Britain,</hi> nor a part of a Parliament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called a Parliament, no more than the Commissioners for the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> can be called the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi>; but how our Commissioners could sit in the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by vertue of their former Commissions, I see not? and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59223:163"/>
therefore it seems to be both fit and just, that the Commissioners of Shires and Burrows should be sent home to their respective Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituents, to crave their advice and consent, in so weighty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive an Affair, <hi>nam quod omnes tangit ab omnibus debet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be likewise contended that this Great Determination of Uniting both Parliaments, requires at least the full assent of the Members of both Parliaments; and that though the Parliament had power to alter its own Fundamentals; yet if any one dissent, the Union of both Parliaments must stop; for both in Law and Reason, the power of making Laws, and the Right to retain or resign Priviledges, are two different things; the one is a Legislative Power, which is regulated by plurality of Voices; the other is founded upon Dominion or Property, and is not subject to Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, no more than other Properties are; for as every Member has Right, so his Right cannot be taken away from him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own consent; though all these who are in the Society with him should renounce what is theirs, <hi>in re pari melior est conditio prohibentis, &amp; in re communi nemo dominorum jure quicquam sacere potest invito altero L. Sabinus, ait</hi> 28. <hi>ff. com. divid.</hi> thus if the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Society were by Law free from Impositions, though all the Society, save one, should submit to pay, yet plurality would not in that case oblige the Refuser, and if all who had interest in a Commonty, should condescend to Resign their Right therein in favours of another, yet if one were refractory, that one would not be prejudged by the consent of all the remanent partners; whence it seems consequential, that as the Parliament cannot Debar any Member from sitting in Parliament, so that if one Member by advice from his Constituents, oppose the Union of Parliaments, it could not be carry'd by plurality; for what ever Reason militats why plurality should not oversway in the one, does likewise mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat in the other; and if the right of every Member is given as the cause why, he cannot be debar'd from sitting; Why should not the same Right empower him much more to stop the total alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parliament? even as a man cannot be Debar'd from using a Commonty. It will likewise operat, that the Commonty cannot be altered in its Nature, without his consent; and the Right of these who sit in Parliament, is as much prejudg'd, by extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the being of a Parliament, as by debarring them from sitting, or Voicing in it. Our Shires and Burghs have Right to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in no Parliament, save that of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and therefore if the Commissioners had power to overturn the being of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they could have debar'd our Shires and Burghs from being Re-presented in the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> seing they could pretend no Right to sit there; so that it seems, either plurality of Voices may exclude any particular Member, and may retrinch that Member: Or else by the same Reason, no plurality can establish an Vnion of both Parliaments; and if our Parliament could by plurality of Voices, overturn the Fundamentals, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59223:164"/>
the very being of our Parliament; How shall it be possible to secure our Parliament, when it is joyn'd in with the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> into one Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> so as that the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> may not by the plurality of Voices, likewise overturn any Fundamentals that shall be condescended on; but that the Fundamental Constitution, and priviledges of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, are not subject to Suffrage, and cannot be abrogated, nor innovated, without the universal consent of all its Members and Commissioners, may be clear likewise from many Instances, for it is most certain that the Parliament, as now Constitute, could not by any Statute Ordain, that there should be no more Parliaments, or resign over their Parliamentary power in the hands of the Council; nor could they Transmit the Power they possess, in favours of their own Heirs, or exclude any of the Three Estates; and sure if Fundamentals be not subject to plurality of Voices; the power of Uniting of Parliaments, and suppressing of Monarchies is not, for these comprehend all other Priviledges and Fundamentals; and if the priviledges of one of the Three Estates cannot be altered by plurality; I see not how the priviledges of all the Three can be; and we have seen Parliaments in the last age do such irregular things, that the succeeding Parliaments have been forc'd, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to abrogat their Laws, but even to find that they had exceeded their power, which implyes that it was not arbitrary.</p>

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 2.</note> as it is Declar'd that it was never mean'd by His Majesty, that the Estate of Bishops was to be suppressed: Their sitting in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, being by this Act Declar'd, to be one of the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of the Nation: But by this Act, their Benefices are only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to them, which were much impaired: And though by the 114 <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 12 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. General and Synodal Assemblies, and Presbytries, are thereby Ratifi'd; yet Episcopacy is not thereby abrogated expresly.</p>
               <p>By this Act, the King is Declar'd <hi>to be Soveraign Monarch, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Prince, Judge, and Governour, over all Persons, Estates, and Causes, both Spiritual and Temporal, within this Realm</hi>: And by the 1 <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 2 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. It is asserted and Declared, <hi>That His Majesty hath the Supream Authority, and Supremacy over all Persons and in all Causes Ecclesiastical within this His Kingdom, and that by vertue thereof, the Ordering and Disposal of the External Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Policy of the Church, doth properly belong to His Majesty, and His Successors, as an inherent Right to the Crown:</hi> and that <hi>His Majesty and His Successors, may Settle, Enact, and Emit such Constitutions, Acts, and Orders, concerning the Administration of the external Government of the Church, and the persons employed in the same, and concerning all Ecclesiastical Meetings therein, as they in their Royal Wisdom shall think fit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There having been great Debates about the wording this part of the Act; some Members of Parliament, pressing to have it without any Restriction, and others, though very Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, pressing it might be Restricted to the Calling and Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Ecclesiastick Meetings, and External Government only: <hi>Lightoun</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dumblane,</hi> was at last trusted by the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner, who has drawn it very Cautiously for the Church; though our blinded Fanaticks think otherwise; For, First, It is Founded upon the former Old Statute; and after repeating that Statute, it
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59223:165"/>
is said, <hi>It is therefore Enacted,</hi> to shew that it was not Design'd, that this Act should exceed the former and old Supremacy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prerogative is restricted <hi>to Government</hi>; and not only so, but to the <hi>External Government</hi>; and even as to this External Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the King has only the Ordering, and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein it is acknowledg'd, that the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Kirk consists <hi>in the Preaching of the Word, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Manners, and the Administration of the Sacraments:</hi> In which <hi>Act,</hi> three things are observable; 1. That the <hi>Act</hi> tells they derive their Jurisdiction from the King, which is as to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part; for no man can think they Derive their power of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrating the Sacraments from the King; though from Him they Derive the Faculty of having the External Face of a Church, without which, that could not be enjoy'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the Church has the Correction of Manners, yet the King may regulat these, as we see in the very next <hi>Act,</hi> for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath; and which seems to have been made the next <hi>Act</hi> to this, for to clear the meaning of that part of this Act.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though the Preaching of the Word is Declar'd to be a part of the Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction; yet that relates only to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, to be Preach'd; as to which, Ministers are to be judg'd by Church Judicatures; but if they Preach what encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es on the Secular power, they are to be judg'd by the King, and those Deriving Power from Him, conform to the 129 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 8 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>This Supremacy in cases Ecclesiastick seems to have been ever the proper Right of Secular Princes; and <hi>Haedeus</hi> the Great <hi>Canonist. repet. in cap. novit. de jud. num</hi> 145.

               <p>In this Act the Bishops are not restored to Benefices, that are not of Cure, but to these which have a particular Cure; and therefore His Majesty Confirms all Dispositions, or other Rights made of Abbacies, Priories, or other Benefices, not being Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks made or Confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is likewise reserved by this Act, all Feus lawfully set and Confirmed before the Act of Annexation, which was in the year foresaid; and all Patronages of Kirks (pertaining formerly to them) Disponed by the lawful Titular; and the Kings Majesty, and Ratifi'd in Parliament, which extends, as well to the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages of Mensal Kirks, as of Kirks which are of the Bishops presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>March</hi> 25. 1631. and albeit <hi>regulariter confirmatio nihil no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi juris tribuit</hi>; yet <hi>hoc casu supplet omnes alios desectus</hi>; for by the former Practique it is found, that alienations of Patronages, even of Mensal Kirks, are valide, if made as said is, by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Titular; though not made by him, with the consent of the most part of the Chapter; for this Act requires that it be made by the lawful Titular, but there is no mention therein of the consent of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>By the Act of Annexation in <hi>anno</hi> 1587. the whole Superiorities of all Kirk-lands being annexed to the Crown, it was therefore necessary that by this Act, they should have been Restored, but they are not Restored expresly to these; but it is alleadged that they have Right to them by the 14 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.

               </p>
               <p>The difference betwixt these Restitutions by this Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, that the person that is restored by way of Grace, has not by his Restitution, Right to any part of the Forefaulted Lands, and others Disponed in favours of third parties: but such as are Restored by way of Justice, will thereby have Right to their own Lands, though Dispon'd to third parties, for onerous Causes, as was found in the Disposition of the Lands of <hi>Mugdock,</hi> formerly belonging to the Marquess of <hi>Montrose,</hi> and Disponed by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for onerous Causes to <hi>Argile:</hi> as also, these who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored by way of Justice, will have Right even to repeat the sums of Money, which formerly belonged to them, though assigned to third parties for onerous Causes: and albeit those sums were first ordained to be pay'd in to the Thesaurie, and precepts only drawn upon the Thesaurie, in favours of these third parties, as was found in the Earl of <hi>Branfords</hi> case against the Earl of <hi>Callen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and others; though this Restitution of Money seems much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than that of Lands, since Money is <hi>res sungibilis:</hi> and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Successors are not oblig'd to know to whom the same belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

It was answered, that these Heretable Offices were Dispon'd to the Family before that Act; and it being Reply'd, that the first Right was extinguished by the Forefaulture, and the Restitution being only by way of Grace, was to take effect only from the date; nor was it more suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent against the King, than if the King had granted them origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally at that time; in which case they would have been quarrallable on that Act; and yet <hi>de praxi,</hi> the King restores to Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as of the first date.

The King succeeding to Lands by Forefaulture, has right to whatever the Forefaulted person was five years in possession of before the Forefaulture, because it is presumed, that the Forefaulted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will abstract the Evidents; and therefore upon the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, it is likewise appointed by this Act, that the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Extracts out of the Register, shall satisfie the production in Improbations against the King in Forefaulted Lands; Whereas other singular Successors Rights will be improven, if the Originals be not produced, <hi>vide notata</hi> upon the said Act 2.

But though a Vassals Charter, who holds of the King, bear, <hi>si petatur tantum</hi>; Yet the Exchequer by an Act, does Tax the price, and pursue for these, and for annual growths, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they have not been crav'd within the year, for which I can give no other reason, but that the negligence of the Kings Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers cannot prejudge the King: But how can the Act of Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer alter the Nature of the holding, which is an express Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract betwixt the King and His Vassals; and it may be alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by Act of Exchequer, it may be as well Declar'd that prescription shall not run against the King, for this is a species of prescription; but especially since it is Declar'd by this Act, that they shall not pay, notwithstanding of any Act of Exchequer past, or to come: nor does the Act anent the negligence of the Kings Officers, abrogat this Act, as it ought to have done. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocats Protestation in the end of this <hi>Act</hi> seems to be in-intelligible; for how can Blench-duties be conform to the Kings Estate and Dignity: Some Interpret this <hi>Act,</hi> as if it only prohibited the Conversion of the Blench-duty into Money, in the body of the Charter; but does not hinder the Exchequers valuing of it: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to reconcile the present practice with this <hi>Act,</hi> make a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt holdings in <hi>blanco,</hi> and in <hi>alba firma</hi>; as if the first being an inconsiderable Duty, as a Rose, or a Penny, may not be converted to Money; but the other affording some profit, such as Gilt-spurs, Gloves, a pound of Pepper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be valued by the Exchequer.</p>

It may be doubted whether, since this <hi>Act</hi> runs in the general against Convocations within Burgh, if this <hi>Act</hi> should not as well extend to Burghs of Barony, and Burghs of Regality, as to Burghs Royal, since the word <hi>Burgh</hi> comprehends all; and the Reason inductive of this Act, <hi>viz.</hi> the quenching Convocations extends likewise to all; and when the Parliament designed to extend their Acts only to Burghs Royal, they were particularly exprest, as is to be seen in the immediat foregoing Act: and albeit it may be urg'd, that this Act speaks of Provost and Baillies, yet this must be Interpreted <hi>applicando singula singulis</hi>; for there are many Burghs Royal, as well as Burghs of Regality and Barony, that want Provosts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 5. It is observable that this Act proposes no punishment for Towns, where the Magistrats do not their duty to oppose Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults against the Government; yet the Town of <hi>Lanerk</hi> was fin'd for not pursuing those who burnt the <hi>Test</hi> at their Cross, <hi>anno</hi> 1681. and privat Burgesses pay a proportion of such fines, though they were not required by their Magistrates, because it is their duty to concur when they see such Tumults; and Magistrats are oftimes unable to require concurrence.</p>

It may be also doubted, whether speaking against the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or their Resolutions, is punishable by this <hi>Act,</hi> since it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes all reproachful Speeches of the People, or Countrey of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and they are the Representatives of the People; and since these are punishable who speak against a Councellour of <hi>England,</hi> much more ought they to be punish'd who speak against the House of Commons. But in my opinion, this <hi>Act</hi> reaches only such as speak reproachfully of their Nation, Countrey, and Counsellours; but the whole <hi>Act</hi> ought to be abrogated by our Parliament, as being past by us, in expectation that <hi>England</hi> would make such an <hi>Act</hi> in their Parliament, which they never did; and upon which account it was never in observance with us. It is likewise observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that though in our Law, Concealing and not Revealing, is only punishable in Treason; yet by this Statute, the hearing any thing spoke against the people of <hi>England,</hi> or any Privy Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in that Nation, and the not Revealing, is declared to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punishable, with inventing such Calumnies.</p>

Therefore it seems that this <hi>Act</hi> has been made; whereby it is declar'd, that such as are presented to Benefices, which were at the Presentation of Forefaulted persons, shall not be prejudg'd by their Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and which was very just, since Patrons are not prejudg'd; because it is presum'd, that the Ordinary would not Collate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that were insufficient; nor were Patrons allow'd to make any advantage by the Presentations; and upon the same principle, it seems reasonable to conclude, that a Minor cannot Revock a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation granted by him, with the consent of his Curators, during his Minority.</p>
               <p>THis Act Ratifies an Act of Privy Council, whereby <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were commanded to depart the Kingdom betwixt and the first of <hi>August</hi> thereafter, under the pain of Death:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 13.</note> but it may be justly doubted, how the Council had power to make Acts inferring the pain of Death? Since it is a received Principle in our Law, as is clear by <hi>Craig</hi> and others, that the Secret Council can make no <hi>Act</hi> which may infer forefaulture of Life or Estate: and though by the <hi>Acts</hi> 124, and 147. <hi>Par.</hi> 12 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6.

Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds and <hi>Aegyptians</hi> are to be employ'd in Common Works: yet by neither of these <hi>Acts,</hi> is the pain of Death to be inflicted: and therefore it was lately Debated, that this <hi>Act</hi> was but at best, a Temporary <hi>Act</hi>; and so <hi>Aegyptians</hi> could not be impannelled for their Life: but yet this <hi>Act</hi> has been still repute a sufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand for punishing by Death, such as were known, holden and repute to be <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> And I find, that upon the last of <hi>July</hi> 1611. <hi>Moses Schaw</hi> and others were Hang'd as <hi>Aegyptians</hi>; and it is notour, that immediatly after this <hi>Act</hi> Sheriffs and others did Hang very many, by warrand thereof; and the <hi>Act</hi> is not Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, for it appoints them to be Executed in time coming, after the first of <hi>August</hi>; and the Act has ordain'd <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against as Sorners and common Thieves, who are by our Law to be punish'd with Death, as is clear by the Narrative of this Act, which bears that the Council had Commanded, <hi>That the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and common Thieves, commonly call'd Aegyptians, &amp;c: should depart forth of the Kingdom</hi>; So that the Council has not inflicted the pain of Death upon a new Crime, but has only declared, <hi>That Aegyptians fell under the old Crime, that was punishable by Death:</hi> Nor can it be deny'd, but that from this and many other Acts it is
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59223:172"/>
clear, that the Council has a power to extend and interpret Statutes, even relating to Life and Forefaulture; since the Act appoints on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such to be punishable by Death, <hi>as are known, holden and repute to be Aegyptians</hi>: It may be doubted, what can prove that the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> pannell'd, <hi>are known, holden and repute to be such</hi>? For which, beside the common Inferences of notoriety adduc'd by <hi>Mascardus</hi> and others, <hi>in probatione notorij.</hi> Our Law allows that such as call themselves <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> or go up and down the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, bleaking their Faces, telling Fortunes, and speaking the Gebrish peculiar to those people, shall be punished as <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> and ordinarly His Majesties Advocat chooses such Assizers as know the persons impannelled, to be commonly repute to be <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>

               <p>AFter King <hi>James</hi> the sixth came to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> it was necessary that the Laws concerning the Borders should have been alter'd by both Kingdoms; and by this <hi>Act,</hi>

               <p>In place of the old Wardens of the Borders, there is now a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission granted under the Great Seals of both Kingdoms, to an equal number of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> who have in effect a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Justiciary; and it was found by the Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they could not quarrel the Decreets of the Borders, because they proceeded by a Warrand under the Seal of both Kingdoms; but the Laird of <hi>Haining</hi> having Charged <hi>Elliot</hi> for payment of a sum, for not presenting of a Thief to the Commissioners of the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, conform to a Decreet of the Commissioners, finding that he had Forefaulted the Bond, there was a Bill given in to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, craving that this case might be remitted to the Commissioners of the Borders, and not Suspended by the Session; because, <hi>First,</hi> These Decreets being pronounced by the <hi>English,</hi> as well as the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners; the Session could not be Judges to what was
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59223:173"/>
done, by vertue of an <hi>English</hi> Commission, and because they could not cite the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners; therefore they could not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their Sentences.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Commission of the Border is a Criminal Court, and the Lords of the Session are only Supream Judges in Civils.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Border is judg'd by a Law unknown to us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since the Lords of the Session behov'd to Consult them, though they were Judges, it but multiplies Processes and Expences, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lords to be Judges <hi>in prima instantia.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. If the Lords here review'd such Decreets, the Judges at <hi>Westminster</hi> would do the like, which would be very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and expensive to us: The Council upon this Debate recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Lords to remit the Tryal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in so far as it was Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal to the saids Commissioners.</p>

But by this Act it is declar'd, That Arch bishops and Bishops shall be by His Majesties Licence Elected by the Dean and Chapter of their own Cathedral-kirk, to which they are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, who being assembled by His Majesties Warrand, shall proceed to the Election of the Person named by His Majesty; and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection being Testified under their Seals and Subscriptions, he is to get a right to his Benefice under the Kings Great Seal, and to be Consecrated.</p>
               <p>It is fit to know that this Warrand for meeting, is call'd with us, <hi>a conge d'eslire,</hi> which is a <hi>French</hi> word, signifying <hi>a liberty to Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is fit to know likewise, that with the <hi>conge d'eslire,</hi> there comes a Letter from His Majesty, recommending such a Person, whom the Dean and Chapter are oblig'd to Elect, by the words of this Act; and being Elected, the Election is Recorded in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister of the Chapter: in which Register, all Deeds done by the Bishop, either for Entering Vassals, or granting Tacks of Teinds, are inserted. An Extract of this Election is returned to the Arch-bishop of the Province, and inserted in his Register; and by him Transmitted to the King, who thereupon grants a Patent to the Person so Elected, who after this is call'd Bishop Elect of such a See, which passes through all the Seals, and by which he has right both to Spirituality and Temporality; though this Act says, <hi>It shall only give right to the Spirituality</hi>; This being signifi'd to His Majesty by the said Arch-bishop; the King grants His Royal Mandat to a competent number of Bishops within the Province, (which cannot be under three, by the 3 <hi>Canon.</hi> 1 <hi>Concil. Nicen.</hi>) after which there is no new Gift to the Temporality, as this <hi>Act</hi> provides: only before his actual Possession, he makes his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage either to the King personally, or to one Commissionated to receive it; of which Oath and Homage, no mention is made in Ecclesiastick Story, till the fourth Counsel of <hi>Toledo, anno</hi> 633.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> The Mandat for Consecration, passes only the Great Seal, <hi>per saltum.</hi>.</p>
               <p>It is natural to all Benefices that they should be vacant before they be fill'd; and the Right should express <hi>a modus vacandi</hi>; and therefore His Majesty having sent down two <hi>Conge d'eslires</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1679. one in favours of the Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>Ross:</hi> and another in favours of the Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; It was advis'd that the <hi>Conge d'eslire,</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59223:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> should not be presented till <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was vacant, by his being Elected by the Chapter of <hi>Ross.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is observable likewise from this Act, that a Bishop has not right to the Temporalities, till after Consecration: For the Act sayes, <hi>That after the Consecration, His Majesty is to Dispone to the Person elected the Temporality</hi>; and the same being past under the Great Seal, the Bishop shall do Homage, and swear Obedience; neither shall it be lawful for him who is admitted to intromet with any of the Benefices, or Rents of the Bishoprick, until he have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the said Oath, and done the said Homage. And thus the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Lawyers, following, as I conceive, that notion of the Common Law, that <hi>Episcopus est maritus Ecclesiae</hi>: They say, that Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is as the Sollicitation; the Confirmation is the Contract; and the Consecration is the Consummation of the Marriage: but where a Bishop is Translated, there needs no Consecration, either by the Canon Law, or ours.</p>
               <p>The old Forms of Election was, that the King sent a Visitor to oversee the Election, and he return'd to the King the Decree of the Election, who Confirm'd it by giving investiture; and the Metrapolitan was oblig'd to Ordain the Person Elected, the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>BY this Act the Dean and Members of the Chapters of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral-kirks within this Kingdom, are restor'd to their Manses,<note place="margin">

               <p>The Chapter is to the Bishop, what Convents were to other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats; that is to say, their Council, of which the Dean, or <hi>Decanus</hi> was the Head, under the Bishop. By the Civil Law, <hi>decanus erat ille qui defunctorum lectos seu feretrum gestabant, vid. Tit. de Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, lib.</hi> 12. <hi>Cod. tit.</hi> 17.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> because the Dean proceeded over ten Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons or Prebends; and their <hi>decani</hi> especially in the Cathedral Churches succeeded in place of the <hi>Archipresbyter</hi>; and therefore these two are taken in the same sense, <hi>cap. ad haec</hi> 7. <hi>de off.

               <p>The Chapter is call'd <hi>Capitulum</hi> by the Canon Law; because it is the little, or inferiour Head of the Diocy, and is defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>Clericorum congregatio sub uno Decano in Ecclesia Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drali.</hi>

                  <hi>Nota,</hi> By that part of the <hi>Act</hi> it seems, that though <hi>regulariter,</hi> Superiours are not bound to receive singular Successours: yet Kirk-men being Superiours are.

               </p>
               <p>As to this Act it is observable; <hi>First,</hi> That Prescription is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly competent to such as have bruiked by vertue of Heretable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments;
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59223:178"/>
and therefore he who alleadges Prescription, must alleadge an Heretable Title; but though the Possessor be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly Infest; yet if he has possessed the subject, as part and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, it will be sufficient; and therefore a Salmond-fishing was found to be prescriv'd, though it was alleadg'd to be <hi>inter regalia,</hi> since the Prescriver was Infest <hi>cum piscationibus</hi> in general, <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> 7. 1672. But if the Prescriver be Infest upon a bounded Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it will not furnish him a valid Title for prescriving, as part and Pertinent, any Land that is without the bounding, <hi>November</hi> 14. 1671. This <hi>Act</hi> is also extended to Heretable Offices, as to Patronages, Pensions, and all Servitudes, though not expresly mention'd; and though Heretors and Wodsetters are enumerated, sometimes as different from one another, <hi>Act</hi> 6 <hi>Sess.</hi> 2 <hi>Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. yet Heretage in this Act comprehends Wodsets, and it is even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to long Tacks; so that it was found, that after fourty years they could not be quarrel'd, as granted without consent of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, <hi>July</hi> 7. 1677.</p>
               <p>This want of a Title likewise, and of <hi>bona fides,</hi> hinders a Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal to prescrive against his Superiour, since the <hi>reddendo</hi> of that same Charter, whereupon he founds his prescription, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges him still to know his Superiours Right; and by this Act for the same cause, a Wodset cannot prescrive, where the Reversion was incorporat, in the body of his own Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Since this <hi>Act</hi> appoints that His Majesties Lieges bruiking for 40. years, shall have Right by prescription; it may be doubted, whether prescription can run in favours of strangers, who have not been Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 2. That these fourty years are only to run from the date of their Infestments by this Act; and yet in warrandice, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to run from the date of the Distress: but from both it is clear, that the reason is, because till then, they who have such Rights, <hi>non valent agere</hi>; and therefore the exception allow'd by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law of <hi>non valens agere,</hi> is allowable in ours, though it be not expressed in this Act, as minority is, whereby it seems that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis.</hi> Likeas, it was found in the Earl of <hi>Lauderdail's</hi> case, against the Earl of <hi>Tweddel,</hi> that <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdail</hi> being Forefaulted by the Usurpers, prescription could not run against him during that Forefaulture; but where there is a Title, prescription may run, albeit the Defender was <hi>absens rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae causa,</hi> at the least, durst not come home in the Usurpers time, for alleadg'd Crimes committed against them, as was found in <hi>White-foords</hi> case, the 24 of <hi>July</hi> 1678. He having kill'd in <hi>Holland Dorislaus,</hi> one of the Kings Murderers, for the Lords thought that he might have Transferr'd his Title to another, and if this reason hold it seems that <hi>absens reipublicae causa</hi> in general, is not sustainable as Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is, since these who are absent may leave Procuratories to pursue their Rights.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:59223:178"/>It may be likewise debated, that such as are <hi>vi majore</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from coming to pursue, as being taken by Robbers, or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, should have the priviledge of <hi>non valentes agere,</hi> though no exception be made of them here, for though the chief design of the Act be, to establish Heretable Rights in the persons of singular Successors, who cannot know such accidents, and are secure if they find a fourty years progress: Yet prescription was at first introduced, for punishing the slouth of the Proprietars, amongst other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and therefore <hi>non valens agere,</hi> was allow'd by the Civil Law and ours.</p>
               <p>It may be also doubted, whether prescription should run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a furious, or mad Man, since they are minors in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Law, and so are to have Curators, and are less ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious oftimes than Minors are; but yet since they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest here, when the Law secur'd priviledg'd Minors, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd they were designedly omitted; and it were hard to know who are Furious, and Furiosity might continue eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ninety years; or a man might feign himself mad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Earl of <hi>Argile contra Menauchtan,</hi> and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Seasine is but <hi>assertio notarii</hi>; and therefore it was too lax a foundation for an Heretable Right; and one Seasine may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silier forg'd than moe Seasines can, and one Seasine being forg'd, may be laid up in the Charter-Chist, so that the true Proprietar could not, before the Registration of Seasines, know how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the same: and since this Act requir'd no Charter from Heirs, it was just that it should require more Seasines, to secure against Falshood: But since the Act appointing Seasines to be Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, the argument of easie Forging is much taken off; Because the <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament sayes, <hi>That it is necessary to produce a Charter, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by their Superiours and Authors:</hi> It may be doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Superiour is oblig'd to receive a Vassal, though fourty years in Possession, except he or his Predecessors can shew a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from him; and that because, not only does the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

But yet they found, that an Infest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Annualrent could not be taken away by Discharges grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Debitor, nor by Compensation of his Debts, in prejudice of a singular Successor, who had Right to the said Annualrent; and that because, <hi>First,</hi> The design of this Act appears by the Narrative, to be made for security of Buyers; and buyers could not be secured, if such latent wayes of extinction were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Infeftment of Annualrent is Constituted by a Seasine, which must be Registrated; and therefore it cannot be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but by a Renunciation, or some Paper which must be Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>

Though by this Act there be not express mention of Rights of Annualrents; yet they are comprehended under the word <hi>Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets</hi>; for an Infeftment of Annualrent is but in effect a Wodset of the Rents; and though this Act is only urg'd against such as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalȝie their Lands; and that it was urg'd, that an Infeftment of Annualrent was not an alienation of Lands, but rather a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude upon them; yet this is a mistake, for an Infeftment of Annualrent is an alienation, else it could not infer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition, as without doubt it does.

               <p>Since this Act of Parliament requires that all Seasines, Renunciation; of Wodsets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be Registrated, I think the Booking of them is necessary: nor is it sufficient (as some pretend) that they are produ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this <hi>Act</hi> all grants of Redemption are to be Registrated, for securing singular Successors; but seing the using an Order of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, with a Declarator thereupon, will evacuat the Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, even as to a singular Successor; and yet he cannot know whether there be such an Order used, and Declarator obtain'd, it not being requisite that either of these should be Registrated; it seems that singular Successors are yet unsecure: As also, since if a person obtain a Decreet against him to whom he sold his Land, decerning him to grant him a Reversion, conform to his promise, this will be valid against a singular Successor (though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was not) and yet the singular Successor cannot know this Decreet, nor needs it be Registrated; and therefore this Register seems yet no sufficient, and adequat Remedy in Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets.</p>

And that Seasins of Lands in <hi>Leith</hi> need not be Registrated, though it be no Burgh Royal, <hi>July</hi> 10. 1623. The reason of which Exception was founded upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness of Town Clerks, and the constant Custom thereof, Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how soon the Seasin is granted; and so far are Seasins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Burgh exeem'd from such Solemnities, that the Lords sustain'd a Seasin within Town, being subscribed by the Town Clerk, though there was no Vestige of it in the Towns Register, nor the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars Protocal, and was Latent for many years, <hi>June</hi> 30. 1668. and thus singular Successors were not sufficiently secur'd by this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute within Burghs, for though Town Clerks use to Registrat, yet there being no necessity upon them to Registrat, and the Seasin not being annulled for not Registration; it follows clearly that there is no security; and therefore by the 11 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 3 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 6.</note>IN this <hi>Act</hi> it is warranted, that such as Compris'd great Estates for small sums, did notwithstanding, possess the whole Rents for payment of their small Annualrent; and therefore to Correct this, it is ordain'd by this <hi>Act,</hi> that the Comprizer shall impute in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his principal sum, the superplus of the Rents of the Lands intrometted with by him, and the true reason of the former Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom was, because by the 37 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 5. <hi>Ja.</hi> 3. The Lands Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized were to be adjusted by the Sheriff, with the sums Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized for, and so the Rent was at first but answerable to the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59223:183"/>
Annualrent, though thereafter all being Comprised, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priser appropriated all the Rents, without imputing, as said is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 2. That this <hi>Act</hi> makes only the Compriser lyable for his actual intromission; and it has been found that the Compriser is not bound to intromet: But yet this is so severe to the poor Debitor, and the other Comprisers, all whom the first Compris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may debar, and so suffer the Tennents to Bankrupt, and the Lands to become waste; that therefore if a Compriser once intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, he is bound to continue his intromission; and where there are Tacks standing, he is bound to do Diligence, <hi>February</hi> 9. 1639. or where there are moe Comprisers, the Lords may force the first Compriser to do Diligence, or if he do not betwixt and such a time yearly, they may allow access for the second to enter to the Possession, <hi>February</hi> 11. 1636. <hi>July</hi> 1662. Or if the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priser exclude any Diligence that the second is using, he will <hi>eo ipso</hi> be lyable thereafter to do exact Diligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 3. By this Act it is Declar'd, that upon payment of the principal Sum and Annualrent, and the Expence bestow'd by the Compriser, in passing and obtaining Infestment together with the Annualrent of the said sums, and the necessary Expences bestow'd in leading the Comprising, that then the Comprising shall expire <hi>ipso facto</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is to say, by way of exception, without Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, though ordinarly an order of Redemption be us'd; and not only does payment, or intromission with the Mails extinguish the Comprising, and prove against singular Successors, but even any acknowledgement of payment by the Leader of the Comprising will extinguish the Comprising against those singular Successors, <hi>July</hi> 23 1662.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 4. That the Comprizer is to get allowance of a years Duty, as due to the Superiour by this <hi>Act,</hi> and though he get himself entered for less by the Superiour than the years Duty, yet he will get allowance of the full years Duty that was due to the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whose gratuity will be of no advantage to the Debitor, <hi>July</hi> 2. 1625.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 5. That by this Act, what is pay'd to the Superiour bears <hi>Annualrent,</hi> as do the necessary Expences; but it may be doubted, if Annualrent be due for Sheriff-fees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 6. That Comprisings are not to run against Minors, but that it is lawful for the Minor at any time within the age of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five years to Redeem, which priviledge was found not only to be due to Minors when the Comprising is led against themselves; but even when a Minor has right to the legal Reversion, he being himself a second Compriser; for even in that case, a Minor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving led a Comprising may be prejudged as well as the Minor against whom the Comprising is led, there being the same parity of reason in both; and though this be not clear by the first words of the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59223:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Exception: Yet it is clear by these words, <hi>And that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the preceeding Laws and Practiques of this Kingdom, by the which, the Legal Reversion of the Comprised Lands expired within seven years after the leading of the Comprising, from the which His Majestie and Estates hath by this present Act and Statute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Minors in all time coming, declaring the same no wayes to run against them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 7. That because this Act appointed only the superplus of the Mails and Duties, which exceeded the annualrent to be imputed in the payment of the principal sum, during the seven years of the Legal, but did not expresly extend this to the case of Minority; Therefore it was found that Minors not Redeeming within the seven years, the Compriser had from the expiring of the seven years, the whole Rent of the Land for payment of his Annualrent, without imputing the superplus in payment of the principal sum, because the Act Corrected only that Custom, <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad</hi> the Legal, <hi>&amp; leges correcti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

This Decision was Corrected, and it was by that Act ordain'd, that Comprisers should impute the superplus of the Rent, beyond the Annualrent, for payment of the Principal sum, not only during the Legal, but during the whole course of the Minority.</p>

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 7.</note> And from this it would seem to follow <hi>argumento hujus legis,</hi> that whatsoever is competent in Adjudications, is not Competent in Comprisings, for else this Act had been needless; and the Lords would not extend the priviledges of the one to the other in many other cases, and so would not allow the Superiour to get a years Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, because the immediat preceeding Act did allow Comprisd Lands to be Redeemable upon the payment of the sums Compris'd for, and a years Rent for their Entry: But in this Act of Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, there is no mention of a years Duty, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was thought to be of purpose omited, and so needed a new Law, notwithstanding of the parity of Reason, whereupon a new Law was made, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> 18 <hi>Par.</hi> 2 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. Whereby not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Superiour is ordain'd to have a years Duty; but its expresly Declar'd, <hi>That in all Cases relating to Superiours, Adjudications shall be in the same condition with Comprisings,</hi> and consequentially to this last Act, it was found that the Superiour might at his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either Enter the Adjudger, or pay the Sums for which the Adjudication was led, since the Act of <hi>Par.

               </p>
               <p>There are in every Chapter, and Bishoprick with us some of those Dignities, but of a different Rank and Jurisdiction, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from those in the Canon Law, but the Dignities in our own Bishopricks differ from one another, though all of them agree in this, that those Dignities which were appointed at the foundation of the Bishopricks continue to this day, and the foundations are the Rule, and are very different.</p>
               <p>The ordinary Dignities common to all, are the Dean, the Arch-dean, the Chanter, the Chancellour, and the Thesaurer.</p>
               <p>The Office of the Dean has been fully Explain'd in the <hi>Act</hi> 2 <hi>Par.</hi> 22 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>The Arch-deacon (call'd improperly by us <hi>Arch-dean</hi>) is the <hi>Archidiaconus</hi> of the Canon Law, who though they be inferiour to Deans, yet they are in effect the Bishops Vicar, and have the Chief Jurisdiction next to him; being in the Canon Law <hi>oculus Episcopi,</hi> their Office in that Law was to examine such as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Bishop, and to put them in possession of their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice after their admission; as also, to visit the Diocy every three year, if the Bishop be not present, and to oversee the Manners and Living of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>The Chanter is in the Canon Law called <hi>Primicerius,</hi> because he is first of the Order of the Singers; and by the Greek Church <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>In <hi>England</hi> the Chancellor is in effect a Church-Lawyer, who judges for the Bishop through the whole Diocy, and is universal Commissary; whereas these only are called Commissars by that Law to whom the judging in particular Places or Cases is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But with us the Chancellor is still a Church-man, and the Province of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> has its Chancellor as well as the special

               </p>
               <p>The Thesaurer is he who did oversee the Thesaury, and all things else belonging to the Church, who in the forecited <hi>cap. cum olim,</hi> is accounted to have Ecclesiastick Dignity.</p>
               <p>It is observ'd by <hi>Bengeus, de beneficiis Ecclesiasticis, Renat.

Wherein he appointed, that the rate of all Tiends should be the fifth part of the constant Rent of what each Land pay'd in Stock and Tiend, where the same are valu'd joyntly, and where they are valu'd a-part, the rate is according as the same were valu'd by the particular Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for Valuation of Teinds, with deduction of a fifth part, call'd, <hi>the Kings Ease</hi>; and that all Teinds should be bought at nine years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, where they consisted in Money; and if they consisted in Victual, that they be first liquidat into Money, and then they should be bought at nine years purchase: And if there were but Temporary Rights, then the price is to be abated; or hight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

proportionally; and the said Teinds being so bought, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are to relieve the Titulars of His Majesties Annuity, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Stipends <hi>pro rata,</hi> and in case of wrong done by the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, there is place for appeals left to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Submission made by the Bishops, did only relate to Teinds, payable to them, whereof they were not presently in Possession; and therefore where any Church-men were presently in Possession of any Tiends, His <hi>Majesty</hi> by His Decreet Arbitral, did not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain them to sell the same; but they are ordain'd to sell such Tiends as belong to them, that were not in their present Possession, which they were ordain'd to sell at nine years purchase, with deduction always of His Majesties Annuity, forth of the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The determination upon the Submission of the Burrows, differs nothing from the former two; but that the saids Burrows are to pay the Annuity forth of the superplus of their Tiends, if they should be found to exceed what is due for intertainment of their Ministers, Colledges, Schools, and Hospitals, and the Terms of payment, of what is to be pay'd for these Tiends, is declar'd in all the three Decreets Arbitral, to be betwixt <hi>Yule</hi> and <hi>Candlemass</hi>; such likewise as had Church-lands and Tiends, Erected in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, in Temporal Lordships, did grant Commission to surrender their Rights in His Majesties Hand, upon the condition therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd; and therefore by this <hi>Act,</hi> the Commission granted by His Majesty for providing the Ministers serving the Cure with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Stipends, is here Ratifi'd, and it is declar'd, <hi>That the lowest Stipend shall be eight Chalders of Victual, or proportionally in Silver, except such particular Kirks occur, wherein there shall be good reason to go beneath the same</hi>; But it seems that by this Act, they can only go beneath the said <hi>quota,</hi> where there have already Valuations been led; the reason whereof seems to be, because till a Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be led, it cannot be known whether there be more free Tiends in the Paroch, then will amount to eight Chalders Victual: As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, because this High <hi>quota</hi> was granted to the Minister, in respect of the power granted to the Heretors, to value their own Tiends; therefore, where the Heretors had not taken the benefite of the Valuation, the Minister ought not to have the high Stipend: But yet the Commission for Plantation of Kirks, do use to modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie less Stipends, where it is notour, that the Paroch is not able to bear the same; and that albeit that <hi>quota</hi> was condescended on in the Commission of Surrenders, and is renew'd in the 19 <hi>Act</hi> of this Parliament.</p>
               <p>By this Act it is likewise declar'd, that <hi>where Valuations are lawfuly led against all persons having interest, that the samin shall not be drawn in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion upon the pretence of enorme laesion, at the instance of the Incumbent, not being Titular, or His Majesties Advocat, except in the case of Collusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which is declar'd to be <hi>presumptione juris &amp; de jure,</hi> where the

               <p>The Earl of <hi>Southesk</hi> having Right to the Muire of <hi>Montromant,</hi> as Heretable Forrester, intented a Declarator against the adjacent Heretors, concluding that they should be debar'd from Pasturing therein. Against which it being alleadg'd, 1. That they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriv'd the right of Pasturage. It was Reply'd, that the Prescription was interrupted by this Act. To which it being Duply'd, that this edictal Interruption was introduc'd without a Warrant, the Act 1617. having allow'd thirteen years for the Subjects to interrupt, without any Reservation in favours of the King. 2. This is neither His Majesties annext Property, nor is it a part of that un-annext Property, whereof the Ferms, or Feu-duties have been counted for in Exchequer, since the year 1455. and so the interruption which is restricted to these, reaches not to this case. 3. This Pasturage is but a Servitude, and this Interruption ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends only to Alienations, but not to Servitudes, or things of so small moment. To which it was Triply'd, that as to the first, there was no necessity that there should have been a Reservation in favours of the King, by the Act 1617. since the King not being mention'd in the Act, which was the Rule; There was no necessity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve His Right by way of exception; but this Act of Parliament has supply'd that want, though there had been an omission in that Act. To the second, it was Triply'd, That the interruption 1633. being to secure His Majesty against Prescriptions, upon the <hi>Act</hi> 1617. It was just that it should extend as far as the <hi>Act</hi> 1617. And these words, <hi>Whereof the Ferms have been Compted for in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> are only Demonstrative, and not Taxative; the compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Exchequer being only a publick Evidence of His Majesties Right; and therefore, where there were other publick Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of His Majesties Right, as strong as this His Majesties interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59223:192"/>
by this <hi>Act,</hi> behov'd to take place, else it should not extend to secure His Majesty, as to any thing, for which there were blench, or Ward-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; This <hi>Act</hi> mentioning only Feu-ferms; it should not extend to His Majesties Castles, or other things, for which he gets no advantage. 3. This has been compted for, in so far as the Sheriff compts for the Blench-duties; and <hi>Southesk</hi> payes Blench-duties for his Forrest. 4. By an Act of Parliament in King <hi>Davids</hi> time, 1357. and another 1367. All the Kings Forrestries are ordain'd not to be Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon'd without consent of Parliament, and so are to be lookt upon as a part of the annext Property. To the third it was Duply'd, That this <hi>Act,</hi> as the <hi>Act</hi> 1617. was to be extended to Prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and there were things of less consequence than Servitudes secur'd against by this Act, such as change of holdings, Patronages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This case is not decided.</p>
               <p>The reason why this <hi>Act</hi> restricts it self in this Clause to the year 1455. is, because in that year was the first Act for annexing any Property to the Crown, <hi>viz.</hi> The 41 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 11 <hi>Ja.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>It being alleadg'd upon this Act, that the King behov'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Letters of Publication at the several Mercat Crosses, and the Executions thereof, else His Majesty could not have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the Interruption. It was answered, That the Act of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt of the Session, did indeed appoint Letters of Publication; but two years after that Act, this Act of Parliament was made, allowing the King this Interruption, wherein the Parliament did certainly consider the Publication, as having preceeded, <hi>&amp; statuit lex hoc casu super praesumpto,</hi> and so the Letters of Publication and Extentions, need not now be produc'd; Which Answer the Lords found Relevant, <hi>November</hi> 1682. Sir <hi>William Ker contra Grubet</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Interruption being thus made by the King, does last for fourty years, so that no Prescription can run against the King, till four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after the date of this Act; and that though the Executions and publication required by this Act of Parliament, cannot be found, for every particular Shire: It may be likewise doubted, whether Prescription should run against the King, whilst he was out of the Countrey: For which, <hi>vid. observ.</hi> on the <hi>Act</hi> of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription 1617.</p>

but I confess, I understand not what is mean'd by the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art of a Regality; for Stewartries and Regalities are distinct and inconsistent Jurisdictions; a Stewart being a Judge in the Kings Property only, having the same power that a Lord of Regality has of the Lands Erected in the Regality holding of himself, and the Lands holding of him: But this Act has in this follow'd the words of the Act of Annexation 1587.</p>

The Lords found, that the Lords and Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Erection, had Right to the Casualities of these Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ay and till they be Redeem'd; but by the 30 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>It is declared, That the Feuars shall be bound to make payment of their Feu-ferms and Duties contained in their Infestments, to the Lords of Erection, ay and till they be Redeemed</hi>; but it is not clear whether Escheat and Non-entry will belong to the King, or Feuars, except it be comprehended under the general word <hi>Duties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though the Feu-mails and Feu-ferms be reserv'd to such Lords and Titulars of Erection, as subscriv'd the Surrender, so that it may seem necessary to prove that these who seek Feu-duties, did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrive, or else that these should belong to the King: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Surrender cannot be found, the Lords found it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that the Titular acknowledg'd the Kings Right, conform to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59223:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Act: But they found that they had not Right to the Arrages and Carrages of these Kirk-lands, because by this Act, all the Rents and Duties are Declar'd to belong to the King, and the Reservation in favours of the Superiour, is only of Feu-duties, if they found no abatement of the Feu-duty, in respect of Vastations, since the Feu-duties were small, and the Feuar might have gain'd by prior and subsequent years, <hi>June</hi> 27. 1662. <hi>Watson contra Elleis.</hi> Because the Superiorities of these Kirk-lands, is by Act declar'd to belong to the King; therefore the Lords of Erection cannot pursue a Reduction of these Feus; nor is the concourse of His Majesties Advocat sufficient, except there be an express Warrand under the Kings Hand for that effect.</p>
               <p>Albeit it be uncontroverted by this <hi>Act,</hi> that the King has no right to the Feu-mails, and Feu-ferms, due by the Vassals of Erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, until he redeem the same, as said is; yet it may be doubted, whether the King has Right to the Feu-mails, and Feu-ferms of the Lands, which pertain'd in property to the Lords of Erection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said Surrender, and which were mentioned in the old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festments, before the date of the Erection, and that without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the saids Feu-ferms, and redeeming them as said is, as he is oblig'd to do in the case of the Feu-ferms, due by the Vassals of Erection: and it may be urg'd for the Lords of Erection, that the King has not right to the Feu-ferms of their proper Lands, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he Redeem them; And that because, 1. The Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is relative to the Submission made by the Lords of Erection, whereupon the Act proceeds; but so it is, that by the Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they resign the Superiorities, reserving only to themselves the Feu-duties, till they receive satisfaction; but it is expresly provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that under this Resignation, their proper Lands should not be comprehended, but that they should hold the same of His Majesty, as the same was holden before the date of the Erection; and so the meaning is, that though they should hold the same in Feu, yet they should not be oblig'd to pay the Feu-duties, till they receive satisfaction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It were absurd that the Lords of Erection should not quite the Feu-duties of their Vassals, till they receiv'd satisfaction; and yet they should be oblig'd to quite the Feu-duties of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, in which they had far more interest, than in the Lands of their Vassals, without any satisfaction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Custom is the best Interpreter of Law, and by the general Custom of the Nation, the Lords of Erection have never counted for the Feu-duties of their proper Lands.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There being a Reservation made in the first part of the <hi>Act,</hi> of the Feu-duties only in case of payment; The Reservation in the second part of the <hi>Act,</hi> must in Annalogie of Law be construct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be burden'd with the same quality, except the contrary were expresly declar'd in the <hi>Act.</hi> but on the other side it may be more
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59223:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
strongly urg'd for the King, that he has Right to the Feu-ferms of these their proper Lands immediatly, without any satisfaction, and that for these reasons; 1. Because by the Act of Parliament, they are expresly to hold their proper Lands of the King, and to pay him the Feu-duties mentioned in the old Infestments, without any Clause obliging the King to make satisfaction; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The King is not oblig'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Parliament having had that Reservation, of making satisfaction under their view, in the case of the Vassals, they had certainly renew'd it in the immediat subsequent case of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if they had not expresly design'd the contrary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the Charters granted under the Great Seal, to the saids Lords of Erection, since the Surrender, and this <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, they are expresly by different <hi>reddendo's</hi> made lyable, both to the general blench Duty, due for the whole Lands of the Erection, both Property and Superiority, and for the Feu-dutie of their own proper Lands: <hi>Ergo,</hi> This Feu-duty of their proper Lands, is due by their Charter, which is a Feudal Contract, and that without any Reservation of payment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The blench-duty of the Erection, and this Feu-duty is due upon different accounts: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The payment of the Blench-duty is not sufficient; for the Blench-duty is due by the Lords of Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for the interest that they have in the Vassals Lands, and for the Tiends, and for the property that was Feu'd the time of the Erection: Whereas this Feu-duty is due only for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lands Feu'd out before the Erection.</p>
               <p>And to the contrary Objections it may be answered, That <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament are not to be extended <hi>de casu in casum,</hi> especially in such favourable Cases as this, which tends most ungrately to take from the King a part of that which himself gave freely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was very good Reason why they should be lyable to pay the Feu-duties of their proper Lands, without any satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; because the King having rais'd a Reduction of all the saids Erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; The Lords of Erection did Redeem themselves from the hazard of this Plea, by this surrender; and the reason why the quality of satisfaction was adjected, as to the Vassals, and not as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, was, because the Lords of Erection had no interest in their Vassals Lands, but the Feu-duties; and so it was fit they should get a satisfaction for these; though the satisfaction was made easie for the King: But as to their proper Lands, it was just, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the great advantage they had by them; and that they were by this <hi>Act</hi> secur'd in the property of them. It was just that the King should get the Feu-duties without any acknowledgement; and without this the King had got nothing for securing them, when he might have with Success quarrell'd their Rights; And the pretence of the Vassals, not having pay'd these Feu-duties, for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59223:194"/>
Lands formerly, is of no import, since the negligence of the Kings Officers cannot prejudge him; and the Times were Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, since the year 1633. Nor is this true, though it were Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; for the Earls of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> and others have pay'd.</p>
               <p>Because these Arguments and Difficulties gave some Colour to the Lords of Erection, to think that they were not lyable, therefore they us'd to get ease as to bygones; but they are made lyable still for the future, in the payment of these Feu-duties.</p>
               <p>The Superiorities belonging to Bishops and their Chapters, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd to secure them against the Annexation, 1597. and their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorities, are likewise reserv'd from the Annexation mention'd in the tenth Act of this Parliament.</p>
               <p>Some think it fit for His Majesties Interest, that these Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties should be Redeem'd; for he might thereby have a great and sure Revenue, and a great dependence of Vassals; and it seems also fit for the interest of the poor Vassals.</p>

               <p>This Annuity was found to be made <hi>debitum fundi</hi> by this <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, and so to oblige all singular Successors; because the <hi>Act</hi> says generally, that the King shall have Right to all the Annuity bypast, and to come, though it be not expresly declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that singular Successors shall be obliged, as our Law ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly uses to do, when it resolves to make any thing <hi>debitum fundi.</hi>

And conform to this, the Lords of the Commission decided, <hi>February</hi> 1679. <hi>Hamilton contra</hi> Earl of <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>; though it was there alleadg'd, that this would prejudge Church-men, since it would discourage Laicks to take Tacks from them at due Rates: but Teinds holden of Collegiat Kirks, are subject to buying and selling, as other Teinds, the 3. of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> 1632.</p>
               <p>Though it would appear by this <hi>Act,</hi> that every man shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have the Leading, and Drawing of his own Teind, after the same is valu'd, since the <hi>Act</hi> sayes, <hi>the same being first truly and lawfully valued:</hi> Yet if the Heretor intent a Pursuit for Valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he will, during the Dependence, get liberty to lead his own Teinds, if he offer Caution to pay his Teinds, conform to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation that shall be led, <hi>July</hi> 14. 1630.</p>
               <p>But this benefit of leading is only granted to Heretors, by the the foresaid <hi>Act</hi>; and therefore no Liferent Tacks-man hath this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, except the Liferent be Constitute, by Infestment of Conjunct-fee, or the like, <hi>November</hi> 30. 1631.</p>

It is only granted likewise to such He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retors, whose Teinds were drawn before, but not to these who pay'd Rental-bolls, <hi>July</hi> 24. 1635. And yet the contrary is found the 3. of <hi>July</hi> 1643, But the Heretor may have the leading of his own Teinds, though he does not instruct a publick Infeftment, if he shew that he is not <hi>in mora,</hi> to be Infest, and that he is the person who should be Infest, <hi>July</hi> 6. 1642. But the Teinds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Church-men, whereof they were in possession the time of the Submission, are not to be led upon Caution; and yet by a Missive the 9. of <hi>May</hi> 1634. His Majesty declares His Favour not to be extended to their Tacks-men, being Laicks; but that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these Tacks, the Heretor may lead, he finding Caution, as said is.</p>
               <p>By the Submission, the Decreets following thereupon, and the express words of this <hi>Act, Ministers are to be provided before the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retors have liberty to buy, or value</hi>; and therefore the Titular may allocat what Teinds he pleases, towards the Maintainance of the Minister; and the Heretor <hi>eo casu</hi> cannot force the Titular to sell, <hi>February</hi> 17. 1645. But though the Kirk be not provided, yet the Heretor may buy his Teinds, if he be content to undergo his part of the augmentation when it shall be granted, the 20. of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 1645. Earl of <hi>Hadington contra</hi> the Laird of <hi>Bairfuird.</hi> So that it appears, that albeit a Titular may assign any one mans whole Teinds towards the Ministers Maintainance, when there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent provision; yet if there be any, though it be small, he may not; but the same should burthen proportionally, the whole free Teinds of the Paroch, where there is a present provision, and where the Teinds are once bought, the Heretor will not be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, as long as there is any Tack-duties free in the Titulars hands, <hi>February</hi> 15. 1643. But the Tacks-man will not be found lyable in the said Relief, <hi>January</hi> 27. 1635. But if there be no free Teinds in his hand, then the Buyers, and all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retors must be burdened with the augmentation, <hi>January</hi> 16. 1635.</p>
               <p>It seems that the Titular cannot assign the Teinds of one Paroch for paying the Stipend of another; For by this <hi>Act</hi> it is said, <hi>That the Teinds shall be burdened with the Stipend of the Minister serving the Cure of the Kirk</hi>: But the Commission allocats sometimes the Teinds of one Paroch, to make up a Stipend to the adjacent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roch, if the Minister of the Paroch, out of which the free Teinds are allocated, be competently provided; for the Commission thinks the Teinds, as the Spirituality of the Church, to be burdenable in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; and yet if this argument prove any thing, it will prove there can be no free Teinds as long as there is any Minister in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> unprovided competently.</p>

               <p>The Commissioners did of old, appoint Sub-commissioners in every Presbytry, who were to be chosen by the Presbytry it self, and five to be a <hi>quorum,</hi> for trying the Valuation of every mans Teinds, and before them Process were intented at the instance of the Procurator-fiscal, or the Heretors; and their Reports being return'd to the Commission, were allow'd. The Injunctions given to them, then were, That none should be Witnesses before them who were not worth an hundred Pounds of free Gear; that such as dwell within the Presbytry should be Cited upon ten days; and such as were without it, upon twenty; that the Depositions should be Subscriv'd by the most part of the Sub-commissioners, and the Clerk; and when any man would make use of anothers Servant, as a Witness, that the Master should produce him upon his hazard; that where both used Probation, not the greatest number, but the clearest Deponers should be prefer'd; and no Witnesses to be receiv'd but only ten for each Party, which was thereafter Expon'd to be ten for each Room, <hi>July</hi> 18. 1634.</p>
               <p>The Probation is oft-times allow'd to both Parties in this Court, and where it is single, it is call'd <hi>The Prerogative of Probation,</hi> and is much contended for; Wherefore it is thus regulated, <hi>viz.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Teinds are drawn <hi>ipsa corpora,</hi> by Titular, or Tacks-man, and then they have the sole Probation allow'd them, to prove what the Teinds were worth, they proving that they led seven years of fifteen before the year 1628. And though after so long a time, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proven; Yet the proving immemorial Possession is found equivalent; or else they have Rental-bolls pay'd them, <hi>&amp; eo casu</hi> they have the sole probation likewise, they proving twenty years possession, of uplifting Rental-bolls, condescending upon the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and quality: Or in the third case, the Heretor has Tacks of their own Teinds, for payment of Silver-Duty: and then there is joynt Probation allow'd, both to Heretor and Titular; albeit the Heretor have the benefit of a Conjunct Probation; Yet he may refer the worth to the Titulars Oath, before Witnesses be receiv'd, but not after, <hi>February</hi> 21. 1623. but where the Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

has the sole Probation, the Heretor cannot <hi>eo casu</hi> lead any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Stock, except it be for certification, <hi>id est,</hi> except where the Heretor summons the Titular, who was in possession of Drawing of the Teind, to prove the worth thereof, with Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to him, if he appear not, the Heretor will prove the worth of the Stock, <hi>quo casu</hi> the fourth part is Declar'd to be Teind, <hi>February</hi> 19. 1634. and <hi>February</hi> 24. 1643. Where the Stock and Teind are valu'd joyntly, the Teinds are made the fifth part; but where the Titular and Tacks-man has the sole Probation, the Heretor has the fifth part down, as <hi>the Kings Ease</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the Titular takes a Dyet for proving of the Teind by it self, the Heretor may take the same Dyet to prove the Stock, that in case the Heretor fail, he may have <hi>the Kings Ease, July</hi> 8 1642. Where there is joynt probation of Stock and Teind, the present Rent should be proven, as well as the Rent in all time coming, else the same is null, <hi>January</hi> 19. 1631.</p>
               <p>There are two Dyets granted for probation in this Court; and if the first be not made use of, the Term may be circumduc'd, and the second will not be granted, <hi>February</hi> 2. 1643. and though Diligence be Extracted after the Dyet; yet if it be Extracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other party crave the Term to be circumduc'd, the same will be sustain'd, <hi>November</hi> 22. 1634.</p>
               <p>By this Act also it is Declar'd, That where Valuations are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully led against all Parties having interest, and allow'd, they shall not be call'd in question at the Instance of the Minister, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Titular; nor at the instance of His Majesties Advocat, for His Annuity, except the Collusion be proven, to have been to the Diminution of the third of the just Rent presently pay'd; and therefore all Reductions upon this head, are at the instance of His Majesties Advocat; but it may be doubted, whether His Majesty has any interest, where the party has bought his own Annuity; though it may be alleadg'd, that even in that case, the Decreet is Reduceable, together with the Alienation founded thereupon, if subsequent to the Decreet, because the Exchequer has sold upon a mistake, occasioned by the Collusion, albeit <hi>regulariter</hi> with us, Venditions are not quarrellable, as in the Civil Law, though made <hi>infra dimidium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Clause it is likewise Declar'd, that this Collusion shall be probable by the parties Oaths, and thereupon it has been doubted, whether this Clause be Exclusive of other probation, and in <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drums</hi> case against <hi>Tolquhon,</hi> before the Commission in <hi>January</hi> 1672. It was found, that a Decreet of Valuation might be Reduced upon this Clause, if it were proven by Witnesses that the valuation was led far within the third of what the Teinds were then worth.</p>

               <p>By this <hi>Act</hi> several privat Rights and Ratifications, are except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this <hi>Act salvo</hi>; But since the <hi>Act salvo</hi> proceeds upon the principal of natural Reason and Justice, it seems that even these Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are questionable, for else the <hi>Act salvo</hi> should signifie nothing; For these who had the interest to obtain privat <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament, would likewise have the interest to get them excepted from the <hi>Act salvo</hi>; and upon this Reason it was doubted, and not Decided, whether Exceptions from the <hi>Act salvo,</hi> made in privat Rights, though not repeated in the <hi>Act salvo,</hi> were sufficient to secure these Rights against the <hi>Act salvo</hi>; for though it might be alleadg'd, that in these there is a speciality from this case, since the <hi>Act salvo</hi> being posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and simple, Annuls and Derogats from the former Reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet even there it may be alleadg'd, that it cannot derogat, since in the former special <hi>Act,</hi> the Parliament Declar'd their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Inclination, that it should not Derogat.</p>

                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1.

That the Chancellour is to preside, not only in the Parliament, but in all other publick Judicatures; and therefore though it was pretended by the Thesaurer, that notwithstanding of this Act, the Chancellour could not preside in Exchequer, though he was named in the Commission; Because the Exchequer was rather the Kings Chamberlains Court, than a publick Judicature, in which the Thesaurer was chiefly intrusted, because he was chiefly to be answerable; yet this pretence was groundless, since the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer is a Judicature which Hears, and Discusses Causes, relating to the Revenue, and is Declar'd a Judicature by the 18 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.

                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. That by this Act the <hi>King is Declar'd to have the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power of Raising Armies, and making Garrisons,</hi> the Subjects alwayes being free of the Provision, and Maintainance of these Forts and Armies; and therefore it was asserted, that free Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except in the Case of actual Rebellion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was unlawful, and that even then it behov'd to be warranted by a Parliament, or Convention, though it seems, that Rebellions may be so sudden, or Parliaments and Conventions so dangerous, that free Quarter may be warranted by the Kings own Authority in cases of necessity; and if any part of <hi>Scotland</hi> should rise in Rebellion, it is not imaginable that they will either give Quarter for Pay, or deserve to be pay'd; and so to refuse the King the Power of free Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, without Parliament, or Convention, in that case were to deny Him the Power of raising an Army, without which it cannot be maintain'd. But free Quarter is expresly Discharg'd by the 3 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 3 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.</p>

Some likewise think by this Clause, that though the King may force Towns, and adjacent Countreys, to carry Baggage and Ammunition of His Souldiers, the publick Good so requiring; yet He must pay them for it; since by this Act, the King is to pay for the Provisions, as well as Maintainance of the Army, and to take away Countrey-mens-horses without pay, is as great a Tax upon them, as Free-quarter: But yet our Kings have still been in use, by immemorial Possession, to exact such Carriage without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and so the only Doubt remains, Whether this Act Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vats the former Custom? And whether the Subjects, not seeking payment, being <hi>merae facultatis,</hi> prescrives against them, <hi>jus non petendi?</hi>

It has been controverted, Whether though by this Act the King may Dispose upon all Forts, Strengths, and Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, if He can thereby make any privat Mans House a Garison? that was not so Originally, it being pretended, that if this were allow'd, no man can be sure of his Dwelling-house, which is the chief part of his Property; but it cannot be deny'd, but that all Houses with Battlements, or <hi>turres pinnatae,</hi> as <hi>Craig</hi> observes, are <hi>inter regalia</hi>; and of old could not be Built, without the Kings special Licence: and as to these, the King may Garrison them; for since He has the absolute power of making Peace and War, it were absurd to deny Him the power of Garisoning convenient places, without which the War cannot be mannag'd.</p>

                     </gap> adher'd to the former Decision, though it seems very strange to the best Lawyers. The Lords likewise found upon the 28 of <hi>July,</hi> 1671. That this Power granted to them, was only in favours of the Debitor, from whom the Lands were Comprysed, and could not be extended in favours of posteriour Comprysers, who could not upon this Clause crave, that the first Compryser should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted to his Annualrent; for the priviledge is granted to the first Compryser in contemplation of his being oblig'd to Ratifie: Nor are the second Comprysers prejudged by the first Comprysers Possession, since it will extinguish his Comprysing <hi>pro tanto,</hi> and make way for them.</p>
                  <p>By this Act also, all Comprysings led since the first of <hi>January</hi> 1652. before the first effectual Compryser, or after, but within year and day of the same, shall come in <hi>pari passu,</hi> as if one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prysing had been led for all the Sums: Upon which Clause it is observable, 1.

That the first effectual Comprysing is interpreted to be a Decreet of Apprysing, whereupon Infeftment follows; and therefore if the second Comprysing be led within year and day, after Infeftment was taken upon the first, it will not come in <hi>pari passu</hi> with it, except it be within year and day of the Decreet of Apprysing, for the first Comprysing was expir'd, and so the next Creditor could Comprise nothing, so that his Comprising could not come in <hi>pari passu</hi>; Which was so decided. Albeit it was alleadg'd, that by this Act, <hi>all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prysings led within year and day, are</hi> fictione juris, <hi>to be repute as if one and

                  <p>Upon this Clause it was also Debated very subtilly, whether an Infeftment of Annualrent having interveen'd betwixt a prior Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prysing, and other posterior Apprysings, could be prefer'd to the posterior Apprysings; for all these Comprysings having been led within year and day; It was alleadg'd that by this Statute, they behoved to come in <hi>pari passu,</hi> as if one Comprysing had been led for all; and therefore since the first was preferable to the Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Annualrent, so should the rest, though posterior to it. But to this it being answered, that the meaning of the Act was, <hi>That Comprysings led within year and day, should come in</hi> pari passu, <hi>only in competition with one another</hi>; but that Infeftments of Annualrents, or other Rights could not be postpon'd to posterior Rights, for which Annualrents, if the Creditor had Compris'd, he had been prefer'd. The Lords brought them all in <hi>pari passu</hi>; the matter being dubious, and the doubt arising on the unclearness of a new Statute, <hi>February</hi> 6. 1673 <hi>Brown</hi> of <hi>Colstoun contra Nicolas</hi>; which shews what <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 2. Though this Clause runs only in favours of Apprysers, from which it may seem, that they are only allow'd to Redeem; Yet the Lords Decided <hi>January</hi> 9. 1677. <hi>Hay contra Gregory</hi>; That a Creditor having an Infeftment of Annualrent, might Redeem from a Compryser who excluded him; and it seems by that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, that any Creditor may have this Benefit as well as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisers, since they may Comprise: Nor are the strict words of the <hi>Act</hi> to be considered; for else Adjudgers could not Redeem, since they are not nam'd in the <hi>Act.</hi>

                  <p>It is fit to know that by our Law, Wodsets are either proper, or improper. A proper Wodset is, where Lands being impigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for a sum, the Rents of the Land are accepted in satisfaction of the Annualrents of the Money, and that without any Restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon either side: and as to these Wodsets, it is by this <hi>Act</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, that the Wodsetter shall be oblig'd upon offer of sufficient surety by the Lender, either to quite his Possession, or Restrict himself in his Possession to his Annualrent, counting for the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus: But this Act innovating the privat Paction of Parties, was found only to oblige the Wodsetter, to be countable from the Date of the Offer of Surety, and not from the Date of the Act of Parliament, <hi>February</hi> 21. 1666 Lord <hi>Borthwick contra</hi> his Wodsetters. But in this Computation the Wodsetter is to get Defalcation of what he hath depursed upon Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or hath lost by Quarterings, or any other manner of way. Improper Wodsets are these, whereby it is expresly Declar'd, <hi>That the Wodsetter shall not be lyable to any hazard of the Fruits, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, Wars, or Troubles</hi>; so that the Wodsetter is to have Re-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these, by and attour the Rents of the Lands, which are Declared to be Usurary in time coming, and the Wodsetter in all such Wodsets taken since the year 1649. is obliged to count for the superplus, more than pays his Annualrent, and to impute the same <hi>pro tanto,</hi> in payment of his principal Sum.</p>

                  <p>The denying His Majesties Supremacy, as it was then Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is declar'd punishable by in-capacity, and such other punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as is thereto due by Law; But it had been fitter to Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that punishment, and from the words as it is now Establisht; It may be doubted, whether the Impugning the Supremacy abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely be punishable by this Act, since the Supremacy is extended by a posterior Act, <hi>viz.</hi> The 1 <hi>Act</hi> 2 <hi>Par. Ch.</hi> 2. But that <hi>Act</hi> being only an Explication of this; all such as Impugn the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy absolutely, are punishable.</p>
                  <p>From these words also, <hi>That they shall be punishable by such other pains as are due by Law in such cases:</hi> It may be doubted, what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is due to such as Impugn the Kings Supremacy, besides

                  <p>It has been urg'd, <hi>That all speaking against the Kings Prerogative, is only punishable by incapacity and arbitrary punishments,</hi> because this Clause sayes, <hi>That if they Speak, Print,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>against the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in Causes Ecclesiastick, or to justifie any of the actings, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices abovementioned, they shall be so punished</hi>; But so it is, that all rising in Arms to Depose the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are above-mentioned, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> say they, <hi>The speaking, or Preaching in Defence of these, is only to be so punished</hi>; and they urge this from the Principles of Reason, and the practice of other Nations; and that excellent Law, <hi>si quis impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratori maledixerit; lib</hi> 9. <hi>tit.</hi> 7. <hi>C.</hi> but this were a most absur'd Gloss: For certainly, if this Objection prov'd any thing, it would prove, that no words could infer Treason, which is expresly contrary to the very Act, whereby all these Positions are Declar'd Treason, and consequently all words whatsoever, which express these Positions, are punishable as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>reason; and it is fit to know that it is not that very <hi>formula,</hi> or words, which are condemn'd, but these Positions are condemn'd, for else it were easie to make the Act elusory, and to evade it, by using other words, than the words here set down, and the Analysis of that part of the <hi>Act</hi> is, that first <hi>the Positions are Declar'd Treasonable.</hi> 2. <hi>The speaking against the Kings Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the Ecclesiastical Government, as now Establish'd, &amp;c.</hi> is forbidden. 3. <hi>The Plotting or Contriving any thing against the King, consequentially to these Positions, is Declar'd punishable by Forefaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 4. <hi>That the speaking,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>against the Supremacy, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish'd Government of the Church, is to be punish'd arbitrarly</hi>; and the words, <hi>Or to justifie any of the Deeds declar'd againstly this present Act,</hi> are to be restricted to words relative to the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mention'd in that Clause only.</p>
                  <p>It is also observable, That the Impugning the Government by Bishops, or the Kings Supremacy, are only punishable, if they be pursu'd within eight Moneths, and Sentenc'd within four Moneths thereafter, and are only punishable by this Act, if it was done by malicious, and advis'd Speaking; and therefore it appears, that such as were Drunk, when they spoke these words, are not punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by this <hi>Act</hi>; nor such as are reputed <hi>fatuus</hi> and Fools, though they be not declared Idiots, or Furious: and yet it seems that <hi>all Writing, Preaching, and Prayers, and such malicious Expressions, to stir up the people to a dislike of His Majesties Royal Prerogative and Supremacy in Causes Ecclesiastick,</hi> are punishable indefinitly, and that because either the Law presumes they are premeditated; or because of the great danger arising therefrom, and therefore it will have them punish'd as such; for the Act runs disjunctively, <hi>Writing, Preaching, Praying, or advis'd and malicious Speaking.</hi>

                  <p>It may be doubted from this Act, whether when any man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of Oppression, as that a Robber, or Neighbour sits violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down upon his Land? The Sheriff and Countrey are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to concur by this Act, since the Act seems to be restricted to the way of taking of Goods, though it speaks generally of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and I think they are lyable in the one case, as well as in the other; and this case being a permanent Act, is more easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd.</p>

                  <p>By this Act Ministers absenting themselves without a lawful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse from the Diocesian meeting, or not concurring in the Church-discipline, when required by the Arch-bishop, are to be Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded till the next Diocesian meeting, and if they conform not then, to be Depos'd; and though this be design'd chiefly against the Non-conforming Ministers; Yet it has been repin'd at by some of the Episcopal Clergy, because the Bishops have by it a power to Suspend by themselves; and by the present Discipline of the Church, the Bishop may Depose by himself, without the concourse of the Clergy, even in the Diocesian meetings, though he usually takes alongs with him the advice of the Ministry.</p>
                  <p>In this Act with-drawing from publick Worship, as well as keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Conventicles, is Declared to be Seditious; and therefore each Heretor with-drawing, loses the fourth part of his years Rent; each Yeoman, or Tennent may be fin'd, not exceeding a fourth of his free Moveables; every Burges is to lose his Freedom, and may be fin'd in a fourth part of his Moveables: and the Council have by this Act a very full and undetermin'd power, to inflict Corporal, beside the former punishments; But it seems that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> those Punishments can be inflicted upon With-drawers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where they have first been admonished by their Minister in presence of two Witnesses; But since the Minister of the Paroch is not here specifi'd, it was thought that persons might be fin'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Admonition, given by any Minister appointed by the Privy Council, or Presbytry.</p>
                  <p>This part of the Act is not expresly abrogated; but the Fines are altered by the 7 <hi>Act</hi> of the 2 <hi>Sess. Par.</hi> 2 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.

                  <p>By the other Act also it is appointed, <hi>That the same shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for three years, except His Majesty shall think fit it continue longer,</hi> and it was thought, that this power of Fining might be continued by the Council, without any new express Order from the King, since His Majesty did not Command the contrary: as also upon this Clause was founded the Indulgence 1679.

of this same Act, and which shews that this was designedly omited in this Clause; yet we see that the Council does call to the Host all betwixt sixty and sixteen, without express Warrand from the King, and that the Justices fine such as are absent upon these Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and which is very just, because the King is still presumed to be in the Council <hi>sictione juris,</hi> they Re-presenting by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission His Royal Person; and we see by many Instances, that Rebellions may rise before any such Warrand can come from the King.</p>

                  <p>It may be Debated, whether under the word <hi>Forraigners,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> may be comprehended, since we are not Treated by them as Forraigners in the point of Succession, it being frequently decided amongst them, that the <hi>Scots</hi> may succeed to Heretage in <hi>England,</hi> notwithstanding of their Statute, debarring <hi>alibi natos</hi>; and why

then should they be repute as Forraigners to us in the matter of Trade; and this were indeed solid Reason for both Nations; but since the <hi>English</hi> debar us from their Plantations, and look upon us as Forraigners in the point of Trade, it is just that we should give them the same measure.</p>

<pb n="427" facs="tcp:59223:218" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the 22000 were oblig'd to meet fourty dayes; though this last mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del was by some objected to be a standing Force: and all Laws are <hi>stricti juris,</hi> and to be fulfill'd <hi>in forma specisica</hi>; but especially Taxations, which are a Gratuity, founded upon the free Offer of the people, as this is, to allow Conversions in such Cases, would discourage the Subjects from future offers.</p>
                  <p>This Act likewise did Ratifie the Acts of Council, which appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Shires to provide at their own Charge, Colours, Standarts, Drums, and Trumpets, though that might seem an Imposition; but these being necessars, and the natural Consequents of the first Grant; and the Parliament having granted to the Council the former power, as said is, these Acts of Council are therefore hereby approven as Legal.</p>

For these can yet only be forefaulted before the Parliament, though they may be declared Rebels before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices: and it has been doubted, whether the hounding out to open Rebellions, or the Resetting those who were at them, be punishable by the Justices in absence; for Art and Part is by the 114 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 12 <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. <hi>To be punishable as the Crime,</hi> whereof it is an accession, and it really deserves oft-times a severe and speedier animadversion: and thus a Noble-man of great interest Plotting, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It has been doubted, whether such whose Forefaultures were Ratifi'd by this Act, could be thereafter admitted to propone an Exculpation, since the Justices could not Rescind Sentences of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? and whether such as are Forefaulted before the Justice-Court, can be admitted to propone any such Exculpation upon their being <hi>alibi</hi>?

                     </gap>fences can have the least shadow of Justice; nor is it sufficient to say, <hi>That they were either afraid, or out of the Countrey</hi>; for these are the ordinary Defences of such as are guilty, and any guilty person might go out of the Countrey pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to have this Defence.</p>
                  <p>The method now observ'd in Forefaultures in absence, before the Justice-Court, is, that the Advocat Raises a Libel of Treason with the former Certification, he sends a Herauld with a Display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Coat, to give the Citation, and sends Witnesses alongs, who at their Return, <hi>swear that they saw the Execution truly Executed</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that was found to be the Form before the Parliament. Then the Witnesses are adduc'd, after the Relevancy is cleared by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutors, who are Examined whether they knew the party who is to be Forefaulted, which excludes the Defence, that there were more of one Name, as the purging them of partial Council does all objections against the Witnesses, that can be thereafter found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, since it was their own fault, who compeared not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>The Advocat uses ordinarly to cause Cite the Pannals upon six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes, and at the Mercat Cross, and at their Dwelling-House, lest they be out of the Countrey; at all which places, Copies of the Libel, the Names of the Assizers, and Witnesses are left.</p>
                  <p>Though ordinarly the Advocat, for further Terror, causes Renverse, and Tear the Coat of the Persons Forefaulted, in the Justice-Court, with sound of Trumpet, after the Doom of Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falture, and Proclaim them Traitors over the Cross with sound of Trumpet; Because that Solemnity is observed in Forefaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before the Parliament; yet this is not thought absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>It is observable, That in the Process against the Earl of <hi>Mar</hi> and others, for taking away King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth from <hi>Stirling:</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Gowries</hi> Forefaulture, the Summons were before the King, Parliament, and His Justices, and the Doom is, <hi>the King with the advice of His Parliament, and His Justices:</hi> Some think the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices sit only in Parliament, as the Judges sit in <hi>England</hi>; But the Summons having been before them, insinuats that they were conjunct Judges, and not Assessors. The probation in that case is led before the Lords of Articles, and not before the Parliament; but in <hi>anno</hi> 1661. The probation was led in plain Parliament, and this is juster, because the Parliament is the Grand Inquest.</p>
                  <p>The last words in the Act, <hi>viz. If the said summons be found Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and proven by the Verdict of an Inquest,</hi> are wrong Pointed; For the summons cannot be found Relevant by the Verdict of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</p>

Resetting of Rebels imported Infamy, because it was Treason, <hi>&amp; nemo tenetur jurare in suam turpitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> 2. No Declaration without a Remission past the Great Seal, can secure a man in such Cases; yet both these Defences were Repelled by the Privy Council in the case, Kings Advocat <hi>contra</hi> Laird of <hi>Duntreath, June</hi> 30. 1681. For as to the first, It was answered, That some Crimes did defame <hi>omni jure,</hi> as <hi>Incest, Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. and in these a man could not be oblig'd to Depone against himself, because the Kings Declaration could not take away the <hi>Stigma</hi> impressed by the Laws of God and Nature: But in Crimes Introduc'd only by the Municipal Laws, in favours of the King and His Government, the Infamy may be taken away by the Declaration; and where the Kings Advocat Declares, he insists not in it as a Crime, but as an irregular Transgression; The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession does not Defame, because no Crime is acknowledged. To the Second, it was answered, That there needed no Remission, where the irregularity was not pursued by way of Crime: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions being only of Crimes, and there was nothing more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, than for His Majesties Advocat in all Courts, to restrict his pursuits to arbitrary punishments, as in the Cases of Mutilations, Hamsucken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The Master and Mistres of the House likewise where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle was kept, are lyable to relieve the Magistrats, upon which ground, an Act of Council was made, <hi>making the Heretor lyable for the Fines</hi>; against which it was objected, <hi>that the Parliament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This being a matter of Government, must be interpreted so, as to preserve the Government; and if Wives who were the half, and the more humorous half of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were allow'd to abstract, all the other Remedies would be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and they would debauch their Children, Tennents, and Servants, as well as influence their Husbands. 3.

It is also declared, that if the Heretor be Minor, and his Tutors neglect to buy his Teinds, the Minor shall have action for 2 years after his minority to compel the Titular to sell them; but the Act is ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, not mentioning Curators; but the giving power to buy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter minority, includes both; but it may be doubted whether this

did impower Noblemen and others to Regulat the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures; and these Regulations set down by them, are here Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd: But it was objected, that this could not have been done in Law, because by the Institution of the Colledge of Justice, and particularly by the 93 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 7 <hi>Ja.</hi> 5. The Session has power <hi>to make sick Acts, Statutes and Ordinances, as they shall think expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for ordering of Processes, and hasty expedition of Justice:</hi> And it was thought strange how Noblemen and Gentlemen, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not <hi>Forms of Process,</hi> could Regulat incident Diligences, and the ordinary Terms in Reductions and Improbation, which with many other things specified in these Regulations, were so much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Form, and were so little to be known by the strongest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the greatest Lawyers did oft-times understand less of them, than the ordinary Leaders of Processes.</p>
                  <p>The first thing in these Regulations is, the Roll in which all Causes are to be taken up, and are Ordain'd to be Discuss'd according to the Dates of the Returning of Processes; which Roll was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in use, though by the 12 Article it was here added, <hi>That if any Cause should be call'd by anticipation out of its due place, the Pursuers Advocat might refuse to insist, or the Defenders Advocat to answer</hi>; and upon this Article it was, that the Lord <hi>Almond</hi> appeal'd to the Parliament; because in the Action at <hi>Dumsermlings</hi> Instance against him, there having been a Debate in the <hi>Outter-house,</hi> Reported to the Lords, they had ordain'd the Cause to be summarly heard before themselves <hi>in praesentia</hi>; Whereas by the 5 Article, where the Lords upon intricacy, Ordains a Cause to be heard <hi>in praesentia</hi>; the Process should have been insert in the Roll of the <hi>Inner-house,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Date of that Deliverance; which Article being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted: It was alleadg'd that by this Article, <hi>Almonds</hi> Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators were not oblig'd to Debate. To which it was answered, that though where a Cause is Ordain'd to be Inroll'd, it must be heard according to that Date; yet that did not hinder the Lords to call in any Cause for clearing the Terms of a Debate in the <hi>Outter-house,</hi> Reported to them, before they give their Interlocutor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which, as needing no Inrolment, falls not under this Article<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this Course of Calling in Advocats summarly, for clearing some Points, is ordinarly us'd without Inrolling Causes in the <hi>Inner-house,</hi> Roll; but after a Cause is once Inrol'd in the <hi>Inner-house</hi> Roll, it must be heard according to its Date.</p>
                  <p>The Council sometimes likewise when they sustain themselves Judges Competent to Ryots, do, if any Defence be propon'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in point of Right, remit the matter of Right to the Lords
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:59223:228"/>
of Session; but ordain it to be discussed summarly, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this Enrolment, to the end, that when the matter of Right is Discuss'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they may know how to Judge the Ryot.</p>
                  <p>As to the 16 and 17 Articles, <hi>Vide</hi> Observations upon the 9 <hi>Act Sess.</hi> 3 <hi>Par.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>By the 22 Article, it is appointed, <hi>That the Advocat who Returns the Process shall give out all the Papers, whereupon he resolves to found his Defences</hi>; which was done to prevent the Pursuers being forc'd to take a time to see those Papers, upon which the Defence was founded; but this was found unpracticable, because the Defenders Advocats knew not what would be found Relevant, or not; and therefore the Defenders Advocat does now propone his Defence, and if it be found Relevant, he takes a Day to prove it as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
                  <p>The Difference betwixt <hi>Outter-house</hi> and <hi>Inner-house</hi> Advocats, which was appointed by the Regulations is omitted in this Act, which Confirms the Regulations without that distinction.</p>
                  <p>Before this Act in <hi>Incident Diligences,</hi> four Terms were allowed for producing the Writs, which were accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crav'd to be produc'd: The first was <hi>Letters, with Certifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if the Havers produc'd not, other Letters would be direct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, Charging them thereto</hi> simpliciter. 2. <hi>That Letters of Horning would be direct.</hi> The third was <hi>Horning.</hi> The fourth was <hi>Caption.</hi> But by this Act, the first Diligence is appointed to be <hi>Horning.</hi> The second <hi>Caption,</hi> which may seem too short; for it is hard that third Parties should, without any previous advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be Charged with Horning; for though no Escheat will fall on this Denunciation; yet the Rebel will upon this Denunciation be debarr'd, <hi>ab agendo,</hi> beside other inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p>As to the Regulations concerning the Justice-Court, it has been doubted, whether they extended to Justice-airs, or Circuit-Courts; and therefore it was doubted, whether a Citation given to a Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal who is in Prison, might be given upon fewer than fifteen dayes in a Justice-air, and the Judges inclined to think, that these Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions extend to Justice-airs, as well as Justice-Courts, as to all the Articles here exprest, since Orders are given by the Parliament for regulating Justice in these Regulations, which shew the Parliament design'd to extend them to both.</p>
                  <p>From these words in the ninth Article, <hi>That the Chancellour of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size mark how every individual Assizer shall Vote whether he Condemns or Asseilȝies,</hi> it clearly follows, that no Assyzer in Criminals may be <hi>non li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi>: and if this were allow'd in one, it might be in all; &amp; because this was not necessary formerly; Therefore by the 63 <hi>Act Par.</hi> 8. <hi>Ja.</hi> 3. It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd that when a Summons of Error was rais'd, each Assizer was to set down who assoilȝed, and who Condemned; but because they might forget, or for fear of punishment, might be unfaithful in this;
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:59223:228"/>
Therefore this Act appoints, <hi>That in the first Verdict it shall be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who Condemned, and who assoilȝed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Albeit this Act appoints <hi>that the Chancellor shall mark whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man assoilȝes or Condemns:</hi> Yet it is thought the omission of this would not annul a Verdict in favours of the King, that being only introduc'd in favours of the King, to the end that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Advocat may be instructed whom to pursue in a Summons of Error, when a party is wrongously assoilȝed.</p>
                  <p>By the 11 Article it is appointed, <hi>That when any Summons of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpation is Executed against any party, that at the same time the Names of the Witnesses and Inquest should be given, to the end the party may know what to object against the Witnesses</hi>: Upon which Article it was alleadged that when an Exculpation was rais'd against the King, the Witnesses Names should be given to his Advocat likewise; and which the Justices found to be necessary in <hi>March</hi> 1680. For the Act being general as to all; and there being as great reason that the King should know those who are to be led against Him, as any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat party, He ought to have the same measure: and whereas it was objected, that it were a very severe thing, that a poor Pannal might not lead any Witness, even during the Debate, though his Name had not been given in List; yet this has no weight, since the Act is so clear in general Terms as to all: and it may seem as unreasonable that the King should not be allow'd to lead any Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to prove a Crime, if he find him in the Court the time of the Debate; for the Pannal may much better, know who can prove his Defence, since he behov'd to know them, if they were present, than the Kings Advocat can know who were present when the Crime was committed; and though there may be some inconvenience in this, for one particular Pannal, yet in the general there is great advantage in this to Pannals, the King being thereby forc'd to give in the Names of his Witnesses, so that the Pannal may not only know how to object against them, but even how to practise them: and whereas it may be objected, that by this procedure there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd to be <hi>progressus in infinitum,</hi> since the King might Cite Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to cast the Pannals Witnesses; and the Pannal behov'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be allow'd to cast the Kings Witnesses, and to have Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that effect. It is answered, that this might as well be urg'd against all Reprobators; nor does this hold here, for the Judge should not allow such Citations, save one to each party. Because Messengers in Executing Criminal Letters, gave sometimes only copies of the Libel it self, and yet returned Executions to His Majesties Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat; that they had likwise given Lists of Assizers and Witnesses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore the Justices declar'd in <hi>February</hi> 1681. by an Act of their Sederunt, that if the Pannal should produce a Copy under the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers hand of the Libel, except the List of the Assizers and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses Names were upon the same Paper with it, they would not sustain the Execution, though bearing <hi>That Lists of Witnesses and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizers were given.</hi>

                        <hi>ACT</hi> 19.</note> and the Sheriff was to adjust the sums due with the Lands Comprised; but thereafter great Estates being Comprised for small Debts, the Parliament thought fit by this Act to Ordain, that for the future, not a Messenger who was Judge in Comprisings; but the Lords of Session should by a Process be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, Adjudge as much of the Debitors Lands to the Creditor as would satisfie his principal Sum and Annualrent, with a fifth part more, because the Creditor was forc'd to take Land for Money, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the Common Law, <hi>aliud pro alio invito creditore solvi nequit.</hi> And albeit this Act expresses only that this fifth part shall be beside the Composition to the Superiour, and Expenses of Infeftment; yet certainly the Creditor must likewise have all the Expenses bestow'd upon the Process; for as this is reasonable in it self, so that expenses tends to the procuring of the Infeftment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. This Act came in to the Parliament simply in these Terms, and the equity of it was prest from the Custom of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and particularly the Common Law, where the <hi>Praetor</hi> did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the Debitors Land proportionally to the Debt; but it being strongly urg'd by the Lawyers, Burgesses and other Members who were Moneyed Men, that it was most unreasonable to force the Creditor to take Land, except the Debitor should produce to him a good Progress and Security; for both, to be forced to take Land, and yet to want a sufficient Right thereto, was altogether unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable: Therefore the Parliament ordain'd, that if the Debitor did not compear and produce a sufficient progress, and Renunce the Possession, the Debitor might Adjudge the whole Estate as formerly he Comprised it; and this has almost Evacuated the whole Act; for the most of Debitors are unwilling to produce a Progres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and renunce Possession; and therefore most Lands are now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd as they were formerly apprised; and in <hi>December</hi> 6. 1681. It was found that an Adjudication led for a fifth part more in absence of the Debitor, was null; since the fifth part more was only to be given, where the Creditor compeared, produced a Progress, and Renunced; albeit it seems that this alternative being introduced in favours of the Creditor, it ought to be optional to him to choose either.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 2. That the Legal in these Adjudications is only five years, whereas it was seven in Comprisings, for the danger being less<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because of the said Commensuration, it was just that the time for Redemption should be shorter; and though it be not exprest that the foresaid five year shall not run against Minors, and that it may seem it should not run against them, in respect of the short commensuration, and that it seems unreasonable, that a Creditor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:59223:229"/>
forc'd to take so little Land, and should yet be forced to be unsecure during a whole Minority, yet the said Legal in Adjudications will not run against Minors, for Adjudications having come in place of Apprisings, are to be regulated by the same Rules, except where it is otherwise provided by express Law; and therefore Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot be led upon Bonds, bearing <hi>Requisition,</hi> except Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition be first used, this being formerly necessary in Compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 3. That where Land is Decern'd proportionally to the sum, with a fifth part more, the Creditor is to possess the Land in satisfaction of his annualrent, during the not Redemption, without being lyable to Restitution, or Compt and Reckoning; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Act does thereafter say, <hi>that he shall be pay'd of his principal sum and annualrent,</hi> that must be understood in the Terms foresaid, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Rent of the Land shall be allowed for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrent, without Restriction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 4. If the Creditor acquire once Possession, he cannot thereafter use personal Execution; which I think should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood only where the Debitor compears, both because this Clause is adjected to that part of the Act which presupposeth Compear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and before the Clause punishing his absence; and because it were unjust that a Debitor should have advantage, when he will not consent. It may be also doubted, whether though the Debitor compear, he may be free of Personal Execution, when the Land adjudged is not able to pay the sum, according to the Terms of the Act; for the reason of the Law ceaseth, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man should not use Execution, when he has attain'd payment: and thus albeit of old in Comprisings, the Compriser could not use personal Execution, where he was in possession, except he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunced the same, <hi>July</hi> 23. 1633. yet where he had not attained the possession, albeit the Comprising was expir'd, he might have us'd personal Execution by Horning and Caption, though not by arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and poinding, <hi>December</hi> 7. 1631.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> 5. That since this <hi>Act</hi> Declares, that neither the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour nor Adjudger shall be prejudged by this Act; it clearly follows, that the Superiour may in this case, as in Comprisings, Redeem the Adjudger by payment of the sum, it being unjust that a stranger Vassal, should be forced upon him, when he is content to pay what is due.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quaritur,</hi> Whether albeit by this Act, no Comprisings can be led of Lands, not already Comprised; if yet Adjudicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may not be led, even where Lands are formerly Comprised; for this is not expresly discharg'd: and this seems to have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:59223:230"/>
in favours of the Creditors, who may make their own Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and I think they may.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is Declar'd, That the Superiour and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judger, shall be in the same case after Citation in the Process of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judication, as if Apprising were led, and a Charge given. It may be doubted, how a simple Summons can be equivalent to an Appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and Charge; for if that were sustained, he who had rais'd the first Summons would be preferr'd to him, who having rais'd a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterior Summons, had got the first Decreet; because the first Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons would be equivalent to an apprising; and consequently to a Decreet of Adjudication: But the Lords have very justly found that the meaning of this Clause is, That the first step in an Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be preferable to the second step in a Comprising, and so forth: But not that the first step in an Adjudication shall be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a compleat Comprising: and yet it still remains, that a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in an Adjudication is equal to a Denunciation in an Apprising; for tho a Denunciation be the more solemn <hi>Act,</hi> yet a Summons publickly call'd in the House, does likewise make the Diligence ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notour.</p>

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 4.</note>THere having been a full Debate before His Majesty, how far Masters were answerable for their Tennents, the Parliament to prevent the like for the future, made this Act, being fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that Masters in <hi>Scotland</hi> could command their Tennents and Servants; suitable whereto, there are many old Statutes, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Masters to present them, and finding that without this, the Peace could not be secured; and upon the event it is found, that this has secur'd the Peace for Tennents and Servants, knowing that their Masters would find out their Crimes, which Sheriffs and others could not know; and that they could not get Service, or Land any where; If they were disorderly, they have conformed, and this hath Restor'd Masters to the just Influence which our Predecessors had over their Tennents and Servants, and which they lost by their Fanaticism, by which they came to depend only on their Ministers; and minding more Conventicles than their Work: and in which extravagancy, they were so far advanc'd, that they would not see themselves till they were secur'd, that they should be allow'd to go to these: nor is the Master ty'd by this Act to any hard thing, since by presenting them to Justice, or by putting them out of his Land, or out of his service, he is free from all danger, and this is in his power; as also to secure him yet further, it is Declar'd, that he may break their Tacks; and that if any Master take them who are put away, he shall be lyable unto three years Duty.</p>
               <p>It having been also Debated before the King, that there could be no Deputs nam'd, for putting the Laws against Ecclesiastick Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders to execution, within the bounds of Heretable Judges; therefore His Majesties Power is Declar'd as to this Point, by the Clause of this Act; but this is now unnecessary, because by the 18 <hi>Act</hi> of this Parliament, His Majesties cumulative Power is Declar'd as to all points.</p>
               <p>IT is very observable that the longer the World lasts, Probation by Witnesses-lessens alwise in esteem,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 5.</note> because men grow alwise more Wicked. In our Saviours time, <hi>out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses, every word was to be established</hi>: Thereafter by our Law, and by the Laws of other Nations, nothing above an hundred pounds could be proven by Witnesses. And albeit of old the affixing of a Seal was probative without a Subscription or Witnesses:
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:59223:231"/>
but as by former Acts, the Subscriptions of Parties is Declar'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit: So though formerly the Designing the Witnesses, was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, although they did not Subscrive: Yet by this Act no Writ is Declar'd Probative, except the Witnesses Subscrive; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Subscriving, the Writ is Declared null: But the Act of Parliament does not condescend, whether this nullity shall be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by way of exception, Or if it must require a Reduction: But I conceive it must be null by way of exception, since the Law hath Declar'd such Papers null, and the want of Witnesses ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by production of the Paper it self.</p>
               <p>The second thing Established by this Act is, that no Witnesse shall sign as a Witness to any Parties Subscription, except he know the Party, and saw him subscrive, or saw, or heard him give war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to the Nottar, or touch the Pen; The occasion of which part of the Act was, among other remarkable Cases, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman pretending that she could not Write before so many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, desir'd to sign the Paper in her own Chamber, whereupon she got the Paper with her, and at her return brought it back sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriv'd, and she thereafter rais'd a Reduction of the same Paper, as not truly sign'd by her; and though this should hardly have been sustainable at her own instance, because she was heard to own it by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the subscriving witnesses, and the whole company: yet this exception of <hi>dole</hi> could not have secluded her Heirs or Executors from reducing it as said is. If witnesses without seeing a party subscrive, or giving war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to subscrive, shal subscrive as witnesses, they are declared to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable as accessory to Forgery; which quality some think was added to seclude the punishment of Death, it being, as may be pretended, too severe to punish by Death, that which is the effect of meer negligence, and unto which very many fall through negligence; yet our Law knows no difference betwixt accessories and principals further than <hi>ex gratia</hi>; accessories may sometimes find a mitigation of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. I conceive also, that a party signing as Witness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seeing the Paper subscriv'd, should be lyable to a third party who got assignation to that Paper in Damnage and Interest, if it be Reduced <hi>ex eo capite,</hi> since he was a loser by his negligence: But <hi>quid juris?</hi> 1. If the party himself, to whom the Paper was granted, were pursuing such an action for Damnage and Interest, since he should have considered his own security, and the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses might have trusted to his exactness. 2. <hi>Quid juris?</hi> if the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness heard Command given to one of the Nottars, since the Act says, <hi>That unless they heard him give Warrand to a Notar, or Notars, and touch the Notars Pen</hi>; and yet even in that case, the Paper may be null, because there was not a Command given to both the Notars; and a third party may thereby lose his Right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. It may be doubted if upon a Notars asking, if the party will warrand him to subscrive, the party do give a Nod, whether that Nod will be equivalent to a Warrand, and free the Witness, who thereupon subscrived as Witness? And it seems it should; for the Act says, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:59223:232"/>
he saw or heard him give Command:</hi> and a man cannot see a Warrand otherways than by a Nod; and <hi>nutus</hi> was sufficient by the Civil Law to infer a Mandat.</p>
               <p>The third point in the <hi>Act</hi> is, that albeit in all Forraign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Subscription of a Notar proves in all Obligations; (for there the Notar keeps the Paper sign'd by the Party, and gives on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Duplicat sign'd by him) and albeit in our Law, a Notars Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription did prove in all Instruments, such as Seasins, Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Witnesses were insert, and design'd, though they did not at all subscrive; yet by this <hi>Act</hi> the Witnesses must likewise subscrive, which is another argument to prove, how much the Faith to be given to men is now lessen'd: But it is fit to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that other Instruments taken by Notars, continue in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition, and need no subscriving Witnesses; though for cautiousness, all Witnesses in any Instrument do now Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> That the Civil Law call'd all Obligations Instruments; but we call only Acts of Notars Instruments.</p>
               <p>The fourth Point in this Act is, That all Executions of Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon Inhibitions, Interdictions, Hornings, or Arrestments, shall be null, if they be not subscriv'd by Witnesses; and these were exprest, because they are Executions of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and yet it seems that Executions of Comprisings and Adjudications are of as great Importance as any of these; and yet it is not requir'd by this <hi>Act,</hi> that Executions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisings and Adjudications should have subscriving Witnesses; and a Reduction being raised of the Execution of a Comprising, because there being but two Witnesses exprest in the Execution; one whereof did expresly deny, that ever he was witness in such an Execution, and so the same became null, as wanting two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses: To this it was answered, that the Deposition of a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, denying that he was present upon the Land the time of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, was not sufficient to destroy an Heretable Right of so great importance, as this Comprising was; for this Deposition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so long a time, could amount to no more than <hi>a non memini</hi>; and the reason whereupon this Statute is founded, appears by the Narrative to be, because the Witnesses may by their forgetfulness easily disown their being Witnesses; and many men are apt to forget such Circumstances, and to deny that ever they have been in such a Place or House, until the same be brought back to their memory, by other very remarkable Circumstances, which could not be done here, because the Messenger and the other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses were both Dead. 2. The Deposition of one Witness deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his being present, should not infer a nullity of the Compris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, since the loss of the whole Executions would not infer the same, after so long a time as has been frequently decided. 3. If
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59223:232"/>
this were allow'd, it should be in the power of every single Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in an Execution of a Comprising, or Adjudication, which are now the Foundations of the most of our Rights, to destroy and overturn the same for Money or Prejudice. 4. No singular Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor buying a Comprising, could be secur'd; and if these Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions had been thought of such importance, this Statute had required subscriving Witnesses. For a Comprising is of far more consequence than an Arrestment; The one relating to an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the other to an Moveable, and very Temporary Right. 5. No man could with a sufficient <hi>causa scientiae,</hi> Depone that he was not upon the Ground of the Lands of such a Barony, except he knew every bit of the March of the Barony, for that Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might have been used upon the very remotest corner of it.</p>
               <p>The last Branch of this <hi>Act</hi> is, that no Execution whatsoever shall be sufficient to interrupt the Prescription of Heretable Rights, unless the same have subscriving Witnesses; and by this, we see what Care our Law has taken to preserve Prescriptions: and for the same reason it is appointed by the 10 <hi>Act</hi> 2 <hi>Par. Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>That all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that shall be made use of, for Interruptions shall be renew'd every seven year</hi>; and because of this Clause in the <hi>Act,</hi> it is advisable, that all Executions in Adjudications, Comprisings, Molestations, and generally in all Actions, relating to real Rights, have Subscriving Witnesses, though these be not Exprest, because they may be made use of as interruptions in other cases. <hi>vid. observ.</hi> on the said Act.</p>
               <p>THis Act concerning the <hi>Test,</hi> is so exactly and universally known, and all objections against it have been so fully clear'd,<note place="margin">ACT 6.</note> that it is unnecessary to Write any Observation upon it:</p>
               <p>BY the 2 <hi>Act</hi> of the 1 <hi>Par. Ch.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">ACT 7.</note> It is <hi>Declar'd that the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Senators of the Colledge of Justice did ever belong to the King.</hi> And His Majesty and His Predecessors have ever been in use of appointing the times in which they should sit, and Judge for him; and therefore His Majesties Royal Brother, finding, that many Members of Parliament inclin'd to want the Summer Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he allow'd the Overture to be brought into the Articles. It was likewise propos'd, That <hi>there might be one Moneth allow'd for the Summer, and four only for the Winter</hi>; for which it was urg'd, that this would save all the inconveniencies that could be adduc'd against the Summer Session; since therein Causes that could not well admit of delay, such as Suspensions, Removings, Actions upon Bills of Exchange, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might be discuss'd; but this was Rejected by Vote of both Articles and Parliament, as tending to as much Trouble and Expense as the Summer Session it self, without any considerable advantage. For the Leiges behov'd to attend from the remotest parts of the Nation, and yet the whole time would
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59223:233"/>
be spent in useless preparations for Business the first fourthnight; and in a dangerous hurry the last fourthnight; by this Act then there is only one Session to be in the whole year, which is to last from the first of <hi>November,</hi> to the last of <hi>March inclusive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Arguments adduc'd for this Model were first, That two meetings of the Session did encourage our Countrey-men too much to litigiousness, who were naturally too much addicted thereto; whereas one Session might well enough end all our Affairs: and it was indeed observable, that to recommend this Overture, all possible dispatch had been made in the former Session. 2. That these two Sessions occasioned great Expense, since people behov'd to come twice a year from the remotest parts of the Nation, most unnecessarly; for the Summer Session was spent in Preparation, or Hurry, as said is. 3. The Summer being the only time wherein <hi>Scots-men</hi> could have any pleasure, or could make any improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Building, Imparking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Summer Session did, without making us any Recompense, destroy both our own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and the adorning of our Countrey.</p>
               <p>The Arguments for continuing the Summer Session as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Session not sitting for seven Moneths, His Majesties Authority during all that time, wants the support and assistance which otherwise it uses to have from the frequent attendance of the Nobility, the Kings Officers, and others do meet frequently during the Session, because of the conveniency they have in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their private Business. Whereas in this long Vacation of seven Moneths, they can hardly be brought together, and so want that Correspondence, Intelligence and mutual assistance which they have in time of the Session; and our Rebellions being ordinarly in the Summer time, because of the conveniency which Rebels have of lying in the open Fields, and of getting provision for their Horses, it would be much easier to suppress the same, when His Majesties Authority is fully represented, and His Nobility and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants fully conveen'd; a great instance whereof appear'd in the late Rebellion of <hi>Bothwel-bridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Summer Session was very well contriv'd for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Justice, because in the Moneths of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> such as have affairs in dependence before the Session, had then no La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring at Home, those two Moneths falling very conveniently in betwixt Seed-time and Harvest, and we having formerly had the Moneth of <hi>March</hi> adjected to the Winter Session, that Moneth was taken from it, because it was a part of our Seed-time, and consequently to have it now a part of our Session, must be very inconvenient. 2. In those two Moneths, His Majesties Subjects in the Isles, and remote Countreys, can only come to get Justice administrated to them in the Summer, there being no passage from
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:59223:233"/>
these places to the Session in the Winter time; or at least if they do come, they must stay the whole Winter; and in some years the storms are such, that there is no Travelling, even from nearer Countreys, nor is the winter fit for old men Bishops, Clergy-men, and such as are infirm to travel in. 3. The Season in these two Moneths, being very moderat with us, and the dayes long, much more Bussiness is dispatched, than in the Winter time: and there is far more conveniency of Informing, than in the cold and rigid Winter Nights, which puts men to great expense, and occasions many Diseases. 4. Though his Majesties Subjects now procure Decreets, or get Bonds; yet the same being Suspended, they cannot be discuss'd for nine or ten Moneths; during which time also widows and Orphans starve; Masters cannot remove Tennents, because they Advocat the Cause; and Debitors become Insolvent; Creditors likewise being forc'd to use Adjudi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ions within year and day of one another, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together by the said long Vacation excluded. 5. Not only Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before the Session by this means, but even before inferiour Courts are stopt; for such as are conscious to the injustice of their own cause, stop procedure there likewise by Advocations, which cannot be discuss'd for nine or ten Moneths. 6. Not only in these particulars; but in general, the course of Justice is stopt here: far contrary, not only to our conveniency, but to the Custom of all Nations, who allow in place of one, four or five Sessions. There being no Vacation in the world longer than two Moneths, except in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who now allow seven; during which time, honest men are Defrauded, Bankrupt, and violent Possessors are Indulg'd; Probation by Witnesses, and otherwise perish: and to be short, there is no face of Justice during that time. 7. As the Vacation is too long for the conveniency of the People, so is the Winter Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion too long for the conveniency of the Judges, Advocats and other Members of the Colledge of Justice, who must either destroy themselves by toiling too much, or the Peoples Business by their languid and negligent mannadgement thereof, it being undenyable that before the four Moneths used to expire formerly, all persons concerned did languish, weary, and wish for a Vacation. 8. The shortness of the time now allow'd, forces the Judges to give shorter au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and to frequent the Side-Bars more than is fit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The want of the Summer Session destroys Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; Because 1. Merchants cannot get in their Money, with which they should Trade, wanting the Execution of Law for so long a time. 2. There is now no <hi>Whitsunday</hi> Term, so that the Course of Money is stopt; and it is undenyable, that there are no payments now at <hi>Whitsunday</hi>; whereas we having had two Terms formerly, <hi>Whitsunday</hi> and <hi>Martinmas,</hi> there were very wisely two Sessions appointed, one in the Summer for those who did not pay at <hi>Whitsunday</hi>; and another in the Winter, for those who did not pay at <hi>Martinmass.</hi> 3. There being no concourse and meetings of the People for seven Moneths, there can be little Commerce: For all Traffique arises, and Bargains are made upon such occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:59223:234"/>
4. It is undenyable, that twice more Merchants have broke in those two years that we wanted a Summer Session, than in any six formerly; from which decay of Trade also arises a great loss to His Majesty in His Customs and Revenue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This want of the Summer Session is very prejudicial to the private Estates and Interests of almost all sorts of People: For, 1. There is alwise greatest consumption of Corn, Cattle, and all Products of the Nation, in more frequent and numerous concourse of People; and the greater the Consumption be, the prices rises so much the higher. 2. The Victual of the Northern Shires not being Transportable till <hi>April,</hi> because of the Storms, it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vented during the Summer Session; and now the price of the Victual there is much faln, and His Majesties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in those Shires much prejudg'd. 3. The Heritors of Store-rooms in the South and West are very much prejudg'd, since a great part of their Cattle, especially of the younger, was only vented in the Summer Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 4. The Heretors in the Shires about <hi>Edinburgh</hi> are prejudg'd in every thing that is pay'd to them. 5. The half of the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> it self is almost laid waste; Landlords having almost lost half their Rent, and the best Trades-men running away to other Nations, because they are idle for seven Moneths here. By which also His Majesty is a great loser in His Revenue, that Town paying him more alone, than a sixth part of what is pay'd by all the Burghs-Royal in the Kingdom; and Trade by this extraordinary Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty decaying in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which is the Fountain of Commerce, and the Staple Port of the Nation, it must proportionally decay in all the other Towns, since their Trade and Commerce depends upon it. 6. His Majesties ordinary and additional Excise in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> has very much decreased, and the Brewers are almost all broken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these two years, as the Tacks-men and Customers too well know: The Ministers Stipends likewise being pay'd out of the Annuities on House-Meals, they must likewise decrease as the House-meals do. Nor is the Town able to keep up the Company, nor to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish His Majesty such assistance, as formerly it gave in the Rebellions at <hi>Pentland</hi> and <hi>Bothwel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the contrary Arguments, it was answered, that as to the first, Business did increase daily in all Nations, with the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Land and of Trade, and the multiplying of Diligences, so that Processes could not be sooner ended than formerly, without deciding them more carefully. To the second, no man now need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come till his Cause was call'd, because all Causes were decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their course by a Roll, and so it was no matter whether he came Summer or Winter. To the third it was answer'd, there was more Planting and improvement in the Moneth of <hi>March,</hi> which is now lost than in both the Moneths of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:59223:234"/>It may be doubted if the King can recal the Summer Session with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an express Act of Parliament; and it may be urg'd that He may, since the Session is his own Court, wherein He does Justice to His People by His Judges; and therefore as any of His Majesties Vassals may hold their Courts when they please, much more may His Majesty hold His. Likeas His Majesty has oft-times by His Council, order'd the Session to sit when and where He pleas'd: And whereas it is pretended, that if this were true, Acts of Parliament in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his case were unnecessary; and that such alterations have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been made without the Parliament. To this it is answered, That at first the Session was a Committee of Parliament; and so the Diets of Session behov'd to be appointed by Parliament: and now likewise it is fit, that the Inclinations of the Subjects be gratifi'd by such Acts, taking along their consent in a Case of so general a concern; but it does not necessarly follow, that all things that have been Establ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that which makes this Court a Soveraign Court is, that by this <hi>Act</hi> it is declar'd, that they may not only review the Decreets of inferiour Admirals, but their own; and the reason why they are allow'd to review their own is, because it is their custom to grant oft-times Decreets summarly, for not finding Caution; and it were hard not to allow the persons concern'd to be heard upon an offer to find Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as also, It is declar'd by this <hi>Act, that no Advocations shall be granted from them to the Session</hi>; but even this is not observ'd, tho it was the great design of this Act, for this <hi>Act</hi> restricting this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to <hi>maritim</hi> and Sea-affairs, the Lords Advocat Causes from that Court, as not <hi>maritim,</hi> it not being determin'd what Cases are <hi>mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> and so can be comprehended under that Term.</p>
               <p>The Lords are still allow'd to Suspend the Decreets of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>in praesentia,</hi> or by three Lords in the Vacance, which is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be reconciled with its being a Soveraign Court: And yet in some Cases, the Lords Suspend the Decreets of the Justice-Court, and of the Commission of the Kirk, which are certainly Soveraign Courts. The Admiral Court has got also power by this <hi>Act</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Fines and Amerciaments of their own Courts, to their own use, which formerly belong'd to the King; and they have also the sole power to grant Passes and safe Conducts to Ships, which by a special priviledge was granted immediatly before this <hi>Act,</hi> very ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly to Magistrats of Burghs Royal, and in the time of the late <hi>Dutch</hi> War, it was granted to a particular person, named by His Majesty, who was called <hi>Surveyer-general</hi>; and was bound by his Instructions, not to grant a Pass to any Ship till he was aboard,

               <p>BY this <hi>Act</hi> because common things are neglected, and Creditors are disappointed of all the Rents where the same are controverted amongst them;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 17.</note> therefore they are allow'd to roup the Lands of the common Creditors, when become Bankrupts, which is now done by Summons, Narrating this Statute, in which all the real Creditors are Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereupon the Lords grant a Commission for trying the value of the Estate, and then they determine what shall be the least price, and they name a Lord before whom the Roup is to be made, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are raised, Charging Creditors to appear on twenty one dayes, at such an hour at the New-Session-House, to offer before such a Lord, at which Day he comes to the Outter-House, and the Clerk Reads the Acts, and Commission to that Lord, and the Macer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Lands at the price put on them by the Lords three several times, and if none offer more, he who raised the Summons gets them at that price.</p>
               <p>After all this, the Creditors go on in their multiple poinding, and being rank'd according to their due preference, the price is distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongst them accordingly, tho it may be Debated that this preference should be first determined, since till then Creditors will not willingly offer.</p>
               <p>It seems more reasonable that Roups should be in the Shires where the Lands to be sold do ly, for there will be more buyers found there than at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>: I could likewise wish, that where any of the Lords of the Session are Pursuers, they would name Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners in the Countrey to make the Roup, for Societies should shun <hi>sibi jus dicere,</hi> where the same can be supply'd by others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> think also that it were fit that Roups were made three several dayes, and not all at one time, as is required by the Doctors; for this would give all persons concerned time and opportunity to appear, and consider what is fit to be offered, for men may be surprised, or be sick, or busie at one hour, or time. <hi>I</hi> conceive also, that the Lord who makes the Roup, should stay all the two hours allow'd, not only to the last moment, but from the first, as we see the Judges do in Roups abroad, and before our Admirals, where the Roups are therefore appointed to be made <hi>ad candelam,</hi> or <hi>clepsidram,</hi> and in Orders of Redemption, we see that the Redeemer must wait from Sun to Sun; and tho where the Common Good is to be Rouped in Towns, or the Customs in Exchequer, the same use to be done in half an hour or so, yet it is a different thing where Creditors are to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for getting payment of their own just Debts: and for the same reason it seems, though a just Creditor come somewhat late; yet if he offer more, he ought to be preferred, <hi>nam de minimis non curat praetor,</hi> and the interest of lawful Creditors ought to have greater favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:59223:237"/>It is doubted, if a part of the Bankrupts Lands may be Rouped, since the <hi>Act</hi> ordains in general his Estate to be Roupt, and a part of the Estate cannot be call'd the Estate; and it were hard to choose out the Mannor-place, and some little part of the Land, by the want whereof, the rest would become of little value: The <hi>Act</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by ordaining the price to be distributed among the Creditors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuats that one Creditor cannot choose a part to be Roupt for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his particular Debt.</p>
               <p>Whether the Lords may stop offers when they grow exorbitant in prejudice of offers of a just price, made by lawful Creditors; and whether a Creditor should be preferr'd to a stranger, both offering the same price, tho the stranger made the first offer; and if a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor in passion may be allow'd to repent, and if he should get Deductions in case of supervenient War, Pestilence, or <hi>vis major,</hi> may be seen with many other intricat questions, fully discust by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus de auctionibus,</hi> and <hi>Postillus de sub-hastationibus,</hi> where all the matter of Roups are excellently Treated.</p>

               <p>THe occasion of this <hi>Act</hi> was a Solemn Debate betwixt Provost <hi>Curry</hi> and <hi>Charles Oliphant</hi> in <hi>December</hi> 1677.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 19.</note> In which the said Provost rais'd a Reduction of a Right made by the Mr. of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingtoun</hi> to the said <hi>Charles</hi> of the Lands of <hi>Nether Mordingtoun,</hi> and <hi>Edringtoun,</hi> as made by a Minor; and though an Oath was adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Minor, to Ratifie at his majority: Yet that was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise null, since by the same facility that Minors will Contract to their Laesion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will likewise swear to their Laesion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the publick interest, as well as the interest of the Minor, that such Oaths should not bind.</p>
               <p>To which it was answered, that though the World, whilest <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> did Rescind such Oaths; yet by the famous Law <hi>sacramenta puberum,</hi> such Oaths were to be observ'd: and though Oaths gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against a publick Law, were not to be observ'd; yet in such a Case as this, where the publick was not concerned; and where there was no Statute against the interposing such an Oath, the Oath ought to be observed, as being a matter of far greater consequence than the Contract: Nor should Judges favour Perjury, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare people who trusted Oaths; and even in Countreys where Statutes were made against the validity of such Oaths, they ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Minor to be first absolved by a Church-man; and since we had no such Absolutions, we could admit of no Restitution. To which it was Reply'd, that the Laws Restoring Minors were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon publick Good and Interest; and therefore it were absurd to suffer the Contravention of them to be secured by an Oath, and that an Oath adjected by a Minor, should no more bind than an Oath adjected by a Wife, which has been by many Decisions found not to be binding, and even in these Countreys where the Canon Law takes place, this authentick Constitution is not observ'd, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. as is observed by <hi>Guidilinus de jure novis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. It was 2<hi>ly</hi> alleadged, That such Oaths ought not to secure where the Deed is in it self invalid and illegal, as here where the Father authorizes the Son to Confirm a Deed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers own advantage, <hi>nam nemo potest esse author in rem suam.</hi> 3. It ought not to be respected even by the opinion of the Civilians, where there is <hi>aenorm laesion</hi>; which <hi>aenorm laesion</hi> is <hi>dolus praesumptus:</hi> and no oath can secure against <hi>fraud</hi> or <hi>dole.</hi> 4. Though the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor might have prejudged himself by that oath, and thereby have secluded himself from craving Restitution; yet he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the Provost who was a third Party, and was his Creditor; for the effect of the oath being only personal, could not reach him. The Lords upon this Debate sustained the Contract, and Repelled the Reason of Reduction, though rais'd by a singular Successor.

                     <hi>ACT</hi> 20.</note>BY this Act for facilitating the course of Trade, Bills of Exchange are ordain'd to be Registrated within six moneths after they are due, and tho the Bill bear no consent to the Registration as Bands do; yet they are registrated by vertue of this Act, which is Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the beginning of the Paper that is Registrated; but this is of no great use; and therefore Merchants choose rather to pursue summarly before the Dean of Gilds Court, who is with us, <hi>le con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul des Merchans,</hi> and even these Pursuits are disappointed by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations; nor have they so much as the priviledge of being Discust summarly, without attending the course of the Roll, as was crav'd by the draught of the Act that was first under consideration. It was also crav'd, that Compensation should not be receiv'd against Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, as is Customary abroad; and a Bill is in effect, in the constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Law, a bagg of Money trusted by the Drawer, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivered in another place; and Compensation is not even by the Common Law received against Depositations.</p>
               <p>The reason why this Act was only extended to Bills drawn from abroad, or in favours of persons abroad; and not to Bills drawn from one place within the Kingdom to another, was, because if that had been allow'd, all Debts had still been constituted by Bills, and not by Bands, and so had been priviledged by too summar execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:59223:238"/>BEfore Parliaments can proceed to publick Affairs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ACT</hi> 21.</note> all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Elections must first be cleared and determined, which being the occasion of great delayes in the dispatch of business gave the rise to this Act, whereby it is ordain'd, that none shall have vote in the Elections of Commissioners for Shires or Stewartries, except those who are publickly Infeft in Property or Superiority, Life-rent or proper Wodset, and in possession of a 40 shilling Land of old Extent, holden of the King or Prince, or in Lands of 400 Pounds Valuation, whether Kirk-lands, or other Blench, Few or Ward-lands, and that appearand Heirs being in possession by vertue of their Predecessors Rights, and Husbands for the free-holds of their Wives, or as Life-renters by the courtesie of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of the Extent and Valuation foresaid, have right to Vote.</p>
               <p>The Shire of <hi>Berwick</hi> having made cross Elections of Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the late Parliament, the Committee for controverted Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons decided these points for clearing this Act, which report was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven in Parliament.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a Charter confirmed by the King of a 40 shilling Land, does not give a party right to vote, except his Seasin thereupon be produced, and that the Confirmation be of the Seasin, since the Confirmation of a Charter, imports no more but the Confirmation of a personal obligment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Vassals of Kirk-lands of the Extent and Valuation foresaid, have no vote unless they hold their Lands of the King as their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Superiour; for since it is optional to them, either to hold of the King, or Lord of Erection, by the 53 <hi>Act,</hi> 1 <hi>Parl. Ch.</hi> 2. it is presumed they still hold of the Lord of Erection, unless they instruct that they hold of His <hi>Majesty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Where Vassals produce Rights to a part of a Barony, that will give them no right to vote, except they can instruct that their Lands are Retour'd to such a proportion as put them in the terms of the Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Life-rents not constitute by Infeftments, but by personal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligments, give not the Life-renters right to vote.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Persons Interdicted seem to be debarr'd from voting, since they who were not fit for managing their own affairs, ought not to be trusted to vote for Commissioners to Parliaments; but this I think should only hold in Interdictions, <hi>causa cognita,</hi> very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men consenting to voluntar Interdictions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If the King be only Superiour <hi>supplendo vices</hi> of the immediat Superior, by his not entering to the Superiority: this will not give the Vassal a vote, since the immediat Superior retains all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualities, and consequently remains still Superiour, albeit <hi>pro hac vice</hi> the King supplies the defect of the Immediat Superiours lying out, by infefting the Vassal.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Appearand Heirs, albeit in the terms of this Act have no right to vote, if they have renounced, or if their Predecessors were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuded,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:59223:239"/>
albeit they were in possession, the famine being only by a tollerance from the Party in whose favours the Predecessor was denuded.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Appearand Heirs by the Mothers side, gives not a Title to vote, except they be actually entered Heirs, since it is presumed there are Heirs Male, except the contrair be proven by a Service.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Vassals who have expired Apprisings, or Adjudications, have liberty to vote, albeit by an Act of the Lords of Session, the Lands are declared to be redeemable for the Sums truly due, since by this Act Apprisings, Adjudications, and proper Wodsetts, are not to be questioned upon pretence of any order of redemption, payment, or satisfaction, unless a Decreet of Declarator, voluntar Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, Resignation, or Renunciation be produced.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It was found in the Election of the Commissioners of East-<hi>Lothian,</hi> that no votes are sustained, but these who voted and sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Meeting was dissolved; and the votes of those who came immediatly after, were not sustain'd, tho the Preses return'd with some of the number. But in the Elections for the <hi>Mers,</hi> it was found that a person was capable to vote, albeit he was detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prisoner by a mis-information from one of the Competitors; he having given an account of the way and manner of his Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Meeting, and declared his vote to them, and after his enlargement did immediatly take the Test, and sign the Commission.</p>
