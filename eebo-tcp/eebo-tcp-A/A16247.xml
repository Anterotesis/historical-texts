            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THere is a common ſaying among ours and Gods enemies the Papiſts, that <hi>the Chriſtian Church muſt be knowne by theſe Characters, Viſibility, Antiquity, Vniuerſality, and Conſent:</hi> but the Spirit of God ſayes, that all theſe are the marks of the Beaſt; and perſecution and paucitie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſignes of the true Church: thus began the firſt propheſie, <hi>I will put enmity betweene thee and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>the woman, and betweene thy ſeed and her ſeed;</hi> thus it continued in <hi>Iohns</hi> Reuelation, <hi>Then the Dragon</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 17.</note> 
               <hi>was wroth with the Woman, and went and made warre with the remnant of her ſeed, which keep the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, and haue the teſtimony of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And thus could we ſpread the teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture like a mantle expoſed to your view, full of delicate reſemblances, wherein you might behold how the true Church of God hath been euer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ceſſation ſubiect to ſcornes, opprobry, the malignant circumſtances of time, or fearfull perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. But withall we pray you remember, that we make not our approches from <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> heating the oven ſeuen times hotter, but the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons <note place="margin">Dan. 3. Apoc. 12.</note> watching the Woman, the Man that ſitteth in the Temple of God as God, thoſe that be in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire, ſuch as were inveſted with <hi>Aarons</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2877:3"/>
and in plaine termes the continued per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution which we meane muſt ariſe out of the hate and malice of Chriſtians; yea Preachers themſelues, that are oppoſites to zealous profeſſors, and this we complaine of.</p>
            <p>Oh reade, reade for Gods ſake the ſtory of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> and marke his perſecutions, and who were his greateſt enemies? <hi>Shemaiah</hi> a falſe Prophet, and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniah</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ch. 29.</note> the chiefe Prieſt in ſtead of <hi>Iehoiada;</hi> yea if you ſtep a litle further you ſhal find, that the king <hi>Zedekiah</hi> durſt not iuſtifie his conference with <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ch. 38. 24.</note> as being afraid of the Princes and Prieſts: ſo that in truth he had no friends but <hi>Baruch</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> the Moore. And as it was with him, ſo it continued with all the reſt, vntill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, and then wherfore did he call them <hi>generation of Vipers?</hi> or who were thoſe <hi>hypocrites</hi> that Chriſt exprobrated, but the <hi>Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> who ſat in <hi>Moſes chaire,</hi> and at laſt condemned the Sauiour of the world to an ignominious death: ſo that it is apparant, here was nothing but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. And for <hi>viſibility,</hi> did not <hi>Eliah</hi> crie out, he was alone, and thoſe that were the true ſeruants of God, durſt not iuſtifie their profeſſion? And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, he that was the Author of all truth, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an impoſtor and deceiuer of the world.</p>
            <p>Oh marke what the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>For I thinke that God hath ſet forth vs the laſt Apoſtles, as men appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to death: for we are made a gazing-ſtocke vnto the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 9.</note> 
               <hi>world, vnto the Angels, and to men.</hi> Which place of Scripture driues vs to amaze, when we conſider the diſparitie betweene the flouriſhing Churches,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2877:3"/>
ambitious Prelacie, exalted Biſhops, and maieſticke glory of Clergie men in Europe, and the pouerty, perſecution and diſreputation of the true Church of God indeed, as either it was in the time of the Apoſtles, or muſt be (according to this propheſie) to the worlds end. Reconcile vs then (we pray you) whether the Apoſtle onely meant the preſent time, or from the Spirit of God by way of prediction had reference to after ages, yea the end of the world? but doe not come too neare our eyes to dim our ſight, or deafe our eares with the fearfull ſound of the prerogatiue of Princes, the high command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voices of authoritie, or the ſeeming flouriſhes of the orders of a Church; but plainly out of cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Scripture, rectifie our vnderſtanding in this point. For if the Apoſtles haue prophetically ſet downe, and indefinitely concluded, that this muſt be the eſtate of the true Church of God; we ſhall neuer beleeue, but that outward pomp, pride, wealth, eminencie, and the ill ſounding accent of <hi>ſupereoritie ouer their brethren,</hi> can decipher any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> and ſo muſt loue ſuch in our ſoules, as either out of <hi>Pauls</hi> humilitie content themſelues with that portion which God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted, or <hi>Dauids</hi> patience endure the <hi>Micols</hi> of the world to call them fooles.</p>

            <p>WHen <hi>Paul</hi> came to preach at Epheſus, and bring as it were the Arke of God into the Temple of <hi>Dagon,</hi> that hee might breake his necke, it is ſaid, <hi>the whole Citie was moued,</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> a ſiluer-ſmith, who got his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by making of Images, raiſed ſuch a hurliburly amongſt the people, that they would not endure any motiue for their conuerſion to Chriſtianitie, but cried out, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apoſtle afterward exclaimed vpon them, that he had fought with beaſts at Epheſus. Thus is it with all kingdomes and ſetled gouernments, though neuer ſo many thornes and thiſtles grow vp to choke the good ſeed, yet if there be a deſire to ſet a crowne of gold on the Prieſts head, and take away his rags and deformed garments, to bring ſome leprous offender to publicke view, that it may be diſcerned whether he be vnclean or no; to make the Prieſts to cleanſe the Temple of filth and pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons dung, as you reade of <hi>Hercules</hi> who let in the riuer to cary away the ordure of <hi>Angens</hi> ſtable; to ſearch the vnſwept corners of vicious mens ſoules;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2877:4"/>
and in a word to reforme the abuſes of a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; then ſhall ſome <hi>Amaſiah</hi> tell <hi>Amos, Bethel</hi> is the Kings Court, and the Kings Chappell, there is no preaching there: then ſhall ſome Prince or Lord tell <hi>Zedechiah</hi> that <hi>Ieremy</hi> weakens the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and disheartens the ſouldiers: then ſhall <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolet</hi> and the reſt affright <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when hee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts the diſcouery of foule enormities: in a word, then ſhall your great men and officers, for feare ſome charming arme of <hi>Hecate</hi> turne their inſide outward, crie out of innouation, ſedition, turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, or ſome hare-braind ſpirit.</p>
            <p>But, moſt gracious Lords, we beſeech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how worthily King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a petitioners preſumption, when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine woman kneeled before him to deliuer a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, he reiected her ſuite, and turned away in ſcorne from her: the woman amazed, yet boldly anſwered, <hi>Then ceaſe to be a King, if thou denieſt to heare thy ſubiects petitions.</hi> The King hearing her voice, but not vnderſtanding what ſhe ſaid, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe, and askt her what ſhe meant. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted woman repeated the words againe; and the magnanimous Prince, not onely pardoned her, but tooke her vp in his armes, and as you ſhall reade that <hi>Dauid</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abigail</hi> for keeping him from ſhedding of blood, ſo did King <hi>Philip</hi> bleſſe the woman for telling him his dutie, and chid all the reſt for being flatterers and paraſites.</p>
            <p>Thus doe we ſay to you, ſeeing our great and conſiderate Prince hath now condeſcended to call this high Court of Parliament to heare his ſubiects

grieuances, and redreſſe the enormities of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; either ceaſe to ſit, and come not there at all, or entertaine our petitions, and relieue our diſcontents. But becauſe we will not affright Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, as the ten explorators of the land of Canaan did, with talking of Enachims and giants, of iron walls and high towers, that is, with medling with the Church and gouernment of the Clergie, either by finding fault with the ſetled ſtate, or propoſing vnto you our maner of diſcipline, according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reformed Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Confeſſion of <hi>Auſpurgh,</hi> the Harmonie of Confeſſion, or other fearfull petitions which in the dayes of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> were preſented to the Councell; we will at this preſent contract ourſelues, and inſiſt onely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three things. 1. Firſt concerning Non-reſidents, and the ill example which the Clergie giue by their ill liues to weake and ignorant ſoules. 2. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the mixtures of Papiſtrie in your kingdome, or conniuing at the impudencie of ſuch men, that with <hi>Bels</hi> prieſts eate vp the Kings prouiſion, and make him beleeue the Dragon did it. 3. Laſt of all, not to giue eare to the <hi>Syrens</hi> incantations, but tie yourſelues cloſe to the maſt of true Religion and Chriſtian policie, that you be not ſeduced and brought within the <hi>Panthers</hi> reach, whoſe ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and perſumes intoxicateth many innocents and ignorants.</p>
            <p>Firſt concerning Non-reſidents, Formaliſts, and other abuſes of the Clergie; if it pleaſe you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the malefactor or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent in any kind, ſaued his life if he could once

take hold of the hornes of the Altar; yet when the caſe was againſt King <hi>Salomon,</hi> it could not ſerue <hi>Ioabs</hi> turne, but hee periſht immediatly: ſo is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, if you can but name the orders of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and conſtitutions of the Church, you are able to ſtop any diſputants mouth, to ſilence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Preacher; but this ſhall not ſerue your turne in any cauſe againſt the maieſtie of heauen, but the ſentence of our Sauiour ſhall be denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any hypocriticall Formaliſt vnder the Sunne, <hi>He that knowes his maſters will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> If againe he be an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, oh reade the propheſie; the flying booke came to one, and he could not open it, it was too faſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; it came to another opened, and hee could not reade it; and it came to a third, and hee could not vnderſtand it. Thus out of ignorance or wilfulneſſe you haue ſilenced many worthy ſpirituall ſtones of Gods building, and traduced thoſe that could not endure the prophane mixtures in religion, with the termes of heretiks, ſchiſmatiks and ſectaries, termes more affrighting then Iewes, Turks and Infidels: for their miſunderſtanding themſelues may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <hi>ex magno inſcitia bello,</hi> yet <hi>Coraſim</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida</hi> ſhall anſwer the matter more fearfully.</p>
            <p>But, moſt gracious Lords, notwithſtanding theſe calumniations, or the brand of malice by intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate humours; the crime of <hi>hereſie</hi> is not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to any, whoſe faith doth wholy rely vpon the ſure rocke of Gods word; they are no <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks</hi> who runne for ſhelter vnder the comfortable ſhade of the tree of the Church of God, ſuch as

the Prophets, Apoſtles, and primitiue Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, or ſuch as all the Reformed Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> take vpon them to defend: nor are they to be reputed <hi>Sectaries</hi> which embrace the truth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one and itſelfe, and ſo impregnable, that all the aſſaults of Satan ſhall not preuaile againſt it: and therefore, Right honorable Lords, we do here exhibite a petition vnto you, ſo to order the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that neither we be thus ſcandalized, nor any ſeruant of God put from his eſtate &amp; maintenance, for making a conſcience againſt ſome friuolous ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which are not things indifferent (as now is the phraſe) if you compell men to the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore to affright them with loſſe of liuing, maintenance or impriſonment, is no bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly puniſhment, nor charitable diſcipline, doe rather, as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> did by his Senator, we beſeech you.</p>
            <p>There was a Romane dwelling in the great city, named <hi>Ouidius Pollio,</hi> who determining to invite the Emperour to ſupper, made a great preparation; but in the waſhing of his chriſtall glaſſes, the ſlaue broke one of them; for which he was condemned the next day to be cut in peeces, and throwne into his fiſh-ponds. The Emperour comming to ſupper, and hearing of this moſt cruell doome for ſo triuial an offence, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded all the glaſſes to be brought into his preſence, and ſo brake them to peeces: <hi>This I doe</hi> (quoth <hi>Auguſtus) to preuent further miſchiefe which may happen vpon ſo ſlight occaſions.</hi> Wee will not apply, but leaue all to be throughly ſearched and diſcuſſed, and that for two cauſes: 1. The one,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2877:6"/>
for that wee are confident, you are able in reſpect of your ſingular knowledge in the Scriptures, and hope you are willing in reſpect of your honours and ſincere pietie toward Religion, to convince our errors by Gods word, and diſcouer our wandrings, if in any thing we be out of the way. 2. Secondly, that if you find the teſtimony &amp; confeſſion of faith of honeſt religious men agreeable with the word of truth, you will alſo agree either to convince vs by writing, or giue vs leaue to liue without oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy or infamous <hi>characters</hi> in our poore and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eſtates, or not to clog our conſciences (as we ſaid) with ceremonies and devices of men. For, what ſaid <hi>Stephen</hi> King of Poland, <hi>Princes might command the bodies and liues of their ſubiects, but not their ſoules and conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who, I pray you, are our greateſt enemies, but ſuch as liue in pomp, ſtate, glory, feaſting, with much aboundance and affluencie; ſuch as haue plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of Benefices, are reſident at none of them, and ſcarce preach once in a yeare; ſuch as are Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends in Cathedrall Churches, whoſe liuings are inordinatly ſpent vpon a number of Drones and deuouring panches, Singing-men, Organiſts, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſters, and diuers ſuperfluous officers, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might be extended toward the reliefe of poore ſchollers and the true ſeruants of God; and all this is the more lamentable, becauſe many times the place of preaching is vnſupplied, and when it is ſupplied, you ſhall finde at leaſt a dozen Miniſters walking in your moſt frequented Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing the word of God at all: to be briefe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2877:7"/>
ſuch are our enemies, as neither know what true zeale or deuotion meanes, nor once thinke vpon the propagation of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or purity of a ſincere life.</p>
            <p>Iudge, moſt gracious Lords, whether our ſoules are truly vexed or no, at the enormities and groſſe wickedneſſe of Clergie men; when amongſt you there are ſuch couetous and ambitious Preachers that retaine divers Benefices, offices and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuings in their hands, and growing rich, are able to purchaſe Lordſhips and Mannors, when yet you reade the Levites might haue no lands, nor any ſordide commutations of rents, keep princely hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and diet with ſong and minſtrelſie, their wiues and children coached in the ſtreetes, and equalling your beſt Ladies in habit and fantaſticall attire, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, friſled haire, masks, fans, bodkins, and in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vſing all thoſe faſhions for which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth <note place="margin">Iſai. 3.</note> the daughters of Zion in his time. We could name frequenting publicke aſſemblies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interludes, <hi>Ieſabels</hi> painting among the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Herodias</hi> dancing, and all other fearfull cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of temptation, wherewith the diuel beguiles the wandring ſoules of Gods people, and bringeth poore innocents vnder the captiuitie of ſinne, who with <hi>Heuah</hi> dare adventure on the apple, becauſe it was faire to the eye.</p>
            <p>We could tell you, that when Cardinall <hi>Woolſey</hi> was made <hi>Legatus alatere, Lord Chancellor of England, Archbiſhop of Yorke,</hi> and had a Bull read in publicke of all his temporall and ſpirituall liuings, there was ſuch murmuring and repining among honeſt ciuill men, that they durſt publikly preſage his downfall,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2877:7"/>
and the Courtiers themſelues were amazed at his wealth. The like was ſpoken of <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Poole.</hi> And many in thoſe dayes ſhed teares againe to thinke that ſuch as had the cure of ſoules ſhould affect other offices, dignities and temporall honors; and wee pray God there be not the like corruptions ſtill. As for the vanities of the world, yea life it ſelfe, what are they but bubbles and balls raiſed out of a little niter and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ope, as boyes in their paſtimes blow vp with their quils, and ere they be toſſed three times, they burſt of themſelues. Wee muſt ſay yet further, that there are ſuch Formaliſts, Temporiſers, flatterers, and meere paraſites, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Courtly prieſts in the times of Iſraels and Iudahs Kings, that ſundry Chaplins lie watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer Gods true Miniſters indeed, and if they preach according to their conſciences and the word of God, or be examined before hand how they meane to diſpoſe of themſelues, they ſhall be told to their faces that the text ſerueth not for the times; nor are men to be endured that dare put their rude hands vnto the raw wounds of the gouernment: but wee will be bold to ſay, that all this Courtly pomp, large reuenues, abundance of wealth, and maintaining of pleaſures, are the diuels clogs to preſſe their minds and meditation to the earth and corruptible droſſe, ſo that they cannot looke vp to heauen, nor affect ſuch things as are aboue.</p>
            <p>To end, leſt we neuer end, many of theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poriſing Clergie men are ſo curious, trim and neate in their apparel, with garters, roſes and ſhoo-ſtrings, with bootes and ſpurres, with velvet, ſattin and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2877:8"/>
caſſocks and tippets, with horſe and coach, and in a word with all worldly pomp and brauery, that except the colour, no man can diſcouer them from Knights and Gentlemen; when yet a Prophet was knowne in thoſe dayes by the habit of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; and he that reades ſhall finde that <hi>Eliahs</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther girdle, <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> nakednes, <hi>Ieremies</hi> dungeon, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> neat-heards ſtaffe, <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſts camels haire, <hi>Chriſts</hi> coate without a ſeame, <hi>Peters</hi> fiſhing net, and <hi>Pauls</hi> labouring with his hands, did far exceed the proud Prieſts miters, or the Phariſes philacteries. Here wee might adde the frequenting of publicke Theaters, vſing all maner of exerciſes, gaming, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes, wantonneſſe, and ſuch like, inſomuch that the Apoſtles, eſpecially <hi>Iude</hi> truly preſaged what maner of men they would be, and what corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould creep into the Church; yea our Sauiour Chriſt propheſied, that for theſe and other groſſe impieties, at his ſecond comming hee ſhould ſcarce find faith vpon earth. And thus much for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of your Clergie, and our expoſtulation, that you will remember <hi>Iethro's</hi> counſell to <hi>Moſes: Moreouer, prouide thou among all the people, men of</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning Papiſts, or the conniuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie at ſuperſtitious Popery, or coming ſo neare the chariot wheeles of the Strumpet, to be daſhed with the flingings of her dirt and filth; what is it but to bring in the Syrian idolatry to be mixed with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marias <note place="margin">2.

Marke, we beſeech you (moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lords) how iealous God is of his honour, and will not endure any diſobedience, eſpecially the pollutions of idolatry, which are maintained in their prophane religion and ſophiſticate diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deceits of equiuocation. When <hi>Rahel</hi> ſtole her fathers idols, ſhe made no more accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of them <note place="margin">Gen. 35.</note> then to tombe them in the ſtraw, and ſo ſat vpon them; but as ſoone as <hi>Iacob</hi> came to a reſting place, the text ſayes, he preſently cleanſed his houſe of ſuch filthineſſe and abomination: when <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 24.</note> the time for circumciſing his ſon, the Lord had like to haue kild him in the way; and when it was done, his wife <hi>Zipporah</hi> reuiled him with the name of <hi>bloody husband.</hi> Oh how angry and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed was God at <hi>Aarons</hi> calfe, inſomuch that <hi>Moſes</hi> in a great rage broke the tables of ſtone all to fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and God himſelfe would haue deſtroyed Iſrael <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> in the wilderneſſe, &amp; made a greater nation of him. And what are the idols and images of Papiſts, with their Roods and Crucifixes, and painted pictures, but Egypts calues; and <hi>Naamans</hi> going into the temple of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> which he knew was a ſin, and ſo craued mercie? Are not the Papiſts aſhamed of theſe things, when among their owne Doctors and

Schoole-men, it is doubtfull &amp; diſputable, whether <hi>Salomon</hi> was ſaued or no, by reaſon of his apoſtacie?</p>
            <p>Would it not make a mans heart to tremble to heare the fearfull epithites and characters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the holy Ghoſt hath branded Papiſtrie? and is not the Pope proued to be that Antichriſt, not one man, as the diuell would deceiue weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but <hi>the Conclaue of Cardinals,</hi> and the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rome, as it is now exalted.

            <p>What think you of <hi>Pauls</hi> inſtructions to <hi>Timothy,</hi> concerning <hi>the doctrines of diuels, ſpeaking through</hi>

               <hi>hypocriſie, hauing their conſciences burned with a hot iron, forbidding meates and mariages, and giuing heed to the ſpirit of errors to be ſeduced:</hi> ſo that you ſee there muſt be a doctrine amongſt profeſſors of Gods word, preſcribing things abominable to the truth, and it ſhall be perſpicuous to the world, and plainly reuealed, and when it is diſcouered and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2877:9"/>
made knowne, the concluſion followes, without diſtinction or exception, that it is the doctrine of the diuel: anſwer then a Gods name, you that muſt anſwer before the throne of the Lambe; is not this Papiſtrie? and who would be thus defiled? Oh marke the goodnes of God when the gueſts made excuſes, and would not come to the feaſt, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſent about into the high wayes and hedges for the poore, the blind, the halt and the lame; yea hee compelled ſome to come, that knew not what that hoſpitalitie meant; and yet for all this, when hee diſcouered a man in the bride-chamber that had not on his wedding garment, he caſt him forth, and his miniſters threw him into vtter deſolation: what then will become of Papiſts? can you conceiue that the Popes triple crowne, his veſtments embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with pearle and gold, the Cardinals bloody ſcarlet gownes, the Prieſts ſtately and pompous copes, the altar-hangings of rich arras, with all thoſe proud and pompous attires, are wedding garments fit to come into Chriſts bride-chamber? No, no. It is true humiliation and the waſhing of our ſins with his precious blood muſt make vs fit for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. What is Calamus, Benimmi, or Storax, ſays the Prophet, or a thouſand riuers of oile to make vs delicately cleane, and ſmell of perfumes, except the Lord purge and cleanſe vs, and by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his holy Spirit wipe away our leprous ſpots of iniquitie, and purifie vs by a new ſanctification, not by the Purgatory of Papiſtry, the interceſſion of Saints, the Maſſes of Prieſts, the merits of works, the Indulgences of the Pope, the trentals &amp; dirges

of cozening Friers, nor in a word the trumperies and fooleries of proceſſions and puppet playes.</p>

            <p>But, moſt gracious Lords, we will come nearer home to you, you know what letters haue paſſed from your Biſhops to inferiour Miniſters, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what and how they ſhall preach, with certaine limitation of handſome language toward the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that none of theſe fearfull <hi>characters in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> ſhall be once mentioned againſt them: you know how the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> would faine haue mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the charges of the Iudges of Aſſiſe at their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Seſſions and Aſſemblies, as if there were a full determination in the gouernment to repeale all the Statutes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> yea the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt Papiſts, Prieſts and Ieſuites. You know how audacious they haue been euen of late dayes to iuſtifie their bad diſpoſitions toward the State, and make a publicke proteſtation of their inficious wilfulneſſe, inſomuch that ſome of them dared to ſay, when we reioyced with bonfires at the Princes returne, that they were ſory to ſee ſo much wood ſpent in vain, for there would not be fagots enough left to burne the Hereticks in London.</p>
            <p>What then hath our gracious Soueraigne gotten by this partiall charitie or conniuencie at Papiſts; but at home a generall feare leſt the Diuell ſhould lay hold vpon the latch of the doore, and ſo take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of no bodies watching without; or their negligence within, and politikly enter, and then who knowes not, what a ſubtil Serpent, raging Lion and watching Dragon hee is?

reports, that hee was afraid of the Popes and Spaines mightineſſe, or durſt not truſt his owne greatneſſe againſt the factious Papiſts of England, if they ſhould vnite themſelues to any forrein Prince; when yet he hath had experience of his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, and the many deliuerances of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor that famous Queene of euerlaſting memory: for the hand of God is not ſhortned, and he hath ſtill a cloudy pillar by day, and a fiery pillar by night to conduct his Iſrael through the wilderneſſe. If there were no more to make you abhorre Papiſtrie, then the martyrdome of the Saints in Queene <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> dayes, it were ſufficient: Oh horrible crueltie to haue men and women burnt for ſaying the Lords prayer in the vulgar tongue, and inſtructing their families in the word of God.

enforcement, concerning the profit and honour of both Nations by this match, with the iocundity of the Princes in their vnion; and penſelled out the excellencies of the <hi>Infanta Maria:</hi> after, we ſay, that hee had as it were made a faction in <hi>England,</hi> and knew by name who were Hiſpaniolized, and for their priuate ends (as all temporiſers do) neglected the publicke good either of Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.

            <p>Shall we proſecute other matters? was it well done, thinke you, to compoſe that booke of <hi>Roſa Hiſpanioa,</hi> and <hi>Anglicum punicum,</hi> and expoſe it to publike view, with an idolatrous and blaſphemous frontiſpeece, Chriſt comming from heauen to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie them, when he himſelfe had curſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> if they matched with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> with pulling their haire from their heads, made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple put away their idolatrous wiues; and for the booke it ſelfe, the wiſer and iudicious ſort not onely derided it for the phraſe and fantaſticall title vnto as fantaſticall a man, but for the ſubſtance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which might be euery way, and euery one retorted againſt the other: and for the frontiſpeece, the very women in <hi>Edenborugh</hi> haue made good ſport to heare of the ieſts that haue beene contriued

vpon it. At the firſt, when a certaine man deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whom thoſe pictures did perſonate, and anſwer was made, that the one was <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the other, the Lady <hi>Maria Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine;</hi> and the third, Ieſus Chriſt come from heauen to marry them. <hi>Not too faſt,</hi> (replied the fellow) <hi>but yet I am glad that Chriſt is between them, for then ſure he wil neuer ſuffer them to ioyn together, except God giue her ſo much grace, which ſeldome happens to a Spaniard, to come out of Babilon, and not be partakers of her Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi> After this, the book lying long on their ſtalls, and the man ouen angred againe at ſuch lukewarme goſpellers and tradeſ-men, that care not by what for did meanes, and ſuperſtitious filthineſſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelues, he asked once againe what thoſe pictures meant? and they once againe anſwered, the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Princeſſe of <hi>Spaine,</hi> with Chriſt between them. <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thats impoſsible! For if Chriſt meant any ſuch matter, he would haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht it before now:</hi> and queſtionleſſe there would neuer haue been ſuch delayes, and rediculous pride amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Then followed the Princes iorney into <hi>Spaine,</hi> with rigging out a Nauy, and ſelecting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to pleaſe the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred of ſome of the principall Catholike Lordes of <hi>England,</hi> who apparrelled their followers honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and did all things befitting the dignitie of the nation; but what followed vpon <hi>Brunſwicks</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw? <hi>Spaine</hi> with <hi>Ixion</hi> boſted, he muſt lie with <hi>Iuno:</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> ſwelled ſo big, that if the tumor of pride be not pricked downe, it will

burſt with her own greatnes and preſumption, that they are not able to raiſe another <hi>Gigantomachia,</hi> and with <hi>Typhon</hi> caſt the mountaines againſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: for preſently the noble Prince found a kind of remiſnes and relaxation concerning his firſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, &amp; peraduenture being a pathick to ſome indignities, he and the Navy were all diſmiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Lady or any diſpatch of the buſineſſe: ſo that we in <hi>Scotland</hi> did wonder how ſo great and ſo wiſe a King could either be misinformed, or rely on any Temporiſer to go forward with vncertainties; and yet for all this you in <hi>England</hi> printed more books of the Princes royall entertainment in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and like childrens wormſeed it was trimmed ouer with gold and put into candid ſtuffe, that is, it had braue phraſes and oratory, with ſome things that ſauored of impoſſibilitie.
