         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou receive in this Effect of
my Obedience, one of the
higheſt Proofs I can give
You of its Greatneſs. For
when You Command but things that
tend to Your Service, the Performance
is wont to be accompanied with
a Satisfaction, that ſuffers me not to
find it <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neaſy. But I confeſs it was
not without Reluctancy, that I was
prevailed with to venture abroad
Compoſures, wherein, even when I
publiſh Them, I decline Owning them,
<pb facs="tcp:54159:3"/>
and which, (if our Names be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd)
may I fear, not only hazzard
the Reputation (if it have any)
of my Pen; but, (where You are leſs
known) bring into Question that of
Your Judgment. 'Twas eaſie for me to
repreſent to You how unfiniſhed and
unpoliſhed the Trifles you called for,
were, eſpecially conſidering that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matureneſs
of ſome of them would not
probably be the Chief thing that would
make many think they come forth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably,
ſince they avowedly Aim
at the Perſuading and Teaching men
to Improve their Thoughts, as well as
Husband their Time, at a ſeaſon, when
both thoſe Pretious Things are ſo Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
or ſo Mis-imploy'd, that the
chief uſe, which too many make of the
Former, is to deviſe wayes to get ridd
of the Later. But though to my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readineſs
to Publiſh theſe very long
neglected Papers, at the ſame time
<pb facs="tcp:54159:3"/>
when a Prae-engagement oblig'd me to
Diſpatch another Treatiſe of a quite
different Nature, I added all thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſſuading Conſiderations that I
have mentioned in the Preface to the
Reader; yet what I repreſented proved
as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>navailable, as what I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
was In-compleat. For, whilſt You
fancied that the following Reflections
(ſuch as they are) had Fewer Faults,
and were like to do More Good, than I
can preſume; Your Charity for others,
and Partiality for me, made you ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and preſſing to have me run a
Venture, which you are pleas'd to
think but a very Small One; that I
judged it more excuſable to preſent you
Green Fruit, than, by obſtinately Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
what you ſeemed almoſt to Long
for, loſe an opportunity of Evincing,
That Your Commands can Prevail, both
where thoſe of Others would have been
wholly Ineffectual, and when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb facs="tcp:54159:4"/>
me to preſent You (ſome, if not
many,) things that are ſo little worthy
of You, that perhaps they are ſcarcely
ſo, ev'n of me.</p>
            <p>Wonder not, Dear <hi>Sophronia,</hi> that
I appear ſo Sollicitous to manifeſt the
Greatneſs of my Obedience; ſince That
implyes an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rgency in your Commands,
that it highly concerns me to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of. For thoſe that, having
the Happineſs to converſe with You,
ſhall chance to caſt their Eyes upon
the following Papers, will probably
think that I ſhew as little Diſcretion in
the Addreſs, as I have ſhewn Skill in
the writing, of theſe Reflections; when
I expoſe ſuch Cenſurable Things to the
Judgment of a Perſon that has ſo pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a One, and preſent Trifles to one,
that deſerves the Nobleſt Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of (what ſhe is ſo great a Miſtreſs
of) Wit, and Eloquence. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whoſe
Account ſhe is wont to perſuade Piety
<pb facs="tcp:54159:4"/>
as Handſomly in her Diſcourſes, as ſhe
expreſſes it Exemplarily in her Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and might, if her Modeſty did leſs
confine her Pen to Excellent Letters,
both make the Wits of our Sex envy a
Writer of Hers; and keep Our Age from
envying Antiquity, for thoſe Celebrated
Ladies, who, by their Triumphant Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
Ennobled the People of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and taught their Children to Sway
thoſe Rulers of the World.</p>
            <p>But when I can plead, that not only
Your Commands, but even Your Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
ingaged me (though not to the
Addreſs, yet) to the Publication of
theſe Papers; I may reaſonably hope,
that among thoſe many conſiderable
Perſons to whom Your Attainments are
not unknown, not only my Dedication
will be Excuſed, but even my Book will
not be ſo haſtily Condemned.</p>
            <p>But I dare not proſecute ſo Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a Subject, for fear of offending Your
<pb facs="tcp:54159:5"/>
Modeſty; ſince that predominant Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
gives You ſo great an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
for all Your other Qualities, that
it is as much Your Cuſtome to look
ev'n upon Smal Praiſes as Flatteries,
as it is Your Prerogative to keep Great
ones from being ſo. And I ſhould
therefore have omitted that little it
ſelf which I have ſaid, if, on This occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
my Intereſt did not as well Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me, as the known Truth Warrant
me, ſo to Conſider Your Modeſty, as
not to be altogether Injurious to Your
other Excellencies; ſince the Reader's
knowledge of Theſe (if he be not a
ſtrnager to You) will promiſe me this
Advantage, that divers of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
themſelves will chuſe rather to
Abſolve my Writings, than Condemn
Your Judgment: and that at leaſt,
the Devout, to whom Your Practice has
afforded ſo many other Examples, will
be ſcrupulous to be more Severe to theſe
<pb facs="tcp:54159:5"/>
Papers, than a Perſon in whom, upon
the ſcore of her own Style, Severity
were more juſtifiable than in moſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
(without excepting the Eloquent
Ones) and will imitate Her, in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
that this Book pretends to
preſent them Thoughts, rather than
Words, and in Supporting, for the ſake
of the Deſign, the Manner in which it
is proſecuted.</p>
            <p>And certainly, my Lady <hi>R's.</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
is a Happineſs which divers
ſorts of Conſiderations may render as
Advantageous as Welcome to me. For
if any of theſe Thoughts, do (which
yet I can ſcarce hope) derive it from Your
Juſtice, that great meaſure of Eſteem
You do not only Merit, but Poſſeſs,
may both Aſſure them of a General
One, and much contribute to Procure it
them. But if all of them owe your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
(as I fear they do) to your
Partiality; ſince that muſt not be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Small
<pb facs="tcp:54159:6"/>
to be able to pervert ſuch a Judgment,
This it ſelf will prove an Evidence of
the Bleſſing of Your Affection; which is
a Felicity, that I know You enough to
value above all the Praiſes I can miſs
of: ſince Applauſe can make me happy
but in other Mens Opinion, but Your
Friendſhip can make me ſo in my own.
Yet, apprehend not, Siſter, That I
ſhould here endeavor, by a ſolemn Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of You, to juſtifie what I have
been ſaying: For, though to write a
Dedicatory Epiſtle, without a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
be grown of late very <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
yet ſince 'tis as much ſo, to take
the Praiſes wont to be profuſely given
in ſuch Letters for Meaſures of any
thing but the Writers Wit, I muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reſerve the Acknowledgments I
ow Your Merit and Your Favors to
ſome Occaſion, where they may not be
lyable to paſs for a Tribute paid to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
not a Debt due to You; than
<pb facs="tcp:54159:6"/>
draw a needleſs Suſpition upon the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of our Friendſhip, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to expreſs my Affection and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
in a Dedicatory Letter; and by
chuſing to Profeſs, upon an Occaſion
where Cuſtom allows men to Say what
they do not Think, ſo Great and Real a
Truth, as that of my being, far more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

with which the following Trifles come

more of that mind, than the Author is. But by way
of Apology, it may be repreſented, That moſt of the
<pb facs="tcp:54159:8"/>
following Papers, being written for my own private
Amuſement, a good deal of Negligence in them may
appear as pardonable, as a Careleſs Dreſs, when a
man intends not, nor expects, to go out of his ſtudy,
or let himſelf be ſeen. And that which I now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
being deſign'd, not to ſatisfie the Criticks, but to
gratifie the Devout, I hope it will be thought a
Venial Crime, if in <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe Meditations I
have not aim'd to expreſs Eloquence, but only to
cheriſh Piety. I ſay, in <hi>ſome,</hi> becauſe there may
be <hi>others</hi> (where a different style was thought fitter)
in whoſe Favour I would produce ſuch Suffrages, as
would not be ſlighted, if I were concern'd to do any
more for thoſe Papers, than <hi>Excuſe</hi> them.</p>
            <p>And perhaps they that ſhall take the pains to try
their skill in making Meditations, <hi>Indifferently</hi>
upon the Occurrences that ſhall happen, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no further from the Circumſtances of their
Themes, nor lard them any more with Sentences &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Paſſages borrow'd from the Fathers, or the Poets,
than in moſt of the following Papers, I have done:
will not find the Task ſo eaſie, but that they will
think it reaſonable to be Mild in their Cenſures, and
will diſcern, that in ſuch Compoſures, ſome Unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs
is ſo hard to be Avoided, that it ſhould not
be hard to be Forgiven.</p>
            <p>I know the want of Uniformity in the ſtyle of the
enſuing Reflections, may ſpeciouſly enough be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
For, not to mention that ſome of them are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long, and others very ſhort; it will be ſaid, that
ſome are written in a very Neglected, and others ev'n
in a Luxuriant ſtrain; &amp; there may (perchance) appear
betwixt ſome of them, as great an Inequality as can
eaſily be found, betwixt Compoſures that are none of
them Excellent. Beſides, that the Incoherence of
<pb facs="tcp:54159:8"/>
the Subjects, together with the differing Ways
wherein they are handled, may make them look ſo
little of kin to one another, as ſcarce to appear the
Productions of the ſame Pen. But this Uneven way
of writing will poſſibly be rather pardon'd than won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at, by thoſe that ſhall be informed.</p>
            <p>That the nature of this kind of Compoſures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
not any other than a looſe and Deſultory way
of writing.</p>
            <p>That theſe Reflections are very far from coming
abroad in the Order of Time wherein they were ſet
down: but in that Caſual order, wherein, when I was
engag'd to tack them together, I was able to light
on them among my looſe and forgotten Papers. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of which being diſcovered to have been loſt when
ſome of the rest were to be at the Preſs; I was fain,
for the compleating of the number, to inſert here and
there ſome of a much freſher date, among thoſe that
were made (as ſome know who then read them) ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or ſeventeen years ago; when my Style could
hardly be other than differing enough from what it
now is.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, That the differing Natures of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Subjects required, that the Reflections on ſome
of them ſhould be far Longer than on others; and As
my want of Leiſure, and ſometimes of Diſpos'dneſs
to write, induc'd me to make ſome of my Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
but ſhort: So I thought fit to let them paſs for
Their ſakes, to whom, for want of Time or Skill, the
Brevity of <hi>thoſe,</hi> may make them the fitter, and the
more recommend them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, what has been alledged againſt the <hi>Style'</hi>
I know it may be objected, That in ſome of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
the <hi>Subjects</hi> are very Mean, and Trivial,
and that ſuch I hemes are not Worthy the being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcanted
<pb facs="tcp:54159:9"/>
on. And indeed, if I aim'd at the Writer's
advantage, more than the Reader's, I could eaſily
have left them out, and have ſubstituted in their
places ſome others that lye by me, leſs liable to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
But I confeſs, I did not think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd,
to publiſh no Meditations, but the leaſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable
ones that I had made; and divers of thoſe
intimated in the objection, were purpoſely inſerted,
when I was prevail'd with to bundle up theſe looſe
ſticks into Faggots. For Then, deſigning this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
for the Benefit of the Generality of Devout Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
I thought it not amiſs, amongſt divers Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions
(ſuch as moſt of the <hi>II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
               </hi> and of the <hi>IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
more ſuited to thoſe Peruſers that are either of the
more intelligent ſort, or good Proficients already; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
ſome few Meditations, of more familiar ſort,
&amp; eaſier to be lighted on; to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd,
from trying to ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Occaſional Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who may chance to have either Barrenner Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's,
or more unpractis'd Pens, than even I had
then: And thoſe (perhaps) who, without ſuch eaſily
imitable Examples would not be invited to make Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
Meditations, may, by the Practice of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them, grow ſuch Proficients in the Art, as to
ſurpaſs ſome that deſpiſe ſuch humble Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
            <p>But as I ſend abroad theſe Papers without the
Authors name, that I may have the greater Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to hear other mens <hi>Opinions</hi> of them, and the
leſs Temptation to wave the complying with thoſe
that ſhall ſeem Reaſonable: ſo if I ſhall find, That
ſuch Readers as I eſteem competent Judges in an
Affair of this Nature, ſhall think that thoſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wherein I have comply'd with the weaker ſort of
Peruſers, may be better Spar'd, than Inſerted: I can
<pb facs="tcp:54159:9"/>
ſily repair that fault in the next Edition (if theſe
Trifles ſhall be thought worthy of another). In the
mean time, I preſume that thoſe devout Readers who
may be concern'd in this matter, will take it kindly
that I have for their ſakes adventur'd to treat of
Subjects too mean and barren to furniſh me with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
any thing conſiderable; ſave the Opportunity's of
manifeſting, how low I can stoop to gratifie ſuch
Perſons.</p>
            <p>I know it is a new thing, That I have ventured to
put ſome Occaſional Reflections into Dialogues. But
the Reader will be leſs ſtartled at my deviating in
this, and other things, from <hi>Biſhop Hall's</hi> way of
writing <hi>Occaſional Meditations,</hi> if I acknowledge
that not to Prepoſſeſs or Byaſs my Fancy, I purpoſely
(till of late) forbad my ſelf, the peruſing of that Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Praelates devout Reflections. Which Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being premis'd, I ſhall ſubjoyn, That when I
wrote for my own Divertiſement, I ſometimes took
Pleaſure to imagine two or three of my Friends to
be preſent with me at the Occaſion, that ſet my
thoughts on work, and to make them Diſcourſe as I
fancy'd Perſons, of their Breeding and tempers,
would talk to one another on ſuch an Occaſion. And
one of theſe, whom I call <hi>Euſebius,</hi> being a Dr. of
Divinity; two others <hi>(Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Genorio)</hi>
being Travellers and fine Gentlemen; and the fourth,
(whom I name <hi>Lindamor)</hi> being a Learned Youth,
both well Born and well Bred; I was apt to think,
that ſome of their Conferences, might be allow'd to
paſs among the other Papers; both becauſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
and Variety, are wont to be not unwelcome
things, and becauſe this way of writing allows a
Scope for diverſity of Opinions, for Debates, and
for Replies, which moſtcommonly would be Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb facs="tcp:54159:10"/>
where only a ſingle ſpeaker is introduc'd: Not to
add, that poſſibly if this way of writing ſhall be Lik'd
&amp; Practis'd, by ſome Fam'd &amp; happier Pen, that were
able to Credit and improve it; it may afford uſeful
Patterns of an Instructive and not unpleaſant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
and ſuch Reflections, being of the nature
of ſhort and Occaſional <hi>Eſſays,</hi> may afford men
the opportunitys, of ſaying the Hanſomeſt things they
know, on ſeveral Subjects, without ſaying any thing
Elſe of them, or filling above a <hi>Sheet,</hi> or perhaps
a <hi>Side</hi> of Paper at a Time. And the Liberty that
this way of introducing Speakers, allows, brings
with it a Conveniency, which 'tis more Eaſie for an
Intelligent Reader to conjecture at, than 'twere
Diſcreet for the Writer to mention expreſsly.</p>
            <p>Another Novelty will probably be taken notice
of, in the following Papers, where the ſecond and
fourth Sections, though by far the longeſt in the
whole Book, are intirely taken up, the Former only
by Meditations on Accidents relating to an <hi>Ague</hi>
that once afflicted me, and the Latter by thoſe that
occurr'd to ſome Anglers by the River ſide. But
for this Matter, I preſume, it will not be difficult to
Apologize. For having obſerved Men to be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
either openly to Object, or at leaſt tacitly to
Suſpect, That in Occaſional Meditations, that may
hold true, which is (perchance not altogether unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly)
ſaid of Epigrams, That in moſt of them the
Conceits were not Suggested by the Subjects, but
Subjects were Pretended, to which the Conceits
might be Accommodated; I thought, that to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt,
that (at least, ſome) Writers of this kind of
Compoſures need not have recourſe to the ſuſpected
Artifice; the fitteſt way I could take was, By put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together what the Accidents of my Ague, and
<pb facs="tcp:54159:10"/>
of my Angling Journy, had ſuggested to me, to
ſhew, that 'tis very Poſſible for a perſon, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not to a very pregnant Fancy, to Diſcourſe by
way of Reflection upon the ſeveral Circumstances
that ſhall happen to occurr to his Conſideration,
though one Subject ſhould require above fifteen dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Meditations; and the other above twenty.
Not to add, That 'twas rather Wearineſs and Deſign,
then want of Thoughts upon other paſſages relating
to the ſame Subjects, that kept me from increaſing
the Number of thoſe Reflections.</p>
            <p>As for the Similitudes, though ſome would make
me hope that they will be at least <hi>excus'd;</hi> and
though it were perhaps no great Vanity, for one that
do's aſſiduouſly enough converſe with the Works of
Nature and the Productions of Art, to think he has
the means of furniſhing himſelf with pretty ſtore
and variety of Compariſons; yet for all this, I am not
willing to quit my Pretenſions to a ſhare in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Effects of that common Equity which forbids to
exact too accurate a likeneſs in the making of
Compariſons, which Orators confeſs ought to be
judg'd with Indulgence, and without exacting a
Conformity in Other Attributes betwixt the things
compar'd, provided there be a competent Likeneſs in
reference to the Particular wherein the Collation or
Parallel is made.</p>
            <p>And if I have, on ſome occaſions, proſecuted the
Reſemblance through all the particularities wherein
the Parallel could be made to hold, more fully and
nicely than is uſual in ordinary Compariſons; and
if in ſo doing I may have at any time a little Strain'd
the Similitude, the better to accommodate it to
my preſent Theme, and Deſign; I have this to
repreſent, That to Diſplay Reſemblances to the full,
<pb facs="tcp:54159:11"/>
and Inſiſt on their particular Circumſtances, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
no more than the Nature of theſe Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
do's <hi>allow,</hi> if not <hi>require;</hi> and that, on ſuch
occaſions, to ſtretch the Parallel as far as it can well
be made to reach, is but a venial fault, which many
Readers are diſpos'd not only to Pardon, but to Like.
As if, in ſome Caſes, it far'd with Similitudes as
with Bows, which though they <hi>may be</hi> bent ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
as to be thereby broken or ſpoil'd; yet by being
ſtrain'd ſomewhat more than ordinarily, they acquire
a greater ſtrength, and enable the Arrow to Pierce
farther, and to make a ſmarter Impreſſion, than
elſe it would.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Protaſis</hi> (as Rhetoricians call the firſt part
of a Compariſon) may in ſome of the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
appear to be too much amplified, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly
to lengthen the Meditation. But not to urge,
that ſometimes the more conſpicuous Adjuncts of the
Subject were ſo mean and barren, that there was a
kind of neceſſity to Exaggerate, or to Exſpatiate upon
little Circumſtances to invite Attention; The
<hi>Protaſis,</hi> wherein we diſplay and conſider the minute
particularities of the Theme, being the Ground-work
of all the reſt, and it being far more eaſie to ſay Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
than Much, with equal pertinency upon a Subject;
I thought it not amiſs, to afford unpractis'd Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
the moſt aſſiſtance of Examples in ſuch Caſes,
wherein 'tis probable they will moſt need it; eſpecially
ſince he that has accuſtom'd himſelf to write Copiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly,
may eaſily Contract his Diſcourſe when he will, by
Omitting as many paſſages as he pleaſes; and 'tis
far more difficult for a Beginner to ſupply Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
than retrench Superfluities. Which are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſuch Faults, but that I remember ſome great
Maſters in the Art of Oratory, have pronounc'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy
<pb facs="tcp:54159:11"/>
to be a good Sign in a Young Writer, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it for a mark of a fruitful and exuberant Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
that, in it's Productions, there is ſomthing to be
cut off. So that if there ſhould be found any Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Expreſſions in ſome of thoſe Thoughts that were
written down, when I had not yet attain'd my <hi>19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi>
or <hi>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> year, when <hi>I</hi> might be allow'd to write not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to <hi>imploy,</hi> but ſomtimes to <hi>amuſe</hi> my ſelf; I may
hope, that the ſame Youth that was my Temptation
to write them, may prove my excuſe for having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them; as it may for leaving them Unexpung'd;
That as I deſire to invite as well young Gentlemen
as other Readers, to pen Occaſional Meditations;
So I find that ſome of the Readers I am willing to
pleaſure, do as little dislike that Luxuriant way of
writing Now, as I did Then: as Youths and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
oftentimes better reliſh Muſt than Wine.</p>
            <p>I know too, that there may be found in ſome of
thoſe <hi>Protaſes,</hi> divers paſſages, and particularly
ſome Deſcriptions (that often make a great part of
them) which to ſome Readers will not ſeem Noble
and Gawdy enough. But to ſuch Peruſers it may
be repreſented, that a <hi>ſutableneſs</hi> to the Theme, how
mean ſoever it be, <hi>may</hi> very well, as a piece of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi>
be <hi>allow'd</hi> to a Writer, and in few Caſes
more than in point of Deſcriptions; and that Theſe
being but Pictures drawn (with Words inſtead of
Colours) for the Imagination, the skilfull will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thoſe moſt, that produce in the mind, not the
Fineſt Idaeas, but the Likeſt: as a Critick in Limn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will more prize the Picture of an old meagre
Sibill, where the Wrinkles, and the ſallow skin are
drawn exactly <hi>to the Life,</hi> than a dozen ordinary
Pictures of the Spring, (which yet are wont to charm
Vulgar eyes) though the Youthfull face which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb facs="tcp:54159:12"/>
that Florid ſeaſon, have as Gawdy Colours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cheeks and Lips, as imbelliſh the Roſes and
Lillies, which compoſe the Chaplet that adorns the
Head.</p>
            <p>And poſſibly there will be found <hi>other</hi> Readers
(and thoſe too, skil'd in Rhetorick) that will accuſe
ſome other of our Meditations, as being too Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
or too Pompous, for the Themes whereunto they
are accommodated. But having laid by a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
number of thoſe lately mentioned Reflections,
wherein I aim'd chiefly at inviting and aſſiſting Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of meaner Capacity: I confeſs, that in the Other
Meditations, aiming either at my own Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or the gratifying Another ſort of Perſons, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
my ſelf to make choice of ſuch applications of
the objects I conſider'd, as I thought every body
would not ſo eaſily light on. And, provided the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
were not <hi>ſtrain'd, nor</hi> too <hi>far fetch'd,</hi> I
thought it not amiſs they ſhould be ſomewhat <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing:</hi>
that I might, by the way of Handling the
Subjects I was to treat of, ingage an Attention,
which otherwiſe I could ſcarce expect for ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſing
Themes. I know that if the Judgement
of ſome ſevere Criticks, were as Infallible as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
think it, the ſtyle of ſome of the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
would ſeem diſproportionate to ſuch mean
and trifling Subjects. I do not perhaps ignore what
Rhetoricians are wont to teach of what they call,
the <hi>three</hi> differing <hi>Characters</hi> of Writing; I have
read thoſe Diſcourſes that <hi>Cornificius</hi> propoſes as
the Patterns of the <hi>Sublime,</hi> the <hi>moderate,</hi> and the
<hi>humble</hi> way of expreſſing ones ſelf on differing Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;
and I have been taught, and willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that all Themes are not ſo well capable
of that Character which they call <hi>Sublime;</hi> and that
<pb facs="tcp:54159:12"/>
according to the Nature and Dignity of the Subjects
that one treats of, the Manner of handling them ought
to be varied. But if I were much concern'd in this
matter, I might reply, that notwithſtanding all this,
I know, That ev'n the Artiſts themſelves do not ſo
perfectly agree about the <hi>defining</hi> of theſe matters,
and the grand Rule about theſe Characters being
only, That the Laws of <hi>Decorum</hi> (or, as the <hi>French</hi>
call it <hi>Bien-ſeance)</hi> be not violated, in the Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of that Decorum, I ſee no great Reaſon to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi>
my ſelf to the Magiſterial Dictates of either
Antient or Scholaſtick Writers. For, living in
this Age, and in This part of the World, where we
are not like to have thoſe for Readers that dy'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were born, I ſee not why one may not judge
of <hi>Decorum</hi> by the Examples and Practices of thoſe
Authors of our own Times and Countries, whoſe
Writings are generally eſteemed by Judicious
Men.</p>
            <p>And certainly, in the judging of what is Decent
on particular Occaſions, we muſt as well conſider,
Who it is that is introduc'd as the Speaker, as what
it is he ſpeaks of. And though it be Improper to
do what thoſe have done, that have unadviſedly
made Shepherds and Nymphs diſcourſe like Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
or Doctors of Divinity; yet when the Writer
either ſpeaks Himſelf, or introduces any whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
as intelligent Perſons; they may be allow'd,
ev'n about things Ordinary and Mean, to talk like
themſelves, and employ Expreſſions that are neither
mean, nor ordinary. As <hi>Virgil,</hi> in his admir'd
<hi>Georgicks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It nigrum campis Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> does in ſome paſſages, where he treats of
contemptible Inſects, ſpeak of them in ſo noble &amp; lofty
a ſtrain, That when he mentions Multitudes of Ants,
one would think he were ſpeaking of an Army of
<pb facs="tcp:54159:13"/>
Moors: and when he gives an Account of Bees,
his Expreſſions about <hi>their</hi> Common Wealth would
ſcarce mis-becom the Majeſty of that of <hi>Rome.</hi> Such
paſſages do, notwithſtanding the great diſparity
of Themes, make the Style of his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> as
well Noble (if not ſtrictly Heroick) as that of his
<hi>Aeneids;</hi> and when he writes of Ants and Flies, he
does it in a Strain worthy of the ſame Pen, that ſo
loftily deſcribes the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the
Adventures of that <hi>Hero</hi> whom he would have to be
(though not immediately) the Founder of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not ſay, that ſince there is a Mode in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
as well as in Cloaths, I ſee not why the
<hi>faſhion,</hi> that now a-dayes allows our Gallants to
wear fine Laces upon Canvaſs and Buckram,
might not warrant the tricking up of ſlight ſubjects,
with the richer Ornaments of Language: nor will
I examin whether Men may not Except againſt the
Authority of ſome Jejune Writers, that taking upon
them to preſcribe the Laws of Styles, make ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their Precepts Negative, that one may ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
them indited not ſo much by Skill, as Envy,
which makes ſuch aſſuming Law-givers mistake
the Impotence of a Barren Fancy for the Skilfulneſs
of a Criticall Judgment, and (Valuing only the
Idaeas they think they can Reach) Condemn what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they deſpair to Imitate. And, from thoſe that
would be thought to cenſure the Moderns, but out
of a Veneration for the Antients, one might me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
reaſonably expect but Light Cenſures for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
upon occaſion, that noble Figure of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riok
call'd <hi>Hyperbole;</hi> ſince I ſhould be loath to
uſe it Often, with no more Reſerve than thoſe great
Orators <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Iſocrates</hi> have Sometimes done
before me. But a juſt debate of the Rules of Estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:54159:13"/>
Decency, would take up ſo much room as muſt
make it improper for this place, where all I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for, is, That though when one treats of Various
Subjects, ſomewhat Differing Styles are indeed to
be accommodated to them; yet this is to be ſo done as
ſtill to preſerve a certain Dignity in Expreſſions:
So that a Writer may be ſometimes <hi>engaged</hi> by his
Subject to uſe a Lofty Style, but without ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>obliged</hi> to employ an Abject one; though indeed
in ſome caſes he may be <hi>allowed</hi> to ſtoop below what
he is <hi>bound to,</hi> and forbear Soaring, as well as avoid
Creeping. Nor am I, for my own part much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Inſiſthere on the Subject I juſt now declin'd to
Debate. For if I miſ-remember not, <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf,
as well as ſome ſucceeding Orators, allow in divers
caſes to Shift Characters, even in the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
according to the differing Particulars that
happen to fall under conſideration: and ſome of
them add this reaſon, That hence there will ariſe
<hi>variety,</hi> which is wont to be a <hi>welcome</hi> thing.
And to apply this to the Occaſional Reflections
that may be concern'd in this Debate, I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Reader to take notice of theſe two things.
The one, that though the Thing it ſelf, which ſets
a mans thoughts a-work may be but Mean in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
regards, yet that which the Reflector pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
upon to conſider, may be of another Nature;
as though the Glo-worm, which afforded me the
<hi>I. V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> Reflection of the <hi>V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> Section, be but a
ſmall and contemptible Inſect, yet the Light which
ſhines in his Tail, and which makes the chief
Theme of the Meditation, is a noble and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Quality, and might have justified the having
many things ſaid of it, for which the <hi>Sublime</hi>
Character would have been the moſt proper. The
<pb facs="tcp:54159:14"/>
other particular I meant to point at, is, That
oftentimes, when the <hi>Protaſis,</hi> or former part of
a Reflection, is ſpent upon conſidering ſome mean
and Trivial ſubject; the <hi>Apodoſis,</hi> or Reddition,
contains ſuch an Application of what one was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of in the Subject, that the thing Point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at, may be ſome important Moral Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or perhaps ſome Theological Myſtery; and
conſequently may Require and Juſtifie, Another then
the former <hi>humble</hi> Style, and admit all the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Expreſſion and the richeſt Ornaments,
that belong to thoſe two higher Characters which
Rhetoricians call the <hi>Subtil,</hi> and the <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi>
But if I ſhould now and then deviate from
Bounds, which, not being Conſpicuous, 'tis difficult
Never to ſwerve from; I have this Peculiar Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
to make for ſuch Aberrations; That writing
for the most part of Themes wholly New, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
of by others, I must needs want the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Examples to Regulate or Authorize my
Expreſſions: about which I need not yet be very
Sollicitous, if I may truſt a Learned and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
Writer (whoſe cenſure I deſir'd) that is
both able to judge <hi>skilfully,</hi> and wont to judge
<hi>freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things I have the more carefully Inſiſted
on, becauſe I would not have thoſe Ingenious
Perſons, that may chance to caſt their Eyes on theſe
Papers, to be tempted by any imperfections of
mine, to think otherwiſe of Occaſional Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
than that though there be <hi>ſome,</hi> yet there are
not very <hi>many,</hi> of their Themes ſo Low and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
but they are capable of affording Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
of Another nature to Them, that are
dexterous in making Applications of things. And
<pb facs="tcp:54159:14"/>
I would not have ſuch diſcourag'd from hoping to
find in many Themes, that ſeem deſpicable at first
ſight, ſome Hint or other that may give thoſe that
have Wit or Eloquence, Opportunity enough to diſplay
thoſe Qualities. For as there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Such Writers, and Common ones,
ſo 'tis very material by what Pens the Subject is
treated of; and Extraordinary perſons, in Estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what they are like to perform, muſt not only
conſider the unpromiſing Nature of their Subject,
but the Activity of their own Fancy, and the Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
of their own Wit. For though the Starrs
<hi>cannot,</hi> the Luminaries <hi>can,</hi> cloath the light and
wandring vapours of the Ayr, with the colour of
Gold, and of Roſes; And the Sun, by his piercing
and improving Beams, cannot only make Diamonde
ſparkle, and Rubies flame, but by his action upon an
obſcure Cloud can make even That exhibite all thoſe
Glorious and charming Colours, for which we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Rain-Bow.</p>
            <p>And, that the following Papers may prove to
ſuch Perſons the leſſer Temptations to undervalue
and mis-judge of this kind of Compoſures; I am
firſt to advertiſe the Reader, that they are capable of
ſo much greater Variety, than the following Treatiſe
preſents, that beſides the vaſt multitudes of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
unmentioned in it, that may be added under thoſe
Heads to which the enſuing Meditations are referr'd,
there are ſeveral diſtinct <hi>ſorts</hi> or <hi>kinds</hi> of Occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Thoughts <hi>(ſuch</hi> as thoſe that are Made upon
Texts of Scripture, <hi>or</hi> Relate to leſs familiar points
of Divinity, or other Learning, <hi>or</hi> contain <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi>
Applications, &amp;c.) upon which I have, out
of haſt, and other Reaſons, purpoſely forborn
<hi>(though not to write,</hi> yet) to <hi>publiſh</hi> Reflections.
<pb facs="tcp:54159:15"/>
And in the <hi>next</hi> place, I muſt here frankly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that many of the enſuing Reflections are ſo far
from being the Beſt, that en'n no better a Pen than
Mine <hi>could</hi> make, that they are much Inferior to
divers that I <hi>have</hi> already Made; though (for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Conſiderations) I have for born to Publiſh them.
And I muſt confeſs, that I am more beholden to
my Occaſional Reflections, than they are to me. For,
whereas they have furniſh'd me with Divers of the
Thoughts, which have been the favourablyeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
by the Readers of my other Books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
I did much impoveriſh theſe Papers, that
profeſſedly contain my Occaſional Reflections, by
not only <hi>leaving,</hi> but <hi>taking</hi> out of them ſeveral
things, which were the moſt likely to have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
them; that I might accommodate other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
for which I had a greater Kindneſs or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Diſcourſe of Occaſionall Reflections,</hi>
all that I ſhall ſay of it, is, That conſidering how
early I attempted that Subject, and that I was fain
to repair, as well as I could, the unſeaſonable Miſs of
divers Papers belonging to it, when <hi>I</hi> diſpatch'd it
to the Preſs; conſidering theſe things <hi>(I</hi> ſay) <hi>I</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
not but that it will be thought, that <hi>I</hi> have not
ſaid nothing in favour of a Subject that hitherto had
ſo little ſaid to recommend it, That ev'n the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">In the latter part of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme, whereof the whole amounts not to one Page of this Preface.</note> imploying but ſome Lines, not
Pages, upon the Priſe and Utility of it, (which he
mentions but in very Generall Tearms) left me to
find out, by my own Thoughts and Experience, the
various Conſiderations, by which I have endeavoured
to Diſplay the Uſefulneſs of the <hi>way of thinking</hi> I
would invite to. Which I have further manifeſted,
by applying to that Scope, divers paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:54159:15"/>
(which the Reader muſt therefore not wonder,
if he do not now meet with) as Texts, that either by
way of Example, or upon other Accounts, belong
to what I have written about the Method of making
Occaſional Reflections.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Diſcourſe may ſeem ſomewhat In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat,
becauſe of the Omiſſion of this Way (that
is more than once mentioned in it.</p>
            <p>But though the looſe Papers, wherein that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
and divers Examples of it, are ſet down, were
lying by me, when I tack'd up thoſe that now come
abroad; yet my Occaſions eaſily prevail'd with me to
continue to ſuppreſs them. For though I did not
much ſcruple to comply with my haſt, and Avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by forbearing to ſwell a Book, whoſe Bulk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
much exceeded my Intention; becauſe, that, as
the Papers that now appear, were extorted from me;
ſo I confeſs, that I was not fond of expoſing thoſe
that <hi>I</hi> had an expedient to keep back, but that I think
it very fit to obſerve, firſt, whether the Reception that
the following Meditations will find, will make me
and others think it worth while, to have the ways
publiſhed, that <hi>I</hi> was wont to uſe in making
them.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot to <hi>intimate,</hi> That ſome urgent
Avocations having obliged me to ſend the following
Treatiſe to the Preſs without reading it over my
ſelf, I now find that my haſt will make me need an
Apology to thoſe Readers, that expect to have the
paſſages and Phraiſes of Scripture printed in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating
Letter, and quoted in the Margent.
For though in Books of Poſitive, or of Controverſial
Divinity, I confeſs I have often obſerved, a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
ſtuffed with a multitude of Citations, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
divers ſo unconcluding, if not impertinent,
<pb facs="tcp:54159:16"/>
That the Number does better ſhew the Authors
Memory than his judgment, yet in Books of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I am not much averſe from complying with
the generality of Readers, who expect to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by the Margent, where they may find thoſe
Stories, and Expreſſions, which their being bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
from an inſpir'd Book, make more Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Emphatical. But I muſt on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
further intimate, That as to thoſe Citations of
Paſsages of Scrpture wherein I may ſeeme to have
miſ-recited the VVords of the Text; though as to
ſome of them that were ſet down when I had not a
Bible or Concordance at hand, my Memory may
have deceiv'd me <hi>as to the words</hi> (which is no
more than has often happen'd to the Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the like caſe, and is a venial fault, where
Dogmatical or Pole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mical Divinity are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned)
yet oftentimes my variations from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Verſion, were made on purpoſe. For having had
the Curioſity to get my ſelf inſtructed, as well by
Jews as Chriſtians, in the Eaſtern Tongues (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Hebrew) I thought I need not ſtrictly
confine my ſelf to the words of our Tranſlators, when
ever I could render the meaning of a Text in ſuch
tearms as to me ſeemed proper or expreſſive; or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
injuring the ſence of the Hebrew or the
Greek, could better accommodate my preſence pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Now whereas ſome may think that in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
I employ Excuſes that ſeem (ſome of them) not
to agree with one another; I deſire it may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
That the Meditations they relate to, being not
only written upon differing Subjects, but (which is
more) deſigned for very differing uſes (ſome of thoſe
Diſcourſes being intended to invite the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful,
<pb facs="tcp:54159:16"/>
and Incourage the more Deſpondent ſort
of Readers; and Others, to entertain Proficients)
it was but Requiſite that I ſhould by very Differing,
(and perchance ſeemingly Repugnant) Conſiderations
give an Account of ſuch differing VVays of writing
of them, as ſuch diſtant Subjects, and my Scope,
required.</p>
            <p>But what if it ſhould fare with me Now as it
has done on other Occaſions, on which my
friends have accus'd me, of framing more Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt my ſelf, than were afterwards made
against me by my Readers? I dare not ſay it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi>
but that this may prove the caſe. But
if it do ſo, I ſhall not yet think my ſelf to have Alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
miſs'd my aim in what I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
repreſented. For I have Mentioned the more
particulars, and Diſcourſed the more largely of
them, that if they prove not needful Apologies
for my Reflections, they may prove uſeful Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
for thoſe whom I would invite to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
their Pens in ſome ſuch way of Writing: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of whom will probably be incouraged to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon making ſuch compoſures, when they find
Excuſes for divers of thoſe things that are the
moſt likely to be thought to Blemiſh ſuch Eſſays, (or
drhearten Beginners from attempting them) to be
diſawn up already to their Hands. But as for my
own particular, if I could make none of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
now inſiſted on, for the Imperfections impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to this Treatiſe; yet I ſhould not be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
of a very just Excuſe for the Publication
of it. For divers Devout Perſons, that had more
Partiallity for theſe Writings, and leſs Tenderneſs
of my Reputation, than I could have wiſhed; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
long ſollicited the Publications of thoſe they had
<pb facs="tcp:54159:17"/>
in their Hands, were at length ſo Reſolved to effect it,
that, in ſpight of the promiſes I at length made
them to comply with their deſires, when ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Writings I was then about, ſhouldbe Diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
I was fain to make uſe of a Legal Artifice to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for a while at the Stationers Hall the Publication
of divers Papers that I had not ſo much as read over.</p>
            <p>But I confeſs I take notice of theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
rather to excuſe theſe imperfections, which
Haſt may have Occaſion'd in theſe immatue Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
them to Apologize for writing on Such
a Subject. For ſo many Advantages that may accrue
to a Devout and ſkilfull Perſon, by aſſiduouſly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Occaſional Meditations, have been diſplaid
in the Diſcourſe that is premiſed to thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
that I hope the former Part of this Book will
ſufficiently Apologize, for my having written the
later: Eſpecially if to the Other particulars propos'd
in the newly nam'd Diſcourſe, as things fit to Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
that kind of Thoughts, <hi>I</hi> here be allow'd to add,
That a mans Devotion may not alone be cheriſh'd
by Occaſional Meditations, upon the Account of thoſe
which every private Chriſtian makes for Himſelf,
but by the help alſo of thoſe which he finds made
By others, or intends for them. For not only whilſt
pious Reflections <hi>are making,</hi> they are proper to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the Mind,<note place="margin">Would we but keep our whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would too rich. Bp. <hi>Hall</hi> in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme.</note> and Warm the Affections; but the
<hi>Objects</hi> upon which ſuch Meditations have been
made already, either by our ſelves or others, do Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
the Memory of thoſe good Thoughts, that were
ſuggeſted by them. So that when Diligence and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
in the Practice of our <hi>Meleteticks,</hi> ſhall
have ſupply'd us with Religious and hanſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
upon the moſt Obvious VVorks of Nature,
and the moſt Familiar Occurrences of humane Life;
<pb facs="tcp:54159:17"/>
Devout perſons will have the Advantage to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Surrounded either with Inſtructours, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers.
And when they want Skill, or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd
to extract Spiritual things out of Earthly
ones, they may, without racking their Invention, be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with good Thoughts, upon many Objects by their
Memory. For, (as I elſwhere more fully declare,)
thoſe Truths and Notions that are dreſſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d up in
apt Similitudes, pertinently appli'd, are wont to
make durable Impreſſions on that Faculty, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that though I am far from Pretending any
of the Reflections to be met with in the following
Treatiſe, to be of that Nature; yet ſuch as they
are, divers Conſiderable perſons of differing <hi>Ages</hi>
and <hi>Sexes,</hi> have been pleas'd to ſay (which is an
Advantage may richly recompence more trouble
than thoſe Writings coſt me) That they ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſee ſuch or ſuch particular Things on which I
have written Reflections, without remembring
both thoſe Thoughts, and their Author. So that
They who have ſo eaſily attainable <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hings, as
Happier Pens than Mine, in ſetting down Occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Meditation, may have the Satisfaction of
making almoſt the whole World a great<note n="*" place="margin">So they call a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Room, Arficially furniſh'd with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures or other Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of things, whereby to help the Memory,</note> 
               <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave

for the ſervice of Piety and Vertue, and
may almoſt under every Creature and Occurrence
lay an <hi>Ambuſcade</hi> againſt Sin and Idleneſs.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Indirectway of instructing men, Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a Chriſtian, or Unworthy of him. For in the
ſpiritual Warfar, where our Adverſary is <hi>the old
Serpent, Stratagems</hi> are as Lawful as Expedient,
and he that gets the victory, whether or no he
Wins Reputation by the Manner, is ſure to obtain
(a greater Recompence) Glory, by the Succeſs. A
<pb facs="tcp:54159:18"/>
Teacher is not oblig'd to imitate <hi>Alexander,</hi> who
upon a Diſputable Punctilio of Gallantry, that was
neither Wiſe, nor Charitable, refus'd to <hi>ſteal a
Victory:</hi> For the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> ſcrupled not
to Deceive <hi>David,</hi> that he might Reclaim him; and
ſurprize him into a Confeſſion of the Criminouſneſs
of his fault. And the Apoſtles being tearmed by
their Maſier, <hi>Fiſhers of Men,</hi> were warranted to
make uſe of Baits as well as Hooks, and Nets.
And our Saviour himſelf, by the Parable of the
Wicked Husbandman that uſurp'd the Vine,
drew the Phariſees to an Acknowledgment, which
they ſtarted from as ſoon as they perceived what they
had done. And the ſame Divine Teacher, did ſo
frequently imploy Fictions to teach Truths, that to
condemn Figurative and Indirect ways of conveying
ev'n Serious and Sacred matters, is to forget How
often Christ himſelf made uſe of Parables. And
I am the leſs troubled to ſee ſome Thoughts of mine,
which, though unpoliſh'd, have an natural tendency
to Inveagle men (if I may ſo ſpeak) into Piety
and Vertue, thruſt abroad into the World; Not
only becauſe I ſee no reaſon to Deſpair, that ev'n as
to the moſt Obnoxious of theſe Meditations, the
Examples they afford may make them Uſeful, when
the Things they contain, do not make them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
and Equitable, Readers will rather pitty,
than Admire to find, that an Author do's not Soar
whilſt he is Clogg'd or Depreſs'd by the Meanneſs
of his Subject: but becauſe ſome Experience ſeems
to promiſe, that their Novelty and Variety, will
procure the Book in the general, a favourable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment;
And, indeed if I had written in
a more uſual or a more ſolemn way, <hi>I</hi> ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
have had no Readers but Divines, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,
<pb facs="tcp:54159:18"/>
or Devout Perſons, or Deſpiſers of the
World, or (in a word) the Maſters, or Lovers of
that one kind of Learning, to which my Subject did
belong: But treating as I do, of Whatever chanc'd
to come in my way, and conſequently of many very Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
and Unuſual things, Curioſity will probably
invite both the Learned and the Devout; both Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and Ladyes; and, in a word, Inquiſitive
Perſons of ſeveral Kinds &amp; Conditions, to caſt their
Eyes upon theſe Reflections; which, by their Variety
and Shortneſs, will have this advantage, towards the
making them entertain'd with Patience, that ſcarce
any of them will give him that peruſes them, above
half a quarter of an hours Exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>And as I thought it not any Fault to have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to what was like to Pleaſe a good part of the
Readers <hi>I</hi> wrote for, (though it would not elſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have pleas'd me, any more than it will the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
palats of the Criticks;) So if theſe Trifles chance
to meet with half ſo kind a Reception from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
as they have had from Particular Perſons, I
ſhall not, perhaps, want the Conſolation, which may
be deriv'd from the Judgment of a great Maſter of
Wit, who ſcrupled not to affirm, That he had rather
his Entertainments ſhould pleaſe the Gueſts, than the
Cooks. Though they that would compleat the Good
Fortune of theſe Papers, may do it more effectually, by
Addicting themſelves, as conſiderable Perſons have
been of late induc'd to do) to Write Occaſional Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
(how excellent ſoever they may prove) than by
being Kind to Theſe; ſince having written them, not
to get Reputation, but Company, <hi>I</hi> cannot but be Unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to travel alone: and had rather be <hi>out-gone,</hi>
than <hi>not</hi> at all <hi>follow'd,</hi> and Surpaſs'd, than not
Imitated.</p>

diſapprove. But I am ſo far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Vanity to think, that the Trifles of
this kind, your Commands make me trouble
you with, would recommend Occaſional
Reflections to thoſe, whoſe Eyes they were
not meant for, that I think my ſelf oblig'd
to premiſe ſomething touching the Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this way of Meditating, leſt the
careleſs and unpoliſh'd Inſtances you will
I fear meet with, among thoſe I now preſent
you, ſhould diſparage and bring a Prejudice
upon Compoſures of this kind in general;
Wherefore, judging it requiſite, to premiſe
ſomething touching this way of thinking,
I ſhall forth-with apply my ſelf to that
Task: And I ſhould judge it a very natural
Diſtribution to divide the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
into two parts, the firſt of which
ſhould contain ſome Invitations to the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating
this ſort of Meditations, and the
latter ſhould offer ſomething by way of
Method, towards the better framing of
them. But leſt I ſhould at this time be
hinder'd from treating of each of them
diſtinctly, I will at preſent omit that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54159:21"/>
and indeavour in recompence ſo to
deliver the Motives I am to propoſe, that
the firſt part of the Diſcourſe may not
appear maim'd, though it be unattended by
the ſecond, and yet the Particulars that
might compoſe the ſecond, may (if it
prove convenient to mention them at this
time) be commodiouſly enough inſerted
in opportune places of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Of Inducements to this Exerciſe, I might
perhaps name many, but for order's ſake,
I ſhall comprize them in the enſuing five;
the firſt whereof will take up the preſent
Section, and the remaining four, as many
others.</p>

                  <p>ANd firſt, the way of Meditating, I
would recommend, conduces to keep
the Soul from Idleneſs, and Employments
worſe than Idleneſs; for while a Man's
thoughts are buſi'd about the preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of his Reflections, our Ghoſtly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
is diſcourag'd to attempt that Soul,
which he ſees already taken up, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is at leaſt <hi>innocent,</hi> if not <hi>good.</hi>
If I had not elſewhere diſplay'd the Evil
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54159:22"/>
and Danger of Idleneſs, and repreſented it
as a thing, which, though we ſhould admit
not to be in it ſelf a ſin, yet may eaſily
prove a greater miſchief than a very great
one, by at once tempting the Tempter to
tempt us, and expoſing the empty Soul,
like an uninhabited place, to the next Paſſion
or Temptation that takes the opportunity
to ſeize upon it: If (I ſay) I had not
elſewhere diſcours'd at large againſt Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I might here repreſent it as ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
an Enemy, that it would appear alone
a ſufficient Motive to welcome our way of
Meditation; <hi>That it baniſhes Idleneſs.</hi> He
that is vers'd in making Reflections upon
what occurs to him; He that (conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
has the works of Nature, and the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Men, and almoſt every Caſualty that
falls under his Notice, to ſet his Thoughts
on work, ſhall ſcarce want Themes to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them on: And he that can (as it
were) make the World vocal, by furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every Creature, and almoſt every occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
with a Tongue to entertain him
with, and can make the little Accidents of
his Life, and the very Flowers of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
read him Lectures of Ethicks or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;
ſuch a one, I ſay, ſhall ſcarce need
to fly to the Tavern, or a worſe place, to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54159:22"/>
get a Drawer, or a Gameſter (perhaps no
better qualifi'd) to help him to get rid of
his time, ſuch a one will rather pity, than
purſue thoſe, who think it their Priviledge
to ſpend their whole Life in Diverſions
from the main Buſineſs of it; and out of
an unskilful, and ill govern'd ſelf-love, are
come to that paſs, that they cannot endure
to be with themſelves. Such a one will not
need to frequent the company of thoſe
Gameſters, that are ſure to loſe that, which
all their winnings will never be able to buy,
or to redeem, and expoſe themſelves coldly
to as many Caſualties, as ev'n War could
threaten; and voluntarily tempt thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
it is the Task of Wiſdome to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
and a Virtue to ſuppreſs; loſing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their time, without loſing their
Patience too, and commonly a great part
of that Reverence and Submiſſion <hi>they owe
to him,</hi> of whom the Scripture tells us,<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 33.</note> that
ev'n <hi>of Lots themſelves, the whole diſpoſal is
his.</hi> Nor will he need, for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what to do when he is alone, to make
it his almoſt daily Employment, to make
impertinent Viſits, to unſanctify'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
where ſometimes he may loſe his
good Name, often his Innocence, oftner his
Zeal, and always his Time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54159:23"/>
And, as the Exerciſe, I would perſwade,
will help to keep us from Idleneſs, ſo will
it, to preſerve us from harbouring evil
Thoughts, which there is no ſuch way to
keep out of the Soul, as to keep her taken
up with good ones; as Husbandmen, to
rid a piece of rank Land of Weeds, do
often find it as effectual a Courſe to ſow it
with good Seed, as to cut them down, or
burn them up. And indeed, the Thoughts
of many a Perſon, are oftentimes ſo active,
and reſtleſs, that ſomething or other they
muſt, and will perpetually be doing; and
like unruly Souldiers, if you have not a care
to employ them well, they will employ
themſelves ill.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, when a Man hath once ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
this way of Thinking, familiar, <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi>
the ſubject of his Meditation will lead
him to Thoughts, and excite Affections,
full of Serenity, and Joy, like thoſe fair
Mornings, where the cloudleſs Beams, and
cheriſhing warmth of the Sun, inviting the
Lark to aſpire towards Heaven, make her
at once mount, and ſing; and when the
Mind is rais'd to ſuch a welcome and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
ſtate, to liſten to an ordinary Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
a Man muſt forgo his Pleaſure, as
well as violate his Duty, and in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54159:23"/>
betwixt the Imployment that buſies
him, and that whereto he is ſollicited to
ſtoop, he will eaſily diſcern, that his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
will not be the onely thing that he
would loſe by ſo diſadvantageous a Change;
And <hi>ſometimes too,</hi> whether or no the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
that buſies his Thoughts, happen
to be ſo delightful, it will however appear
to be ſo conſiderable, that it will ſeaſonably
furniſh him with that excellent Anſwer of
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to thoſe that would have diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him from building of the Temple, to
come to a Treaty with them,<note place="margin">Nehemiah 6. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>I am doing a
great Work,</hi> (and ſuch indeed is the ſerving
God, and the improving the Mind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we conſider its Importance, or its
Difficulty) <hi>ſo that I cannot come down; why
ſhould the work ceaſe, whilſt I leave it, and
come down to you?</hi> Which laſt Expreſſion
ſuits very well with the preſent caſe, ſince,
when a pious Soul is once got upon the
wing of Contemplation, ſhe muſt deſcend
and ſtoop to exchange her converſe with
Heavenly objects, for one with Earthly
vanities, and much more muſt ſhe debaſe
and degrade her ſelf, if the things ſhe is
tempted to, be Luſts, which ſhe will thence
clearly diſcern, to be as Low as the Hell
they belong to, and deſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54159:24"/>
And as theſe Objects will afford Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
enough to our Reflector, ſo will
the wholſome Inſtructions they will ſuggeſt,
incline him to ſhun thoſe ways of waſting
his time, which they enable him eaſily to
avoid: For I have obſerv'd this Difference,
betwixt Ghoſtly dangers, and ordinary ones,
that, whereas in Military hazards, thoſe
that are the moſt forward to thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into dangers, are commonly the beſt
able to ſurmount them; they on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
are wont to be the moſt fearful of
Temptations, that are the moſt reſolv'd,
and beſt qualifi'd to reſiſt them.</p>

                  <p>NOr will the Meleteticks (or way, and
kind of Meditation) I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
keep Men alone from ſuch groſs and
notorious Idleneſs, that they may be ask'd
the Queſtion, propos'd by the Houſholder
in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Matth. 20. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Why ſit ye here all the Day
idle?</hi> But this way of Thinking, may in
part keep Men from the loſs of ſuch ſmaller
parcels of Time, as though a meer Moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
would not perhaps cenſure the neglect
of them in others, yet a Devout perſon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54159:24"/>
would condemn it in himſelf: For betwixt
the more ſtated Employments, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Occurrences of humane Life, there
uſually happen to be interpos'd certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
of Time, which, though they are
wont to be neglected, as being ſingly, or
within the Compaſs of one day inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
yet in a Man's whole Life, they may
amount to no contemptible Portion of it.
Now theſe uncertain Parentheſes, (if I
may ſo call them) or Interludes, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to come between the more ſolemn
Paſſages (whether Buſineſſes, or Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
of humane Life, are wont to be loſt
by moſt Men, for want of a Value for them,
and ev'n by good Men, for want of Skill
to preſerve them: For though they do not
properly deſpiſe them, yet they neglect, or
loſe them, for want of knowing how to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
them, or what to do with them. But
as though grains of Sand and Aſhes be a
part, but of a deſpicable ſmallneſs, and
very eaſie, and liable to be ſcatter'd, and
blown away; yet the skilful Artificer, by a
vehement Fire, brings Numbers of theſe to
afford him that noble ſubſtance, Glaſs, by
whoſe help we may both ſee our ſelves,
and our Blemiſhes, lively repreſented, (as
in Looking-glaſſes) and diſcern Celeſtial
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54159:25"/>
objects, (as with Teleſcopes) and with
the Sun-beams, kindle diſpos'd Materials,
(as with Burning-glaſſes) So when theſe
little Fragments, or Parcels of Time, which,
if not carefully look'd to, would be diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
and loſt, come to be manag'd by a
skilful Contemplator, and to be improv'd
by the Celeſtial fire of Devotion, they may
be ſo order'd, as to afford us both Looking-glaſſes,
to dreſs our Souls by, and Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
to diſcover Heavenly wonders, and
Incentives to inflame our hearts with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Zeal; And ſince Gold-ſmiths and
Refiners are wont all the year long carefully
to ſave the very ſweepings of their Shops,
becauſe they may contain in them ſome Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
or Duſt of thoſe richer Metals, Gold
and Silver; I ſee not why a Chriſtian may
not be as careful, not to loſe the Fragments
and leſſer Intervals of a thing incomparably
more precious than any Metal, Time; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,
when the Improvement of them,
by our Meleteticks, may not onely redeem
ſo many Portions of our Life, but turn them
to pious Uſes, and particularly to the great
Advantage of Devotion.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, the Affairs and Cuſtoms of
the World, the Imployments of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Callings, the allowable Recreations,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54159:25"/>
that Health, or Wearineſs requires, and
the Multitude of unfore-ſeen, and ſcarce
evitable Avocations, that are wont to ſhare
our Time among them, leave us ſo little of
it, to imploy in the ſet and ſolemn Exerciſes
of Devotion, and make thoſe ſo unfrequent,
that our Hearts are in great Danger, of
being, by the Buſineſs, and Pleaſures, and
Hurry of the World, if not perverted from
Aſpiring to, at leaſt too long diverted from
Enjoying, Communion with God, and
kept too much Strangers to Him, if in the
long Intervals of our more ſolemn Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
of Devotion, we be not careful to lay
hold on the ſhort, and tranſient Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of Cheriſhing, and reviving, that
Grace in us, and do not by the Riſes given
us by the Things that occur, take occaſion
to make frequent, though but ſhort Flights
Heaven-wards, in extemporary Reflections,
ſerious Soliloquies, piercing Ejaculations,
and other mental, either Exerciſes, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of Devotion, by which means,
we may make thoſe very objects, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
that would Diſcourage, or at leaſt
Diſtract, our Minds, elevate and animate
them: As <hi>Jonathan</hi> made thoſe very things,
whereby his Enemies, the Philiſtims, ſought
to intrap, or deſtroy him, Incouragements
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54159:26"/>
to fight with them, and Omens of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over them. And as ſcarce any Time
is ſo ſhort, but that things ſo Agile, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring
as the Flames of a Devout Soul,
may take a flight to Heaven, (as <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
could find time to dart up a ſucceſsful Prayer
to the Throne of Grace, whilſt he ſtood
waiting behind the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s Chair) ſo
by theſe extemporary Reflections, as well as
by other mental Acts of Piety duely made,
a Devout Soul may not onely reſcue theſe
precious Fragments of Time, but procure
Eternity with them.</p>

                  <p>A Second Inducement to the Practice
of making Occaſional Meditations,
is, that for an Exerciſe of Devotion,
'tis very delightful, and that upon ſundry
accounts.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, Variety is a thing ſo pleaſing
to humane Nature, that there are many
things, which it, either alone, or chiefly,
recommends to us, and 'tis rarely ſeen, that
we love the ſame things very much, and
very long; and of things that elſe would
appear equally good, we uſually think that
the <hi>better,</hi> which happens to be another.
Now, a Perſon addicted to make Occaſional
Meditations, may be ſuppli'd with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
whoſe Variety is ſcarce imaginable:
For the works of Nature, and of Art, are
not the onely Objects that often preſent
themſelves to our Reflector's Conſideration;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54159:27"/>
The Revolutions of Governments, the Fates
of Kingdoms, the Riſe and Ruine of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites;
and on the other ſide, the moſt
ſlight and trivial Occurrences: And in
ſhort, all that he ſees happen from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Tranſactions, to the ſlighteſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
incident to humane affairs, may
afford matter of Contemplation to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
diſpos'd to it. The mind of Man is ſo
comprehenſive, and ſo active a faculty, that
it can force its paſſage into thoſe imaginary
ſpaces, that are beyond the outermoſt part
of the outermoſt Heaven, and can in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
return back, to conſider the ſmalleſt
Circumſtances of the meaneſt of humane
affairs; ſo that the thinking faculty, being
equally fit, and diſpos'd to reflect upon the
works of God, and the actions of Men,
how unlikely is it, that it ſhould want Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Subjects to be imploy'd on, whilſt
the whole World makes but a part of its
Object: And the ſeveral Productions of
Nature, and Art, of the Providence of God,
and the Will of Man, may be ſo many
ways conſider'd, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> be ſuppos'd ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ſions to Notions,
and Reflections, far more numberleſs than
themſelves; ſo that the moſt vigorous, and
the moſt active Soul, is in leſs danger of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54159:27"/>
wanting freſh Game, than Thoughts to
purſue ſuch endleſs Variety of it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, whereas Men are wont, for the
moſt part, when they would Study hard, to
repair to their Libraries, or to Stationers
Shops; the Occaſional Reflector has his
Library always with him, and his Books
lying always open before him, and the
World it ſelf, and the Actions of the Men
that live in it, and an almoſt infinite Variety
of other Occurrences being capable of
proving Objects of his Contemplation;
he can turn his Eyes no whither, where he
may not perceive ſomewhat or other to
ſuggeſt him a Reflection.</p>
                  <p>But, that which may much indear ſuch
Meditations, is, their ſuprizing ev'n him,
whoſe Thoughts they are: For one of the
chief accounts, upon which Wit it ſelf is
delightful, is, in very many caſes, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedneſs
of the things that pleaſe us;
that unexpectedneſs being the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Novelty, which, as I freſhly noted,
does exceedingly gratifie moſt Men's minds.
We need not in this caſe, as in moſt others,
make an uneaſie Preparation to entertain
our Inſtructors; for our Inſtructions are
ſuddenly, and as it were cut of an Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade,
ſhot into our Mind, from things whence
we never expected them, ſo that we receive
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54159:28"/>
the advantage of learning good Leſſons,
without the trouble of going to School for
them, which, to many, appears the greateſt
trouble that is to be undergone, for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſt
of Knowledge. But though theſe
Irradiations of Light, be oftentimes ſudden,
as that which we receive from flaſhes of
Lightning, yet 'tis not always upon the
ſingle account of this ſuddenneſs, that the
Inſtructions, preſented us by Occaſional
Meditations, have an unexpectedneſs; for
oftentimes, the Subject that is conſider'd,
appears not to be any thing at all of Kin
to the Notion it ſuggeſts. And there are
many of theſe Reflections, whoſe Titles,
though they name the occaſion of them,
do ſo little aſſiſt, ev'n an ingenious Reader,
to gheſs what they contain, that if you tell
him what is treated of, he will ſcarce ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
how ſuch Thoughts can be made to
have a Relation to ſuch remote Subjects;
And the Informations we receive from
many Creatures, and Occurrences, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
extremely diſtant from what, one
would conjecture to be the moſt obvious,
and natural Thoughts thoſe Themes are
fitted to preſent us, though, when the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
are throughly examin'd, and
conſider'd, the Informations appear proper
enough: Thus, when a Navigator ſuddenly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54159:28"/>
ſpies an unknown Veſſel afar off, before he
has hail'd her, he can ſcarcely, if at all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
what he ſhall learn by her, and he
may from a Ship, that he finds perhaps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome remoter coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> or the
<hi>Indies,</hi> meet with Informations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Country, and affairs; And thus
ſometimes a little Flower may point us to
the Sun, and by caſting our eyes down to
our feet, we may in the water ſee thoſe
Stars that ſhine in the Firmament or higheſt
viſible Heaven.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>AND, laſtly, the pleaſantneſs of theſe
Meditations, to him that hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
skill in making them, will, if he be
not much mortifi'd, be much increas'd by
their being <hi>Proofs,</hi> as well as Effects, of
<hi>Skill.</hi> To be able to take up Inſtructions in
Books that are repleniſhed with them, and
where they are purpoſely and diſtinctly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in the form of Inſtructions, requires
rather that a man be docile than ingenious,
but to be able to collect Moral and Spiritual
Documents out of a Book of Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,
or from a Lanſcape or a Map, is
more than every attentive conſiderer can
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54159:29"/>
do, and is that which argues ſomething
of Dexterouſneſs and Sagacity that is
not very ordinary. And ſo, from Ethical
or Theological Compoſures, to take out
Leſſons that may improve the Mind, is a
thing much inferiour to the being able to
do the like out of the Book of Nature,
where moſt Matters that are not Phyſical,
if they ſeem not to be purpoſely veil'd, are
at leaſt but darkly hinted. And me-thinks
there is ſuch a difference betwixt him that
but takes up Inſtructions in Books of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Devotion, and him that by Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional
Reflections derives them from the
Book of Nature, and the Accidents he
chances to take notice of, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
an Ant that contributes nothing either
to the Production or Improvement of the
Corn ſhe lays up and feeds on, but onely
carries away that which ſhe finds ready
form'd into its little Granary or Repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and the Induſtrious Bee, who, without
ſtealing from Flowers any thing that can
prejudice them, does not onely gather, but
improve and transform, her food, and live
on that which otherwiſe would be uſeleſs,
and beſides, not onely has the pleaſure to
gather its food from Flowers, and from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of them, but lives upon Honey, an
Aliment that is as ſweet and delicious as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54159:29"/>
nutritive. 'Twas doubtleſs a very great
pleaſure to <hi>Aeſop,</hi> that by his ingenious Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
he could, in a manner, lend Reaſon and
Speech to Lions, Foxes, Crows, and other
Animals, to whom Nature had deni'd
both; and I know not why it ſhould be leſs
delightful, by Occaſional Reflections, to
turn not onely Birds and Beaſts, but all
kinds of Creatures in the world, as well
mute and inanimate, as irrational, not onely
into Teachers of Ethicks, but oftentimes
into Doctors of Divinity, and by compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſenſeleſs Creatures to reveal Truths to
us, that they were never acquainted with
themſelves, perform really ſomething like
that, which was but pretended by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Augures and other Diviners the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

by the caſual flights of Birds, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
of the Intrals of Beaſts, to learn
the Will of Heaven. 'Tis a piece of skill, for
which Mathematicians have been deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admir'd, and which is little leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to thoſe that have it, than wonderful to
thoſe that have it not, that as if Artiſts were
able to preſcribe to the Sun and Moon, and
the reſt of the luminous Globes of Heaven,
both their pace and their ſtages, they can
make that inexhauſted Fountain of Light, at
ſo immenſe a Diſtance, by the Shadow of a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54159:30"/>
little Gnomon, fitly plac'd, give us an exact
account of all the Journeys he performs in
the Zodiack; but perhaps, 'tis neither a leſs
noble nor a leſs delightful piece of skill, to
be able, by an innocent kind of Necromancy,
to conſult the dead, and conjure up worm-eaten
Carkaſes out of their Moſſy Graves,
without fearing to hear from them ſuch
diſmal Diſcourſes as <hi>Saul</hi> had from dead
<hi>Samuel,</hi> and to make, not the Stars onely,
but all the Creatures of Nature, and the
various occurrences that can fall under our
notice, conſpire to inrich us with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
they never meant us; ſince the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the celeſtial lights are known, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and invariable; but theſe particulars
are neither to be defin'd by number, nor
limited by Rules. Not to ſay, that this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
does as much excel that other, which
recommends Aſtronomy, as Wiſdom does
Science, and is as much the more uſeful of
the two, as to know how to paſs away our
time is more profitable, than to know how
our time paſſes away.</p>
                  <p>But there is a fourth particular, which,
though ſomewhat leſs directly than the
three I have already diſcours'd of, may be
reduc'd to the Pleaſantneſs of Occaſional
Meditations; and it is, That whereas our
innate Self-love is wont to make any thing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54159:30"/>
that minds us of our faults exceedingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
and unwelcome: in the Diſcoveries
that, by this way of thinking, are made us
of what is amiſs, the uneaſineſs is very
much allai'd, and the Pill very well gilt.
For there are two main things that conduce
to the ſweetning of Reproofs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to keep men
from being offended at them; The one is,
when they come from a perſon whom we
love, and whom we believe to love us, and
to have no other deſign in diſpleaſing us
than that of ſerving us: And the other is,
That the Diſcovery that is made us of our
faults be ſweeten'd by Acknowledgments
of our having Qualities of a commendable
Nature, whence wiſe Reprovers uſually
mingle, and, as it were, brew their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
with Praiſes. Now, both theſe
pleaſing Vehicles, if I may ſo call them, and
Correctives of Reproofs, concur in thoſe
we meet with in making Occaſional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.
For, in theſe caſes, being our own
Inſtructors, and our own Conſciences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Makers of the Application, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſuſpect the Reprehenſions to come from
Perſons, that either miſtake us, or are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
againſt us; and that Truth which a
man's Conſcience applies to him, being
found out by the ſagacity of his own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
extracting from Objects that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54159:31"/>
which every Conſiderer would not have
pick'd out thence; it may very often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
that the ſame Reflection will diſcover
to a man his Excellencies, as well as make
him take notice of his faults; and that which
makes him condemn the Diſorders of his
Affections, may argue, and thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
the Goodneſs of his Parts.</p>

               <div n="3" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <p>I Know, it may be objected againſt the
pleaſantneſs of the Mental Exerciſe I
have been ſpeaking of, That to make Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
Meditations is a work too difficult
to be delightful.</p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this, I might repreſent,
That there are employments wherein their
being attended with ſomewhat of difficulty,
is ſo far from deterring us, that it recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
them: as we ſee that in Hunting
and Hawking, the toil that muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
is ſo much an indearment of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
of which it makes a great part,
that when it happens that we do not meet
with difficulties enough, we create new
ones, as when Hunts-men give the Hare
Law, (as they ſpeak) for fear of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her before they have almoſt kill'd their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54159:31"/>
Horſes, and perhaps themſelves, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her: Yet I ſhall rather chuſe to make a
more direct Anſwer, by obſerving, That the
difficulties imagin'd in the practice I am
treating of, ſeem to ariſe, not ſo much from
the nature of the thing it ſelf, as from ſome
prejudices and miſapprehenſions that are
entertain'd about it, eſpecially the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is a needleſs Scruple, which
makes ſome fancy themſelves obliged to
confine their thoughts to the ſubject that
ſet them on work. And this dwelling long
upon one Theme is to many men a thing
uneaſie and tedious enough. But for my
part, I ſee no neceſſity of ſuch a ſtrictneſs;
and I have often obſerv'd the thoughts ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully
to follow objects of a quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nature from thoſe that were firſt ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
from which, perhaps, though more
obſtinately perſued, very little inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or advantage would have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
and it not unfrequently happens,
that men trouble themſelves in vain to make
any profitable uſe of the conſiderations of
thoſe firſt objects, where the thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
licens'd to expatiate themſelves, they
do often at length pitch upon ſomewhat or
other that is inſtructive, and at which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
they aim'd at the very firſt, though
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54159:32"/>
they attain'd it but by degrees, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd
it by winding and untrac'd ways. As
when we let a Grey-hound looſe in a
Warren, we confine him not to the firſt
Rabbet he makes after, ſince we ſee it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
happens, that one ſets him a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and another proves his Quarry. Nor
do I conceive ſuch a practice diſagreeable
to the nature of Occaſional Meditations,
nor to be excluded by their name, for that
appellation may well enough be appli'd to
thoſe emergent thoughts which fortuitous
Occaſions did awaken or ſuggeſt to us, nor
is it neceſſary that our thoughts be always
calculated for the ſubject that excited them,
provided we thence took occaſion to think:
So that in ſome caſes, the Occaſion is not ſo
much the Theme of the Meditation, as the
Riſe. For my part, I am ſo little ſcrupulous
in this matter, that I would not confine Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
Meditations to Divinity it ſelf,
though that be a very comprehenſive Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but am ready to allow mens thoughts
to expatiate much further, and to make of
the Objects they contemplate not onely a
Theological and a Moral, but alſo a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
an Oeconomical, or even a Phyſical
uſe. And I doubt whether the groundleſs
Imagination, that Occaſional Reflections
ought to be confined to matters of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54159:32"/>
or, at furtheſt, of Morality, have not
much helped to keep our Meleteticks ſo
little cultivated as hitherto they have been.
And indeed there is ſo perfect an harmony,
and ſo near a kindred, betwixt Truths, that,
in many caſes, the one does either find out,
or fairly hint, or elſe illuſtrate or confirm,
the other. And 'tis no wonder that divers
of them ſhould belong to the ſame Object,
and be deduc'd from it. And if men were
ſollicitous to apply the things they take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in Occaſional Objects, to the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
or illuſtration of Oeconomical, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
or Phyſical matters, it would probably
bring ſuch kind of thoughts more into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
with ſeveral ſorts of men, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conduce to the improvement of thoſe
parts of Knowledge themſelves.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                  <p>THE other thing I propos'd to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that which diſcourages ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from the addicting themſelves to make
Occaſional Meditations, is a fancy, That to
practiſe this kind of thinking, one is oblig'd
to the trouble of writing down every Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
Reflection that employs his
thoughts; and they conclude it far eaſier to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54159:33"/>
forbear making any, than to write down
all: But, to do this, were to undertake a
task no leſs unneceſſary than tedious. Thoſe
Meditations indeed that have ſome Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in them, that fits them to inſtruct
others, ſhould for that purpoſe be kept
from periſhing, and thoſe that were not
conceiv'd without ſome extraordinary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in a man's ſelf, ſhould be carefully
perſued, as Bellows to blow or rekindle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
by reminding us of the devout
thoughts the like Objects had excited in us.
But for the reſt of our Occaſional Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
though they fill our heads, they need
not employ our hands, as having perform'd
all the ſervice that need be expected from
them within the mind already.</p>
                  <p>Nor would I have any man be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
from this way of thinking, that cannot
expreſs ſo much wit or eloquence in Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional
Meditations, as perhaps he may aſpire
to. For, beſides that much ſubtilty of wit is
not to be expected, or at leaſt exacted, in
this kind of compoſures, where we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
make uſe of things rather out of
haſte than choice, as frequently being but
the firſt thoughts we meet with, not the beſt
we have; beſides this, I ſay, that which
ought moſt to indear this ſort of Reflections
to a Chriſtian, is rather that they cheriſh
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54159:33"/>
piety, than that they expreſs wit, and help
to make the <hi>man</hi> good, whether or no they
make his <hi>style</hi> be thought ſo. 'Twere inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to nature to fancy, that the Fig-tree
derives no benefit from the Rain and Sun,
becauſe they do not make it, like other
Trees, flouriſh with Bloſſoms, more gaudy
than neceſſary, though without praevious
Buds it brings forth welcome Fruits. Not to
add, that the difficulty of framing Occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Meditations, need not be eſtimated by
that which we find when we firſt addict our
ſelves to the making of them; for practice
will by degrees ſo much leſſen that difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that after a while we ſhall find, that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
thoughts will need but ſmall invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to frequent thoſe minds where they
meet with a kind entertainment. And
though men ſhould be reduc'd to purchaſe
this habitude at the rate of a little difficulty,
I doubt not but they will find the benefit of
it, when gotten, richly to recompenſe the
trouble of acquiring it. Nor will the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
that muſt contribute to the attainment
of a reaſonable degree of skill in making
them, be half ſo troubleſome when thoſe
Exerciſes but make up the habitude, as
they will prove facil and delightful when
they flow from it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <p>THe third grand Advantage that
may be deriv'd from the cuſtom of
making Occaſional Meditations, is,
That it conduces to the exerciſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of divers of the faculties of the
mind. And this it may do upon ſeveral
accounts.</p>
                  <p>1. For, in the firſt place, it accuſtomes a
man to an attentive obſervation of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
wherewith he is converſant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there is ſcarce any thing that may not
prove the ſubject of an Occaſional Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
ſo the natural propenſity we have
to manage well the Themes we undertake
to handle, unperceivably ingages us to pry
into the ſeveral attributes and relations of the
things we conſider, to obtain the greater
plenty of particulars, for the making up
of the more full and compleat Parallel
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54159:34"/>
betwixt the things whoſe reſemblances
we would ſet forth. By which means a
man often comes to diſcover a multitnde
of particulars even in obvious things,
which, without ſuch an ingagement to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
he would never have minded,
and which common beholders take no
Notice of. And though it may ſeem, that
the habit, produced by the practice of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
meditating, ſhould accuſtom a man
to heed only ſuch Objects as are like to
ſuggeſt to him devout thoughts; yet, not to
mention now that I ſhall advertiſe you
anon, that there is no neceſſity of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
occaſional meditations, to matters
Devout, or Theological, I ſhall only
repreſent, that, ſince we know not, before
we have conſidered the particular Objects
that occurr to us, which of them will, and
which of them will not, afford us the
ſubject of an Occaſional Reflection, the
mind will, after a while, be ingag'd to a
general and habitual attention, relating to
the Objects that preſent themſelves to it.
Beſides, that though we ſhould at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our heedfulneſs to circumſtances of
only ſome few ſorts of Objects, yet the
habit, being once acquir'd, would eaſily
reach to others than thoſe that firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
it; as men, that by Learning to ſing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54159:35"/>
Anthems, are come to have critical ears,
will be able to judge, much better than
they could before, of the reſemblances and
differences of Tones in other Songs, and
will take Notice of divers particularities in
Voices, which would not be heeded by an
unpractiſed Ear: And as we have made it
appear, that the way of thinking we would
recommend, does very much diſpoſe
men to an attentive frame of mind; ſo,
that ſuch a frame or diſpoſition is a great
advantage in the whole courſe of a man's
life, will not appear improbable to him who
duly conſiders, that ſince attention, like
a magnifying glaſs, ſhews us, even in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Objects, divers particularities, undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by thoſe who want that advantage,
it muſt needs make the things he is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
with, afford the conſiderer much more
of inſtruction than they obtrude upon the
ordinary regardleſs beholder, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
this exerciſe of the mind muſt
prove a compendious way to Experience,
and make it attainable without grey-hairs;
for that, we know, conſiſts not in the
multitude of years, but of obſervations,
from Numbers and variety of which it
reſults: nor is there any reaſon, why pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſhould be peculiarly aſcrib'd to
the Aged, except a ſuppoſition that ſuch
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54159:35"/>
perſons, by having liv'd long in the
World, have had the opportunity of many
and various occurrences to ripen their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
ſo that if one man can by his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
make, as well he may in a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of time, as great a number of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as leſs heedful Perſons are wont to
do in a longer, I ſee not why ſuch a man's
Experience may not be equal to his, that
has liv'd longer; for it matters not much
whether a man make a competent Number
of Obſervations, in much time or in little,
provided he have made them well.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>II. THe Practice I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
accuſtoms a man to
make Reflections upon the things he takes
notice of, and ſo, by exerciſing, improves his
reaſoning Faculty. For, as moſt men have
much more ſtrength and Agility in the right
hand than in the left, and, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
thoſe Limbs of the body that are moſt
exercis'd, are ſtronger than the reſt of the
ſame kind, ſo the faculties of the mind are
improv'd by Exerciſe, and thoſe that we
frequently employ, grow thereby the more
vigorous and nimble. And, for my part, I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54159:36"/>
have been often inclin'd to think, that the
chief advantage that the reaſoning faculty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
from the Inſtitution received in Logick-Scholes,
comes not ſo much from the Precepts
themſelves, which are pretended to make
up an Art of reaſoning, as from the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
exerciſes that, by occaſion of ſuch
Precepts, the Students are put upon; and
perhaps, if men were oblig'd to read the
controverſies of ſubtle Wits, and to engage
in frequent Diſputations, both premeditated
and extemporary, it would add little leſs of
readineſs and acuteneſs to their wits,
though they diſputed of other matters than
ſuch as properly belong to Logick, and
were not before imbu'd with the Precepts
of that Art; as we ſee, that the uſe of ſinging
with thoſe that can ſing well, does much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
ones Voice, both as to ſtrength and
clearneſs, whatever the Tunes or Songs be
that are ſung, and how little ſoever thoſe
with whom one ſings make it their Buſineſs
to teach him the art of Muſick.</p>
                  <p>But this is only Conjecture; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be true or no, yet this I am confident
is ſo, That the bringing of a man to be a
thinking and a reflecting Perſon, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him ſo great an Advantage, as though it
were the only one may juſtly endear to him
the cuſtom of making Occaſional Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54159:36"/>
and he that could bring this practice
into the Requeſt it deſerves, would do a
greater piece of ſervice, not only to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſons he perſwades, but to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in general, than the greater part of
good men themſelves ſeem to be aware of.
For though God having been pleaſed to
make Reaſon the chief part of our Nature,
among the various Objects that daily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
to us, it can ſcarce be but that ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will in a manner obtrude ſome Notions
ev'n upon the unattentive; yet certainly, all
that has been found worthy of Mankind in
Mathematicks, Philoſophy, and other kinds
of Learning, has been attain'd by thinking
Men, or by a frequent and regular Practice
of imploying the thoughts: And leſt it
ſhould be objected, that theſe various, and
Elaborate effects of aſſiduous meditation
were the productions only of Philoſophers
or other men of ſpeculative heads; Let us
but conſider, that though Gallants and
Courtiers do ſeldom love to tire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with thinking, and are as ſeldom fond
of writing Books, not to add, fit to write
them, and though love be not the fruitfuleſt
Theme that may be pitch'd on, yet that
Paſſion, and ſome Particulars relating to it,
frequently buſying their thoughts, and being
ſeveral wayes conſider'd by them, has been
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54159:37"/>
diſplay'd and contriv'd ev'n by ſuch writers
as I have been juſt now mentioning, into
thoſe numerous Play's that daily imploy
the Stage, and thoſe Voluminous Romances
that are too often the only Books which
make up the Libraries of Gallants, and fill
the Cloſets of Lady's. He that moſt truly
called himſelf, the <hi>Truth,</hi> tells us, that the
Devil is not only a <hi>Liar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jo. 8. 44.</note> but the <hi>Father of
Lies,</hi> that is, the great Patron and Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of falſhood, and, as ſuch, he ſtudiouſly
oppoſes all uſeful Truths; not only thoſe
for which we muſt be beholden to Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but thoſe alſo which may be attain'd by
Ratiocination, and the well regulated exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of our natural Faculty's; And he were
much leſs an <hi>Adverſary</hi> and an <hi>Old Serpent</hi>
than he is, if his Enmity to God and Man,
did not juſtly make him think that ſcarce any
thing is more his intereſt than ſollicitouſly to
divert men from thinking, and diſcourage
them in it, there being few things whereby
he could more effectually oppoſe at once,
both the Glory of God and the good of
Men. And ſure, if ſo ſubtile an Adverſary
did not think it very much his Intereſt to be
ſollicitous about this matter, it could not be
that men ſhould chooſe for a Priviledge, the
laying aſide that faculty of Meditating
which is indeed ſo much their Priviledge,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54159:37"/>
that, if Experience did not convince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
I could never ſuſpect that the Non-employing
of their thoughts could be their
Choice rather than their Puniſhment, and
that rational Creatures, eſpecially profeſſing
Chriſtianity, ſhould either keep idle, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
to Employments worſe than Idleneſs;
ſo noble and improvable <hi>a Faculty,</hi> that
enables an Ingenious Man to pry into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt
Receſſes of myſterious Nature, and
diſcover there ſo much of the Wiſdom;
Power, and Goodneſs, of the Author, as
are moſt fit to give the Diſcoverer a high
and devout Veneration for thoſe Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
A <hi>Faculty,</hi> whereby an Inquiſitive Soul
may expatiate it ſelf through the whole Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity
of the Univerſe, and be her own
Teacher in a thouſand caſes, where the
Book is no leſs delightful than the Leſſons
are Inſtructive. <hi>A Faculty</hi> (to conclude)
by whoſe help the reſtleſs mind having
div'd to the lowermoſt parts of the Earth,
can thence in a trice take ſuch a Flight, that
having travers'd all the corporeal Heavens,
and ſcorn'd to ſuffer her ſelf to be confin'd
with the very Limits of the World, ſhe
roves about in the ultra-mundane ſpaces, and
conſiders how farr they reach.</p>

                  <p>III. BEſides the two already mention'd
Advantages, which the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
part of the Mind may derive from the
practice of Occaſional Reflections, I
ſhould not ſcruple to add a third, if there
were not too juſt Cauſe of apprehending,
that my Writings may diſcredit any thing
that comes propos'd of that Nature, by no
better a Pen, and that the <hi>manner</hi> of what
I am about to deliver, may diſparage the
<hi>Matter.</hi> But ſince, from the Experience ev'n
of purblind and dim-ſighted Perſons, good
Perſpectives may be, not improperly, nor
unſucceſsfully, recommended, though their
Native and peculiar Debility of Sight keep
them from being able to ſee as clear, and as
far, through ſuch Glaſſes, as other Men
can do, if themſelves can, by the uſe of
them, do far more than they could without
them. I will adventure to ſpeak of an
improvement I cannot boaſt of, leſt by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the mention of an Advantage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I cannot make it, I ſhould ſeem either
Vain, or Envious, as well as Dull. I ſhall
then take notice, that the Meleteticks we
are conſidering, may, where it finds a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54159:38"/>
and diſpos'd Subject, much improve
that nimble and acceptable Faculty of the
Mind, whereby ſome Men have a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſubtilty, in conceiving things, and
a quickneſs, and neatneſs, in expreſſing them,
all which the cuſtom of ſpeaking compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
under the name of <hi>Wit,</hi> which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and (if well manag'd) uſeful, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
the exerciſe I am diſcourſing of, may
three or four ſeveral ways promote.</p>
                  <p>For (firſt) the accuſtoming ones ſelf to
make Extemporal Reflections, and that upon
all kind of Occaſions, do's by degrees bring
the Mind to a readineſs of Conception,
which keeps a Man from being eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
by the Subject he has occaſion to
conſider, and enables him oftentimes to
ſurpriſe his Hearers; and that ſuch a kind
of ſurpriſe is one of the moſt endearing
Circumſtances of the productions of Wit,
he muſt not have much conſider'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of them, that ignores.</p>
                  <p>Next, the ſame Exerciſe inures a Man to
draw his Conceptions from the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing he ſpeaks of, which, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe that can judge of Wit, is held
a far greater ſign of it, than the ſaying
things more ſpecious, and elaborate, that
appear to be Antienter than the Occaſion,
as is uſual in Epigrams, and other ſolemn
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54159:39"/>
premeditated pieces of Wit, where often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Thoughts were not made for the
Themes, but before them: Whereas, the
ſuddenneſs of a good Occaſional Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and its congruity to that which gave
it Riſe, perſuades the Hearers, that the
Speaker's Wit is of its own growth, and is
rather ſuggeſted <hi>by</hi> the Occaſion, than barely
applied <hi>to</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>A third way, whereby our Meleteticks
may conduce to Wit, is, by bringing thoſe
that uſe to write their Thoughts, to what
may be call'd a certain <hi>Suppleneſs of Style;</hi>
for when a Man treats of familiar, or of
ſolemn Subjects, he is ſo much aſſiſted by
the received phraſes and manners of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that are wont to be imploi'd about
them, that being ſeldome at a loſs for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
expreſſions, his Wit is ſeldome
diſtreſs'd how to furniſh him with words
fit for his turn. But the Subjects that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
Occaſional Reflections, are ſo various,
and uncommon, and oftentimes ſo odd, that,
to accommodate ones Diſcourſe to them,
the vulgar and receiv'd forms of Speech
will afford him but little aſſiſtance, and to
come off any thing well, he muſt exerciſe
his Invention, and put it upon coining vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and new Expreſſions, to ſute that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of unfamiliar Subjects, and of Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54159:39"/>
that the Objects of his Meditation
will engage him to write of: And by this
difficult exerciſe of his Inventive faculty,
he may by degrees ſo improve it, and, after
a while, attain to ſo pliant a Style, that ſcarce
any Thought will puzzle him to fit words
to it, and he will be able to cut out Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
and make them ſit cloſe to ſuch
Subjects, as a Perſon unaccuſtom'd to ſuch
kind of Compoſures, would find it very
difficult to write of, with any thing of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                  <p>IT remains, that I mention one way more,
and that a conſiderable one, whereby
the practice of Occaſional Reflections may
contribute to the Improvement of Wit;
and that is, by ſupplying Men with ſtore and
variety of good Compariſons.</p>
                  <p>How great, and how acceptable, a part of
Wit that is, which has the advantage to be
expreſs'd by apt Similitudes, every Man's
own experience, if he pleaſe to conſult it,
may, in ſome meaſure, inform him. And
certainly, there is no one part of Wit that
is ſo generally applicable to all kind of
Perſons; for good Compariſons ſerve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54159:40"/>
to illuſtrate, and to perſuade; the
greateſt Wits diſdain them not, and ev'n
ordinary Wits are capable to underſtand
them, and to be affected by them; and if a
Sermon, or a long Diſcourſe, be enrich'd
with one apt Compariſon, what part ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
elſe be forgotten, that will be ſure to
be remembred. And, a but plauſible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
dreſs'd up in fine Similitudes, ſhall
be more praevalent among the generality
of Men, than a Demonſtration propos'd in
a naked Syllogiſm; and therefore, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Sages</hi> did ſo much chuſe to imploy a
Figurative way of delivering their Thoughts,
that when they could not furniſh themſelves
with Reſemblances fit for their turns, they
would deviſe Parables, and Apologues, to
recommend what they ſaid to the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and memory of thoſe they would
work upon. And thoſe famous Orators,
who, though they Liv'd in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
did, by their Eloquence, exerciſe
a more than Monarchical Government
there, and who, by their inchanting Tongues,
rul'd thoſe Warlick people, whoſe Swords
had made them Maſters of the World;
thoſe imperial Wits, I ſay, whoſe Oratory
perform'd ſuch Wonders, performed them
chiefly by the help of their happy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons,
which alone contributed more to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54159:40"/>
their ſucceſs, than almoſt all the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive
Figures of their Triumphant Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick:
Lucky Compariſons being indeed
thoſe parts of Wit, that as well make the
ſtrongeſt Impreſſions upon the Mind, as they
leave the deepeſt on the Memory. Now,
as the being furniſh'd with apt Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
do's ſo very much conduce to the
making a Man's Diſcourſes and Writings
appear Witty, ſo there is ſcarce any thing
more fit and likely to ſupply a Man with
ſtore and variety of Compariſons, than the
Cuſtom of making Occaſional Meditations:
For he that uſes himſelf to take notice of
the properties and circumſtances of moſt
things that Occur to him, and to reflect on
many of them, and thereby obſerves the
relations of things to one another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
diſcerns, how the properties or
circumſtances of one may be accommodated,
by way of Reſemblance or Diſſimilitude, to
ſomewhat that relates to the other, will
often find, beſides thoſe things which afford
him his Occaſional Reflection, divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which, though leſs fit for the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that invited his taking notice of them,
may be very fitly applicable to other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and purpoſes, and will eaſily furniſh
him with Reſemblances, wherewith he may,
if he pleaſes, much increaſe the Books of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54159:41"/>
Similitudes, already extant: And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons
that may be this way lighted on,
may ſometimes prove ſtrange, and unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
enough, to be ſurpriſing ev'n to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as well as to his Auditors, or his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

               <div n="5" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                  <p>BUt, beſides thoſe Similitudes, we may
be furniſh'd with, by the things we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
without turning them into Occaſional
Meditations, we may find in thoſe very
Subjects, whereon we <hi>do</hi> make Reflections,
Circumſtances, that, though improper, or
at leaſt unneceſſary, to be taken into the
Occaſional Meditation, may be very fitly
accommodateD to other things, and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
contribute to the ſtore and variety of
Compariſons we lately mention'd; this
muſt appear ſo much a Truth, to any that
is exercis'd in making Occaſional Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that I ſhould perhaps forbear to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
it, by any particular example, but
that this part of my Diſcourſe recalls into
my Mind ſome Thoughts that were ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
to me, by one of the laſt Occaſions
I had, to make Reflections of this Nature.
I ſhall add then, that being all alone, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54159:41"/>
diverted a pretty while by a ſudden ſtorm
of Thunder, Lightning, Wind, and Rain,
from the imployments I had deſign'd my
ſelf to, I had the unwelcome leiſure to
make ſome Reflections upon the rude Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that obtruded themſelves upon my
Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>And the chief thing that preſented it ſelf
to my Thoughts, was, a reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Prophane or Atheiſtical wits, and the
black Clouds that then over-caſt the Sky:
For, as thoſe Clouds are rais'd to an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
Station, and do afford flaſhes of
Light; ſo theſe Irreligious wits are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
conſpicuous enough, and may bring
forth Notions that are ſurpriſing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive;
but as the ſame Clouds, whil'ſt
they give us but their own momentany
Light, obſcure (by darkning the Sky) and
hinder us, as much as they can, from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that of the Sun, which reaches further,
and is many other ways preferrable to
vaniſhing Coruſcations; ſo theſe Wits,
whil'ſt they ſeem to enlighten thoſe they
dazle, with their own new Opinions, do
really deprive them of the true Heavenly
Light, that would elſe ſhine forth to them
in the revealed Word of God: And as
the Light that we do receive from the
Clouds, may dazle and aſtoniſh us, but is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54159:42"/>
not ſufficient for us to Travel by; ſo the
admir'd reaſoning of theſe Sophiſters may
ſurpriſe and amaze us, but will never prove
ſufficient to be, like the Scripture, a conſtant
<hi>Lamp unto our feet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 105.</note> 
                     <hi>and Light unto our paths.</hi>
And as the Light afforded by ſuch Clouds,
is not onely wont to be attended with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting
Thunder, and hurtful Storms, but
burns, and deſtroys, or at leaſt ſcorches,
and blacks, where it paſſes, and oftentimes
falls upon Churches, Hoſpitals, Colledges,
and brings ſuch frights and ruins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it comes, that 'twere a great deal
better Men wanted the Light of ſuch
flaſhes, than that they ſhould be expos'd to
ſuch inconveniencies by them: So the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
and irregular Wits, I am ſpeaking
of, do not onely make an unwelcome Noiſe
in the World, but do oftentimes ſo deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
the Reputation of them that oppoſe
them, and bear ſo little reſpect ev'n to
things ſacred, or uſeful to Mankind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſparing the Church or Seminaries of
Learning, if either come in their way, that
they do far more Miſchiefs by their errors,
or their practices, than the little Inſtruction
they give us, is able to make amends for.</p>
                  <p>This, if I forget not, was the ſubſtance
of the Occaſional Meditation, ſuggeſted
to me by the Storm; but, beſides that, there
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54159:42"/>
are in this ſome particulars, which are not
neceſſary to the Meditation it ſelf, and may
be fitly enough accommodated, by way of
Compariſons, to other Occaſions. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
the ſame Subject (the Storm)
had other Circumſtances in it, fit to afford
Similitudes, applicable to other Subjects,
and ſome of them unobvious enough: For
inſtance, 'tis not eaſie to find ſo illuſtrious
a Compariſon, to ſet forth, how the moſt
contrary Qualities may proceed from the
ſame Subjects, as that which we may be
ſuppli'd with, by conſidering, that, from the
ſame Clouds, we derive both Light and
Darkneſs; and a noble Compariſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries,
conjoyn'd in one Subject, may be
borrow'd from the ſame Clouds, which
afford us Lightning, and Rain, ſhew, that
they contain in them two of the eminenteſt
and ſeldomeſt conſiſtent contraries of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Fire and Water. And another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
may be deriv'd from the differing
productions of theſe Clouds, to illuſtrate
thoſe things which do at once both much
good, and much miſchief, or ſometimes the
one, and ſometimes the other: For the
ſame Clouds both produce the Thunder,
and the Lightning, and thereby blaſt Trees,
kill Men and Beaſts, fire Houſes, and ruine
the nobleſt Buildings, without ſparing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54159:43"/>
Churches themſelves; and, on the other
ſide, plentifully afford us thoſe refreſhing
and fertilizing Showers, that correct the
heat of the ſultry Air, and cure the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the parched Earth. And one that is
skill'd in framing Compariſons out of Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes,
and exercis'd in the other ways
of turning and winding of Simile's, may
eaſily enough find, in the Subject we have
been conſidering, Circumſtances capable of
being conveniently enough accommodated
to more ſubjects and purpoſes, than I have
leiſure now to take notice of. And ſince,
as the being able to find the latent reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
betwixt things ſeemingly unlike,
make up a great part of what we are wont
to call <hi>Wit;</hi> ſo the being able to diſcern the
unobvious diſparities of things manifeſtly
reſembling, is one of the chief things that
diſplays the Faculty, Men call Judgment;
and ſince both theſe are very much aſſiſted
by the Cuſtom of making Reflections,
wherein we muſt take notice of the ſeveral
properties, wherein things either are alike,
or diſagree; Me-thinks it ſhould not a little
manifeſt the uſefulneſs of our Meleteticks
towards the improvement of Men's parts,
that they not onely inſtruct the more ſerious
faculty of the Soul, but ſharpen the more
ſubtile.</p>

                  <p>IV. BUt the Practice I have all this

not onely diſpoſe us to Attention, in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the things that occur to us, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
us to reflect on them ſeriouſly, and
expreſs them fitly, but do's alſo, though
inſenſibly, ſuggeſt to us Ways and Methods,
whereby to make the Objects we conſider
informative to us.</p>
                  <p>For by Example, Analogy, or ſome of
thoſe other ways which we may be invited,
on another occaſion, to inſiſt on, we are, as
it were, led by the hand to the diſcovery of
divers uſeful Notions, eſpecially Practical,
which elſe we ſhould not take any notice
of. And indeed, the VVorld is the great
Book, not ſo much of Nature, as of the
God of Nature, which we ſhould find ev'n
crowded with inſtructive Leſſons, if we
had but the Skill, and would take the Pains,
to extract and pick them out: The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are the true Aegyptian Hieroglyphicks,
that under the rude forms of Birds, and
Beaſts, &amp;c. conceal the myſterious ſecrets
of Knowledge, and of Piety. And as
Chymiſts boaſt of their Elixir, that 'twill
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54159:44"/>
turn the ignobleſt Metals into Gold; ſo
Wiſdome makes all Objects, on which it
operates, inrich the Poſſeſſor with uſeful
and precious Thoughts: And ſince, ev'n the
illiterate Husbandman can, with the moſt
abject Dung it ſelf, give a flouriſhing growth
to the moſt uſeful Grains, to Medicinable
herbs, and ev'n to fragrant Flowers; why
may not a wiſe Man, by the meaneſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and ſlighted'ſt Object, give a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Improvement to the nobleſt Faculties
of the Soul, and the moſt lovely Qualities
of the Mind?</p>
                  <p>But the particular Method of deriving
Inſtruction from the Subjects we conſider,
will be more fit to be particularly inſiſted
on, when we ſhall have more time, or ſome

making Occaſional Meditations, and ſhew,
how they may be fetch'd from <hi>Example,

to the <hi>Intellectual Faculties.</hi> We will now

Theſe advantages being not onely

upon whoſe account I have been engag'd in
the preſent Undertaking.</p>
                  <p>V. The laſt therefore and greateſt Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
I ſhall take notice of, in the practice I
would invite you to, is, That it awakens
good thoughts, and excites good motions, in
the Will and Affections. For ſince we have
already manifeſted, that it is wont to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
variety of Notions to the Meditator,
and ſuch as are uſually accompani'd with
delight: This friendly property to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I now aſcribe to our Melecticks,
is a very eaſie and genuine off-ſpring of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54159:45"/>
the marriage of the two others: The Beams
of Knowledge, acquired by ſuch Reflections,
having in them, like thoſe of the Sun, not
onely Light but Heat. And indeed it were
ſomewhat ſtrange, as well as ſad, if a perſon
diſpoſed and accuſtomed to obſerve and
conſider, converſing with ſuch inſtructive
Books as thoſe of God's Creatures and his
Providence, with an intention to take out
practical Leſſons, ſhould not find them.
For amid'ſt that rich variety of Objects
that in differing manners proffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to his conſideration, and ſuggeſt to
him a great diverſity of Reflections, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reaſonably be imagin'd that he ſhould
not find ſubjects or circumſtances, that are
proper, <hi>either</hi> to afford him Examples to
imitate, <hi>or</hi> ſhew him the Danger, <hi>or</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomeneſs,
<hi>or</hi> Inconvenience of ſome
thing that he ſhould avoid, <hi>or</hi> raiſe his
thoughts and affections Heaven-wards, <hi>or</hi>
furniſh him with ſome new practical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
<hi>or</hi> ſhew him ſome known Truth
in a varied and delightful dreſs, <hi>or</hi> (at
leaſt) recal ſome Notions his frailty makes
him need to be put in mind of, <hi>or,</hi> in a
word, either refreſh his memory, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
cheriſh his Devotion. Let us ſuppoſe
a perſon, who being qualifi'd and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to reflect upon various objects that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54159:45"/>
occur to him, mainly deſigns, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of that faculty, the warming of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and the improvement of his Piety,
and we ſhall ſcarce doubt, but when he
looks about him in the world, he will find
it, what one of the Fathers loftily ſtyled it,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
(a Schole for Rational Souls to
learn the knowledge of God.) There is
ſcarce any thing that Nature has made, or
that men do or ſuffer, though the Theme
ſeem never ſo low and ſlight, whence the
devout Reflector cannot take an occaſion of
an aſpiring Meditation; as in a hopeful
morning the humble Lark can, from the
loweſt furrow in the field, take a ſoaring
flight towards Heaven, and aſcend thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with a melody that delights both her
ſelf and her hearers. If ſuch a perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
how amongſt ſuch an admirable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
and ſuch odd Antipathies of the
numberleſs Creatures that compoſe the

himſelf powerfully engag'd to relie on the

If he take notice that the World is but our

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54159:46"/>
them, for the neceſſities, nay, for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
of rebellious and unthankful Man, he

                  <p>ANd ſince our Diſcourſe has led us to
the mention of a Text, where the
truly inſpired Poet (who, by his omitting to
ſpeak of the Sun, ſeems to have compos'd
this Pſalm in the night) makes the Moon the
chief ſubject of his Meditation, it will not
perhaps be amiſs, if, on this occaſion, we add
a few ſhort Reflections on the ſame Theme,
and thereby confirm what we lately noted
about the differing Reflections, and Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
which may be afforded by the ſame
ſubject, as its ſeveral Attributes may be
differingly conſider'd.</p>
                  <p>If then, in the firſt place, when our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templator
takes notice of the greateſt
Brightneſs of the Moon, he remembers too,
that 'tis when ſhe is at the Full, that ſhe is
ſubject to be Eclips'd, it would put him in
mind of the mutability of humane things,
and that oftentimes Proſperity proves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the more ſecure for appearing the more
full and reſplendent.</p>
                  <p>Next, our Reflector may find in the
Moon, a lively Emblem of a true Miniſter
of the Goſpel. For, as the Moon commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
to the Earth, the Light, and that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54159:47"/>
onely, which ſhe receives from the Sun; ſo
the Apoſtles, and firſt Preachers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
and (in their meaſure) their true
Succeſſors, communicate to Mankind, the
Light, which themſelves have receiv'd
from the bright <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs.</hi> And
the Similitude may be advanc'd, by adding,
that as the Moon ſhines not on the Earth,
with any other Beams, than thoſe ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
from that fountain of Light, the Sun;
ſo the true Preachers of the Heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
mingle not their own Inventions,
or humane Traditions, with that pure and
ſincere Light of Revelation, they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploi'd
to diſpenſe; it being ſafeſt, and moſt
deſirable, for the Church, that Chriſtians
ſhould receive the Bread of Life, as the
Jews are recorded to have receiv'd the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Bread,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> in a paſſage of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s
Goſpel, where 'tis ſaid, that Chriſt firſt
brake, and gave to the Diſciples, the Bread,
which they afterwards, from Him, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the People; ſo that they might
each of them, in a literal ſence, imploy that
expreſſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>I have received of the
Lord, that which I delivered unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as though the Moon be deſtitute of
native light, yet by vertue of that borrow'd
one, which ſhe plentifully receives from
the Sun, ſhe affords more to Men than any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54159:48"/>
of the Stars, which, upon the ſcore of their
vaſt diſtance from the Sun, are, by modern
Naturaliſts, ſuppos'd to ſhine by their own
Light, ſo thoſe illiterate Fiſher-men, whom
the Sun of Righteouſneſs call'd, and made
the Light of the world, did, by vertue of
the copious Irradiations he vouchſaf'd
them, diffuſe far more Light to mankind,
than the greateſt Philoſophers, that, being
unaſſiſted by Divine Revelation, had onely
their own native beams to ſhine with.</p>
                  <p>And as oftentimes the ſame Subject, but
variouſly conſider'd, may afford both ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
fit to be ſhunn'd, and ſomewhat fit to
be imitated; ſo, in that which we ſuppoſe
our Reflector now conſidering, he may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
diſcern the Emblem of an ungrateful
perſon: For as the Moon, though ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all the Light that ennobles her from
the Sun, does yet, when ſhe is admitted to
the neareſt Conjunction with him, eclipſe
that bright Planet, to which ſhe owes all
her ſplendour; ſo unthankful men abuſe
thoſe very favours that ſhould endear to
them their Benefactors, to the prejudice of
thoſe that oblige them.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis like that our Reflector may, by
the way, take notice, That as what paſſes
betwixt the Moon and the Sun, does thus
afford him a Simile, whereby to ſet forth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54159:48"/>
Ingratitude; ſo what paſſes betwixt the
Moon and the Sea, may ſupply him with an
example of the contrary quality, and put
him in mind, that a thankful man will be
true and obſequious to his Benefactor,
though the perſon that oblig'd him have loſt
that Proſperity that before made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous,
and attracted vulgar eyes, as the
Sea follows the courſe of the Moon, not
onely when ſhe ſhines upon it with her
full Light, but when at the Change ſhe
can communicate little or no light to it.</p>
                  <p>To the two above-mentioned Attributes,
upon whoſe account the Moon afforded a
compariſon for humane Proſperity, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
for Preachers of the Goſpel, we will
now add, That ſhe may afford us a Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to ſet forth a liberal Perſon by: For as
the Moon freely communicates to the
Earth, the Light ſhe receives from the Sun,
ſo the bountiful perſon imparts to indigent
men the Largeſſes he receives, from the
exuberant goodneſs of God. And as to
Intellectual Communications the Parallel
will hold further, ſince as the Moon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
not the leſs of Light, for her imparting
ſo much to the Earth; ſo in Mental Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
Liberality does not impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
and thoſe excellent gifts ceaſe not to
be poſſeſs'd, by being imparted. And 'tis
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54159:49"/>
very poſſible, (to add that upon the By)
That after the light of the Moon has (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what I lately noted) repreſented to
our Contemplator the qualifications of a
Preacher, it may alſo put him in mind of
the Duty of a Hearer. For, as it were very
fooliſh in us, and unthankful towards the
Father of Lights, not to make uſe of the
great Light we receive from the Sun, by
the Moon, or not to acknowledge the Moon
to be a very uſeful Creature, upon the
ſcore of that Light, wherewith ſhe ſhines
upon the Earth, though, in her, that Light
be deſtitute of Heat; ſo it were unwiſe and
ungrateful for Hearers to refuſe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or to be guided by, the conſpicuous
Endowments of Learning and Eloquence,
that God vouchſafes to great Scholars,
though they themſelves were but illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
not warmed, by the Beams they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect.
But therefore, as Oyſters, and other
Shell-fiſh, are obſerv'd to thrive at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of the Moon, though her Light be
unattended with Heat, and though even
when ſhe is at Full, ſhe wants not her ſpots,
ſo devout Hearers will be careful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
proportionably to the Inſtructions they
receive even from thoſe Preachers, whoſe
Illuminations are unaccompani'd with Zeal
and Charity, and who, when they ſhine
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54159:49"/>
with the greateſt Luſtre, are not free from
their Darkneſſes, as to ſome Points, or
from notorious Blemiſhes.</p>
                  <p>And as the Moon may thus furniſh our
Contemplator with Similitudes, to ſet forth
both a Vertue and a Vice of the Mind, ſo
may it ſupply him with an Emblem of its
Condition: For as the Light of the Moon
is ſometimes Increaſing, and ſometimes in
the Wane, and not onely is ſometimes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
Eclips'd, but even when ſhe is at the
Full, is never free from dark Spots; ſo the
mind of Man, nay, even of a Chriſtian, is
but partly enlighten'd, and partly in the
dark, and is ſometimes more, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
leſs, Illuſtrated by the Beams of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Light, and Joy, and not alone now
and then quite Eclipſed by diſconſolate
Deſertions, but even when it receives the
moſt Light, and ſhines the brighteſt, knows
but in part, and is in part blemiſh'd by
its native Darkneſſes, and Imperfections.
And theſe Reſemblances are not ſo appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to the mind of Man, but that they
might eaſily be ſhewn to be applicable to
his condition, in point of outward Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Adverſity. And to theſe Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
other Reflections on the ſeveral
Adjuncts of the Moon might be alſo added,
together with ſeveral Examples of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54159:50"/>
on other Subjects, were it not that I
think my ſelf to have ſpent time enough
already upon a Theme, that fell but inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
under my conſideration; and were
it not alſo, that the Reflections which might
here be annex'd upon the Attributes of other
Objects, may be more properly ſubjoyn'd
to what may be on another occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
you, by way of Illuſtration of ſome
Particulars, that belong to the fourth part
of the precedent Section, in which my haſte,
and ſome other reaſons, made me content
my ſelf, to give ſome few general Hints
about ſuch Reflections, and an Intimation
of the Topicks whence I am wont to fetch
them.</p>

                  <p>ANd having given you this Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>en paſſant,</hi> we may now proceed
a little further, and add, that if we ſuppoſe
our Contemplator's thoughts to deſcend
from Heaven to Earth, the far greater mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and variety of Objects, they will
meet with here below, will ſuggeſt to them
much more numerous Reflections. But
becauſe ſo ſpacious a Field for Meditation
as the whole Earth, would afford us too
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54159:50"/>
vaſt a Theme to be attempted on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
we will confine our Contemplator
to his Garden, or rather to any one of the
Trees of it, and take notice, not of all the
Meditations he might fetch thence, but onely
of four or five of the conſiderableſt of thoſe,
that the viewing it, may, as he walks by at
ſeveral times, ſupply him with.</p>
                  <p>In then, in the Spring of the Year, our
Reflector ſee the Gardener pruning a Fruit-tree,
we may ſuppoſe him invited by that
Object, to reaſon thus within himſelf:
Though one that were a Stranger to the
Art of Gardening, would think, that that
Man is an Enemy to this Tree, and goes
about to deſtroy it, ſince he falls upon and
wounds it, with a ſharp Iron, and ſtrikes off
ſeveral of its Youthful parts, as if he meant
to cut it in pieces; yet, he that knows,
that the Gardener's arm is not ſet on work
by Anger, but by Skill, will not conclude
that he hates the Tree he thus wounds, but
that he has a mind to have it Fruitful, and
judges theſe harſh means the fitteſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that deſirable Effect. And thus, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a Man, unacquainted with the ways and
deſigns of Providence, may ſurmiſe, when
he ſees the Church not onely expos'd to
the common Afflictions of humane Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,
(for that is but like our Trees being
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54159:51"/>
expos'd to be weather-beaten by Winds,
and Rain) but diſtreſs'd by ſuch Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as ſeem to be Divine Inflictions, that
invite Men to ſay of the Body, what the
Prophet fore-told ſhould be ſaid of the
Head,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 53. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>We eſteem'd him stricken, ſmitten of
God, and afflicted.</hi> Whatever, I ſay, a carnal,
or a moral, Man would be apt to imagine,
upon ſight of the Churches diſtreſſes; the
knowing Chriſtian will not from thence
infer, that God hates Her, or that he has
abandon'd Her, ſince 'tis He, that lov'd his
Church ſo well, as to give Himſelf for it,
who declares, that as many as He loves,
He rebukes, and chaſtens. And this is ſo
fitly applicable alſo to particular Believers,<note place="margin">John 15. 2.</note>
that the Divine Son of the great<note n="*" place="margin">That is, Cultivator of the Ground.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
do's not onely give us cauſe to think, that
Afflictions do not ſuppoſe God's Hate, but
to hope that they may not always ſuppoſe
Man's Guilt, but ſometimes rather aim at
his Improvement; ſince they are the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
words of our Saviour, ſpeaking of
his Father,<note place="margin">John 15. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Every branch in me, that beareth
not Fruit, he taketh away, and every Branch
that beareth Fruit, he purgeth it, that it may
bring forth more Fruit.</hi> And it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
illuſtrate the Similitude, to add, that
the Husbandman uſes onely to prune the
Trees of his Garden, not thoſe that grow
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54159:51"/>
wild in his Woods: But though he oftner
wound theſe, yet he wounds the other more
fatally, imploying but the pruning Hook to
pare off the ſuperfluous Twiggs, or, at moſt,
Branches, of the one, whil'ſt he lays the
Ax to the root of the other, to fell the Tree
it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But theſe are not the onely Thoughts,
which the pruning of a Fruit-tree may ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
to our Reflector: For if he conſiders,
That by cutting off ſeveral of the parts of
the Tree, and by Nailing many of the reſt
to the Wall, the Gardener do's not onely
ſecure the Tree from being blown down,
or torn, by the rudeneneſs of boiſterous
Winds, but makes it look well ſhap'd: So
the Divine <hi>Husbandman,</hi> (as we have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeen God ſtil'd in the Scripture) by the
wiſe, and ſeaſonable, though ſeemingly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
and uſually unwelcome, Culture, he
imploys upon thoſe Children of his whom
he afflicts, do's not onely protect them from
ſeveral dangers, whereto, without thoſe
harſh reſtraints, they would be expos'd; but
as he makes them amends in point of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for what he denies them in point of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
ſo he adorns them by VVounding
them. His kind and skilful ſtroaks adding
as much to the Beauty of a Chriſtian's
Mind, as they cut away from the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54159:52"/>
of his Fortune: For the preſſures of
Affliction do give ſo much ſmoothneſs and
gloſs to the Soul that bears them patiently,
and reſign'dly, that the Heathen Moraliſt
ventur'd to ſay, That if there were any
Spectacle here below noble enough, and
worthy to entertain the Eyes of God, it
was that of a Good Man, generouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
with ill Fortune. And the Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole
(though after this manner ſomewhat
loftily expreſſed) will appear the leſs
ſtrange to him that conſiders, That <hi>Job</hi> had
not onely his Patience, when it had been
tried to the uttermoſt, crown'd with a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
double to that which had been the
faireſt in the <hi>East;</hi> but before his conſtancy
was tried near ſo far, receiv'd that much
higher recompence of an Honour never
vouchſaf'd to Mortals until then, when
God himſelf did not onely approve, but
(if I may ſo ſpeak with reverence) make
his boaſt of, a Man. <hi>Hast thou conſider'd</hi>

                  <p>ANd as the conſideration of the pruning
of Trees, under the Notion of <hi>that
which wounds them,</hi> may afford our Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plator
the Reflections already pointed at;
ſo the conſidering of the ſame Action, under
another Notion, may lead him to Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of another Nature: For if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
that, in certain caſes, Gardeners of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
do not onely prune away all the
Suckers, and many of the Luxuriant ſprigs,
but cut off ſome of the Branches themſelves,
provided they ſpare the Maſter boughs;
and yet theſe Amputations, though they
take much from the Tree, are deſign'd to
add to the Fruit, as accordingly they are
wont to do: If, I ſay, our Reflector takes
notice of this, it may eaſily ſupply him
with an illuſtration of what he may have
obſerv'd among ſome Men, who, by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
ev'n in point of Fortune, are
brought to be far more charitable than they
would have been, if their peace and plenty
had continued unimpair'd. As, beſides that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54159:53"/>
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Macedonian</hi>
Churches,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 2.</note> gives them this Character, <hi>That
in a great trial of Affliction, the abundance of
their Joy, and their deep Poverty, abounded
unto the Riches of their Liberality;</hi> We
have in <hi>Zacheus</hi> a memorable Inſtance to
our preſent purpoſe, ſince, after his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
had,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.</note> by his own conſent, cut off from
his Eſtate more than all that Slander, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and other unjuſt ways of Getting,
(which us'd to bring in but too great a part
of a Publican's) had added to it; he gave
away more, out of the <hi>Remainder</hi> of his
Eſtate, than every liberal Man would have
done out of the <hi>Whole.</hi> His Wealth, like
a skilfully prun'd Tree bore the more Fruit
to Piety; for having had ſome parts of it
cut away, he grew Rich (in good works)
by being deſpoil'd, and his Charity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
as much as his Fortune was leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd.</p>
                  <p>If, towards the end of the Spring, our
Reflector ſee the Ground under his Tree
ſtrowed with the Bloſſoms, that Time and
Winds may have caſt down thence, 'tis
like it would furniſh him with this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
That, as though the Bloſſoms are in
themſelves great Ornaments to a Tree, and
oftentimes both uſeful and pleaſant things,
yet to be ſeaſonably depriv'd of them, is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54159:53"/>
not a miſchief to the Tree that loſes them;
ſince, till the Bloſſoms are gone, the Fruit,
which is a better and more laſting thing,
and more principally intended by Nature,
cannot be had: So it will not always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that becauſe certain things are in their
kind deſirable, and therefore may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
among Goods, the loſs or depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them muſt neceſſarily be an
Evil. And ſo, though a fair and healthy
Body may be look'd upon as a Bleſſing, yet
it will not follow,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> that a <hi>Death</hi> (as the
Scripture ſpeaks) either <hi>in</hi> or <hi>for the Lord,</hi>
becauſe it throws this flouriſhing Body to
the Ground,<note place="margin">Revel. 14. 13.</note> and makes it rot there, muſt
needs be a deplorable Evil; ſince, as the
Bloſſoms falling off, is, according to the
courſe of Nature, neceſſarily praevious to
the formation, or at leaſt the perfection, of
the Fruit: So the being depriv'd of this
Life, is, according to God's Ordination, a
neceſſary Antecedent to our being inrich'd
with thoſe more ſolid and durable bleſſings
of perfect Virtue and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>And if, whil'ſt our Contemplator's Tree
is adorn'd with Leaves, as well as Bloſſoms,
(as we often ſee ſeveral of the former come
before all the latter are gone) he chance to
take notice how buſie the Bees are in ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe, whil'ſt they leave the others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54159:54"/>
he may peradventure make this,
or ſome ſuch other Reflection on it; That,
though the Leaves be not onely Ornaments
of a Tree, but Productions, often uſeful to
ſhade and ſhelter the Fruit, and are of a
more ſolid Texture, and a more durable
Nature than the Bloſſoms, which ſeem to be
of a ſlighter make, and rather gawdy and
delightful than laſting; yet 'tis not about
the Leaves, but the Bloſſoms, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
Bee aſſiduouſly imploys her time,
as ſucking from thoſe gawdy productions of
the Tree, ſtore of that Honey which the
Leaves would not afford her.</p>
                  <p>Thus, though the Books written about
Dogmatical and Controverſial points in
Divinity, may be in their kind valuable and
uſeful productions of skill in Theology, and
may ſeem more ſtrong and ſubſtantial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures,
and likely to retain their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
longer, than Books of Devotion; yet
'tis of theſe, rather than thoſe, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Chriſtian will be a ſollicitous Peruſer;
ſince 'tis not from barren, though ſolid Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions
or Diſputes, but from florid and
pathetical Books of Devotion, which firſt
allure the Reader, and then affect him, that
the devout Soul extracts her Honey, I mean
thoſe Caeleſtial pleaſures that reſult from,
as well as maintain, a free communion with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54159:54"/>
God, which does at once both exerciſe her
Devotion, and recompenſe it, and afford
her, as Flowers do the Bee, an Aliment
equally Nutritive and Delicious.</p>
                  <p>And he may ſomewhat illuſtrate, as well
as continue, the Alluſion further, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
That Silk-worms that live upon
Leaves, and Bees that feed on Flowers and
Bloſſoms, do indeed both of them thrive
upon their reſpective Aliments, and are
thereby enabled to preſent Men with uſeful
productions, but with this difference; That
the ſubtil threds of Silk-worms ſerve prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to cloath others, whereas the Honey
that is elaborated by the Bee, does not onely
ſupply others with a healing and cleanſing
Medicine in ſome Diſtempers, but affords a
great deal of pleaſure to the Bee her ſelf:
For thus, though as well the diligent Studiers
of Speculative and Polemical Divinity, as
the careful Peruſers of Books of Devotion,
may be advantag'd by what they Study, yet
this difference may be obſerv'd betwixt
them, that the former may, by the Diſcourſes
they read, be aſſiſted to write others of the
like Nature, whereby their Readers may be
enabled to talk with more Acuteneſs, and
Applauſe, but the latter may not onely be
aſſiſted by making ſuch Compoſures as they
aſſiduouſly converſe with, to contribute to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54159:55"/>
the cleanſing of Men's Conſciences from
Dead works, and as well pacific the troubles
of their Minds, as heal the Wounds which
Schiſm or Scandal may have given to the
Church; but do often, in the firſt place, feel
themſelves all the Joys, and Advantages,
they would procure to others, and they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
find Pious Reflections, Devout Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies,
Ardent Ejaculations, and other Mental
Entertainments of a Religious Soul, to be
of a Nature not onely ſo ſweet, but ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving,
and ſo advantageous, that whil'ſt
many other laudable Imployments recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
us to the Students of Theology, theſe
more eſpecially recommend us to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it, and indear us to God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>If when our Fruit-tree has chang'd its
white Livery for a Green, our Conſiderer
chance to take notice how thick 'tis ſet with
Leaves, of which it had not one ſome
Moneths before, it may poſſibly put him in
mind of the Inſtability of their condition,
that are undeſervedly envied for a Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
train of ſuch ſeeming Friends, and
gawdy Attendants, as are ſo to the Fortune,
rather than the Perſon: For, as in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiny
moneths of Summer, when the fair
weather would keep the Tree warm enough
without the help of Leaves, it is wont to be
cover'd with thoſe Verdant Ornaments, but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54159:55"/>
loſes them all in Winter, when it needs
their ſhelter from the Rigors of that Cold
ſeaſon: So thoſe, that during the Sun-ſhine
of proſperity, are beſet with ſeeming
Friends, of which they had no need, find
themſelves left naked, and forſaken of them
all, when Adverſity would make their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of ſome Advantage. If our Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plator
chance to obſerve how his Tree flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
with verdant Leaves, and gawdy Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms,
at that Seaſon of the Year, when it is
providing to bring forth Fruit, it may put
him in mind of the pleas'dneſs and alacrity,
with which a Charitable perſon ſhould ſet
himſelf to the doing of good, and mind him,
That as the God of Nature loves a cheerful
Giver, ſo the temper of a liberal Perſon is
pointed out by Nature her ſelf, in a Tree,
which ſeems to triumph in all the Ornaments
it can put on, when it is about to exhauſt the
greateſt part of its own ſtock of Sap to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Fruits which onely others are to eat.</p>
                  <p>If he take notice of the order wherein 'tis
uſual for the Leaves and Bloſſoms to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
the Fruit, it may poſſibly invite him to
look with a more favourable Eye upon the
green and immature Eſſays of early Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
if they diſcover, that the Author aims
at good things, though he does not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
great ones: For, however theſe Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54159:56"/>
productions of the Pen are commonly
rather pleaſing and florid, than otherwiſe
conſiderable, yet if they be good for their
Seaſon, and in their Kind, though that kind
it ſelf be not of the uſefulleſt, they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
pardon, and perhaps incouragement;
ſince, though they be not yet ſolid, they may
promiſe ſomething that will be ſo; and ev'n
the beſt Trees preſent us their Bloſſoms,
before they give us their Fruit.</p>
                  <p>If the ſame Contemplator happens to ſee
young people firſt ſhake the Tree in vain, and
then climb it to gather unripe Fruit, it may
afford him a repreſentation of Men's over-eager
and untimely perſuits of ſeveral deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
things, and eſpecially of Honour: For,
as green Fruit, though of a good Kind, will
not eaſily be ſhaken down by them that
would gather it, but reduces them either to
climb the Tree, or forcibly ſtrike it off, which
commonly bruiſes, and disfigures what it
procures; and as the Fruit, when thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
is but ſowr, and unwholſome, being
neither ſweetned nor concocted by Maturity,
ſo that it uſually both ſets the Teeth on edge,
and breeds Sickneſs in the Body, whereas,
if the ſame Fruit were let alone till it were
fully Ripe, and in Seaſon, it would both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
drop into the Eater's mouth, and prove
delicious, and more wholſome Food: <hi>So,</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54159:56"/>
when we greedily purſue after Honour, and
Pleaſure, of which this Life is not the proper
Seaſon, we not onely meet with Difficulties
in acquiring them, but find not, in poſſeſſing
them, either that Satisfaction, or that Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that the Eagerneſs of our unruly Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
promiſes us; whereas, if we would ſtay
contentedly till God's time be come, (which
is always the beſt, and fitteſt) we ſhould not
ſteal, or force, but receive unfading Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and uncloying Delights, by being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
with <hi>Incorruptible Crowns of Glory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 4.</note> by

                  <p>Laſtly, if towards the end of Summer, or
of Autumn, our Reflector, coming to viſit his
Inſtructive Tree, find it preſent him ſtore of
Fruit, and perhaps obſerves it to be grown
taller ſince the laſt Winter, each Bough
will afford him a lively Emblem of a true
Believer. For, as the loaded Branch makes
uſe of the moiſture it attracts from the
dirty ground, to recede as much as it can
from the Earth, and ſpends its ſap in ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up towards Heaven, and bearing Fruit
for Men: ſo the devout Chriſtian im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54159:57"/>
the Bleſſings he receives of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
World, to elevate his mind above
it: And the uſe that he makes of earthly
Goods, and Advantages, is to raiſe his
grateful Soul nearer to God, and diſpenſe
them by works of Charity to men.</p>

                  <p>THeſe <hi>(Sophronia)</hi> are ſome, and but
ſome, of the Thoughts, which the
Occaſional Conſideration of a Fruit-tree
might ſuggeſt to a Conſidering Perſon. And
if we ſhould lead our Reflector from the
Garden to the Woods, or to the River ſide,
or into the Fields, or to the Street, or to a
Library, or to the Exchange, or, in a word,
to I know not how many other places I
could name, I have ſome reaſon to think,
that each of them would ſupply him with
variety of Occaſional Meditations. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſince the want of Themes will not, 'tis
fit that ſomewhat elſe ſhould, place Bounds
to this Diſcourſe. And ſince, by finding, that
I my ſelf begin to be weary of writing, I
have too much cauſe to fear that you are
quite tir'd with reading, I think it high time
to haſten to a Concluſion: Onely, before I
make one, I muſt do our Meleteticks the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54159:57"/>
right to advertiſe you, that you would do
them wrong if you ſhould imagine, that in
the paſs'd Diſcourſe I have either carefully
enumerated, or fully diſplai'd, the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
which a devout and ingenious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templator
may derive from the Exerciſe of
the ways of Thinking I have been treating
of. For, though I have in the paſt Diſcourſe,
eſpecially thoſe parts of it that are contain'd
in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> precedent, and in this preſent 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
Section, ſaid enough to recommend the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to any that is not much indiſpos'd to be
prevail'd with; yet I will not deny, but that,
even in thoſe two Sections, I have left much
unſaid.</p>
                  <p>For, beſides the ſeveral Advantages and
ways of making Occaſional Meditations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
pointed at, there are other accounts
upon which the practice I would perſuade
may both benefit a pious Soul, and be made
uſe of by an ingenious one. For the reſpects
one thing may have to another are ſo num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs,
and the mind of a rational man,
vers'd in Meditations, may compound and
disjoyn Notions ſo many ways, and may
make ſuch Inferences from them, and ſuch
Applications of them, that it frequently
happens, that beſides the Reflection, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
by that which gave the firſt Riſe to
his Meditations, he lights upon Conceipts
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54159:58"/>
differing enough from them, and perhaps
better than they: As when Hounds, hunting
a Hare, meet in their way with a Stag. For,
though Philoſophers ſeem to have juſtly
enough rejected the Opinion, attributed to
<hi>Plato, That all Knowledge is but Reminiſcence,</hi>
yet certainly the Mind of a Man well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with variety of Notions, is, by the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
or Contrariety of Things and Notions,
in reference to each other, ſo eaſily and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
excited to lay them together, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
upon them, that he is oftentimes by
any ſleight occaſion helped to light (and
that with a ſtrange and almoſt ſurprizing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility)
upon things that he would elſe have
ſcarce taken the leaſt notice of. When the
Mind is once ſet on work, though the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
adminiſtred the firſt Thoughts, yet thoſe
thoughts themſelves, may, as well as the
Object that excited them, become the
Themes of further Meditation: and the
Connection of Thoughts within the Mind,
may be, and frequently is, ſo latent, and ſo
ſtrange, that the Meditator will oftentimes
admire to ſee how far the Notions he is at
length lead to, are removed from thoſe
which the firſt Riſe of his Meditation ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted.
And by theſe Incidental Excurſions
he may ſometimes be as much delighted and
ſurpris'd,<note place="margin">Judges 14. 8.</note> as <hi>Samſon</hi> was, when going aſide
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54159:58"/>
to look upon the Carcaſs of a Lion, he met
with a Stock of Honey.</p>
                  <p>But I can add one thing towards the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
you to exerciſe your ſelf in the way
of Thinking, we have all this while been
ſpeaking of, which though I had almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to take notice of, it will, I doubt not,
ſeem important to <hi>Sophronia,</hi> to whom it
need not be a diſcouragement from aiming
at one of the nobleſt uſes of Occaſional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
that it ſuppoſes not a bare acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with them, but ſprings from an entire
and (if I may ſo ſpeak) intimate familiarity
with our Meleteticks. For this uſe of Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional
Meditations, though it do but gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
differ from ſome of thoſe that have been
already mentioned, will perhaps by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
(and conſequently by <hi>Sophronia)</hi> be
eſteemed the higheſt Advantage that this
way of Thinking can confer; and it is, That
the cuſtom of making Occaſional Reflections
may inſenſibly, and by unperceiv'd degrees,
work the Soul to a certain frame, or temper,
which may not improperly be called Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Mindedneſs, whereby ſhe acquires an
aptitude and diſpoſition to make pious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon almoſt every Occurrence, and
oftentimes without particularly deſigning it.
But as this privilege will, as I was intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
ſcarce fall to the ſhare of any but thoſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54159:59"/>
that, by long or frequent Exerciſe, have ſo
accuſtom'd their minds to reflect upon what
they ſee, that they continue that practice, as
it were, of their own accord; ſo when once,
by ſuch a conſtant kindneſs and hoſpitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſuch thoughts, that they will, as it
were, come to the mind without calling, and
make themſelves its gueſts, without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Invitations, the Soul has attain'd that
deſirable Frame we lately call'd Heavenly
mindedneſs, which is a Diſpoſition and a
Readineſs to make Spiritual uſes of Earthly
things, both the Advantage and the Delight
of that frame of heart cannot but be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.
It muſt ſurely afford a great deal
of ſatisfaction to an Ingenious and Devout
perſon, to be able to make the world both
his Library and his Oratory. And which
way ſoever he turns his eyes (not onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unobvious things, but even upon the
moſt familiar ones) to behold ſomething
that inſtructs, or that delights him. And to
find that almoſt every object that preſents
it ſelf to his notice, preſents alſo good
Thoughts to his Mind, to be gather'd with
as much Innocency and Pleaſure, and with
as little prejudice to the things that afford
them, as Honey is gather'd by the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Bee from the differing Flowers ſhe
meets with in her way. Certainly, if we
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54159:59"/>
would carefully lay hold on, and duly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
this help, it would prove a powerful
Remedy to prevent or cure much of that
Dulneſs and Drouſineſs, that do ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſmother or blemiſh our Devotion.
There would ſcarce any thing paſs us, out
of which we would not ſtrike ſome ſpark or
other of that Heavenly Fire, or that would
not contribute ſomething, either to kindle
it, or to feed it, or to revive it. If but half
the pretious time we impertinently trifle,
or ſquander away, upon Employments
that will be ſure to coſt us either Tears or
Bluſhes, were carefully laid out in the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
of this kind of Thoughts, it might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſave our Miniſters the labour of inſiſting
ſo long upon the Uſes of their Doctrines,
when the whole VVorld would be a Pulpit,
every Creature turn a Preacher, and almoſt
every Accident ſuggeſt an Uſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Reproof, or Exhortation. No Burial
but would toll a Paſſing-bell to put us in
mind of our Mortality: No Feaſt but would
make us aſpire to the Marriage-feaſt of the
Lamb: No Croſs but would add to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to be diſſolv'd and to be with Chriſt:
No Mercy but would be a freſh Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto Obedience to ſo good a Maſter
as the Author of it: No Happineſs of others,
but would prove an Encouragement to ſerve
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54159:60"/>
him that can give That, and much greater:
No Miſery of others, but would awake and
heighten our Gratitude, that we are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
from It: No Sin in our Neighbours,
that would not diſſwade us from what we
ſee look'd ſo unhandſomely in others: Nor
any Virtue of theirs, but would excite our
Emulation, and ſpur us on to imitate or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
It. In a word, when the devout Soul is
come to make that true uſe of the Creatures,
as to look upon them as men do upon water,
that the Sun gilds with his Beams, that is,
not ſo much for it ſelf as for the Reflective
vertue it has to repreſent a more glorious
Object; and when ſhe has, by long practice,
accuſtom'd her ſelf to ſpiritualize all the
Objects and Accidents that occur to her, I
ſee not why that practice may not be one of
the moſt effectual means for making good
that magnificent Aſſertion of the Apoſtle,

by this way of ordering my Roſes, though

thought only to be out of my Way,

innocent, that will think himſelf ſo as

comparative Innocence that in Heaven
(which it will never bring thee too)
has no place, by reaſon of the abſence
of all vitious Perſons; and in Hell it

                     <p>To juſtifie your Conjecture,
<hi>Genorio,</hi> I will confeſs to you, That I was
conſidering with my ſelf, that if one, who
knew not the Miller's Trade, and Deſign,
ſhould look upon this Structure, he would
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54159:68"/>
think the Owner worthy of ſo incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
a Manſion, if not of a Room in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam;</hi>
for we ſee he has choſe to erect this
Fabrick in a Solitary place, and upon the
cold and bleak top of a ſwelling Ground,
where nothing ſhelters it from the Violence
of a Wind, whilſt its high Scituation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes

all: But he that is acquainted with the
Exigencies of the Miller's Deſign, and

where no Wind can blow, that he ſhall
not be able to make an Advantage of. And
having conſider'd this, <hi>Genorio,</hi> my Thoughts,

and though a calmer condition of

yet when a more expos'd one, can make
him that is qualify'd for ſuch Employments
more ſerviceable in his Generation, this
may, upon that account, be more Eligible

                     <p>I was, <hi>Genorio,</hi> taking notice, that
this whole Fabrick is indeed but a large
Engine, where almoſt every thing, as well
as the Sails and the Wheels, is fram'd and
fitted for the Grinding of Corn: But,
though this whole Structure be Artificially
enough contriv'd, yet it can now do nothing
in order to its end, for want of ſuch a light
and Airy thing as a breath of VVind, to
put all this into Motion; And, <hi>Genorio,</hi> this
VVind-mill, thus conſider'd, brought into
my Mind the condition of a great Lord,
that you and I not long ſince Viſited, and
who is far from being the only Perſon to
whom the Reflection may be applicable;
for one that not knowing his Humour, and
his Aims, ſhould ſee how great a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
his plentifull Fortune, and his Skil to
manage it, have laid together, of thoſe
things which are wont to be thought the
chiefeſt Inſtruments (and perchance the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54159:69"/>
chief Parts) of Happineſs, would be apt
to envy his Condition, as diſcerning nothing
that is wanting to it. But alas! the Man
expects and covets Eſteem, and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and though Fame have theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances
to the VVind, that 'tis an Airy
and Unſolid thing, which we muſt receive
from others, and which we are not only
unable to procure for our ſelves, but know
not how long we ſhall keep it when we
have it, yet the want of this alone makes
all the reſt utterly inſufficient for his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
Thus the not ſo Great, as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<hi>Alexander,</hi> after all the Blood he
had ſpilt in Conquering the VVorld, is ſaid
to have ſhed Tears, that he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
but one, when a Philoſopher told
him there were more. And all the Favours
that the greateſt Potentate upon Earth,
could heap upon proud <hi>Haman,</hi> were, by
his own Confeſſion, unable to make him
think himſelf happy, as long as he could
not neglect a Captives neglect of him; all
his Greatneſs did him no good, if but one
Man had the Courage not to Bow to it;
and an unſatisfy'd Appetite of Revenge,
quite ſpoild the Relliſh of the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's
Favours, and the fair <hi>Hester</hi>'s Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.
Nor do I doubt, <hi>Genorio,</hi> that we
often marvel, if not repine, at Providence
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54159:70"/>
upon a great Miſtake; for by refuſing to
be God's Servants, Men uſually become<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo to their own unruly Paſſions, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
And therefore, we often very
cauſeleſly Envy the Great and Rich, as if
<hi>they</hi> were as happy as the Advantages vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaf'd
them, would make a wiſe and good
Man; whereas perhaps the Man courts a
Reputation, that is not to be acquir'd by
what Men have, but by what they are, and
do; or elſe he is in love with a Lady
that loves not him, or loves another better:
And the Coyneſs of a Miſtreſs, the greater
Title of a Neighbour, or ſome ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
accident, that another would either
not be ſubject to, or not be much concern'd
for, will keep him from Enjoying any of
thoſe very things, for which By-ſtanders
Envy him: So juſt it is, that in Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

conſider what Poſſeſſions he has, but what

made ſo great a change in my Condition,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54159:74"/>
as to be, I doubt not, already viſible in my
Looks: For whilſt I was ſitting quietly
in my Chamber, and was as far from the
Thoughts of Sickneſs, as from any ſuch
diſorders as are wont to be the occaſions
of it; and whilſt I was delightfully enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
by an Out-landiſh <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> that came
to Viſit me, with an Account of the ſeveral
attempts that are either made, or deſign'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in foreign Parts, to produce Curioſities,
and improve Knowledge; I was ſuddenly
ſurpris'd with a Chilneſs, and a Shivering,
that came ſo unexpected, and increas'd ſo
faſt, that it was heightned into a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Fit of an Ague, before I could ſatisfie
my ſelf what it was. But I confeſs, that
this unwelcome accident had not amaz'd
me, as well as troubled me, if I had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
conſider'd to what a ſtrange number
and variety of Diſtempers theſe frail Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes
of ours are Obnoxious; for, if I had
call'd to mind what my Curioſity for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections
has ſhown me, and remembred
how many Bones, and Muſcles, and Veins,
and Arteries, and Griſles, and Ligaments,
and Nerves, and Membranes, and Juices, a
humane Body is made up of, I could not
have been ſurpriſed, that ſo curious an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that conſiſts of ſo many pieces, whoſe
Harmony is requiſite to Health, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54159:74"/>
not any is ſuperfluous, nor ſcarce any
inſenſible, ſhould have ſome or other of
them out of order, it being no more ſtrange
that a Man's Body ſhould be ſubject to
Pain, or Sickneſs, than that an Inſtrument
with above a thouſand Strings (if there
were any ſuch) ſhould frequently be out
of Tune, eſpecially ſince the bare change
of Air may as well diſcompoſe the Body of
a Man, as untune ſome of the Strings of
ſuch an Inſtrument; ſo that ev'n the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable
Structure of humane Bodies is
ſcarce more admirable, than that ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and elaborate Engines can be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd,
as not to be oftner out of order than
they are; the preſervation of ſo nice and
exact a Frame being the next wonder to its
Work-man-ſhip. And indeed, when I
conſider further, how many outward acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
are able to deſtroy the Life, or, at the
leaſt, the Health, ev'n of thoſe that are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to preſerve them; and how eaſily the
Beams of a warm Sun, or the Breath of a
cold VVind, or too much, or too little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
a Diſh of green Fruit, or an infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Vapour, or ev'n a ſudden Fright, or ill
News, are able to produce Sickneſs, and
perhaps Death; and when I think too, how
many evitable Miſchiefs our own Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54159:75"/>
or Vices, expoſe us to, by acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
that neceſſitate the Creatures
to offend us, and practices of Sin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we provoke the Creator to puniſh us;
when I ſay, I conſider all this, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
how many Miſchiefs he muſt eſcape
that arrives at Gray-hairs; I confeſs, the
commonneſs of the Sight cannot keep me
from thinking it worth ſome wonder, to ſee
an Old man, eſpecially if he be any thing
Healthy. But theſe kinds of Thoughts
<hi>(Sophronia)</hi> are ſeldome entertain'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they be excited by ſome unwelcome
Occaſions; and when we are long accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to Health, we take it for granted,
that we ſhall enjoy it, without taking it for
a Mercy that we are ſo; we are not ſenſible
enough of our continual need and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on the divine Goodneſs, if we long
and uninterruptedly enjoy it; and by that
unthankfull heedleſneſs we do, as it were,
neceſſitate Providence to deprive us of its
wonted ſupports, to make us ſenſible that
we did enjoy, and that we always need
them: It being but fit that Mercies ſhould
ceaſe to be conſtant, which, their conſtancy
only, that ſhould be their indearment, keeps
us from entertaining as Mercies; I will
therefore <hi>(Sophronia)</hi> endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54159:75"/>
this advantage from this ſudden Fit of
Sickneſs, to make me thankfull for Health,
when God ſhall be pleas'd to reſtore it me,
and to keep me from reckoning confidently
upon the laſtingneſs of it: For though we
are very unapt to take ev'n the Wiſe man's
Counſel, where he forbids us to <hi>boast our

what a Day may bring forth;</hi> yet by ſuch
accidents I find, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpoke much
within compaſs, and had not done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
if for a Day he had ſubſtituted an
Hour: For ſo many, and ſo various are the
unfore-ſeen accidents to which we poor
Mortals are expos'd, that the continuance
of our Health, or Proſperity, do much
more merit our thanks, than the interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

I muſt confeſs, <hi>(Sophronia)</hi> that though
my falling Sick may be but my unhappineſs,
my being ſo much ſurpris'd at it was my

with Cloaths, would confidently
conclude, that, whether or no I be diſtreſs'd
by the contrary Quality, I cannot at leaſt
be troubled with Cold; and if he himſelf
were ſo, he will be apt to Envy me. And
if inſtead of coming in my Cold fit, he
ſhould Viſit me in my Hot one, and ſee me
with my Shoulders and Arms quite unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
and nothing but the ſingle Sheet on
the reſt of my Body; he would be apt to
think, that I muſt lye very cool. But alas!
in ſpight of all that lies upon me, an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Froſt has ſo diffus'd it ſelf through
every Part, that my Teeth chatter, and my
whole Body does ſhake ſtrongly enough to
made the Bed it ſelf do ſo; and, though I
ſtill wiſh for more Cloaths, yet thoſe that
are heap'd on me, can ſo little controle this
praeternatural Cold, that a Pile of them
might ſooner be made great enough to
Cruſh than to VVarm me: So that when
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54159:76"/>
I Travell'd ev'n in froſty Nights, the VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had nothing near ſo ſtrong an Operation
on me. And as that external Cold was far
more ſupportable whilſt it laſted, ſo it was
incomparably more eaſie for me, by Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
and otherwiſe, to deliver my ſelf from
it.</p>
                  <p>Thus, when a Great or Rich Man's mind
is diſtemper'd with Ambition, Avarice, or
any immoderate Affection, though the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders,
that ſee not what diſquiets him,
but ſee what great ſtore of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
fortune has provided for him, may
be drawn to Envy his Condition, and be
kept very far from ſuſpecting that he can
want that Contentment, the means of
which they ſee him ſo Richly ſupply'd
with: And yet alas! as the Colder heat of
the external Air is much leſs troubleſome
to a Man in Health, though furniſhed with
an ordinary proportion of Cloaths, than
the Cold or Hot fit of an Ague, with a pile
of Blankets firſt, and then a ſingle Sheet;
ſo to a Vigorous and Healthy conſtitution
of mind, External inconveniences are much
more ſupportable than any Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
can make the condition of a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
Soul. Let us not then judge of Men's
happineſs, ſo much by what they have, as
by what they are, and conſider both, that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54159:77"/>
Fortune can but give <hi>much,</hi> and it muſt be
the Mind that makes that much <hi>enough:</hi>
And that, as 'tis more eaſie to endure <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
or the Dog-days in the Air, than in the
Blood; ſo a Healthfull mind, in ſpight of
Outward inconveniences, may afford a Man
a condition preferrable to all External ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
without that.</p>

Hot Fit.</head>
                  <p>WHen the cold Fit firſt ſeiz'd me,
me-thought it was rather melted
Snow than Blood that Circulated in my
Veins, where it mov'd ſo Inordinately, and
maintain'd the vital Flame ſo Penuriouſly,
that the greateſt Sign which was left to
diſtinguiſh this Cold from that of Death,
was, its making me ſhake ſtrong enough to
ſhake the Bed I lay on. I call'd for more
and more Cloaths, only becauſe I needed
them, not becauſe I found any relief by
them: I fancy'd the torrid Zone to be of a
far more deſirable Conſtitution than that
we call the Temperate; and as little as I
am wont to reverence vulgar Chymiſts, I
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54159:77"/>
then envy'd their Laborants, whoſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
requires them to attend the Fire:
But when the Cold Fit was once over, it
was quickly ſucceeded by a Hot one, which
after a while I thought more troubleſome
than it. I threw off the Cloaths much
faſter than my former importunity had
procur'd them to be laid on me; and I,
that could a little before ſcarce feel all that
had been heap'd on me, could not now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a ſingle Sheet, but thought its weight
oppreſs'd me.</p>
                  <p>I envied the Inhabitants of <hi>Norway,</hi> and
<hi>Iceland,</hi> far more than thoſe that dwell
either in the richeſt Province of <hi>East-India,</hi>
or of the Golden Coaſt it ſelf: And of all
Creatures, not Rational, I thought the
Fiſhes the happieſt, ſince they Live in a
cool Stream, and, when they pleaſe, may
Drink as much as they Liſt.</p>
                  <p>If then <hi>(Sophronia)</hi> the ſelf-ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may, within leſs than two hours, have
ſuch different apprehenſions of his own
Condition, as now to complain of that as a
ſad Grievance, which but an hour before
he wiſh'd for as a Relief; we may well
acknowledge, that we frequently miſtake
in eſtimating the Hardſhips and Afflictions
we complain of, and find them not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
as we make them, whilſt we not only
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54159:78"/>
endure the whole Affliction that troubles
us, but often increaſe it, by repining at the
envied Condition of others.</p>
                  <p>An afflicted Man is very apt to fancy,
that any kind of Sickneſs, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
troubles him, is far leſs ſupportable
than if it were exchang'd for another Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe;
and imagines his caſe to be ſo ſingular,
that one cannot ſay to him in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Language, <hi>No Temptation has befallen you,
but that which is common to Men,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.
13. He preſumes, that he could far more
eaſily ſupport his Croſſes, if inſtead of his
preſent Diſeaſe, he had this or that other,
though, if the Exchange were made, he
would perchance wiſh for his firſt Sickneſs,
if not be as much troubled at his own
Folly, as with the Diſeaſe. He that is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with the Gout, is apt to envy any
Sick man that is exempted from that Roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
pain, and able to VValk about; He
that is ſwell'd with the Dropſie, fancies all
Perſons happy whoſe Diſeaſes allow them
Drink to quench their Thirſt: And the
Blind man envies both theſe, and thinks no
Perſons ſo miſerable in this VVorld as thoſe
that cannot ſee the VVorld. Feavers burn
us, Agues ſhatter us, Dropſies drown us,
Phrenſies unman us, the Gout tortures us,
Convulſions wrack us, Epilepſies fell us,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54159:78"/>
Collicks tear us; and in ſhort, there is no
conſiderable Diſeaſe that is not very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
in it ſelf, how ever Religion may
ſanctifie and ſweeten it: For as a Fortreſs,
whoſe Defendants are not Treacherous,
can ſcarce be taken otherwiſe than either
by Famine, or Storm; ſo Life, for whoſe
preſervation Nature is ſo faithfully ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
cannot be extinguiſh'd, unleſs either
Chronical Diſeaſes do Lingringly deſtroy,
or ſome Acute do haſtily ſnatch it away.
And indeed, if a Diſeaſe prove Mortal, 'tis
no more than is to be expected, if it tire
out the Patient with tedious Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or elſe diſpatch him with diſmal
Symptoms: Nor is it in point of Sickneſs
only, that we are often more unhappy than
we need, by Fancying our ſelves more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
than we ſhould be, if we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to exchange that which now troubles
us, for any thing which does not. But
there are Evils, which, though exceeding
contrary in appearance, and circumſtances,
do yet agree in being extremely trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome;
as the poſſeſt Wretch our Saviour
cured in the Goſpel, though he were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
caſt into the Fire, and ſometimes
into the VVater, yet in both ſtates was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the ſame Divel, who in variety
of Inflictions ſtill expreſs'd the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54159:79"/>
But we ſhould make a righter Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of ſuffering, if we did but conſider,
that much uneaſineſs is annex'd to an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
condition in general; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which we are ſenſible of, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
rather from the general nature of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and Croſſes, than from the particular
Kind and Degree of ours. And indeed,
if a Man were permitted to exchange his
Diſeaſe with thoſe of others, he would
often find his granted wiſhes to bring him
a variety of Miſchiefs, rather than an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
from them; and many of thoſe
that we Envy, as thinking them far leſs
Sufferers than our ſelves, do look with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious
Eyes on us, and do but diſſemble
their Grievances more handſomely than
we, not find them more eaſie than ours.
And that of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> may be more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
apply'd, than moſt Men think, where
he exhorts to conſtancy, upon this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>That the ſame Sufferings are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
upon our Brethren in the World,</hi> 1 Pet.
5. 9. For 'tis all one as to the Efficacy of
this Lenity, whether our Afflictions be the
ſame with thoſe of others, in Kind, or not
Superiour to them in Degree: And I doubt
not, but we ſhould ſupport many of our
Grievances as eaſily as thoſe for which we
wiſh them exchang'd, if the chief account
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54159:79"/>
upon which they trouble us, were not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that they are the preſent ones, than the

is wont to be Thirſt; and in mine it
was importunate to a degree, that made
me very much ſo, in frequently ſolliciting
thoſe that were about me for Drink, which,
in the heat of the Fit, ſeem'd ſo deſirable
an Object, that it then much leſſen'd my
wonder at that parch'd King's agreement,
who, urg'd with Thirſt, ſold his Liberty for
a full Draught of cold VVater. But alas!
I ſadly found, that the Liquor I ſwallow'd
ſo Greedily, afforded me but a very tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient
Relief, the latter being gone almoſt
as ſoon as the former had paſs'd thorow
my Throat, ſo that not only it did but
amuſe me, not Cure me; but, which is
worſe, Drinking it ſelf increas'd my Thirſt,
by encreaſing the Feaver, whoſe uneaſie
Symptom that was. Wherefore, ſeeing all
the cooling Juleps that could be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54159:80"/>
did free me from nothing but the
Expectation of being much reliev'd by ſuch

thought himſelf this Day oblig'd to a
quite contrary, and yet a more generous
Remedy; and order'd, that, inſtead of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me Drink, they ſhould take away
Blood, as judging it the beſt and far the
ſureſt courſe to take away the uneaſie Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
by removing that which Foments the
cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus when the Mind is diſtemper'd with
turbulent Commotions, and the diſquieted
Appetite does too reſtleſsly and eagerly
crave Objects, which, though perhaps in
themſelves not abſolutely Bad, are at leaſt
made, by a Conjunction of Circumſtances,
unfit and dangerous for the Perſon that
longs for them: VVe, like unskilfull or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
Patients, fondly imagine, that the only
way to appeaſe our Deſires, is, to grant
them the Objects they ſo Paſſionately tend
to. But the wiſe and ſoveraign Phyſitian
of Souls, who conſiders not ſo much what
we do wiſh, as what we ſhould wiſh, often
diſcerns, that this praeternatural Thirſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
and calls for a Lancet, rather than a
Julep, and knows it beſt to attempt the
Cure, rather by taking away ſomewhat
that we have than by giving us that which
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54159:80"/>
only a Spiritual ſuperfluity reduces us to
want: And in effect, we often ſee, that as
a few Ounces of Blood taken away in a
Feaver, does cool the Patient more than
the giving him ten times as much Drink
would do; ſo a few Afflictions, by partly
letting out, and partly moderating our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Affections, do more compoſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
a Mind moleſted with inordinate
Appetites, than the Poſſeſſion of a great
many of the Objects we impotently deſire.
VVhilſt our Appetites are roving, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,
and inſatiate, the obtaining of
this or that particular Object does but
amuſe the Patient, not take away the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe;
whereas ſeaſonable, and ſanctify'd
Croſſes, that teach us to know our ſelves,
and make us ſenſible how little we deſerve,
and how little the things we are ſo Greedy
of could make us happy, if obtain'd, may
reduce us to a Reſignation, and Tranquility
of Mind, preferrable to thoſe over-valu'd
things, which, as it keeps us from enjoying,
ſo it keeps us from needing. Thus <hi>Zacheus,</hi>
who, whilſt a Publican never thought he
had enough, when he had once entertain'd
our Saviour, though he offer'd to make a
quadruple Reſtitution of what ever he had
fraudulently acquir'd, was, upon a ſudden,
by being freed from Avarice, grown ſo

as there was then, but, what is ſadder, I
can ſcarce hope this Phyſick will excuſe me
from the need of taking more again ere
long: But though 'tis a troubleſome thing,
and muſt be often repeated, yet 'tis a ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
thing too, and cannot be more unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
than 'tis uſefull; and as Loathſome as
it is, a Sickneſs were far worſe. Thus
when a relenting Sinner has endeavour'd
to waſh away his Sins with his Tears, he
may poſſibly think himſelf ſo throughly
waſh'd in that abſterſive Brine, (which yet
owes its cleanſing Virtue not to its own
Nature, but to the Blood of Chriſt) that
if he be a new Convert, and be entertain'd
with thoſe Raviſhing delights wherewith
God is often pleas'd to engage ſuch return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prodigals, (as the Kind Father wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd
his Riotous Son with Feaſting, and
with Muſick) that he is apt to fancy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to be like Baptiſm, which, being
receiv'd once for a Man's whole Life, needs
never be renewed. But though, during ſuch
tranſports, an unexperienc'd Convert may
be apt to caſt the Gauntlet to the VVorld,
ſaying in his Spiritual proſperity, that he
ſhall never be mov'd; yet, as our Saviour
ſpeaks, <hi>The Spirit indeed is willing, but the
Fleſh is weak;</hi> and too commonly our Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54159:82"/>
flagg with our Joys, and thoſe that
a while before imagin'd they deſpis'd the
World, find themſelves Worſted, if not
Captivated, by it; and find it far more
difficult than they thought it, to Live in the
Company of Sinners without being of
their Number, and in ſo defil'd a World
without being ſpotted by it.</p>
                  <p>And as the ſame <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid in his
Proſperity, he ſhould never be mov'd, ſaid
in his Diſtreſs, he ſhould one Day periſh by
the hand of <hi>Saul:</hi> So many of thoſe, that
whilſt their Tears of Repentance, and of
Joy, are not yet dry'd off their Eyes, are
apt to defie and contemn all the Ghoſtly
enemies, and difficulties, that oppoſe their
preſent zealous Reſolutions, will perhaps in
a while after, when they meet with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Impediments, and Foyls, change
their confidence into deſpair, and think
thoſe very Enemies, whom they lately
look'd on as Deſpicable, to be Inſuperable:
But as Phyſick, that does good for a time,
ought not to be rejected, becauſe it does
good but for a time; nor ſhould we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the only ſure means of our preſent
Recovery, for fear of future Relapſes; ſo,
though we ſadly find that Repentance muſt
be repeated, and that after we have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
it often, we muſt have need of it
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54159:82"/>
agen; yet ſince 'tis the only proper means
to recover a Soul out of a ſtate of Sin,
which is worſe than any Diſeaſe, and leads
to the worſt of Deaths, we muſt never
ſuffer our ſelves to be ſo far Diſcouraged,
as to forgo ſo neceſſary and ſo profitable a
Duty, and muſt not more frequently Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe
into faults, than renew our Sorrow
for them, and our Reſolves againſt them:
For Innocence indeed is far more deſirable
than Repentance, as Health is than Phyſick.
But as Phyſick is more Eligible than the
continuance of Sickneſs, ſo is Repentance
more Eligible than continuing in the ſtate
of Sin: And as the Drinking ev'n of a
bitter Potion is a leſs Evil than the heat,
and thirſt, and reſtleſneſs of an Ague; ſo
to lament for Sin here, is a far leſs uneaſie
thing than to do it in a place where there
is nothing but remedileſs VVailing, and
Gnaſhing of Teeth. 'Tis true, that our
Souls are in this too like our Bodies, that
our whole Lives are ſpent betwixt Purging
away of naughty Humours, and accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating

Fleſh ſtill ſaying unto the Spirit, as <hi>Ruth</hi>

Ruth 1. 14. But although there are Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

                  <p>AH! Dear <hi>Sophronia,</hi> in ſpight of all
the care, and officiouſneſs of thoſe
diligent Attendants, that you were pleas'd
to ſend to watch with me, I have Slept all
Night as little as I do now, or as I ſhall
deſire to do whilſt you ſtay here.</p>
                  <p>This unwelcome leiſure brought me as
much a Neceſſity as an Opportunity to
ſpend the time in entertaining my Thoughts,
which on this occaſion were almoſt as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and ſeem'd too as Wild, as, if I had
Slept, my Dreams themſelves would have
been: And therefore, I preſume you will
not wonder, if I can now recall but few of
them, and if the reſt be as eaſily Vaniſh'd
out of my Memory, as they came abruptly
into my Mind.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Thought that I remember en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
me, was that which was the moſt
naturally ſuggeſted by the condition I was
in: For when I found how tedious and
weariſome each hour was, and obſerv'd
how long a time ſeem'd to intervene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the ſeveral Diviſions that the ſtriking
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54159:85"/>
of the Clock made of a Night, that muſt
at this time of the Year be much ſhorter
than the Day, I could not but conſider,
how inſupportable their condition muſt be,
to be caſt into outer Darkneſs, where tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Wretches lye, not as I do upon a
ſoft Bed, but upon Fire and Brimſtone,
where no attendance of Servants, or kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Friends, is allow'd them, that need
it as much as they deſerve it little; and,
which is worſt of all, where no Beam of
hope is permitted to Conſolate them, as if
the Day ſhould Dawn after ſo Diſmal a
Night, though protracted to Millions of
Ages, each of whoſe miſerable hours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
an Age.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I was conſidering, was,
How defective we are in point of Gratitude
to God; I now Bluſh that I cannot call to
Mind the time, when I ever thought that
his having vouchſaf'd me the power of
Sleeping, deſerv'd a particular Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.
But now I begin to ſee that 'tis
our Heedleſneſs, not their Uſeleſneſs, that
keeps us from daily being thankfull for a
multitude of Mercies, that we take no
notice of; Though it be injurious, That
that only commonneſs that heightens the
Benefit, ſhould keep us from being ſenſible
of the Greatneſs of it. I confeſs I was
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54159:85"/>
very lately one of them, who look'd upon
Sleep as one of thoſe inconveniencies of
humane Nature, that merit a Conſolation;
and I very little apprehended, that I ſhould
ever complain of the want of Sleep, as of
a Grievance, the neceſſity of it being
what I always look'd upon under that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But I now perceive, he was a Wiſe
man, who ſaid, <hi>That God made every thing
Beautifull in its Seaſon.</hi> And yet, when I
conſider the Affinity betwixt Sleep and
Death, whoſe Image it is, I cannot but
think it very unlikely, that this Life ſhould
be deſign'd for our Happineſs, ſince not to
loſe almoſt half of it were an Infelicity.</p>
                  <p>Another thing I remember I was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
was this, That though want of
Sleep be one of the uneaſieſt accidents that
attend on Sickneſs, yet in many caſes it
proves as uſefull as it can be unwelcome:
For there is a ſort of Jolly people, far more
Numerous than I could wiſh them, who
are at utter defiance with Thinking, and do
as much fear to be alone, as they ſhould to
do any courſe that is naturally productive
of ſo unmanly a fear: And the ſame Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
employments, or Vain paſtimes, that
make them afraid of being alone, do ſo
much keep them from the neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo, that they keep them almoſt from
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54159:86"/>
the very Poſſibility of it: For in the time
of Health, Viſits, Buſineſſes, Cards, and
I know not how many other Avocations,
which they juſtly ſtile Diverſions, do ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
one another ſo thick, that in the Day
there is no time left for the diſtracted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to converſe with his own Thoughts:
And ev'n, when they are Sick, though they
be debarr'd of many of thoſe wonted Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions,
yet Cards and Company will give
them enough to prove a Charm againſt
Thinking, which the Patient is ſo willing,
or rather ſollicitous, to decline, the need of
that Sickneſs leſs troubles him, as it keeps
his Body from going abroad, than as it
tends to drive his Thoughts home; ſo that
Sickneſs does little or nothing towards the
making ſuch Men conſider, by caſting them
upon their Beds, unleſs it alſo hinder them
from Sleeping there. But in the long and
tedious Nights, when all the Praters, and
the Gameſters (who are uſually call'd good
Companions, but ſeldome prove good
Friends) are withdrawn, and have left our
Patient quite alone, the Darkneſs of the
Night begins to make him diſcern, and take
ſome notice of his own Condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
his Eyes, for want of outward Objects, are
turn'd inwards, he muſt, whether he will or
no, during the Silence of the Night, hear
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54159:86"/>
thoſe Leſſons, which by the Hurry and
Avocations of the Day he endeavour'd to
avoid. And though this be a very unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Mercy, yet 'tis a Mercy ſtill, and
perhaps the greater for being ſo unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
For if he could Sleep in Sickneſs,
as he us'd to do in Health, he were in great
danger of having his Conſcience laid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,
till it ſhould be Awak'd by the
Flames and Shriecks of Hell. And the
deſign of God in chaſtning, being to reclaim
and amend us, we not only do, by our want
of Reflecting, indure the trouble of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
without reaping the benefit of it, but
alſo by our ſhunning to conſider, we are
ſo Ill-natur'd to our ſelves, as to lengthen
the Sickneſs, we are ſo Impatient of; which
is in us as fooliſh as 'twould be in a nice
Patient, after having been made to take a
bitter, but a ſalutary Potion, to ſend unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
for Cordials and Julips to hinder
the working of it, and ſo by ſuch unruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
loſe the benefit of the Operation, and
lengthen his Pain and Sickneſs, to avoid the
far leſs trouble of complying with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Medicine, and the Deſigns of
the Phyſitian: So that Repentance being
neceſſary to Recovery, and the conſidering
of a Man's own ways as neceſſary to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
the want of Sleep, which both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54159:87"/>
us time, and impoſes on us a neceſſity
to think, may well be look'd upon as a
happy Grievance, ſince it very much tends
to the ſhortning of our Afflictions, by the
diſpoſing us to Co-operate towards God's
aims in ſending them.</p>

                  <p>THe ſame Violence of my Fit, that

miſs'd not hearing one ſtroke of the Clock

<hi>Sophronia,</hi> that the Clock is kept by the
Souldiers that are Quarter'd in the place
where it ſtands, you will eaſily believe,
that 'tis not very carefully look'd to, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince they are not only wont to let

purpoſe, and as may beſt comply with the

have the Guards that are to be ſet here, or

Of this uncertain going of the Clock, I
never had occaſion to take ſo much notice
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54159:87"/>
as the laſt Night, when, lying too conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

all the hours were ſo tedious, as to ſeem
every one of them extraordinary long, yet
they manifeſtly appear'd to me not to be
equally ſo; and therefore, when the Clock
ſtruck Eleven, to ſatisfie my ſelf whether
it did not miſ-inform me, I call'd to one
that ſat up by me for the VVatch I uſe to
meaſure the time with in nice Experiments,
and found it to want but very little of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night;
and not much above an hour after,
when by my VVatch it was but about one,
thoſe that kept the Clock, whether out of
Negligence, or Deſign, or to make amends
for paſt Slowneſs, made it ſtrike two, which
ſeem'd to me to hint a not unuſefull Rule
in eſtimating the length or ſhortneſs of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes:
For there are Caſes, where the
difficulty or importance of the Subject is
ſuch, that though it coſt a Man many words,
yet, if what he ſays be not ſufficiently fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Exigency of the Occaſion, and
the Theam, he may ſpeak much, without
ſaying enough. But on the other hand,
if (as it often happens) a Man ſpeak
either Unſeaſonably, Erroneouſly, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently,
he may, though he ſay little,
talk too much; The paucity or number of
VVords, is not, as many think it, that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54159:88"/>
which is in ſuch caſes to be chiefly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd;
for 'tis not many, or few, that are
requir'd, but enough. And, As our Clock
ſtruck not ſo often as it ſhould have done,
when it ſtruck Eleven, and yet ſtruck a
while after too often when it ſtruck but two,
becauſe the firſt time it was Mid-night,
and the ſecond time it was but one of the
Clock; ſo to eſtimate whether what is
ſaid have its due length, we are not ſo much
to look whether it be little, or much, as
whether a Man ſpeak in the right time,
and ſay neither more nor leſs than he
ſhould.</p>

                  <p>THe occaſion I had <hi>(Sophronia)</hi> to

ſuggeſted to me this other Reflection, That
the Dyal-plate of the Clock being I know

exceed the correſpondent Circle of the

this little Index, being, when it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

juſtly concluded, That the VVatch did not

                  <p>Thus in eſtimating Men's Lives, there
is ſomething elſe to be look'd at than the
meer duration of them: For there are
ſome Men, who having Loyter'd and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled

have no other Argument of their Age, than
the Church-books of their Gray-hairs;
and as little do they indeed Live, that waſte
a number of inſignificant Years in ſucceſſive
or perpetual Diverſions from the true buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and end of Life. Theſe, and many
other kinds of Perſons, that conſume much
Time to little purpoſe, may be ſaid rather
to have Laſted long, than to have Liv'd
long: As the careleſs VVanderer, who,
inſtead of Travelling, does nothing but
ſtray from one wrong way to another,
though he do ſo at Midſummer from Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

to have Liv'd long enough, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
longer than thoſe that wear
Gray-hairs, only becauſe they were Born
many Years before him. In a word, to one
of theſe ſorts of Men we may attribute a
longer Time, but to the other a longer
Life; (for ev'n the Heathen could ſay,
<hi>Non est vivere ſed valere Vita)</hi> and within

which I think Life valuable, being the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
that accrues from the improvement
of Knowledge, and the exerciſe of Piety,
I thought it allowable, if not commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
to conſume or hazard it for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of thoſe Ends; and eſteem'd Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
more formidable for its unfitting me
to learn, and to teach, than for its being
attended with pain and danger, and look'd
upon what it made me forbear, as far more
troubleſome than what ever elſe it made
me endure. But I find my Body is a Jade,
and tyres under my Mind, and a few hours
fix'd Contemplation does ſenſibly ſo ſpend
my Spirits, as to make me feel my ſelf
more weary that the Riding poſt for twice
as many hours has ever done. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſince, though the proper uſe of a
Candle be to conſume it ſelf, that it may
give others Light, I yet thought fit to have
the Thief taken away, becauſe, though it
made the Candle give more Light, it would
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54159:90"/>
have waſted it too faſt, and conſequently
made it expire too ſoon; I ſee not how I
can reſiſt their perſwaſions, that would
have me husband better the little ſtock of
ſtrength Nature has given me, and the
rather, by a moderate expence of it, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make it ſhine longe, though but
Dimly, then conſume it to faſt, though for
a while to keep up a Blaze: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavour to learn of this Sickneſs,
and of this Accident, what the Doctors
hitherto could never teach me, and injoyn
my ſelf an Abſtinence, which to me is more
uneaſie, than if Wine, or VVomen, or
other ſenſual Pleaſures were to be the
Objects of it; but if in ſo difficult an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of Self-denial, I do not always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what I am now perſwaded to, 'tis
like I ſhall eaſily forgive my ſelf, for but a

the ends of it.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Upon the being in danger of Death.</head>
                  <p>I Know that Phyſitians are wont after
their Maſter <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> to tell us, That
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54159:91"/>
Feavers which intermit are devoid of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
But though an Ague, whilſt it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
ſuch, could not be a mortal Diſeaſe;
yet why may it not degenerate into ſuch a
one? And for my part, who take the
Prognoſticks of Phyſitians to be but
Gueſſes, not Propheſies, and know how
backward they are to bid us fear, till our
Condition leave them little hopes of us:
I cannot but think that Patient very ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd,
who thinks it not time to entertain
thoughts of Death, as long as his Doctor
allows him any hopes of Life; for in caſe
they ſhould both be deceiv'd, 'twould be
much eaſier for the miſtaken Phyſitian to
ſave his Credit, than for the unprepar'd
Sinner to ſave his Soul.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>Sophronia,</hi> finding my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
attended with unuſual threatning
Symptoms, not knowing where they
would end, I laſt Night thought it fit
to ſuppoſe they might end in Death: And
two things eſpecially made me the more
ready for ſuch an entertainment of my
Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>One, That we can ſcarce be too carefull
and diligent in fitting our ſelves for the
Acting of a part well, that we can never
Act but once; For where the Scripture tells
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54159:91"/>
us, <hi>It is appointed for all Men once to Dye;</hi>
it is immediately ſubjoyn'd, That <hi>after that
comes Judgment;</hi> and if we Dye ill once,
we ſhall never be allow'd to Dye again, to
ſee if we would Dye better the ſecond
time than we did the firſt: But as the Wiſe
man Allegorically ſpeaks, <hi>Where the Tree
falls there ſhall it lye:</hi> So that the faults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in this laſt and importanteſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Actions, being irreparable, I think
the only ſafe way is to imitate him, who,
having ſaid, <hi>If a Man Dye, ſhall he Live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</hi>
preſently annex'd by way of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Reſolution: <hi>All the Days of my
appointed Time will I wait till my Change
come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other conſideration that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to me the Thoughts of the Grave,
was this, That we may be often ſollicitous
to provide againſt many Evils and Dangers
that poſſibly may never reach us; and many
endure from the Anxious fears of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Miſchiefs that never will befall them,
more Torment than the apprehended Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
themſelves, though really ſuffer'd,
would inflict. But Death will ſooner or
later infallibly come, and never finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
our Expectations, and therefore the
fore-thoughts of it are an imployment
which may prove, we know not how ſoon,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54159:92"/>
of uſe, and will (however) prove of
excellent Advantage: The frequent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the end of our Lives, conducing
ſo much to make us lead them well, that
the expectation of Death brings not leſs
Advantages to thoſe that ſcape the Grave,
than to thoſe that deſcend into it.</p>
                  <p>Such like conſiderations <hi>(Sophronia)</hi>
having put me upon the thoughts of Death,
I preſume you may have ſome Curioſity
to know what theſe Thoughts were; and
therefore, though I have neither Fitneſs,
nor Inclination to mention to you thoſe
that almoſt every Sober perſon would have
upon a Death-Bed, as a Man, and as a
Chriſtian, I will only take notice to you of
thoſe few that were ſuggeſted to me, by
the leſs general Circumſtances of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
And I am the more willing to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you Curioſity now, becauſe I have
my ſelf been very inquiſitive on the like
occaſion: For the approach of Death will
(if any thing can) make Men ſerious and
conſiderate, being for good and all to go
off the Stage; they make a truer and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer
Judgment of the World they are
ready to leave, and then have not the wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Partiality for the pleaſures and profits
of a Life they are now abandoning. And
as the Mind looks with other Eyes upon
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54159:92"/>
the World, when Death is ready to ſhut
thoſe of the Body; ſo Men are then wont
as well to ſpeak their Thoughts more
franckly, as to have them better grounded.
Death ſtripping moſt Men of their Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
as well as of other things it makes
them part with; and indeed it is then high
time for the Soul to put off her Diſguiſes,
when ſhe is ready to put off the very Body
it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>One thing then that I was conſidering,
<hi>(Sophronia)</hi> was, in how wretched a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I ſhould now be, if I had been of the
ſame Mind with the generality of thoſe,
who are of the ſame Age with me: For
theſe preſume, That Youth is as well made
for Pleaſures, as capable of them, and is
not more a Temptation to Vanity, than an
Excuſe for it. They imagine themſelves to
do a great Matter, if, whilſt Youth laſts,
they do ſo much as reſolve to grow better
when it is gone; and they think, That for
a Man to be otherwiſe than Intentionally
Religious before his Hair begin to change
Colour, were not only to loſe the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Youth, but to incroach upon
thoſe of old Age. But alas! How few
are Deſtroy'd by that incurable Diſeaſe, in
compariſon to thoſe that Dye before they
attain it? And how little comfort is it upon
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54159:93"/>
a Death Bed, to think, that by the courſe
of Nature, a Man might have Lived lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when that very Thought might juſtly
prove Diſmal to an unprepar'd Man, by
ſuggeſting to him, that this early Death
may argue the Meaſure of his Iniquities
exceeding great, and that this untimely
End is not ſo much a Debt due to Nature,
as a Puniſhment of Sin. All the fruition
of theſe deluding Pleaſures of Sin, cannot
countervail the Horrour that a Dying Man's
Review of them will create, who not only
ſees himſelf upon the point of leaving
them for ever, but of ſuffering for them as
long. And on the contrary, the Review of
Youthfull pleaſures declin'd for Virtue's
or Religion's ſake, will afford a Dying Man
far higher Joys than their Fruition would
ever have afforded him.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Upon the ſame Subject.</head>
                  <p>ANd one thing more there is, <hi>(Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia)</hi>
that I dare not conceal from
you, how much cauſe ſoever I have to
bluſh at the diſcloſing it; And it is, That I
judge quite otherwiſe of a competent
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54159:93"/>
preparation for Death now I am near it,
than I did when I was in health. And
therefore, if one, that, ſince his Conſcience
was firſt thorowly awakened, ſtill reſolv'd
to be a Chriſtian, and though he too often
broke thoſe good Reſolutions, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
them, but tripp'd and ſtumbled in
the way to Heaven, without quitting his
purpoſe of continuing in it, finds a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dableneſs
in the approach of Death: How
uncomfortable muſt that approach be to
thoſe that have ſtill run on in the ways of
Sin, without once ſo much as ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to forſake them? A Youth free
from Scandal, and ſometimes productive of
Practices that were ſomewhat more than
Negative piety, is not ſo frequent among
thoſe that want not opportunities to enjoy
the Vanities and Pleaſures of the World,
but that the Charity of other being ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by that great inward flatterer Self-love,
made me imagine that I was in a Condition
fitter to wiſh for Death, than to fear it.
But now I come to look on Death near at
hand, and ſee beyond the Grave, that is juſt
under me, that bottomleſs Gulf of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
me-thinks it is a very hard thing to
be ſufficiently prepar'd for a Change, that
will tranſmit us to the Barr of an Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient
Judge, to be there Doom'd to an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54159:94"/>
ſtate of infinite Happineſs or Miſery.
There is no Art of Memory like a Death-Bed's
Review of ones Life; Sickneſs, and a
nearer Proſpect of Death, often makes a
Man remember thoſe Actions wherein
Youth and Jollity made him forget his
Duty; and thoſe frivolous Arguments,
which when he was in Health, and free
from Danger, were able to excuſe him to
his own indulgent Thoughts, he himſelf
will ſcarce now think Valid enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
him unto God, before whom, if the
ſinleſs Angels cover their Faces, ſinfull Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
may juſtly tremble to be brought to
appear. VVhen the approach of Death
makes the Bodily eyes grow Dim, thoſe of
the Conſcience are enabled to diſcern,
That as to many of the Pleas we formerly
acquieſc'd in, it was the prevalence of our
Senſes that made us think them Reaſon:
And none of that Jolly company, whoſe
examples prevail'd with us to joyn with
them in a courſe of Vanity, will ſtand by
us at the Barr to excuſe the Actions they
tempted us to: And if they were there,
they would be ſo far from being able to
juſtifie us, that they would be condemn'd
themſelves. 'Tis true, <hi>(Sophronia)</hi> if we
conſider Death only as the concluſion of
Life, and a Debt all Men ſooner or later
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54159:94"/>
pay to Nature, not only a Chriſtian, but a
Man, may entertain it without Horrour:
But if one conſider it as a change, That
after having left his Body to rot in the
Grave, will bring his Soul to the Tribunal
of God, to anſwer the miſcarriages of his
whole paſt Life, and receive there an unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
Sentence that will Doom him to
endleſs and unconceivable Joys, or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
and inexpreſſible Torments; I think
'tis not inconſiſtent either with Piety or
Courage, to look upon ſo great a change
with ſomething of Commotion: And many
that would not fear to be put out of the
VVorld, will apprehend to be let into
Eternity.</p>

                  <p>ANother thing, <hi>Sophronia,</hi> which my
preſent ſtate ſuggeſted to me, was, a
Reflection on the great miſtake of thoſe
that think a Death-Bed the fitteſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuneſt
place to begin Repentance in:
But ſure theſe Men are very little acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either with the diſadvantages of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Sickneſs, or the nature of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54159:95"/>
'Tis true, that Sin and Death do
more eaſily frighten one, when they are
look'd on as both together: But I much
doubt whether the being frighted by Hell,
be ſufficient to give a Man a well-grounded
hope of Heaven: For when we ſee Sin and
Torment at one view, and ſo near one to
another, 'tis not ſo eaſie to be ſure which
of the two it is that, as we preſume, ſcares
the Sinner towards Heaven. And ſurely
Repentance, which ought to be the change
of the whole Man, and in ſome ſenſe the
work of the whole Life, is very improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begun, when Men have finiſhed that
courſe, which it ſhould have guided them
in: Nor have Men cauſe to preſume, that
when God is ſeverely puniſhing them for
their Sins, he will vouchſafe them ſo great
a Grace as that of Repentance, which they
would none of, till it could not make them
ſerviceable to him. And as for the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
'tis hop'd an expiring State may give
Men for Repentance, they muſt needs be
great Strangers to great Sickneſſes, that can
promiſe themſelves ſo unlikely a matter:
VVho can ſecure them, that the Acuteneſs
of the Diſeaſe will not invade the Brain?
and as Deliriums and Phrenſies are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent
in Feavers, and other acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
ſo in caſe they happen to perſevere,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54159:95"/>
the VVretch'd patient is caſt into a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
condition, ev'n on this ſide the Grave,
and as near as the <hi>Body</hi> is to its Diſſolution,
the <hi>Man</hi> may be Dead a pretty while before
it.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing he eſcape theſe Accidents,
which make Repentance impoſſible, a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Sickneſs has other Circumſtances
enough to make it very uneaſie: For the
Organical faculties of the Mind cannot but
be dull'd and prejudic'd by the Diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Spirits, by which their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are to be exercis'd; and the ſenſe of
Pain, the troubleſome preſcriptions of
Phyſitians, the loathſome and bitter Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the weakning Operation of Phyſick,
the Languiſhments produced by want of
Spirits, the Reſtleſsneſs proceeding from
Heat and want of Sleep, the diſtracting
Importunity of thoſe intereſted Perſons,
eſpecially if any of them be ſuſpected to
hover about the Dying Man's Bed, as Birds
of Prey that wait for a Carcaſs, the Sighs
and Tears of Friends and Relations that
come to take their laſt Farewell, and to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter
it, The Lawyer that muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to draw up the VVill, the Divine
that muſt be allowed to ſay ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Soul, and the affrighted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that alone brings more diſquiet
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54159:96"/>
than all the reſt put together, do make a
Dying Man's condition ſo Amazing, ſo
Diſmal, and ſo Diſtracting, that to think
this an Opportune time to begin ſuch a
work, (which may well enough imploy the
whole Man in his calmeſt ſtate of mind)
is a Madneſs as great as any, that ev'n a
Death-Bed can, by the tranſlation of the
Humours into the Brain, occaſion: For my
part, I think it ſo wild, and ſo unadviſable
a thing to put off the beginning to provide
all Graces to a Death-Bed, that I think it
uneaſie enough ſo much as to exerciſe <hi>then</hi>
thoſe that were acquir'd <hi>before;</hi> Men being
in that ſtate commonly unable ſo much as
to Reap the conſolation they have been
Sowing all along a pious Life.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>(Sophronia)</hi> brings into my
mind a conſideration, which being taken
from the very nature of a Death-Bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
ſhould me-thinks very much
deterr Men from reſolving before hand to
rely on it; And it is this, That granting
thoſe (Socians, and others) to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that think ſo late a Repentance to
come too late to be available; yet the
Dying Sinner, though he may be kept from
diſpair of paſſing to Heaven, can ſcarce in
an ordinary way have a comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of getting thither! For though it be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54159:96"/>
ſaid, That a true Repentance cannot come
too late, yet it is a hard thing to be certain,
that ſo late a Repentance is true. Since
Repentance confeſſedly importeth an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
and renouncing of Sin, at leaſt in
Hearty purpoſe and reſolution; 'tis very
difficult for an habitual Sinner, that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
what vows and purpoſes of change
of Life, Sickneſſes or Dangers have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
induc'd him to make, which were
forgotten, or violated, when the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
that occaſion'd them were over;
'tis hard I ſay for ſuch a One to be ſure,
that his preſent Repentance is not of the
ſame ignoble and uncurrent kind, ſince
he has no Experience to ſatisfie him that it
would be ordinarily, though not conſtantly,
prevalent over the oppoſite Temptations;
and ſince alſo (which is mainly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd)
'tis ſo eaſie for a Man to miſtake
for the true hatred of Sin, and the love of
God, a horrour of Sin ſpringing from the
preſent painfull ſenſe of the Miſchief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
by it, together with the great fear of
the approaching Torments that it threatens,
and a ſtrong deſire of going to Heaven,
when ſeeing himſelf unable to ſtay any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
on Earth, he muſt get thither to eſcape
Hell. And as it is thus difficult, when a
Man already feels much Puniſhment for
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54159:97"/>
Sin, and ſees himſelf in danger of more,
to diſcern clearly upon what account it is,
that he is ſorry for what he has committed;
ſo it muſt be certainly a ſtate unſpeakably
anxious and uncomfortable to find ones
ſelf dragg'd to the Grave, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether the laſt Trumpet ſhall call
him thence to Heaven, or to Hell: And if
he ſhould be deceiv'd in judging of the
Validity of his Repentance, the fatal er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
would be remedileſs, and the miſtake
far ſadder and more horrid than that of
the <hi>Syrians,</hi> who, when they thought they
were arriv'd Victorious at <hi>Dothan,</hi> found
themſelves at the mercy of their Enemies
in <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 Kings 6. 18. To conclude,
<hi>(Sophronia)</hi> he that reſolves not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his Sins, till he thinks Chriſt ready
to renounce him for them, may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
loſe his Soul, and has moſt certainly
loſt his Ingenuity; and that will appear a
very ſad loſs for a Man, that being by Death
denied the opportunities of actually lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a new and pious Life, muſt derive his
comfort from the aſſurance that he ſincerely
intends it.</p>

that formerly I regarded not, but was

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54159:98"/>

ſent me back by the Apothecary; Good
God! ſaid I, in my ſelf, what a multitude
of unpleaſant Medicines have I been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to take: The very Numbring, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54159:99"/>
Reading them were able to Diſcompoſe me,
and make me almoſt Sick, though the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of them help'd to make me VVell.
And certainly, if when I was about to enter
into a courſe of Phyſick, all theſe loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Medicines, and uneaſie Preſcriptions,
had been preſented to me together, as things
I muſt take, and comply with, I ſhould
have utterly deſpair'd of a Recovery that
muſt be ſo obtain'd, and ſhould not perhaps
have undertaken ſo difficult and tedious a
Work, out of an apprehenſion that it
would prove impoſſible for me to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
with it. Thus when a Man conſiders
the Duties, and the Mortifications, that are
requiſite to a recovery out of a ſtate of Sin,
into a ſtate of Grace, he muſt be reſolute
enough, if he be not deterr'd from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the conditions that Piety requires,
by ſo many and great difficulties as will
preſent themſelves to his affrighted Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination:
But let not this make him De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent;
for 'tis true, that theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſing
Medicines, if I muſt have taken
ſo much as a tenth part of them in one Day,
would have either diſpatch'd me, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
me to endure the taking any the next.
But then, although I now ſee theſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Preſcriptions all at once, I did not
uſe them ſo, but took only one or two harſh
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54159:99"/>
Remedies in one Day, and thereby was
enabled to bear them, eſpecially being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
by moderate Intervalls of Reſpite,
and ſupported both by other ſeaſonable
Cordials, and by that higheſt Cordial, the
Hope that the <hi>uſe</hi> of theſe troubleſome
means of Recovery would ſoon free me
from the <hi>need</hi> of them. And thus, though
the hardſhips of Piety are, by the Ghoſtly
and Carnal enemies of it, wont to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to one that begins to grow a
Convert, ſo great and formidable a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
as to be inſuperable; yet if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that though his fore-ſight meet with
them all at once, yet he will need to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with them but one after another, and
may be as well able to overcome a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
this Day, or to Morrow, as he did
another Yeſterday: So that to this caſe
alſo may in ſome ſenſe be applied, that
(either Counſel, or Precept) of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
not to be ſollicitous for to Morrow,
but to charge no more upon a Day than the
trouble that belongs to it. And if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
too, That as a wiſe Phyſitian has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a great care, that his Remedies be not
diſproportionate to the Patient's Strength,
and after harſh Phyſick to relieve him
with Cordials, ſo God will not ſuffer
thoſe that intruſt themſelves to him to be
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54159:100"/>
tempted above what they are able; but
will allow them Cordials after their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
in caſe he do not turn the Sufferings
themſelves into Cordials. If (I ſay)
our new Convert ſhall conſider things of
this Nature, he will not be much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
by the appearance of difficulties,
that will as much ennoble and indear his
ſucceſs, as they can oppoſe it; and he will
never deſpair of Victory in an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where he may juſtly hope to have
God for his Second, and Heaven for his
Reward.</p>

do but too much reſemble theſe painted
Clouds; for both the one and other are
Elevated to a Station, that makes moſt Men
look upon them, as far above them; and their
Conſpicuouſneſs is often increas'd by the
bright Sun-ſhine of the Prince's favour,
which, though it really leaves them Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the ſame frail Nature that it found
them of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does yet give them a Luſtre and a

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54159:101"/>
and perhaps the Envy and Reſpect of thoſe
ſuperficial Gazers upon things, that are
wont to be Amus'd, if not Dazl'd, with their
inſignificant Out-ſides. But the Parallel
holds further; for as, in ſpight of theſe
Clouds ſublimity and conſpicuouſneſs, they
are but Aëry and Unſolid things, conſiſting
of Vapours, and ſteer'd by every VVind:
So the fine People I am comparing them
too, in ſpight of their Exaltation, and of all
the Shew they make, are really but ſlight
Perſons, deſtitute of intrinſick and ſolid
worth, and guided either by their own
blind Luſts, and Paſſions, or elſe by Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
as fickle as thoſe, (to which it will be
no addition to ſay) or as variable as the
VVind. And as theſe Clouds, though they
ſeem Vaſt as well as High, and are perhaps
able, for a while, to make the Sky ſomewhat
Dark, have uſually but a ſhort duration, and
either quickly fall down in Rain, or are
quite diſſipated, and made to diſappear:
So theſe Titled perſons, what Shew ſoever
their Greatneſs makes, do oftentimes, either
by a voluntary Humility and Repentance,
as it were, deſcend of their own accord,
and, by doing of good, endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate

Uſeleſneſs, if not Miſchiefs; or elſe, after

(ſome of them more ſlowly, and ſome
more abruptly) vaniſh, without leaving

entertain our Sight in the very place, where
before they Ingroſs'd it: And this Ruine
ſometimes happens to the moſt Elevated

ſeem to have infected our very

                  <p>Thus, for Reaſons, which, though we

aſſure us to be both VViſe, and Juſt, a

bring forth Fruit with Perſeverance; if
Prayer, Charity, Reſignation, and thoſe
other Divine Graces, that are wont to be
the proper and genuine Productions of
God's Spirit, do flouriſh, and proſper in
the Soul, we may ſafely conclude that Soul,
though never ſo Diſconſolate, to be in the
ſtate of Grace, and that ſhe really receives
the bleſt Aſſiſtances of Him, who can alone
give the Increaſe (to the Seeds of Piety
and Virtue) though not in the glad and
conſpicuous way of an unclouded Heaven,
yet in the effectual, though ſecret, Method
of fructifying Influences; and we may
reaſonably hope, That He that has not

thorow ſuch Impediments, and Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,

to conſult it; ſo a Sermon, may, by the

though it be for Subſtance excellent:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54159:106"/>
VVhen, as the Frame, though it be not part
of the Glaſs, nor ſhews us any part of our

attract our Eyes, and ſo invite us to
conſult the Glaſs, that is held forth in it;
ſo the Wit, and fine Language, wherein it

often that which invites Men to hear, or

Wit and Eloquence do highly recommend
Sermons, and devout Compoſures, to the
Curioſity and Attention of ſome, that elſe
would ſcarcely mind them; and upon that
account, I allow of your Compariſon, but
give me leave to carry it on a little further,
by obſerving, That as the curious Frame
doth as well pleaſe, as attract, the Eye, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repreſenting to it the lively Image of the
beholders Face; ſo the fine Expreſſions
you applaud, are commonly parts of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
that have no ſpecular Virtue in them,
I mean, that have no Power, like a good
Looking-glaſs, to acquaint the Beholder
with the true Image or Repreſentation of
his own Complexion, and Features: Nor
will this Gaudy frame ſhew him what is
otherwiſe than it ſhould be, the diſcovery
of which, nevertheleſs, in order to the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54159:106"/>
rectifying what is amiſs, is the principal
and genuine uſe of a Looking-glaſs; and
therefore, as no skilfull Man will judge of
the goodneſs of a Glaſs, by the fineneſs of
the Frame, but rather by its giving him a
true Repreſentation of his Face, without
liking it the worſe, for ſhewing him its
Moles, and Warts, or other Blemiſhes, if
it have any; ſo no wiſe Chriſtian will
judge of a rowſing Sermon, rather by the
Language, than the Divinity, or will think
the worſe of a good Book, for diſcovering
his Faults, or making him think the worſe
of his own, or other Men's, ill courſes.</p>

                     <speaker>Euſeb.</speaker>
                     <p>Let me add, Gentlemen, that as
when a Glaſs has a rich and gawdy Frame,
Children's Eyes are oftentimes ſo enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
and amus'd with it, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
of any thing elſe; and for the ſake
of that part, which they can but ſee, they
are unmindfull to conſult that uſefuller part,
whoſe Office it is, to diſcover to them,
themſelves: So, when there is too much of
Rhetorick in a Sermon, many, that ſhould
not be Children, have their Attention, not
only ſo attracted, but ſo detain'd, by that,
that they are not thereby invited to conſult,
but diverted from regarding, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
part of the Diſcourſe. And the
more VVitty and Critical ſort of Auditors,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54159:107"/>
are ſo much more accuſtom'd to judge of
Sermons, than to judge of themſelves by
them, that they deal with them, as if, in this
Glaſs, a Man ſhould only praiſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the VVork-man-ſhip of the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſs'd
Images of the Frame, without caring
to make uſe of the Glaſs it ſelf, to mend
any thing he finds out of order about him:
For thus, theſe Faſtidious and Cenſorious
hearers, make no other Uſe nor Repetition
of Sermons, than to cenſure or applaud the
Expreſſions, and Contrivance, (which
ſhould be look'd upon but as the Ornaments
of it) without minding the Doctrine, or
caring to amend what that has diſcover'd
to be amiſs in them. But it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd,
though I muſt Grieve and Bluſh, it
can be truly ſo, that it is but too often, as
the Scripture ſomewhere complains, <hi>like
People, like Priest;</hi> and that there is a ſort
of Preachers, and thoſe of the moſt Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
who take a Courſe more likely to
encourage, than reform, ſuch Hearers, and
which would, perhaps, make Men ſuch, if it
did not find them ſo: For one of this ſort
of Preachers (for I am loath to call them

his Expreſſions, than to make his Hearers,
good. And whereas, theſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
for the winning, or the ſaving, of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54159:107"/>
Souls, think it a leſs ſure ſign of a good
Sermon, that it makes the Hearers applaud
the Preacher, than that it makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
themſelves: The Orator I am men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning,
had much rather hear their Praiſes,
than their Sighs; and accordingly, is more
ſollicitous to tickle their Ears, than, how
much need ſoever there be of it, to launce
their Conſciences: He may, with far more
Truth than Piety, invert the Profeſſion of
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſay, that he Preaches <hi>not
Christ crucify'd, but himſelf;</hi> and though
now and then he ſeem very Vehemently to
declaim againſt Vices, yet one may eaſily
enough perceive, that 'tis but a perſonated
Anger, and that he rather fences with Sin,
than is concern'd to Deſtroy it, and ſpeaks
againſt it rather to ſhew Skil, than to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Hatred; and as he affects to appear
rather an Orator, than a Divine, ſo he is
well enough content, his Auditors ſhould
rather admire his good Language, than fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his beſt Counſel: And, as if all that
belongs to Miniſters, and their Flocks, could
be perform'd in the Pulpit, and the Pew,
he is more carefull to remember his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
before he has deliver'd them, than to
keep his Auditors from forgetting them
afterwards; and unconcern'd for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
ſeeks but their Praiſes, ſcarce ever
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54159:108"/>
aiming at ſo much as his own Diſcharge.
In a word, in ſuch kind of Sermons, there
is little ſpoken, either from the Heart, or to
the Heart; the Orator and the Auditory
tacitely agreeing to deceive themſelves;
and the Converſion of Sinners, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the effect, nor the aim, of ſuch florid,
but unedifying, Diſcourſes, the buſineſs is
tranſlated on both ſides, as if the Preacher
thought he had done his part, when he has
ſhewn his VVit, and the Hearers thought
they had done theirs, when they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
it.</p>

                  <p>THis more than flattering Glaſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorns
all the Objects I look on
thorow it, with a Variety of Colours,
whoſe Vividneſs does as much charm my
Senſe, as their Nature poſes my Reaſon;
Without the help of the Sun, and Clouds,
it affords me as many Rain-bows as I
pleaſe. And not only when I look on Trees,
and Meadows, and Gardens, and ſuch other
Objects that are of themſelves acceptable
to the Sight; this Glaſs lends them Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
above any they are beholden for,
either to Nature, or Art: But when I
caſt my Eyes upon courſer, and homely
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:54159:111"/>
things, and ev'n on Dunghills, this favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Interpoſer preſents them to me in
ſuch curious and gawdy Colours, that it
does not ſo properly hide their Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
as make them appear Lovely; ſo
that which way ſoever I turn my Eyes,
I find them ſaluted, as if I were in ſome
Rich Jewellers Shop, with Saphires, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pazes,
Emerauds, and other Orient Gems,
the Vividneſs of whoſe Colours, may ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
thoſe that think Colours to be but
diſguiſed Light, which, by theſe various
Reflections, and Refractions, comes to be
rather Dy'd than Stain'd.</p>
                  <p>But this Glaſs muſt as well afford me In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
as Delight, and ev'n by deceiving
me, teach me: For thus, ſinful Chriſtians,
when God looks upon them in themſelves,
muſt needs ſeem too Polluted, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figur'd,
not to appear Loathſom to Him, <hi>Who
is of purer Eyes than to behold Inquity</hi> without
Abhorrency; but when Chriſt interpoſes
betwixt his Eyes and Us, we then ſeem far
other things than otherwiſe we ſhould, and
not only we do not appear Filthy, but we do
appear Lovely, if not Glorious. And as
though, ſome Objects, as things purely
White, and Flames, look better through
this Glaſs, than homely and dirty ones;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54159:111"/>
yet ev'n theſe, look'd upon through this
Glaſs, are more Richly adorn'd, than the
others beheld without it: So, whatever
Difference there may be betwixt Perſons
that are either Innocent, or Exemplary,
upon the bare account of Morality; and
thoſe ignorant or frail Children of God,
that, in themſelves conſider'd, would be
much inferiour to thoſe newly mention'd;
yet when theſe are look'd upon thorow
Chriſt, they are much more acceptable in
God's Eyes, than the others conſider'd out
of him. And I ſhall add this further, that,
whereas my looking upon Objects through
the Priſm, however it makes them appear
to my Eyes, does work no real Change in
the things themſelves, but leaves thoſe that
were homely and foul before, foul and
homely ſtill; God's gracious looking upon
us in Chriſt, makes us by degrees become
fit for his Goodneſs to take delight in,
and has an improving and transfiguring
Power on us, like the Sun, that cheriſhes
Green and unblown Flowers, and paints
them with their curiouſeſt Colours, by his
looking on them. Since then, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tells us, that we are not only reconcil'd
to God, but, if I may ſo expreſs it, are
<hi>ingratiated and endeared to him in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;</hi>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:54159:112"/>
How much do we owe to that
bleſſed Saviour, upon whoſe Account we
enjoy the invaluable Priviledge to appear
(and grow fit to do ſo) pleaſing in God's
Eyes? which beſides, that it is the higheſt
Honour, leads to the higheſt Happineſs;
or rather, is the one as well as the other.</p>

                  <p>THe Sun had as yet but approach'd the
Eaſt, and my Body as yet lay move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
in the Bed, whilſt my roving Thoughts
were in various Dreams, rambling to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
places, when, me-thought, I heard
my name ſeveral times pronounc'd by a not
unknown Voice; This noiſe made me, as
I was ſoon after told, half open my Eyes,
to ſee who it was that made it, but ſo faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that I had quickly let my Self fall aſleep
gaain, if the ſame Party had not the ſecond
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54159:113"/>
time call'd me louder than before, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to his Voice the pulling me by the
Arm. But though this wak'd me ſo far, as
to make me take notice that I was call'd
upon to riſe, yet my Drowſineſs, and my
Unwillingneſs to forgo a not unpleaſant
Dream, keeping me from diſcerning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly,
who it was that call'd me, made
me briskly enough bid him, what ever his

the ſame time I turn'd away my Head to
ſhun the Light, though dim, which at the
half open'd Curtain ſhone in upon me, yet
the Party inſtead of complying with my
deſires, did by throwing open the Curtains,
further let in ſo much more Light upon my
Face, that finding it would not ſerve my
turn to keep my Eyes ſhut, I open'd them to
ſee who it was that gave me this unwelcome
Diſturbance. This I had no ſooner done,
than I perceiv'd that 'twas <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who
with <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and two or three other
Friends, was come to call me to go a Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to a place, where by appointment we
were to meet about Sun-riſing. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
I paid <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and the value I plac'd

Bluſhes to be thus ſurpris'd by him, and
oblig'd me to ſatisfie him as well as I could,
how much I was troubl'd and aſham'd to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54159:113"/>
have the favour of his Company brought
me to my Bed-ſide, which I ought, and
intended to have waited on him. And thus,
whilſt I was making him my Apologies,
and he was pleaſantly reproaching me for
my Lazineſs, and Laughing at the diſorder
I had not yet got quite out of, I made a ſhift
haſtily to get on my Cloaths, and put my
ſelf into a condition of attending him and
the Company to the River-ſide.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt we were walking thither-ward,
and <hi>Lindamor</hi> was minding <hi>Euſebius</hi> of the
promiſe he had made the Day before, to
exerciſe, upon moſt of the things that ſhould
occur to us, his Art of making Occaſional
Reflections, I was delighting my ſelf with
the deliciouſneſs of that promiſing Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and indeed the freſhneſs of the Air, the
verdure of the Fields and Trees, and the
various and curious Enammel of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
the Muſick of the numerous Birds,
that with as melodious as chearfull Voices
welcom'd ſo fair a morning. The curious
and orient Colours wherewith the riſing
Sun embelliſh'd the Eaſtern part of the Sky,
and above all that ſource of Light, who,
though he ſhews us all that we ſee of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54159:114"/>
my ſatisfaction in tearms that, <hi>Eugenius</hi> was
after pleaſed to ſay, needed not Rhymes to
make them Poetical. And the ſenſe of this
invited me to add, that I now would not for
any thing have miſs'd being wak'd, and
thought my ſelf hugely oblig'd to <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s
freedome, that would not ſuffer me to ſleep

take thence a Riſe, to begin complying with
his Friends requeſts, and accordingly, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up towards me, and addreſſing himſelf
to me, he told me, you are unconcern'd

<hi>Lindamor,</hi> that what has this Morning hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to you, puts me in mind of what I
have ſeveral times obſerv'd on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
For when a Man is ſo lull'd aſleep
by ſenſual pleaſures, that like one that
ſleeps, he has but the faculty, not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of Reaſon, and takes his Dreams for
realities, if ſome ſerious Divine, or other
devout Friend, concern'd for the Sinner's
ſoul, or his glory that Dy'd to redeem it,
endeavour to awaken him, and rowſe him
out of that State wherein he lies ſo much at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54159:114"/>
eaſe; ſuch attempts are wont at firſt to be
look'd upon by the lazy Sinner, enamour'd
of his eaſe, and preſent condition, but as
pieces of unſeaſonable, if not uncivil offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
and entertaining the Light it ſelf
but as an unwelcome Gueſt, he obſtinately
ſhuts his Eyes againſt that which alone
makes them uſefull, and inſtead of looking
upon the Attempter as his Friend, he
checks him, and expoſtulates with him, and
uſes him almoſt as an Enemy; Inſomuch,
that too often thoſe that love the welfare of
Souls too little, or their own eaſe too much,
forgo, with their hopes, their endeavours to
reclaim him. But if by God's bleſſing, upon
the conſtancy of this kindneſs, and the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in of ſo much Light upon the Sinner,
that he finds himſelf unable to continue his
Slumber any longer with it, he comes to be
thorowly awak'd, he quickly grows ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that he is brought out of the Kingdome
of Darkneſs into a true and marvellous
Light, and inſtead of thoſe empty fleeting
Dreams, which did before amuſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
him, and which to relliſh, and be fond
of, the Eyes of his Mind muſt be as well
clos'd as thoſe of his Body, he is admitted
to noble and manly entertainments, ſuch as
Reaſon chuſes, Conſcience applauds, and
God himſelf approves. And this change of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54159:115"/>
his condition he finds ſo advantageous, that
he would not for all the World return
again to that, he was at firſt ſo angry to be
diſſwaded from, and he does not forgive,
but thank the Perſon that diſquieted him,
and bluſhes at the Remembrance of his
having reduc'd others to importune him to
be happy: And betwixt ſhame and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
the ſenſe of his preſent, and of his
paſt condition poſſeſſing him, how much he
has reaſon to make his Reſcuer as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for what he indur'd, as retributing
for what he acted for him, he does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
eſpecially in the firſt fervours of his
Zeal, think himſelf as much oblig'd to his
Awakener, as <hi>Philemon</hi> was to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
to whom the Scripture ſays, that he ow'd
even himſelf. And ſometimes ſuch a new
Convert, as I am ſpeaking of, will think his
Obligation to the Inſtrument of his change
ſo ſuitable to the tranſcendent ſatisfaction
he finds in the change it ſelf, that he would
deſpair of ſeeing his Benefactor ſufficiently
recompens'd, if he did not remember a
ſaying of the Prophet, <hi>(That thoſe that
turn others to Righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the
Stars for ever and ever,)</hi> that gives him
ground to hope that God himſelf (whoſe
plenty as well as bounty is inexhauſted)
will make the Recompence his work.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54159:115"/>
Wherefore, concludes <hi>Euſebius,</hi> if you
chance to have any Friends, (as 'tis odds
moſt Men have) that ſtand in need of this
as great as unwelcome expreſſion of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
let us not be too ſoon diſcourag'd, by
finding the effects of our friendſhip coldly
received, and poſſibly too look'd upon as
diſturbances; for beſides, that the leſs they
are deſir'd, and the worſe they are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
the more they needed: a Chriſtian
is not bound ſo much to concern himſelf in
the ſucceſs of his endeavours, as to leave it
in the power of every one that will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate,
to make him unhappy, when the
buſineſs one way or other come to an end,
he may miſs his aim, without loſing his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
ſince he ſerves a Maſter that is as
ready to reward, as able to diſcern Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and in caſe your indeavours do
ſucceed, you will at once make a Man your
Friend, and worthy to be ſo. And you ſhall
ſcarce ever find Men more affectionate to
you, than thoſe you have made your Friends,
by making them Enemies to Vice.</p>

of her. Whereupon <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who was
full as willing to hear as ſpeak, and in the
Occaſional Reflections that he made, was
wont at leaſt as much to aim at the exciting
others thoughts, as the venting of his own,
begg'd <hi>Eugenius</hi> to tell us what it might be,
which his attentiveneſs to the motions of
the Lark made us preſume he was thinking
on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eugenius</hi> after a little backwardneſs,
which he thought Modeſty exacted of him,
ſoon anſwer'd us in theſe tearms.</p>
                  <p>Among all Birds that we know, there is
not any that ſeems of ſo elevated, and I had
almoſt ſaid Heavenly a Nature as the Lark,
ſcarce any give ſo early and ſo ſweet a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to the Springing day. And that which
I was juſt now gazing on, ſeem'd ſo pleas'd
with the unclouded Light, that ſhe ſung as
if ſhe came from the place ſhe ſeem'd to
go to, and during this charming Song,
mounted ſo high, as if ſhe meant not to ſtop,
till ſhe had reach'd that Sun, whoſe Beams
ſo cheriſh'd and tranſported her; and in
this aſpiring flight ſhe rais'd her ſelf ſo
high, that though I will not ſay, ſhe left the
Earth beneath her very Sight, yet I may
ſay, that ſhe foar'd quite out of Ours.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54159:117"/>
And yet when from this towring height ſhe
ſtoop'd to repoſe or ſolace her ſelf upon
the Ground, or elſe when to ſeiſe upon
ſome worthleſs Worm, or other wretched
Prey, ſhe lighted on the Ground, ſhe
ſeem'd ſo like the Earth that was about her,
that I believe you could ſcarce diſcern her
from its Clods. And whereas other Birds
that fly not half ſo high, nor ſeem any thing
near ſo fond of the Sun, do yet build their
Neſts upon Trees, the Lark does as well
build hers upon the Ground, as look like a
part of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have known, in theſe laſt and
worſt times, many a Hypocrite, that when
he was converſant about ſublimer Objects,
appear'd, as well as he call'd himſelf, a Saint;
nothing ſeem'd ſo welcome to him as new
Light; one might think his Lips had been
touch'd with a coal from the Altar, his
Mouth did ſo ſweetly ſhew forth Gods
praiſe, and ſacred diſpenſations. In ſum,
take this Hypocrite in his fit of Devotion,
and to hear him talk, you would think, that
if he had not been already in Heaven, at
leaſt he would never leave mounting, till
he ſhould get thither.</p>
                  <p>But when the Opportunities of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taging
his lower Intereſts call'd him down
to deal about Secular affairs here below,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54159:117"/>
none appear'd more of a piece with the
Earth than he, for he look'd as if he had
been beſmear'd all over with the Earth
round about him, and he ſeem'd, in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for his Family, to be of a meaner and a
lower Spirit, than thoſe very Men whom in
diſcourſe he was wont to undervalue, as
being far more Earthy than himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Since we know, ſays <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that the
beſt things corrupted prove the worſt, it
can be no diſparagement to Piety, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that Hypocriſie is a Vice which
you cannot too much condemn. And when
the pretending of Religion grows to be a
thing in requeſt, many betake themſelves
to a form of Religion, who deny the Power
of it; And ſome perchance, have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
leſs for their Jacobs voice, than for
their <hi>Eſaus</hi> hands.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> let us not to ſhun one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,
fondly run into the other, and be
afraid or aſham'd to profeſs Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome Hypocrites did <hi>but</hi> profeſs it;
His courſe is ignoble, and praepoſterous,
that treads the paths of Piety, rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they lead to Preferment than to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
But yet 'tis more excuſable to live
free from ſcandal for an inferiour end, than
not to live ſo at all: And Hypocrites can
as little juſtifie the profane, as themſelves.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54159:118"/>
It may be, that all that own Religion are not
Pious; but 'tis certain, that he that ſcorns
to own it muſt leſs be ſo. And if ſcoffers
at Piety ſhould ſucceed the Pretenders to
it, they cannot be ſaid (as ſometimes they
would be thought) to be an innocent ſort
of Hypocrites, that <hi>are</hi> better than they
<hi>ſeem;</hi> for Scandal is a thing ſo criminal, and
contagious, that whoſoever deſires, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to <hi>appear</hi> evil, <hi>is</hi> ſo: To refuſe to
be Religious, becauſe ſome have but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
themſelves to be ſo, is to injure God,
becauſe he has been injur'd. A skilfull
Jeweller will not forbear giving great rates
for Neck-laces of true Pearl, though there
be many Counterfeits for one that is not
ſo; Nor are the right Pearls a whit the leſs
Cordial to thoſe that take them, becauſe
the artificial Pearl made at <hi>Venice,</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Mercury and Glaſs, for all their fair
ſhew, are rather Noxious, than Medicinal.
And indeed our knowledge, that there are
Hypocrites, ought rather to commend Piety
to us, than diſcredit it with us; ſince as
none would take the pains to counterfeit
Pearls, if true ones were not of Value;
So Men would not put themſelves to the
conſtraint of perſonating Piety, if that it
ſelf were not a noble Quality. Let us
then, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> fly as far as you pleaſe from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54159:118"/>
what we deteſt in Hypocrites: But then
let us conſider, <hi>what</hi> it is that we deteſt;
which being a bare, and therefore <hi>falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>
to Religion, let us only ſhun <hi>ſuch</hi> a
pretence, which will be beſt done by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
real Poſſeſſors of the thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to.</p>

not only imbrac'd this made him by

the Conference to explain his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſatisfie <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that he did not
think Piety fit to be diſcountenanc'd, though
he thought Hypocriſie was ſo, and that he
was no Enemy to the Profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but to thoſe that blemiſh'd it by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable

Diſcourſes we continu'd our Walk, till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to a Style, over which we were to
paſs out of one Meadow into another, I
chanc'd to ſtop, and turn about to pay <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi>
the Reſpect of deſiring him to lead
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54159:119"/>
me the way over: But not finding him
there, I haſtily caſt my Eyes all over the
Field, till at length they diſcover'd him a
good way off, in a Poſture that ſeem'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
ſerious, and wherein he ſtood as
immoveable as a Statue. This ſight ſoon
carry'd me towards him, and I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
half my way before his changing
his Poſture gave him an opportunity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
me, which as ſoon as he did, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
came to meet me, and almoſt
before I had ask'd him the occaſion of what
I had ſeen; Whilſt (reply'd he) <hi>Eugenius</hi>
was purging himſelf from a fault that none
that knows him will ſuſpect him to be
guilty of, I was detain'd a little behind you
by the Muſick of one of thoſe Larks, whoſe
melody was ſo charming, that I could not
find in my heart to make haſte from it: But
whilſt I was liſtening to it, my Attention
was diverted by a nobler Object, for I
heard, from the further corner of this Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
a Voice, which, though not govern'd
with Skil, did ſo repair the want of it by its
native ſweetneſs, that Art was abſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being miſs'd, and I could not but have
ſome Curioſity to ſee who was the Poſſeſſor
of ſo much power to pleaſe; turning then
my ſteps towards that part of the Field
whence the Voice came, my Eyes quickly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54159:119"/>
ceas'd to envy my Ears, for they diſcover'd,
kneeling by a Cow, and ſinging to her whilſt
ſhe milk'd her, a Perſon, who, in the habit
of a Milk-maid, ſeem'd to diſguiſe one of
thoſe Nymphs that Poets are wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
us. And that you may not wonder,
continues <hi>Lindamor,</hi> at what I ſhall ſay to
you of a country Girle, Know, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
I ſaw in her Face ſomething more
like <hi>Hermione,</hi> before ſhe prov'd inconſtant,
than I expected to find in any of her Sex:
I will not tell you, that this fair Creature
had the Bluſhes of the Morning in her
Cheeks, the Splendour of the Sun in her
Eyes, the freſhneſs of the Fields in her
Looks, the whiteneſs of the Milk ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
in her Skin, and the melody of the
Larks, we were admiring, in her Voice, leaſt
you ſhould think Mr. <hi>Boyls</hi> Seraphick Love
had loſt its Operation on me. But I may
perhaps without much Hyperbole, give you
this Account of her, that though her Cloaths
are almoſt as courſe as cleanly, and though
they are ſuited to her Condition, yet they
are very ill ſuited to her Beauty, which,
as if Nature intended a Triumph over For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
has, without any aſſiſtance of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
more diſtreſs'd my Liberty, than
others have been able to do with all their
moſt curious Dreſſes. And this fair Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54159:120"/>
continues <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as ſhe is rich in
Natures bounty, appear'd as well by the
chearfulneſs of the Tune ſhe ſung, as by the
manner of her Singing it, ſo ſatisfy'd with
the unpurchas'd Treaſures ſhe poſſeſſes,
that ſhe ſeem'd almoſt as much pleas'd as I
was to look upon her. This Character of
<hi>Lindamors</hi> inviting me to go ſee, whether
or no it were deſerv'd, and the frequent
Experience I have had, that ev'n upon ſuch
bright Eyes as Poets, and Lovers, call'd
Suns, I could gaze undazel'd enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
my ſelf a right Eagle, aſſuring me
I might ſafely do it, I fearleſly, but ſoftly,
approach'd the place where the fair Milk-maid
was ſolliciting the Udder of a freſh
Cow, and I found, that though indeed ſome
Reſemblance ſhe had to <hi>Hermione,</hi> had
made <hi>Lindamor</hi> flatter her, yet ſhe look'd at
once ſo innocently, and prettily, that ſhe
ſeem'd like to do Miſchief, without at all
intending it; and I could not but fancy,
that if ſome Ladies that are much cry'd up,
and are very imperious Miſtreſſes, becauſe
they are ſo, were bound to change Dreſſes
with this unſophiſticated and unadorn'd
Maid, the one would appear to owe her
Beauty to Art, and the other to be beholden
for hers to nothing but Nature. But, <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor,</hi>
who is not naturally indiſpos'd to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54159:120"/>
Amorous, did not think that this Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mine did that pretty Creature right:
for when I told him ſhe would eclipſe a
hundred of our fine Ladies, if ſhe had but
the Dreſs of one of them; Why, that (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
he, with a kind of Indignation) ſhe
can do without it, and perhaps, ſubjoyns he,
as much as with it: For her preſent habit
leaves her moſt her ſelf, and Bravery would
but diſguiſe, or hide what it cannot adorn.
And I am confident, (continues he) that
ſhould ſuch a genuine Beauty appear among
the Gallants, ſhe would really captivate
many, ev'n of thoſe wary ones that do
but pretend to be ſo, to the deſigning and
applauded Ladies: For though Skil may
encounter the Wiles of Art, it would ſcarce
be able to reſiſt the Charms of Nature.
But whilſt <hi>Lindamor</hi> was thus Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
with what he fancy'd the Picture
of his once lov'd <hi>Hermione,</hi> and had his
Eyes as much fix'd upon her, as dazl'd ones
could be, the lovely Milk-maid, (who, all
this while having not taken notice of us,
was as regardleſs of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as he ſeem'd
to be of all things but her) having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
what ſhe was doing, took up her
Pail to carry it homewards: But her way
chancing to lye by that part of the Meadow
where we were yet ſtanding, ſhe could not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54159:121"/>
but diſcover us, and judging by our Cloaths,
and more by <hi>Lindamors</hi> Meer, that we were
of a Quality differing from theirs ſhe was
wont to converſe with, ſhe gave us a Salute
low enough to let us ſee that ſhe forgot not
her Condition, but attended with ſo much
Gracefulneſs, as made <hi>Lindamor</hi> conclude
ſhe merited a better, and, as ſhe paſs'd by
him, to return the geſture of Reſpect, which
he thought ſo much Beauty had a right in
any habit to exact; ſhe vouchſaf'd him a
Smile, which, I after told him, would have
made him happy, if he had thought it had
proceeded from Kindneſs, not Civility;
and ſhe went away with a Look ſo ſerene,
as well as taking, that ſhe ſeem'd to carry
home with her far more quiet, than ſhe left
him poſſeſs'd of. But I that had loſt ſight
of her, without loſing any thing with it,
ſave the expectation of ſeeing in haſte ſo
fair a Milk-maid, was going to <hi>Railler</hi> with
<hi>Lindamor,</hi> about what had paſs'd, when I
was reſtrain'd, by perceiving that the ſight
of a Perſon that ſeem'd ſo contented, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the native pleaſantneſs of that
place, and of that glorious Morning, had
ſuch an operation upon him, that he could
not forbear to celebrate the happineſs and
innocency of a Country life. And after he
had with much Tranſport, and Fluency,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54159:121"/>
repeated the ſubſtance of what <hi>Ovid</hi> and
other antient Poets had in their ſtrain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
concerning the felicity of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Age, he began to apply as much of it
as the Matter would bear, to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
of a Rural life, and was very ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
to make me acknowledge, that
though we are wont to look upon Villagers
as an inferiour and wretched ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
yet they are the perſons of the World,
whoſe condition is the moſt proper, not
only to keep them innocent, but to make
them happy: Their cheap and ſimple way
of Living, allowing them to reſt contented,
with what bounteous Nature has provided
for them, or an eaſie Induſtry can procure
them. Whereas among Men nobly Born,
or Perſons of Quality, 'tis look'd upon as
want of Breeding, for a Man not to think
himſelf unhappy, as long as he hath not a
thouſand Pound a Year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lindamor,</hi> though he here made a Pauſe
to take breath, would yet perhaps have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
his Diſcourſe, had he not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the intervening of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who
a while after we had left him, having miſs'd
us, had follow'd us to the palace he found
us in, and who, when he drew nigh, having
over-heard <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſpeaking, ſtood ſtill a
while at ſome diſtance off, to liſten to what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54159:122"/>
he ſaid, and ſo became an unſuſpected Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
of the laſt part of his Friends Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
Whereupon taking him by the
hand, and leading him towards the River,
he told him, with a ſerious, not to call it a
ſevere Look; I had thought, <hi>Lindamor,</hi>
you had made righter Eſtimates of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
courſes of Life, than, by what I have
newly over-heard you ſay, I now ſuſpect
you do. Know then, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> (adds he)
That Innocence and Contentment depend
more upon a Man's mind, than upon his
condition: To manifeſt this to you, I
ſhall in the firſt place obſerve, that 'tis not
always the Occaſion, or the Object, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Degree that makes an Affection of
the Mind unruly and troubleſome; Nor is
it according to the intrinſick value of things,
which none ſave the Wiſe can diſcern; but
the Rate, how unskilfully ſoever fixt, which
we put upon them, that they operate upon
our paſſions. And therefore, you ſhall ſee
a Child take on more ſadly for the ſcape of
a Sparrow, or the breaking of a Rattle, than
ſome will do for the loſs of a good Eſtate,
nay, of a Friend; and <hi>Haman,</hi> for the want
of a Bow from <hi>Mordecai,</hi> complain'd more
in his Place, than <hi>Job,</hi> till his miſerable
comforters had exaſperated his grief, did
for the loſs of the biggeſt Fortune in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54159:122"/>
Eaſt, and of the Children he reſerv'd it for,
and valu'd far above it.</p>
                  <p>And then, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> (continues <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius)</hi>
do not imagine, that though Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
and Gallants have more ſpendid and
glittering Temptations to Sin and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
Country people are exempted from
Temptation to either: Theirs may be as
great, though not the ſame, nor ſo ſpecious
as the other; their Faults and Infelicities
are indeed leſs taken notice of, becauſe their
Perſons and Conditions are obſcure, and
their Poverty conceals their Vices, as well
as their Virtues, from our Eyes; as in a ſharp
Winter the Snow does as well hide their
Dunghills, as cover their Gardens. But if
your Quality allow'd you to acquaint your
ſelf with the true ſtate of this inferiour ſort
of People, you would ſoon perceive, that
ev'n of rural Families, there is ſcarce any,
that, as far as their Wits will reach, has not
its ſeveral Parties, and little Intrigues;
Nor is there any Cottage ſo low, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
as not to harbour Care, and Malice,
and Covetouſneſs, and Envy, if thoſe that
dwell in it have a mind to entertain them:
And what Envy alone may do to produce
Crimes and Diſcontents, we may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
by what happen'd betwixt <hi>Cain</hi> and
<hi>Abel,</hi> ſince their being heirs to the whole
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54159:123"/>
World, could not keep two Brothers at
peace, whilſt one of them was envious:
And there are ſome ſordid Vices, which are
more incident to the meaner and more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous
ſort of Men, as Spiders and Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs
are wont to abound more in thatch'd
Cabbins, than in great Mens houſes. I
ſhould perhaps (ſays <hi>Euſebius)</hi> think theſe
people happy, if I found they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo; but the Pomp and Vanities of
the World have oftentimes ſtronger allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for them, than for the Grandees and
Courtiers themſelves: For thoſe that are
poſſeſs'd of theſe imaginary Joys, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abus'd
by their own Experience; and thoſe
that live among theſe Theatrical perſons,
are near enough to diſcern that they are but
cauſeleſly envy'd. As (for my part) when
I had occaſion to be converſant in great
Mens Families, and the honour to preach
in Princes Courts, the ſight of their courſe
of Life did as thorowly convince me of the
Vanity of the World, as my Sermons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to convince them. Whereas
Country people ſee but the glittering and
deluding outſide of Greatneſs, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it but at a diſtance, ſee it in the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableſt
light which Men can behold it in, and
conſequently are ſtrongly tempted to envy
what they admire, and repine at their own
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54159:123"/>
condition, for the want of it: Nay, every
gawdy trifle, that thoſe that live in Towns
and Cities chance to make ſhew of, is
wont to make a Country man envy, as well
as gape; And 'tis odds, but that very Milk-maid,
whoſe condition you are pleas'd to
think ſo happy, envies ſome Neighbouring
Farmers Daughter for a piece of taudry
Ribbon, or a black Hood: Nor are they ſo
much more priviledg'd from the aſſaults of
Temptation, than Men of higher rank; For
'tis not ſo much a Mans outward condition,
as his inward diſpoſition and temper of
mind, that makes Temptations either to
ſin, or to diſcontent, prevalent, or unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull.
When <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and ſollicited by a Woman that would
needs be his Miſtreſs upon more ſcores than
one, though his condition expos'd him more
to hopes and fears, than almoſt any other
condition could expoſe another Man, And
though his Youth made him very capable
of relliſhing the pleaſures that his Beauty
made him courted to receive, by giving
them; yet this chaſt Youth choſe rather to
be Impriſon'd any where, than in a fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Arms, and preferr'd the being made a
Captive, before the Captivating of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Miſtreſs. But whilſt young <hi>Joſeph</hi>
was thus chaſt in the <hi>Aegyptian Potiphar's</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54159:124"/>
Houſe, his eldeſt Brother <hi>Reuben</hi> was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous
in good <hi>Jacob's</hi> whoſe Family was
then the viſible Church of God; and <hi>Lot,</hi>
who was chaſt and temperate in <hi>Sodom</hi> it
ſelf, was Drunk and committed Inceſt in a
Cave; ſo much more does the ſucceſs of
Temptations depend upon the temper of a
Man's mind, than upon the place he lives
in.</p>
                  <p>I know not (ſays <hi>Eugenius)</hi> whether the
Innocence of Rural people be more eaſie
than that of great Men, but ſure it is not ſo
commendable: For as a Woman that has
never yielded, becauſe ſhe was never ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited,
may be call'd rather Innocent than
Virtuous; ſo their condition, that owe
their not being Inveigl'd by the Vanities of
the World, to their Ignorance of them, has
more in it of good fortune than of merit.
I thank you for that conſideration, (ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
<hi>Euſebius)</hi> for I confeſs I think there
is a great Diſparity betwixt an unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs
with the bewitching pleaſures of
the World, and a contempt of them. And
he is the truly heroick Spirit, that can (as
<hi>David</hi> could) plentifully enjoy all thoſe
ſenſual Delights and Vanities he choſe to
reject: For he could feaſt a Nation, and
prefer Temperance before all that Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
He could gain ſtrange Victories at
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54159:124"/>
once over his outward Enemies, and over
the Temptations he was expos'd to by ſuch
ſucceſſes; He could Build ſtately Palaces,
and then profeſs himſelf to be but <hi>a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and a Sojourner upon Earth;</hi> He could
afford Humility room to ſit with him on his
Throne, and could liſten to her Memento's
amidſt all the Acclamations of his People,
and the Panegyricks of his Courtiers; He
was not to be reſiſted by Beauties, that to
others were irreſiſtible, when he poſtpon'd
the faireſt Objects that could here charm his
Eyes, to ſuch as were viſible only to thoſe
of Faith; He had got together the greateſt
Treaſure, that for ought I remember we
read of in any Hiſtory, and yet ſeems never
to have been much pleas'd with it, but
when he dedicated it to the Building of the
Temple, and made the fruits of his Valour
the oblations of his Piety. To be ſhort, he
was the greateſt Perſon upon Earth, when
he was content to leave it; and was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to deſcend from the Throne into the
Grave, whilſt he look'd upon that as the
place whence he muſt aſcend to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his God; ſo much did he, ev'n
whilſt he wore an earthly Crown, aſpire to
an Heavely one. And though (continues
<hi>Euſebius)</hi> we muſt now a days as little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to meet with a Man of <hi>David</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54159:125"/>
as of his temper, yet proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
we may put a vaſt Difference betwixt
thoſe that but eſcape the ſight of the World's
allurements, and thoſe that reject the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euſebius</hi> was in this part of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
when we were come near enough
to the River, to diſcover it within a little
way of us: And therefore finding by his
ſilence, that he thought it ſeaſonable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
I only ventur'd to tell him, with a low
Voice, as we continu'd our Walk, that I
ſuſpected, that in ſome of the things he had
been ſaying, he had a deſign rather to check
<hi>Lindamor</hi> a little, and keep up the Diſcourſe,
than to deny, that a retir'd and rural Life
has great advantages towards Contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
To which, that he might conclude what
he had to ſay, before we reach'd the River,
he made haſte to reply in the ſame Tone,
That I was not altogether miſtaken: For
(ſays he) I think the caſe may be pretty
well repreſented, by ſaying, that as there
are ſome Airs very much wholeſomer than
others, and fitter to preſeve Men from Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes;
ſo a very private and quiet condition
of Life, does much more eaſily than a more
expos'd and turbulent one, protect moſt
ſorts of Men from Vices and Diſquiets.
But then on the other ſide, as there are ſome
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54159:125"/>
Men of ſuch ſound and ſtrong Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that they will enjoy their Health in
the worſt Airs, when Men of tender and
vitiated Complexions will be Sickly in the
beſt; ſo there are ſome generous and ſteady
Souls, that will paſs thorow the moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
and moſt expos'd courſes of Life,
with more of both Innocence and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than others can enjoy in a condition
far remoter from Diſturbances and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
And, annexes <hi>Euſebius,</hi> (purpoſely
raiſing his Voice) as for theſe Villages that
<hi>Lindamor</hi> thought ſo happy, I muſt diſſent
from him as long as I ſee they can admire,
and almoſt worſhip, a Man for wearing a
Gaudy ſuit of Cloaths, or having two or
three Foot-men behind his Coach, before
they know whether he be not a Knave, or a
Fool, or both: For I ſhall ſcarce think, that
he, who is himſelf poſſes'd with Envy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
mine.</p>

                  <p>BEing at length come to the River-ſide,

                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54159:126"/>
finding the Fiſh forward enough to bite,
thought fit to ſpare his Flies, till he might

Fiſhes, that you catch ſo faſt with this falſe
Bait, poſſibly we are not much leſs unwary
our ſelves; And the Worlds treacherous
pleaſures do little leſs delude both me and
you: For, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> (continues he) as
the Apoſtles were Fiſhers of men in a good
ſenſe, ſo their and our grand adverſary is a
skilfull Fiſher of men in a bad ſenſe; And
too often in his attempts, to cheat fond
Mortalls, meets with a ſucceſs as great and
eaſie, as you now find yours. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that Tempter, as the Scripture calls
him, does ſadly delude us, even when we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54159:126"/>
riſe at his beſt Baits, and, as it were, his
true Flies: For, alas! the beſt things he can
give, are very worthleſs, moſt of them in
their own nature, and all of them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of what they muſt coſt us to enjoy
them. But however, Riches, Power, and
the delights of the Senſes are real goods in
their Kind, though they be not of the beſt
Kind: Yet alas, many of us are ſo fitted
for deceits, that we do not put this ſubtle
Angler, to make uſe of his true Baits to
catch us! we ſuffer him to abuſe us much
more groſsly, and to cheat us with empty
titles of Honour, or the enſnaring Smiles
of great ones, or diſquieting Drugeries
diſguis'd with the ſpecious names of great
imployments. And though theſe, when
they muſt be obtain'd by ſin, or are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
as the recompences for it, be, as I was
going to ſay, but the Devils counterfeit
Flies; Yet, as if we were fond of being

Dim-ſighted are we, as well to what Vice
ſhews, as to what it hides. Let us not then
(concludes <hi>Euſebius)</hi> riſe at Baits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may be ſure to be either groſsly, or

ever ventures to commit a Sin, to taſte the

to confirm this laſt part of his
Reflection, for he had ſcarce made an end

Philoſophers (ſays hereupon <hi>Euſebius)</hi>

good Fortune; but yet indeed he does not
enjoy his wiſh, though he ſeem to have the
thing wiſh'd for within his power, for by
the ſame action in which he ſuck'd in the
Fly, he likewiſe took in the Hook, which
does ſo wound and tear his tender Gills,
and thereby put him into ſuch reſtleſs pain,
that no doubt he wiſhes that the Hook,
Bait, and all, were out of his torn Jaws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the one putting him to too much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Thus men, which do what they ſhould not,
to obtain any Object of their ſenſual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
whatever Pleaſure they may before
hand fancy to themſelves in their ſucceſs,
are oftentimes, ev'n when they obtain then

ſometimes Conſcience, Reaſon, or Honour,
making them, ev'n when their deſires are

Officers obtain'd it, could not find in his
heart to Drink it, but pour'd it untaſted on
the Ground. But when the things we ſo
long for muſt be criminally obtain'd, then
it not only often fares with them, as it did
with <hi>Amnon,</hi> who immediately upon the
inceſtuous fruition of his raviſh'd Siſter,
hated her more than before he had lov'd
her; but it ſometimes happens to thoſe that
ſin more heinouſly in this matter, as it did
to <hi>Judas,</hi> who, after having betray'd a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
that was incomparably more worth
than all the World, and thereby for ever
loſt himſelf for a few pieces of Silver,
ſeem'd to have it in his power, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it in his will, to enjoy them, and in a
deſperate, but unſeaſonable, fit of anguiſh

And ev'n in caſes far leſs heinous, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<hi>Euſebius)</hi> when Men ſeem to have

                  <p>THe fight of ſome Fiſhes playing to
and fro upon the top of the VVater,
diverted us from proſecuting our Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and drew us to apply our ſelves at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
to the catching of them, in which
accordingly we ſpent ſome part of the
Morning; yet whilſt we continu'd Angling,
not far from one another, we often caſt our
Eyes (as is uſual in ſuch caſes) upon each
others fiſhing Corks, to learn as well the
ſucceſſes of our Friends, as in what places the
Fiſh were forwardeſt to bite: As I chanc'd
to look towards that Cork at which <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>'s
Hook was hanging, I perceiv'd that
it was divers times drawn under VVater,
without his endeavouring thereupon to
ſtrike that Fiſh that made thus bold with his
Bait; wherefore laying down my Angle a
while, I went ſoftly towards <hi>Euſebius,</hi> to ſee
what it was that made him ſo regardleſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54159:129"/>
of his Sport, whilſt yet, by the poſture be
continu'd in, he ſeem'd to be intent upon it:
But approaching near enough, I quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
That inſtead of minding his Hook,
his Eyes were fixt ſometimes upon his own
Picture, reflected from the ſmooth Surface
of the gliding ſtream, and ſometimes upon
the Shadow projected by his Body, a little
beſide the Picture upon the ſame River.</p>
                  <p>The unwilling noiſe I made in coming ſo
near, having oblig'd <hi>Euſebius</hi> to take notice
of me, I thought fit, ſince I found I was
diſcover'd, to ask him ſmilingly, whether
he were <hi>Narciſſus</hi>-like, making Love to his
own Shadow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euſebius</hi> gheſſing by theſe words, that I
had conjectur'd what he was doing, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
me with a look ſomewhat more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than that I had ſpoken to him with; I
was indeed, <hi>Philaretus,</hi> attentively enough
conſidering, ſometimes my Picture, which
the VVater preſents me with, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Shadow, which the Sun and I to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
caſt upon the Water; But (ſays
he, with a half Smile) I look'd upon both
theſe, not with the Eyes of a <hi>Narciſſuss,</hi>
(for that would make <hi>me</hi> much Madder than
<hi>he</hi> was) but with thoſe of a Chriſtian:
For I was conſidering, that one of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
betwixt the Law, and the Goſpel,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54159:129"/>
might not be ill repreſented by the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt a common Looking-glaſs, and
that afforded me by this Cryſtal ſtream:
For though both being ſpecular Bodies, I
can ſee my Face in either; yet if my Face
be ſpotted with Dirt, or grown Pale by
reaſon of the Faintneſs uſual in ſuch hot
VVeather, a common Looking-glaſs will
indeed diſcover thoſe things to me, but will
not otherwiſe aſſiſt me to remedy them;
whereas, when I conſult this Stream, if it
ſhew me any ſpots in my Face, it ſupplies
me with water to waſh them off, and by
its cooling, and refreſhing VVaters, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me from that Faintneſs that reduces
me to look Pale.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Law, which is commonly, and
which ſeems ev'n by an Apoſtle to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a <hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> ſhews us indeed
the pollutions of our Souls, and diſcovers
to us the effects of our ſpiritual I anguid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Faintneſs; but the Goſpel does
not only do ſo, but tells the Embracers of
it, by Saint <hi>John</hi>'s mouth, <hi>If any Man ſin,
we have an Advocate with the Father Jeſus
Chriſt, the Righteous, who is the Propitiation
for our ſins, and whoſe Blood cleanſes us from
all ſin.</hi> And the Author of the ſame Goſpel
invites all thoſe, that find themſelves tired
and thirſty, to come unto him, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:54159:130"/>
By this time, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who was Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
not very far off, perceiving us ſtand
together, as if we were engaged in ſome
Diſcourſe, laid by his Rod a while, and came
to liſten to what he expected he might
learn from <hi>Euſebius;</hi> who pauſing here, I
put him in mind, that he had alſo mentioned
to me the ſight of his Shadow upon the face
of the River, as another object of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,
and that therefore my curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
(wherein I knew <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as ſoon
as I ſhould acquaint him with the occaſion,
would ſhare) made me very deſirous to
know what thoughts had been ſuggeſted to
him, by a Subject that ſeem'd ſo ſlight and
barren.</p>
                  <p>Since you will needs know, (replies
<hi>Euſebius)</hi> I will confeſs to you, that my
Thoughts were Theologically enough em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
and therefore, leaſt you ſhould
think, I affect to Preach out of the Pulpit,
I will but ſuccinctly mention ſome of theſe
Various things, that this Shadow, as deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable
as you think it, ſuggeſted to me:
But ſince I was only entertaining and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
my ſelf, not diſcourſing with Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts,
or diſputing with Atheiſts, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
you will not wonder, that I take the
Doctrine of the Creation for granted, as it
is acknowledged by Chriſtians in general,
and particularly by You.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:54159:130"/>
I was then conſidering, that this Shadow,
related to me, might in ſome particulars be
no unfit one of the Univerſe in reference to
God: And indeed, perhaps the VVorld
may without much extravagance be tearmed
the Shadow of him, of whoſe Attributes,
or Perfections, it exhibites to an attentive
conſiderer divers excellent Impreſſes, and
the reſemblance may thus far be advanc'd,
that as though it repreſents the Shape and
Out-lines of my Body, which projects it,
yet it repreſents but them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this Shadow in reference to it is but a
ſuperficial and worthleſs thing; ſo the
VVorld, though it be not deſtitute of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Impreſſes, and as it were Lineaments or
Features of the Divine Wiſdome and
Power, yet for all this, its repreſentations
of the Divine Author of it, are but very
Imperfect, Superficial, and Dark, and the
Excellency of the Adorable Author of
things, keeps him infinitely above all the
works that he has made.</p>
                  <p>But to mention ſome of the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
I took notice of: In the firſt place we
may conſider, that I make this Shadow
here without taking the leaſt pains to do
ſo,<note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 9.</note> and with as little toyl God
made the VVorld: <hi>He ſpake, and
it was done; He commanded, and it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54159:131"/>
stood fast,</hi> (ſays the Pſalmiſt, ſpeaking of
the Creation) and elſewhere the
Scripture ſays,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 40. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>That the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, the Lord, the Creator of
the ends of the Earth fainteth not, neither is
weary,</hi> and therefore that Reſt aſcrib'd him
on the ſeventh Day, is to be underſtood but
a Ceſſation from Creating, not a Repoſe
from Labour, for all diſproportions to the
power of created Agents, are ſo equally
inconſiderable, in reference to one that is
Infinite, that Omnipotence may make even
the World without Toyl.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To make this Shadow, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſe nor need Colours, nor Pencil; I
digg no Quarries, nor fell no Trees to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
this work, and employ no Materials
about it; As little had God any Pre-exiſtent
matter to contrive into this vaſt Fabrick:
Our Creed proclaims him the Creator of
Heaven and Earth;<note place="margin">Revel. 10. 6.</note> the Angel,
that holds the Book, in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
deſcribes him reſembling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That through
Faith we underſtand that the Worlds
were framed by the word of God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 8.</note>
                     <hi>ſo that things which are ſeen, were
not made of things that do appear:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it became an Omnipotent Architect,
not to be beholden but to himſelf for his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54159:131"/>
Materials. He that calleth things that are
not, as though they were, makes them by
calling them; <hi>He brought forth Light out
of Darkneſs, by calling for Light, and there
was Light; he ſpake it, and it was done,</hi> ſays
the Pſalmiſt; and the VVorld was, if I may
ſo expreſs it, but the real Eccho of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive,
<hi>FIAT.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing, I was conſidering, was,
that, to deſtroy this Shadow, I needed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sword, nor Piſtol, the withdrawing of
my ſelf under the Neighbouring Trees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſufficient to make the Shadow diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and leave behind as little ſhape of it,
as if there never had been any. And thus,
as the VVorld could not have had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
without having been provided by
God, ſo for the continuance of the Being
it enjoys, it depends altogether, and every
moment, upon the will and pleaſure of its
firſt Author, of whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,
<hi>That in Him, we not only live, and move, but
have our being;</hi> and to the ſame purpoſe
I think one may allege that place, where the
Scripture ſays of God, not
only,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the 9. and the 6.</note> 
                     <hi>That he has made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Heaven of Heavens
with all their Hoaſt, the Earth and all things
that are thereon, the Seas and all that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;</hi>
but adds, <hi>That he preſerveth them all,</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:54159:132"/>
as our Tranſlatours Engliſh it; for in the
Hebrew I remember it is, <hi>Vivifies them all,</hi>
that is, ſuſtains them in that improper Kind
of Life, or that Exiſtence, which, whilſt their
Nature laſts, belongs unto it; ſo that if
God ſhould at any time withdraw his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
Influence, the World would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
Relapſe, or Vaniſh into its firſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as there are many Notions of the
Mind ſuch, as that of Genus, and Species,
which are ſo the Creatures of Reaſon, that
they have no longer an Exiſtence in the
nature of things, than they are actually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
therein, by being actually thought upon
by ſome Intellectual Being; And God is
ſo the preſerver of all his Creatures, that
one may ſay of the reſt, as the Pſalmiſt
ſpeaks of many of them, where addreſſing
himſelf to God, he ſays, <hi>Thou
hidest thy Face,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 29, 30.</note> 
                     <hi>they are troubled;
Thou takeſt away their Breath, they
Dye, and return to their Duſt; Thou ſendest
forth thy Spirit, they are Created, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was alſo taking notice, (purſues <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius)</hi>
that to produce what changes I
pleas'd, in all, or any part of this Shadow;
I needed not employ either Emiſſaries, or
Inſtruments, nor ſo much as rowſe up my
ſelf to any difficult Exertion of my own
ſtrength, ſince, by only moving this or that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54159:132"/>
part of my own Body, I could change at
pleaſure in the twinkling of an Eye, the
figure and poſture of what part of the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
I thought fit: And thus, when God
had a mind to work thoſe Miracles, we
moſt admire, as when at <hi>Joſuah</hi>'s prayer he
ſtop'd the courſe of the Sun, and at <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>'s,
made him go back, we Men are
apt to imagine that theſe prodigious Effects
muſt needs coſt their Author much, and that
he muſt ſtrain his Power, and be neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a troubleſome Exertion of his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence,
to be able to produce them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
to that Divine Agent, thoſe things that
would be to all others impoſſible, are ſo far
from being difficult, and the Creatures have
ſo abſolute and continual a dependance on
him, that 'tis as eaſie for him to effect the
greateſt Alterations in them, as to reſolve
to do ſo, And even thoſe Miraculous
changes of the courſe of Nature, that do
the moſt aſtoniſh us, do ſo naturally and
neceſſarily flow from the Motions of his
own Will, that to decree, and to execute,
(whether or no they require powers other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than Notionally differing) are alike
eaſie to him: And that irreſiſtible Agent
finds as little more difficulty to produce the
greateſt changes among the Creatures, than
to produce the leaſt; as I find it harder to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54159:133"/>
move the whole Arm of my Shadow, than
to move its little Finger. And this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
(ſubjoyns <hi>Euſebius)</hi> might be, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought,
conſolatory enough to his Church,
who by repoſing an entire truſt in her God,
entitles her ſelf to the protection of him,
that can as eaſily produce changes in the
VVorld, as reſolve on them, and can with
the ſame facility deſtroy her and his greateſt
Enemies, as decree their Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>I was alſo further conſidering, (ſays
<hi>Euſebius)</hi> That though the little wat'ry
Bodies, that make up this River, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
thoſe that glided along by me,
were in a reſtleſs Motion, the hindmoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
urging on, and chaſing thoſe that were
before them, yet my Shadow was as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and ſtable upon the fugitive Stream,
as if it had been projected on the water of
a Pond, or rather as if all the parts of
VVater, whereon 'twas Viſible, had been
fixt and moveleſs; of which I made this
Application, that though we may ſay with
<hi>Solomon,</hi> in a larger ſence than his, <hi>That one
Generation goes, and another comes,</hi> the
VVorld being maintained by perpetual Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes
of Generation and Corruption,
yet the Wiſdome and Providence of God
does ſo far confine the Creatures to the
eſtabliſh'd Laws of Nature, that though
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54159:133"/>
vaſt Multitudes of Individualls are always
giving place to others, yet the particular
Creatures, which do at any time make up
the VVorld, do always exhibit the like Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of its divine Original.</p>
                  <p>But yet laſtly, (ſays <hi>Euſebius)</hi> I was
conſidering too, that though this Shadow
have ſome kind of reſemblance to that,
whoſe Shadow it is, yet the Picture is but
very ſuperficial and obſcure; And if we
ſhould ſuppoſe, the Fiſhes that inhabit this
Stream, to be endued with reaſon, they
could even from <hi>Lindamors</hi> ſhadow but col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
that the Original is a Man, and not a
Brute; but they could not hence make any
diſcovery of what manner of Man he is,
nor know any thing of his Virtues, or his
Thoughts, or his Intention, nor conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have that Notion of him, that I (pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
<hi>Euſebius,</hi> turning to him, and a little
Smiling on him) do harbour and cheriſh,
who having the happineſs to converſe with
him, have the opportunity and the juſtice
to admire him. Thus, where I formerly
ventured to call the VVorld Gods Shadow,
I did not forget, how imperfect a Picture a
Shadow is wont to be: And though this
dark Repreſentation, that God has vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaf'd
Men of himſelf in the Univerſe, be
ſufficient to convince us, that it was not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54159:134"/>
made by chance, but produced by a Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and Intelligent Being; the eternal
Power and God-head of the Great Author
of Nature, as the Scripture ſeems to teach
us, being manifeſted to attentive and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Conſiderers, in the viſible productions
of his Power and VViſdome; yet how
ſhort and dim a Knowledge muſt they have
of him, that have no other than theſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Inſtructors. How many of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Attributes are there, for whoſe Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
we muſt be beholden, rather to his
VVritten, than his Created Word? and
how little will humane Intellects, without
Revelation, diſcover of that manifold VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, which the Scripture teaches
us,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>That even to the Angels it must
be made known by the Church.</hi> And
if thoſe Illuminated perſons, ſuch
as <hi>Moſes</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who had
both extraordinary Revelations from God,
and intimate Communion with him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that in this Life they ſaw him but
Darkly, and, as it were, in a Glaſs; ſure
the Dim light of meer Nature will give
us but extremely imperfect, and detracting
Idea's of him, whom the like Limitedneſs
of our Nature will allow us to know but
very imperfectly, in Heaven it ſelf, though
as we ſhall there ſee him Face to Face, our
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54159:134"/>
apprehenſive Faculties will as well be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
as the dazling and raviſhing Object
be diſcloſed.</p>
                  <p>But, (ſays <hi>Euſebius)</hi> though I forget,
that I am not in the Pulpit, I hope you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that I told you at firſt, how little
I pretended theſe kind of Reflections would
endure a rigorous Philoſophical Examen,
and that I am not ſo Indiſcreet, as to expect
that they ſhould work Conviction in an
Infidel, though I hope they may excite good
Thoughts in a Believer.</p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt words of our Friend being not
followed by any other; <hi>Lindamor,</hi> having
waited a while to aſcertain himſelf, that
<hi>Euſebius</hi> had ended his Diſcourſe, began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
by ſaying:</p>
                  <p>I perceive, <hi>Euſebius,</hi> with much more
ſatisfaction than ſurpriſe, that the ſame
Subject, and at the ſame time, did, as 'twas
fit, ſuggeſt very differing conſiderations to
you and me; for whilſt your Shadow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
you the riſe of ſublime Speculations,
I was making but a moral Reflection upon
mine: For taking notice, (continues he)
that the Shade my Body projected, near
Noon, was almoſt as much ſhorter than it,
as in the Morning it was longer, prompted
me to think, how fooliſh it were for me,
who know by ſure ways of meaſuring my
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54159:135"/>
own Statute, that it is moderate enough,
not to be either proud of, or complain'd of,
ſhould imagine that I am either as Tall as a
Gyant, or as Low as a Dwarf, becauſe I ſee
my Shadow either exceeding long, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ſhort; and I was further conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
purſues <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that if Philoſophers,
as well as the Vulgar, have rightly called
Fame or Glory the Shadow of Virtue, it
would be as irrational to eſtimate ones ſelf
not by the teſtimonies of ones Conſcience,
which is the Authentick ſtandard of Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
worth, but by the ſickle Opinions of
others, (which oftentimes flatter, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
detract) but very ſeldome give a juſt
and impartial eſtimate of merit: The
Fame may have its encreaſe, and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whilſt the Perſon continues the ſame,
and loſes nothing of ſubſtance with the
Shadow. And for a Man that ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
himſelf, and judge of himſelf by his
own deſigns, and actions, not other Mens
words, to ſuffer himſelf to be puff'd up by
vulgar applauſe, or dejected by unmerited
cenſures, were to miſtake a Shadow for a
Standard.</p>

                  <p>IT was not long after this, that <hi>Eugenius</hi>
chancing to ſpy a little Nook, which
ſeem'd to promiſe him a more convenient
Station for his Angling, he invited <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi>
to ſhare the advantage with him, and
began to walk thitherward along the Rivers
Brink, which the abundant moiſture of the
Waters that glided by it, had adorn'd with
a pleaſant Verdure; But he had not marcht
very far, when chancing to tread on a place,
where the courſe of the Water had worn
off the Bank, and made it hollow under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
he found the Earth falter under him,
and could not hinder his Feet from ſlipping
down with the Turf that betray'd him; nor
could he have eſcaped ſo, had not his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to caſt the weight of his Body
towards the Bank been aſſiſted by <hi>Lindamor,</hi>
who though not ſo near the Brink as to be
in danger, was not ſo far off but that he was
able to catch hold of him, and draw him
to the firm Land. The noiſe that <hi>Lindamor</hi>
made, when he ſaw his Friend falling,
quickly drew <hi>Euſebius</hi> and me thither,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54159:136"/>
where, after I had a while made my ſelf
merry with the Diſaſter, I found to have
been ſo harmleſs; <hi>Euſebius</hi> (who arriv'd
there a little later) as'd him how he came
to fall, and <hi>Eugenius</hi> anſwering, that he
thought he had trod upon firm Ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſaw the Bank look to the very edge
as if it differ'd not from the reſt of the
Field, which it terminated; <hi>Euſebius</hi> took
occaſion from thence to tell him, You may
from this take notice, that 'tis not ſafe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
upon the confines of what is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and what is Sinfull, no more than
upon the Borders of two Hoſtile Nations:
VVhen we ſuppoſe, that thus far we may
go towards that which is Sinfull, without
committing it, we are wont with more
boldneſs than conſiderateneſs to conclude,
that we need not ſcruple to venture, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that we ſhall run no venture, having
firm footing all the way. But 'tis much to
be feared, that when we allow our ſelves
to come as far as the utmoſt Verge of what
is Lawfull, and to do that which in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuists</hi>
Language, is, <hi>tantum non</hi> to Sin, the
natural Proclivity of our minds to Evil,
which carries them downwards, as weight
does our Bodies, will ſometime or other
make us find hollow Ground, where we
preſume to find it firm: He that to Day
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54159:136"/>
will go towards Sin as far as he thinks he
may, is in danger of going to Morrow fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than he ſhould; And it is far more
eaſie for him to be ſecure than to be ſafe,
that walks upon the Brink of a Precipice.
He was a wiſe Man, that as ſoon as he had
forbidden his Son to enter into the path of
the Wicked, and to go in the way of Evil
men, ſubjoyns, as the beſt courſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Preſcription, avoid it, paſs not

indulgence leaves us a Latitude to comply
with our Infirmities, and Neceſſities, and to
give us opportunities of exerciſing a pious
Jealouſie over our ſelves, and of ſhewing
how much we fear to offend him. But a

And he muſt often go further than

I cannot think we ought to throw away

which whilſt they flow'd Calmly <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

Incompatible with Innocence, whilſt 'tis

But when once Anger is Boyl'd up into
Rage, or Choler into an habitual Fury, or
appetite of Revenge, it makes more Havok
in the VVorld than Beaſts and Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
The greateſt part of thoſe <hi>Rivers of

the unnatural Thirſt of that <hi>inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate

that wield Scepters, and handle Swords.</p>
                  <p>I will not tell <hi>Lindamor,</hi> That ev'n that
nobleſt and beſt of Paſſions, <hi>Love,</hi> as gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and amiable as it appears, when once it
comes to degenerate by growing Unruly,
or being Miſplac'd, is guilty of far more
Tragedies than thoſe that have the fortune
to be Acted on Theatres, or to furniſh the
VVriters of Romances; and that which
(perchance at firſt) ſeems to be but an
<hi>Innocent Love,</hi> being not duely watch'd, and
regulated, may, in time, grow to diſobey,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54159:139"/>
or deceive Parents, to violate Friendſhips,

in <hi>Virtue,</hi> and in <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> when

are Sacrifices that are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
offer'd up to Ambition, than able
to ſatisfie it: For what can quench his
Thurſt of Rule and Fame, or hinder the
Attempts to which it ſtimulates him, that
can find in his Heart to deſtroy Armies, and
ruine Provinces, only that he may be taken
notice off to be able to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>Certainly (ſubjoyns <hi>Euſebius)</hi> he knew

them ſo haſtily, and ſo plentifully, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince we can ſee no Chanels, nor
other manifeſt Inlets, and Receptacles, that
ſhould divert and retain the fugitive Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſo that the Grounds confining on the
River, muſt be but little advantag'd by its
Neighbourhood. But, (continues <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius)</hi>
though theſe Grounds have not any
patent Paſſages, whereby to derive Water
and Fatneſs from the River, and therefore
muſt ſuffer the greateſt part of it to run by
them undiverted, yet ſtill ſome of the
Cheriſhing and Fertilizing moiſture is from
time to time ſoak'd in by the Neighbouring
Ground, and (perhaps by blind Pores, and
crooked Chanels) ſo diſperſed thorow the
whole Fields, that they have thereby Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in that vehicle Fertility convey'd
to them, which you will not doubt, if you
do but with me take notice, how much the
Lands that lye on both ſides near the Courſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54159:141"/>
of the River, are more Verdant, and Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing,
and more Rich than thoſe leſs happy
Grounds, to whom their Remoteneſs denies
the advantage of ſo improving a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                  <p>Thus (reſumes <hi>Euſebius)</hi> many a pious
Perſon that is an Aſſiduous attendant on the
means of Grace, and has a care to place
himſelf as it were in the way, by which the
Ordinances of God, eſpecially thoſe of
Reading, and Expounding of the Scriptures,
are wont freely and copiouſly to flow, is
(eſpecially upon any fit of Melancholy, or
diſtreſs of Mind) apt to be extremely
diſcourag'd from proſecuting that courſe of
Duties, and by looking upon the little that
he remembers of ſo many excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
as he has heard, he is often inclined
to conclude not only he has loſt all the
good Sermons that he has heard already,
but that at leaſt for ſuch as he there is little
to be expected from them for the future.</p>
                  <p>But though to loſe ſo much of a thing,
ſo precious as the Doctrine of Salvation,
be that, which is oftentimes a fault, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
an unhappineſs, yet 'tis a far leſs
Miſchief to forget Sermons than to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
them, the one may be but an effect of
a weak Memory, the other is that of a
depraved Will, perverted by Lazineſs, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54159:141"/>
or ſome greater fault, we ſhould
ſcarce allow it for a Rational proceeding;
if one in a Conſumption, or Diſentery,
becauſe he grows not Fat with Feeding,
ſhould reſolve to renounce Eating and
Drinking.</p>
                  <p>But this (ſays <hi>Euſebius)</hi> is not that which
I chiefly intended: For Pious, but melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Perſons, are oftentimes too Partial
againſt themſelves, to be competent Judges
of their own Eſtate, they ſeem not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
any Sermon ſo much as that, Charity
ſhould begin at home; And they are much
more carefull not to accuſe any body wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
than themſelves, though they might
remember, that in the Eſtimate of Chriſt
himſelf, all Grounds are not equally Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that are good, ſome bringing forth hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
ſome ſixty, ſome but thirty Fold,
and yet to all he vouchſafes the title of
Good; and though, as mad Men that have
quite loſt their VVits, ſeldome or never
complain of the want of them; ſo thoſe
that have forfeited, or are devoid of Grace,
rarely bemoan themſelves of the weakneſs
of it. And 'tis no mean ſign of Proficiency
in Piety, to be apt to deplore ones unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency;
'Tis true, that Preaching is not
always, and I fear not ſo much as often, the
Savour <hi>of Life unto Life,</hi> the Perverſneſs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54159:142"/>
of the Hearers making it but too frequently
the Savour <hi>of Death unto Death.</hi> But yet,
ſpeaking in the general, though it aggravate
the Sins committed in ſpite of it, yet it
uſually hinders many others from being
committed; and he that twice a VVeek is
told of God, and Duty, and Heaven, and
Hell, has his Conſcience more awak'd than
he that never hears of any of theſe things.
And if you but compare one of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
Chriſtians, we are conſidering,
with the careleſs Senſualiſts, that fly a row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Sermon, as they ſhould do what it
would deter them from; you will eaſily
diſcern a ſufficient diſparity between them,
to invite you to conclude, that the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs
of Preaching may, like the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the River, be convey'd but by little
and little at a time, and by unperceived
Paſſages, and yet be able to impart Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility:
For though much run by, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſomething will ſtick, which we may
ſafely conclude, if though we can diſcern
it no other way, it diſcloſe it ſelf by the
Effects; for 'tis not always to thoſe that
remember the moſt of them, that Sermons
do the moſt good, as VVater retained in
Ponds makes not the Bottom flouriſhing,
but the Banks, and the Efficacy of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
is better to be collected from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54159:142"/>
it has on the Underſtanding, and
Affections, than from that it leaves on the
Memory, whether we retain the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
faithfully or no, and carry them home
with us; yet if a Sermon leave us Devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than it found us, if we go from God's
Ordinances, with a love to them, and a
relliſh of them, and a purpoſe to frequent
them, we may be Deſpondents, but are not
altogether Non-proficients; that incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Seed by which we are Regenerated,
being once thrown into an honeſt Heart,
may, as our Saviour intimates, grow up we
know not well how, and though perhaps
by inſenſible degrees, yet at length attain
Maturity. To diſpatch, (concludes <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius)</hi>
whether or no a Man can orderly
repeat all the Particulars that compoſed the
Sermon, it does him good, if it either
makes him good, or keeps him ſo: And its
Operation is to be eſtimated, not ſo much
by what we Remember, as by what we
Reſolve.</p>
                  <p>What you have been ſaying, (ſubjoyns
<hi>Lindamor)</hi> when he perceived that <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
had done ſpeaking, ſuggeſts to me a
Reflection, that till now I did not dream
of; And though it differ from that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you have been pleaſed to entertain us,
yet becauſe 'tis applicable to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54159:143"/>
and occaſioned by the ſame River, I
ſhall without ſcruple, though after your
Diſcourſe, not without Bluſhes, tell you,
that it is this; I, among many others that
Live near it, have often reſorted in hot
Weather to this River, to bathe my ſelf in
it, and after what I have been hearing, I
now begin to conſider, that though incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
the greater part of the River run
by me, without doing me any good, and
though when I went out of it, I carried
away little or none of it with me; yet
whilſt I ſtayed in it, that very Stream,
whoſe Waters run ſo faſt away from me,
waſhed and carried off whatever Foulneſs
it might find ſticking to my Skin: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
not only cooled me, and refreſhed
me, by allaying the intemperate heat that
diſcompoſed me, and made me faint, but
alſo help'd me to a good Stomach for ſome
while after.</p>
                  <p>Thus (reſumes <hi>Lindamor)</hi> I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
found, that a moving Sermon, though
it did not find me qualified to derive from
it the Advantages it queſtionleſs afforded
better Auditors, and when I went
from it, I found I had retained ſo little of
it, that it ſeemed to have almoſt totally
ſlipt out of my Memory, yet the more
Inſtructive and Pathetick paſſages of it had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54159:143"/>
that Operation upon me, as to cleanſe the
Mind from ſome of the Impurities it had
contracted, by Converſing to and fro in
a defiling World, without ſuffering Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
to ſtay long, and ſettle where they
began to be Harboured; And beſides, I
found that a courſe of ſuch Sermons, as I
have been mentioning, did oftentimes (and
if it had not been my own fault, would have
always done ſo) both allay thoſe Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
heats that tempting Objects are but
too apt to Excite; refreſh my drooping
Spirits, that continually needed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
and raiſe in me an Appetite to the
means of Grace, which are Piety's (and
conſequently the Soul's) true and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Aliments. So that, (concludes <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor)</hi>
though I ſeldome let Sermons do
me all the good they may, and ſhould, yet
I dare not forſake them, becauſe I forget
them; ſince 'tis to do a Man ſome good, to
make him leſs bad than he was, and to give
a Value and Inclination for the means of
growing better than he is.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Upon a Fiſhes running away with the
Bait.</head>
                  <p>THis Reflection of <hi>Lindamor's</hi> was soon
follow'd by another of the ſame
Gentleman's, who ſeeing many Fiſhes riſe
one after another, and bite at <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s
Bait, which he let them ſometimes run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with, that he might be the ſurer to be
able to draw them up, as he afterwards did
ſeveral of them; See, (ſays <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as
one of the Fiſhes had juſt ſwallowed the
Hook) how yonder ſilly Fiſh, having at
length ſeized the beloved Bait, he has been
Courting, poſts away with it as his obtained
wiſh, little dreaming of being himſelf ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
Thus (continues the ſame Speaker)
when greedy Mortals have an opportunity
to obtain forbidden things, they joyfully run
away with them as the Goods they aimed
at, and when they fondly think they have
caught, they are ſo, and whilſt they imagine
themſelves to carry away a Booty, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Prey; for that he is in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that never errs, who, whatever he
gets into the Bargain, loſes himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture, (ſubjoyns <hi>Euſebius)</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54159:144"/>
among other properties of Vice, that
which it calls the Deceitfulneſs of Sin.
And the wiſe Man tells us, that Wine is a
Mocker; and it may be one of the reaſons
of theſe Expreſſions, that when we think
our ſelves poſſeſſed of a ſinfull Pleaſure,
we are indeed poſſeſſed by it, as Doeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacks
are poſſeſſed by the Divel, who ſerves
many other Sinners, though leſs perceived<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he ſerves Witches, whom he gets the
Power to command, by ſeeming to obey
them, and to comply with their criminal
deſires; And, if we compare this, with
what I was juſt now obſerving to you, on
the occaſion of the counterfeit Fly, we may
add, That even when Sin ſeems the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt Obſequious to us, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
if not exceed our Deſires, our caſe
may be but like the Canaanitiſh General's,
who though he had Milk brought him by
<hi>Jael</hi> inſtead of the Water he only requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was but thereby invited <hi>to
Sleep the Sleep of Death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judges 4. 29.</note> and to
have his Fears more ſurpaſs'd than
his Deſires had been.</p>
                  <p>But, (purſues <hi>Euſebius)</hi> this may ſupply
us with another Reflection; for though this
Fiſh ſeems to have devoured the Hook and
Bait it ſwallowed, yet in effect it is taken
thereby; ſo the Divel, when he had played
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54159:145"/>
the Serpent and the Lion, when he had
brought the Jews and Gentiles to conſpire
againſt their common Saviour, and had
made <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> friends to make them
joynt Enemies to Chriſt, and when by theſe
means he ſeemed to have obtained his end,
by employing their hands to Kill the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midableſt
of all his Enemies, this purſued
Prey deſtroyed the ſeeming Conquerour;
and Death appearing to ſwallow the Lord
of Life, was, if I may ſo ſpeak, choaked
by the Attempt, ſince he not only was

                  <p>THis Diſcourſe being ended, <hi>Eugenius,</hi>
who was look'd upon by us all as the
moſt Experienc'd as well as concerned
Angler among us, deſcrying at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
a place which he judged more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for our Sport, than that we there
were in, where the Fiſh began to bite but
ſlowly; He invited the Company to this
new Station, but when we were come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
finding in a ſhort time, that either it
was ill ſtock'd with Fiſh, or that the Seaſon
of their Biting in the places thereabouts
was over, he thought it concerned him to
provide us ſome better place; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
whilſt we were yet, by the pleaſure
of mutual converſation, endeavouring to
keep the Fiſhes ſulleneſs from proving an
Exerciſe to our patience, he walk'd on along
the River, till he lighted upon a Youth, that
by his Habit ſeem'd to belong to ſome Boat
or other Veſſel; and having enquir'd of
him, whether he could not be our Guide to
ſome place where the Fiſh would bite
quick, he replied, that he eaſily could, if
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54159:146"/>
we would take the trouble of coming to a
place on the other ſide of the River, which
his Maſter, who was a Fiſher-man, had
Baited over Night, and would queſtionleſs
let us make uſe of for a ſmall Gratification;
<hi>Eugenius,</hi> being very well content, call'd
away the Company, which were led by the
Youth to a Boat belonging to his Maſter,
into which being entred, the old Man, who
was owner of the Boat, hoys'd up Sails,
and began to ſteer the Boat with one of his
Oars, to a place he ſhewed us at a good
diſtance off, but did it ſo unskilfully, that
ſince a Mariner of his Age could ſcarce
miſtake ſo groſsly for want of Experience
in the River, we began to ſuſpect, that he
had too plentifully taſted a far ſtronger Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
than that which was the Scene of his
Trade; and as the old Man was half Drunk,
ſo the Youth appeared to be a meer Novice,
both which we had quickly occaſion to take
notice off: For ſome Clouds that were
gathering out of the Sea, paſſing over our
Veſſel, rais'd in their paſſage, as is uſual
enough, a temporary Wind, that to ſuch a
ſlight Boat as ours was, might almoſt paſs
for a kind of Storm; For then the old
Man gave out his directions ſo ill, and the
Youth was ſo little able to execute them
punctually, that two of the Company of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54159:146"/>
at their unskilfulneſs, began by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and unſeaſonable Expoſtulations and
Clamours, to confound the already diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Boat-man, and being got up, with no
ſmall hazard to the Boat, they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
by croſſing the VVater-men in
their endeavours, have made it miſcarry,
had not <hi>Lindamor,</hi> whoſe Travels had made
him well acquainted with ſuch caſes, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
requeſted them to ſit ſtill, and let the
VVater-men do their own work as well as
they could, affirming, that he had ſeen more
than one of thoſe eaſily over-ſet Boats caſt
away by the confuſed and diſagreeing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of the VVater-men and Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to preſerve it: This counſel was
thought very reaſonable, ſince the greater
the VVind was, and the leſs the Steerman's
dexterity, the more neceſſary it appear'd,
that we ſhould be orderly and quiet, and
by leaning our Bodies ſometimes one way,
and ſometimes another, as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
do what in us lay to keep the Veſſel
upright, and herein we were ſo proſperous,
that ſoon after the Cloud was paſſed, and
the Shower it brought with it was over, the
VVind grew moderate enough to allow us
to make ſome calm Reflections on what had
happened: This <hi>Lindamor,</hi> from the thanks
that were given him for his advice, took
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54159:147"/>
occaſion to do in theſe tearms: Since States-men
and Philoſophers are wont to compare
a Common-wealth to a Ship, I hope the
Reflection ſuggeſted to us by what had juſt
now happen'd, will be the eaſier pardon'd.
The skil of ruling Nations, is an Art no leſs
difficult than noble; for whereas Statuaries,
Maſons, Carpenters, and other Artificers
work upon inanimate Materials, a Ruler muſt
manage free Agents, who may have each
of them intereſts or deſigns of their own,
diſtinct from thoſe of the Prince, and many
times repugnant to them: And the Prizes
that are contended for in Government,
either are, or (which is in our caſe all one)
are thought, ſo Valuable, and the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are ſo Concern'd, and conſequently ſo
Induſtrious to drive on each his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
that without mentioning any of thoſe
many other things which make good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
difficult, theſe alone may ſuffice
to make it more our trouble than our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the Rulers of States and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
ſhould oftentimes miſ-govern
them. But the publick Infelicities of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
States, are not always wholly due to
the Imprudence of the Ruler, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
thoſe that moſt reſent ſuch Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
even by thoſe very Reſentments,
encreaſe the publick Diſorders they appear
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54159:147"/>
ſo much troubled at; and it may be a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
Whether it be more prejudicial to
Common-wealths, to have Rulers that are
mean States-men, than to have a Multitude
of Subjects, that think themſelves to be
VViſe ones, and are forward to Cenſure
what is done by their Magiſtrates, either
becauſe it is done by their Superiours, or
becauſe 'tis not done by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Yet it may well be doubted, (ſays <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius)</hi>
whether the Reverence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
we owe to Senates, or Princes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to our very Reaſons, and our inward
Thoughts: For the Right, and the Skil to
Govern, are two very diſtinct things; nor
does the one confer the other: A Crown,
how pretious ſoever, adorns but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of the Head, without enriching the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide;
and its Splendour will ſcarce dazle
a VViſe beholders Eyes, though it but too
often does theirs that wear it: No, the
Tribunal of reaſon has a Juriſdiction that
reaches to Thrones themſelves, and what
you well obſerved juſt now concerning
the difficulty of avoiding faults in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
will, I preſume, make you think it
excuſable, if I confeſs that I think, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
do now and then do what you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
'tis ſo hard for them to avoid doing;
Nor is it more a Breach of Loyalty, not to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54159:148"/>
think a weak Governour a Prudent one,
than not to think him Tall, or Streight, or
Sharp-ſighted, if Nature have made him
Low, or Crooked, or Purblind. A Senate
or a Monarch may indeed command my
Life and Fortune; but as for my Opinions,
whether of Perſons, or things, I cannot in
moſt caſes command them my ſelf, but
muſt ſuffer them to be ſuch as the Nature
of the things I judge of requires; and
therefore, the thinking all things done with
VViſdome that are done by Men in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
is too great an Impoſſibility to be a
Duty; and beſides, it would leſſen the
Merit of Obedience, which otherwiſe would
not appear to be paid to the Authority of
the Magiſtrate, ſince we readily obey the
Injunction of Lawyers and Phyſitians, as
long as we think them Prudently fram'd for
our good, though we acknowledge not
theſe Perſons to have any right to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
us.</p>
                  <p>But though (continues <hi>Eugenius)</hi> I take
Reaſon to be ſo ſupream a thing, that as
even the greateſt Princes Actions ſhould be
regulated by it, ſo they may be judg'd by it;
yet I allow lawfull Authority a Juriſdiction
over my Actions, that I deny it over my
Opinions; and though I can obey the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that have the Impreſſes of VViſdome,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54159:148"/>
as well as the ſtamp of Authority, with
more hope and alacrity, yet I can obey
thoſe wherein I think Power is unguided by
Prudence, with no leſs Punctualneſs and
Fidelity: I would not reſiſt a Magiſtrate
when I cannot eſteem him; and though I
dare diſcern Folly even in the greateſt
Princes, yet I can reverence Authority in the
weakeſt.</p>
                  <p>I know <hi>Eugenius</hi> too well (ſays <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor)</hi>
not to believe him: But though I
confeſs, that to do what you ſay, is to do
much, and to do that which I fear is not
uſually done, yet me-thinks it were well
if we did ſomewhat more; for whereas
moſt humane Actions, eſpecially about
Matters political, are attended with great
variety of Circumſtances, according to ſome
or other of which, they may be differingly
conſidered, and eſtimated, as 'tis not very
difficult to make many, if not moſt Actions
appear politick or unwiſe, according as
they are Cloathed with thoſe of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
that may be applied to excuſe
them, or with thoſe that are fit to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them; ſo I would take a care to put
the favourableſt Conſtructions on thoſe
publick Counſels, that are capable of more
Conſtructions than one, and uſe the Parents
of my Country, as <hi>Noah</hi>'s two dutifull
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54159:149"/>
Children did their diſtemper'd Father,
whoſe Nakedneſs when they had once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
they covered too; and that in
ſuch a way, as ſhewed they were unwilling
to ſee more of it than was neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them to hide it. And I ſay this, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<hi>Lindamor)</hi> with Relation to <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and ſuch as he; for as to the Vulgar,
who yet make up the far greateſt and loudeſt
part of thoſe that would intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into State-affairs, upon the pretence
of their being ill managed by their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours;
I cannot but think, that whatever
the courſe of Affairs be, theſe cannot but
be incompetent Judges of their being Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,
or the contrary: For to judge of
things barely by ſucceſs, were ſomewhat to
forget that there is a ſupream and abſolute
diſpoſer of Events, and has been a practice
always rejected by the Wiſe, as both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
Wiſdome and affronting it;
And as for the Counſels, by which indeed
the Prudence or Imprudence of publick
Actions is to be eſtimated, the Vulgar is
rarely admitted to have ſuch a Proſpect into
the true State of Affairs, as is requiſite to
enable them to judge of the Expedience
or unadviſedneſs of them, being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the frame and Motives of the
Prince's Counſels and Deſigns: Ordinary
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54159:149"/>
Men may often think that Imprudent,
whil'ſt they conſider it only in it ſelf, which
its congruity to the reſt of the Prince's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
may make Politick enough, and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Whiſper, or the Intimation from an
unſuſpected Spy, or an intercepted Letter,
or divers other things unperceiv'd, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
undreamt of, by thoſe that are not of
the State-Cabal, may make it wiſe to do
ſeveral things, which to thoſe that look only
at the Actions, without knowing the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
may appear Unpolitick, and would
indeed be ſo, were it not for theſe Reaſons,
which yet ought to be as little Divulged
as Diſobey'd: So that the Peoples for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs,
to quarrel with the Tranſactions
of their Prince, is uſually compounded of
Pride and Ignorance, and is moſt incident
to thoſe, that do not ſufficiently underſtand
either State-affairs or themſelves; and
whil'ſt they judge upon incompetent Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
even when their Superiours are in
the fault, they may be ſo, for cenſuring
them.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not now diſpute, (ſays <hi>Euſebius)</hi>
whether ſuch as you, Gentlemen, whom
their Conditions, Parts and Opportunities
qualifie to diſcern the Intereſts and Deſigns
of Princes, may not be allowed to judge of
their Counſels, and ſee their Errours; As
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54159:150"/>
our late Aſtronomers, being aſſiſted with
good Glaſſes, are allowed to tell us, that
they diſcern Spots even in the Sun it ſelf.
But certainly, the Ambition of Pragmatical
Inferiours, to make themſelves States-men,
upon pretence that thoſe that ſit at the
Helm do not Govern it as wiſely as theſe
would do, if they were in the ſame places,
is a fault no leſs prejudicial to any State,
than Epidemical in ſome of them: For
whil'ſt the Government is thus Decryed, the
ſame diſadvantageous Repreſentatations em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
Strangers and Forrainers to attempt
the Subverſion of a State, and make the
diſpondent Subjects deſpair of preſerving
it, little conſidering that there are ſcarce
ever any Imprudences in a Government,
that can prove any thing near ſo Prejudicial
to the Generality of the Subjects, as would
the Subverſion of it, whether by Forain
Conqueſt, or by Inteſtine Jarrs; ſuch
changes ſeldome doing leſs than entail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unhappy Countries the fears and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
of Warr. And that though it be
granted, that the right of Governing does
not confer the Skil, yet 'tis much better to
ſtick to the former, than oppoſe or deſert it,
becauſe it wants the latter: For a right to
a Crown, is that, which for the moſt part
manifeſtly belongs but to one, and is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54159:150"/>
plauſibly pretended to by above two
or three, whereas the Skil to Govern is ſo
undetermined, and ſo uncertain a thing, that
Mens Innate pride and Self-love would
encline almoſt every Man to claim it for
himſelf, eſpecially, ſince by challenging
that, he might put for no leſs than Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty:
And in a State thus abandoned
to the craftieſt or the ſtrongeſt, there would
never want diſturbing Viciſſitude of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
as well as Governours, ſince
whoever could get Intereſt enough in the
Souldiery, or the Multitude, would quickly
deviſe and impoſe ſuch a frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as may put the Management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
into his and his Parties hands, and
give them the Authority that have the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
But (reſumes <hi>Euſebius)</hi> I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that not Politicks, but Divinity is
my Profeſſion, and therefore without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
upon the confuſion that is inevitable
in a State, where the right of Governing
being not heeded, or at leaſt not aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
every Man would pretend to Counſel
or Command, and none would think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
bound to Obey; I ſhall only mind you,
that Magiſtracy having been inſtituted by
God, for the good of Mankind, we may in
obeying our Lawfull Magiſtrates, though
perhaps leſs Wiſe than we could wiſh
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54159:151"/>
them, not only participate the Advantages
naturally accruing from Obedience to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
but divers peculiar Bleſſings that
God oftentimes vouchſafes to our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his Vice-gerents, and his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Let Subjects therefore (ſays <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius)</hi>
wiſh for wiſe Princes, but ſubmit to
thoſe the Providence of God, and the Laws
of their Country, may have given them:
Let us, if by any juſt way we be called to
it, aſſiſt a Prince with the wiſeſt Counſels
we can; if not, let us aſſiſt him to make the
beſt of the unwiſe Counſels he has taken,
without adding our Factiouſneſs, or our
Paſſions to his Miſgovernment, remembring
that, at leaſt in my Opinion, to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Common-wealth, it is not only
requiſite that the Prince know how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
well, but that the Subjects obey well;
and that even weak Counſels, faithfully
aſſiſted, and as much as may be rectified or
repaired by thoſe that are to Execute them,
may leſs prejudice the publick, than the
froward and jarring endeavours of Men,
that perhaps would be wiſer Rulers if they
had a right to be ſo. It may be (continues
<hi>Euſebius)</hi> that affection and diligence in
the publick Service, may, in ſpight of the
Governments miſcarriages, prevent, or at
leaſt retard and leſſen, the Ruine of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54159:151"/>
State. But however, (concludes he) it
will be no ſmall ſatisfaction to an honeſt
Man, and a loyal Subject, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
to himſelf of having contributed to
the publick Calamities, either by his own
Provocations, or his Factious indignation
at the Princes faults; if a Man have done
his utmoſt to hinder the Ruine he comes to
be involved in, the publick Calamity will
be far lighter to him, being not clogged by
private Guilt; and he will ſupport the
misfortune of it with far the leſs trouble,
if he be to ſupport nothing elſe. Nay,
ſince the Service we do to whatever Prince
is rightfully ſet over us, upon the ſcore of
his being Gods Vice-gerent, is ultimately
directed to that Supream, and as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
calls him, <hi>Only Potentate,</hi> whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
is as inexhauſted as his Treaſure;
we may ſafely expect, that whatever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
we here ſuſtain upon the account of
the Prince's commands, will hereafter be
advantageouſly conſidered to us in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of our Obedience.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Upon Clouds riſing out of the Sea, and
falling down in Rain not Brackiſh.</head>
                  <p>THis Diſcourſe had already laſted ſo
long, that as well my Unwillingneſs
that one Theme ſhould detain us any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as my Deſire to keep <hi>Eugenius</hi> from
making any Reply, which on ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
might perchance have begot ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
made me forward to divert the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
by inviting the Company to take
notice of a black Cloud that was coming
towards us, which ſoon after, in its paſſage
under the Sun, interpos'd betwixt our Sight
and that gloriouſeſt Object of it. <hi>Lindamor</hi>
then having a while attentively enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
it, took thence an occaſion to ſay:
This Cloud, Gentlemen, whenſoever it
ſhall fall down in Rain, will ſufficiently ſhew
that it was before but VVater, which whilſt
it lay mingl'd with the reſt of the River, or
the Sea, whence 'tis Exhal'd, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
as Clear and Limpid as any of the
reſt; but now that the Sun has by its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Beams elevated this VVater in the form
of Vapours, and drawn it near it ſelf, we
ſee it Compoſes a Cloud, which does no
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54159:152"/>
longer receive or tranſmit the Light, but
robs the Earth of it, and eclipſes the Sun
that rais'd it, and ſometimes too, produces
diſmal ſtorms of Rain, and Wind, and
Hail. Thus (purſues <hi>Lindamor)</hi> there
are many, who while they continu'd in a
low and private Fortune, were as blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
as others; and yet, when by a peculiar
Vouchſafement of Providence, they are
rais'd from that humble ſtate to a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
height, they ſeem to have as much
chang'd their Nature as their Fortune, they
grow as much worſe than meaner Men, as
their condition is better than that of ſuch;
and the principal things by which they make
their Exaltation be taken notice of, are, the
Prejudice they do to their Inferiours, and
the Ingratitude they exerciſe towards that
Monarch of the VVorld, that rais'd them
above others. Of ſo perverting a Nature,
is ſo high a Station, that the gaining of an
Earthly Crown, is very far from being a
furtherance to the acquiring of an Heavenly
one: And many, whom an humble condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Life kept as Innocent as Lowly,
are, by the higheſt Advancement in point
of Fortune, impair'd in point of Morality;
and theſe ſupreme Dignities, which the
ambitious World ſo fondly Courts and
Envies, do ſo often manifeſt thoſe that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54159:153"/>
have attain'd them, to be unworthy of
them.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether <hi>Eugenius</hi> imagin'd
that <hi>Lindamor</hi> did in this Diſcourſe make
ſome little Reflection, upon what we had
lately ſaid on the behalf of Princes: But
I afterwards ſuſpected, that it was partly
to reply to this Obſervation, as well as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the Company with a new one that
he ſubjoyn'd. As this Cloud has furniſh'd
<hi>Lindamor</hi> with one Reflection, ſo that which
lately brought us the Showr of Rain, whoſe
marks are yet upon our Hats, may ſupply
us with another, which may ſhew, that
Themes of this Nature are applicable to
very differing purpoſes, according as one
or other of their Circumſtances happens to
be conſider'd and employ'd: For as far
(purſues he) as we can judge by the
Neighbourhood of the Sea, and by that
Cloud's being driven hither by a VVind
blowing thence, it conſiſted of the Sea-water
rais'd in the form of Vapours. But
though the Water of the Ocean is Salt and
Brackiſh, Unpleaſant and Unwholeſome
whilſt it lies there Unelevated; yet that
Water which has the Advantage of being
rais'd to the ſecond Region of the Air, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
when 'tis turn'd into Rain, to have
left all its Brackiſhneſs behind it, and proves
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54159:153"/>
both wholeſome for Mens Bodies, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilizing
to their Fields.</p>
                  <p>Thus (continues <hi>Eugenius)</hi> we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſee, that Men, who in a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
were ſubject to divers Vices, deveſt
them when they are advanc'd to the honour
of putting on Royal Robes, as Silk-worms
leave their Husks behind them, when by
acquiring Wings they turn into (a nobler
ſort of Creatures) flying Animals; as
moſt Men change, ſo ſome improve their
Minds with their Condition, and ſeem to
have miſ-behav'd themſelves in a lower
Station, but becauſe they were Born to a
higher, and were, whilſt beneath it, detain'd
out of their proper Sphere. And indeed,
as a Throne expoſes thoſe that ſit on it to
peculiar Temptations to Vice, ſo does it
afford them peculiar Engagements to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as ſo Elevated a Station is apt to make
Men giddy, ſo is it proper to make them
circumſpect, by letting them ſee that all the
VVorld ſees Them; the Sublimity of ſuch
a Condition would make any Soul, that is
not very mean, deſpiſe many mean things
that too often prevail upon Inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
If Princes have any ſenſe of Shame
and Honour, it will be a great Curb to
them, to conſider, that, as there are too
many Eyes upon them to let their Vices be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54159:154"/>
ſecret, ſo their Faults can as little eſcape
Cenſure as Diſcovery; and Men will be
the more ſevere to their Reputations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis the only thing wherein Subjects
can puniſh their Soveraigns. If they have
any thing of Generoſity in their Natures,
their very Condition, by placing them above
other Objects, will make them aſpire to
Glory, and that is a Miſtreſs, that ev'n
Monarchs cannot ſucceſsfully court, but
with great and good Actions. And if they
have withall a ſenſe of Piety, they cannot,
but, in Gratitude to him, whoſe Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents
they are, endeavour to promote his
Intereſts that made them ſo, and ſo make
themſelves as like him as they can in his
other Attributes of Clemency, Juſtice, and
Bounty, as he has vouchſaf'd to make them
in his Power and Authority: And beſides,
that the actual Poſſeſſion of an Earthly
Grown leaves them nothing worth aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to but a Heavenly one: The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the great Advantages they have
above other Men of doing Good, and the
Exemplarineſs and Influence as well of
their Vices as of their Virtues, will make
them tremble at the thoughts of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they muſt one Day render of ſo many
Thouſands, perhaps of ſo many Millions,
(of Subjects) committed to their Charge,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54159:154"/>
if, as they are ſure it will be a great one,
they ſhall not make it a good one. Nor
(purſues <hi>Eugenius)</hi> is Hiſtory altogether
unfurniſh'd with Examples of thoſe whom
a Throne has as well Improv'd
as Dignify'd:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 6. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Saul</hi> was not the
only Perſon, who when he was
created King had another Spirit, and became
another Man; That <hi>Titus,</hi> who was the
Head of it, was juſtly ſtyl'd the Darling
of Mankind, though his Virtue and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
did, more than his Crown, keep the
greateſt part of Poſterity from taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of any thing in him, but an Obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
proportionate to his Greatneſs: Yet
I find in ſome antient VVriters, to whom
Truth was more dear than ev'n this Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of Mankind, that before he came to
that ſupreme Pitch of humane Dignity, his
courſe of Life did not promiſe the <hi>Roman</hi>
World the happineſs it deriv'd from his
Government; His Life before he came to
be Emperour, having not been ſo free from
Blemiſhes of Luſt and Blood: But that I
may, in writing his Character, invert what
the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorian ſaid of one of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours,
and ſay, that <hi>Titus</hi> had been
thought <hi>Indignus Imperio niſi imperaſſet.</hi> And,
without going as far as <hi>Rome,</hi> our own Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
affords us a <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, who,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54159:155"/>
before he came to the Kingdome, was
ſcarce thought worthy to Live in it, and
did ſo degrade himſelf to the Practices of
the meaneſt Malefactors, that a Judge, that
was then his Fathers Subject, was fain to
uſe him at that Rate; and yet this Prince,
as ſoon as he had Seated himſelf in the
Throne, did as ſuddenly as if the Place it
ſelf had ſome ſecret Virtue to improve
thoſe it admitted, behave himſelf as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
worthy of it; and not only Conquer'd
<hi>France,</hi> but, which was a Nobler, as well as
a more difficult Victory, his own Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
too, by preferring that Judge, when
King, that had Impriſon'd him, when Prince;
and evincing by ſo memorable an Action,
that he preferr'd Virtue above himſelf, and
renouncing the Pleaſure of Revenge, he
ſcrupl'd not to promote one whom he could
not commend without condemning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
were it not, that in this Prince, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what I was ſaying, the King was
become another Man than the Subject.
And perhaps, (concludes <hi>Eugenius,</hi> a little
Smiling) I could proceed to give you other
Examples enough to keep it from being
improbable; that one main Reaſon, why
there are but few good Princes, is, becauſe
there are but few Princes; were it not
that I ſee the VVater-man prepare to Land
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54159:155"/>
us: And in effect, we were now come ſo
near the place, where the Fiſher-man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to ſet us Aſhore, that whether or no
<hi>Lindamor</hi> had a mind to return any thing to
what <hi>Eugenius</hi> had ſaid, it would then have
appear'd unſeaſonable, either to reſume the
Debate, or proſecute the Diſcourſe.</p>

the Owner of it reach'd out his long Pole,
and by means of the Crook, taking faſt

him with all his might, and thereby brought
the Boat to Shore. This endeavour of the

<hi>Euſebius</hi> to ſmile a little, gave me the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
as ſoon as we were Landed, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
why he did ſo: It is almoſt as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
(anſwers <hi>Euſebius)</hi> for Men to think
themſelves wiſer than God, as 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them really to be ſo. Thoſe that
ſtudy nothing but to obtain their Ends, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54159:156"/>
that ſcruple at nothing they judge condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
to them, do oftentimes lay their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
and plots with ſo much Artifice and
Subtilty, that they do not doubt, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may become of Gods deſigns, and of
his promiſes, and threats, thoſe which
themſelves have laid ſo Politickly cannot but
ſucced. And even pious and well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Perſons, that have the opportunity to
diſcern the Politick ways that theſe Men
take to compaſs their Ends, are oftentimes
tempted to needleſs Fears, that Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
will be puzzl'd and diſtreſs'd by
them; and to think, that for Reaſons ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
though juſt, Providence may be put
by theſe Mens craft to play an after-game
in the VVorld to come. But in ſuch caſes,
it often fares with theſe grand Deſigners,
as it did juſt now with our VVater-man:
He had faſtened his Grapling-Iron to the
Shore, and putting to his utmoſt ſtrength,
did ſo forcibly endeavour to draw it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, that one, that did not know
that the Shore was fixt, might expect this
Luſty Fellows endeavours capable to put
into Motion whatever he ſo forcibly drew
towards him: But the Shore being fixt,
and immoveable, inſtead of making that
come to him, his very ſtrainings drew him
and his Boat to that. Thus the contrivers
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54159:156"/>
of the proud Pile of <hi>Babel,</hi> whereby they
meant (not, as moſt imagine, to ſecure
themſelves againſt a ſecond Flood; the
Text being ſilent as to that Aim, and a
Plain being a very improper place for ſuch
a purpoſe, but) to make themſelves a
Name, and prevent Diſperſion. Theſe
ambitious Contrivers, who had laid their
Plot ſo hopefully, that they had engag'd no
leſs than Mankind, and who probably had
Deſigns as rais'd as their intended Fabrick,
ſince thoſe Expreſſions of him, that knew
their Hearts,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 11. v. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>(And this they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to do, and now nothing will be
restrained from them, which they
have imagined to do)</hi> ſeem'd me-thinks to
warrant my Conjecturing, that thoſe had
deſigns very aſpiring, that intended but to
make a Riſe to their ſoaring flight of a
Tower, whoſe Top ſhould reach unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
But the Policy of theſe ambitious
Builders being contrary to the charitable
decree of God, to have the Earth Peopl'd,
he made uſe of that very conſpiracy, that
brought them together, to effect that which
they conſpir'd to prevent; ſo, that now the
remoteſt Parts of the Inhabited World are
but the Colonies of <hi>Babel,</hi> whoſe ſcattered
Architects have indeed made themſelves a
Name, but upon a quite contrary Account
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54159:157"/>
than they intended or expected. Thus the
Purblind envy of <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Brethren, having
made them reſolve to prevent his future
Dreams of Superiority over them, made
them think, that by Selling him for a Slave,
they had taken ſufficient Order he ſhould
never come to be their Maſter. And yet
we ſee, that <hi>Joſeph's</hi> being ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
was made uſe of by the wiſe Orderer of
humane Affairs, to make him in effect Lord
of that rich and populous Kingdome; and
thereby, of his envious Brethren, <hi>Pharoah's</hi>
Dreams having advantageouſly made him
amends for the hardſhips his own had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
him to. So the proud Favourite of
<hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> queſtionleſs thought he could
ſcarce miſs his Ends, when, by the Counſel
of his Friends, and, as he fondly thought,
of his Gods too, he provided for <hi>Mordecai</hi>
that fatal Gibbet, which probably he might
have eſcap'd, if he had not erected it. Thus
the High Prieſt and <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> of the Jews,
ſeem'd to Act with much Policy, though no
Juſtice, when they reſolv'd upon the Death
of our Saviour, leaſt, as the Goſpel tells
us, the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould come and Deſtroy
their Temple, and Nation, which whether
indeed it did not rather procure than divert
the coming of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Church-Hiſtory
can inform you. Nay, the Old
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54159:157"/>
Serpent himſelf, that Arch-politician, that
was the Inſtructer of thoſe others I have
been naming, even in his chiefeſt Maſter-piece,
found himſelf the moſt Over-match'd
by him, to whom the Scripture aſcribes the
taking of the VViſe in their own Crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
For queſtionleſs, he highly applauded
his own Subtilty, and ſeem'd to have taken
the directeſt and moſt proſperous way to
his impious Ends, that could be devis'd,
when, having made <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> Friends
upon ſuch tearms, that the Lamb of God
ſhould be the Victim of their new Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy,
he had engag'd both Jews and
Gentiles in a ruinous and tragick Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
to Kill the Prince of Life, and by that
unparallel'd Crime at once deſtroy the
Divels chief Enemy, and make God theirs:
And yet the Event has ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted,
that the Apoſtle might well affirm,
that Chriſt by his Death deſtroy'd him that
had the Empire of Death, the Divel, and
that Satan's Kingdome never receiv'd ſo
deadly a Wound, as that which pierc'd our
Crucify'd Saviour's ſide. VVherefore in
ſhort, (concludes <hi>Euſebius)</hi> the Decrees
of Providence are too ſolid and fixt to have
Violence offered them by humane At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
how ſpecious ſoever they be; and
thoſe that think to bring God to their Bent,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54159:158"/>
will find at long Running, that they have to
do with One, whoſe Power and Wiſdome
are ſo Over-ruling, that not only he can

place.</head>
                  <p>AS ſoon as we were come to the place
the Fiſher-man told us of, we found
it as plentifully ſtor'd with Fiſh as he had
fore-told us, and caught more in ſome few
Minutes than we had taken in a whole hour
before: But we did not half ſo much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
at this, as we were pleas'd with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Fiſher-man inform'd us, that he
had liberally Baited the place over-night
with Corn, as well as VVorms; whil'ſt
this pleaſant Exerciſe laſted, <hi>Euſebius</hi> mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how great a Reſort of Fiſhes there was
in that place, and how faſt we drew them
up, upon comparing what he ſaw happen,
with the Occaſion of it, thus acquainted
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54159:158"/>
us with the thoughts thereby ſuggeſted to
him. Thoſe (ſays he) that Yeſter-day
in the Evening might ſee this Man (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Fiſher-man) throw in his Baits
by handfulls into this place, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
as minding them no more, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
if they knew not his Deſign, and the
Cuſtom of Fiſhers, tempted to think him
a waſtfull Prodigal, or at beſt a venturous
Fool, to bury his Corn in the River, and
throw his Baits to be caught up by Fiſhes,
that for ought he knew would never come
back to thank their Hoſt. But thoſe that
know (what we now find) how profitable
a Courſe this is wont to prove, would, in
ſtead of thinking ſuch a practice a piece of
Folly, look upon it as a piece of Pro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
For though he be ſure not to
recover in kind the things he caſt upon
the Waters, yet ſuch a loſs is wont to
prove very gainfull unto him, whilſt he
loſes but a Grain of Corn, or a Worm, to
obtain Fiſhes of far more Value. Thus,
though the purblind World may think a
liberal Almes-giver, or a generous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
a Fool, or a Prodigal, whil'ſt they
only conſider him as one that throws away
what he has in preſent Poſſeſſion, and
ſeems not ſo much as to hope for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the ſame Goods, or any of the like
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54159:159"/>
Nature; yet thoſe whoſe Eyes being Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
with a Heavenly light, are thereby
enabl'd to look into the vaſt and diſtant
Regions of the future, and to deſcry there
the final Iſſues of all Temporal things, will
be ſo far from thinking him unwiſe, for
parting with unſatisfying Trifles, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the higheſt and moſt permanent
Goods, that they will think his Proceedings
far more juſtifiable in point of Prudence,
than we now think the Fiſher-man's: Nor
will the parting with a greater Fortune, as
freely as with a leſſer, any more alter the
Caſe, than the Fiſher-mans throwing in
his bigger VVorms, and grains of Corn,
with no more ſcruple than his leſſer: For
Heaven does as well incomparably out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaue
the greateſt, as the leaſt Goods poor
Morals can lay out for it; and he, who has
all things to give, and is infinitely more
than all himſelf, has promis'd, that thoſe
that Sow plentifully, ſhall Reap ſo too;
and though the leaſt of future Acquiſts
would incomparably tranſcend the greateſt
Price that can be here given for it, yet the
future Rewards will betwixt one another
bear a proportion to the Occaſions of them;
and as the Fiſher-man is ſure to loſe what
he throws into the Water, and is not ſure
to get by it any thing of greater Value than
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54159:159"/>
ſome Fiſhes; the Chriſtian-Adventurer,
(if I may ſo call him) may hope, though
not confidently promiſe himſelf, in this
World the hundred fold mention'd by our
Saviour, as well as in the VVorld to come
Life everlaſting. And therefore, if we do
indeed in Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> Language, look, not
to the things which are ſeen, which are but
Temporary, but to the Inviſible ones which
are Eternal, we ſhall think that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>WE had not yet dismiſs'd the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
when <hi>Eugenius</hi> chancing to
expreſs a Curioſity, to know what a Clock
it was, when we had freſhly begun to Angle
at our new Station; as <hi>Lindamor</hi> and the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54159:160"/>
reſt drew their VVatches to ſatisfie his
Queſtion, ſo the Boat-man took out of his
Pocket a little Sun-Dyal, furniſhed with an
excited Needle to direct how to Set it,
ſuch Dyals being uſed among Mariners, not
only to ſhow them the hour of the Day,
but to inform them from what quarter the
VVind blows; upon the ſight of this Dyal,
my natural Curioſity invited me, after it
had told me the hour, to try whether the
Magnetick Needle were well touched, by
drawing a little Penknife out of a pair of
Twiſes I then chanc'd to have about me,
and approaching it to the North point of
the Needle, which according to the known
cuſtom of ſuch Needles, readily followed
it, or reſted over againſt it, which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I turned the Penknife, or whereabout
ſoever I held it ſtill; <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſeeing me
give my ſelf this Diverſion, came up to me
to be a ſharer in my ſight, which no Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
can keep from being a VVonder:
But after a while, he look'd upon it in a
way that made me think it preſented him
ſomewhat elſe than the hour of the Day,
or the corner of the VVind; and I was
confirm'd in that thought, by ſeeing him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to it the caſe of <hi>Lindamor's</hi> VVatch, and
then a Diamond-ring pluck'd from his own
Finger, and in effect, he ſoon began to tell
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54159:160"/>
me; Me-thinks, <hi>Philaretus,</hi> this Needle
may afford us a good direction in the choice
of Companies: And that is a matter of
ſuch moment, that ſome Divines perhaps
would queſtion, whether or no the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
it gives Navigators to find the Poles,
be of much greater Importance: For not
only it has been truly obſerved, that the
choice of ones Company does exceedingly
diſcover whether a Man be Good, or Bad,
VViſe, or Fooliſh; but I ſhall venture to
add, that it does very much contribute to
<hi>make</hi> him what others ſay it declares him:
For an aſſiduous Converſe does inſenſibly
diſpoſe and faſhion our Minds and Manners
to a reſemblance with thoſe we delight to
converſe with, and there are few that have
ſo much Reſolution, as to diſobey Cuſtoms
and Faſhions, eſpecially when embraced by
Perſons that we love, and would be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by, and from whoſe Opinions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
we can ſcarce diſſent conſtantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impreſſing a Diſlike, that threatens to
make them diſlike us. For my part, (ſays
<hi>Lindamor)</hi> I have always thought there
is great difference betwixt keeping Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with ſome Men, and chooſing to do
ſo; For whilſt we Live in this VVorld,
we muſt often have to do with the Lovers
of the VVorld: But though to be caſt by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54159:161"/>
the Exigencies of our Callings upon bad
Company, be an Infelicity without being a
Fault, yet certainly, to <hi>chooſe</hi> ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and prefer it before that of wiſe and
good Men, is in a high Degree both the one
and the other. And I confeſs, (continues
he) I cannot think, that the proper uſe of
Converſation is but to <hi>paſs away</hi> our time,
not to <hi>improve</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>You are certainly much in the right,
(ſubjoyns <hi>Euſebius)</hi> for though too many
of thoſe that are now cried up for good
Company, do either ſo diſſwade us from
good and ſerious things, or ſo divert us from
them, that 'tis oftentimes counted a piece
of Indiſcretion to ſay any thing that may
either inrich Men's Underſtandings, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
their Conſciences; yet I cannot but
think, that Converſation <hi>may</hi> be, as well as
<hi>ought</hi> to be, reſcued from being an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to promote Idleneſs and Vice; and, if
Men were not wanting to themſelves, I
doubt not, it may be ſo ordered, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
which ſo often robs Men of their
time, and ſo frequently of their Devotion,
might be made a great Inſtrument of Piety,
and Knowledge, and become no leſs Uſefull
than 'tis wont to be Pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>To make Companies (replies <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor)</hi>
ſuch as you think they may be, they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54159:161"/>
muſt grow very different from what moſt
commonly they are: For, not to ſpeak of
thoſe looſe and profane ones, where Virtue
and Seriouſneſs are openly derided, and any
thing, how contrary ſoever to Piety, or right
Reaſon, may be uſed, not only with tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but applauſe, if Men can bring it
out, I ſay not in Jeſt, (for they are ſeldome
more in earneſt) but neatly wrapt up in
Raillery; even in thoſe civiller ſorts of
Company, where Vice is not profeſſedly
maintained, you ſhall ſeldome, during a
long ſtay, hear any thing that is really worth
carrying away with you, or remembring
when you are gone. And to Diſcourſe of
any thing that is Grave enough, either to
exerciſe Men's Intellects, or excite their
Devotion, is counted a piece of Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is wont to be more carefully
avoided than almoſt any thing that is really
ſuch; ſo, that even in ſuch Companies, the
Innocenteſt uſe that we are wont to make
of our time, is, to loſe it: And really,
(continues <hi>Lindamor)</hi> when I conſider
how enſnaring the worſer ſort of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are, and how little, even thoſe that do
not openly defie Piety and Knowledge, are
wont to cheriſh either of them; I begin to
be reconciled to <hi>Hermites,</hi> who fly from
ſuch Converſations as are ſo apt to make
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54159:162"/>
Men either Vitious, or at leaſt Idle into
thoſe Solitudes, where they are not like to
be Tempted, either to renounce their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
or to ſuppreſs it, to entertain idle
Thoughts, or ſtifle good ones: Nor could
I without much Scruple, as well as Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
allow my ſelf to ſpend ſome part
of my time in ſuch kind of entertainments
as many ſpend moſt of theirs in, were it
not, that looking upon Civility as a Virtue,
and Hoſpitality as in ſome caſes a Duty,
and upon both of them as things of good
report, I can think thoſe hours they make
me ſpend, may be juſtly caſt upon their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and that the Ceremonious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant
converſations whereto they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me, may be undergone upon ſome ſuch
account as that, on which ſerious Parents
converſe and oftentimes play with their
Children; for, as though the things they
do, are in themſelves trivial, and uſeleſs,
yet they may be juſtifiable Effects of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
care to ſtill a Child, or keep him
from harming himſelf; ſo the Duty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
of Civility makes me look upon
as juſtifiable, though unpleaſant, thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of it, which, in themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
I could not Reflect on without
Indignation, and could not but think very
much below any Man, whom Education has
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54159:162"/>
fitted for the exerciſe of Reaſon, or whom
Religion has elevated to the hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>But it may (ſays <hi>Euſebius)</hi> on the other
ſide be repreſented, that ſince 'tis ſcarce
poſſible not to meet ſometimes with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
that are not of the beſt ſort, we
ſhould look upon thoſe Neceſſities, as calls
of Providence, to improve thoſe Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
for the advantage of them we are
engaged to converſe with; for Nature, as
well as Chriſtianity, teaches us, that we are
not Born only for our ſelves, and therefore,
as we ought often to converſe with the beſt
Men, to acquire Virtue and Knowledge, ſo
we muſt ſometimes converſe with others,
that we may impart them, and learn how
much we are beholden to God's Goodneſs,
that has ſo much diſcriminated us from
other Men; and though we do not find that
our Converſation does immediately and
viſibly reform thoſe we converſe with, yet
it will not preſently follow, that it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ineffectual on them: For, beſides
that the ſeeds of Virtue and Knowledge,
as well as thoſe of Plants, may long ſeem
to lye dead, even in thoſe Soils wherein
they will afterwards Flouriſh and Fructifie,
there may be at preſent a Good, though not
a Conſpicuous, Effect of your Diſcourſe and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54159:163"/>
Example. For when Men are haſting to
Hell, he does them no ſmall Service, that
does ſo much as Retard their courſe, as
Cordials, and other Medicines, may do good
even to decrepid Old men, whom they
cannot perfectly cure.</p>
                  <p>And truſt me, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> 'tis no ſuch
uſeleſs performance as you may think it,
for a Man of known Piety and Parts, by
converſing with the Children of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>To</hi> dare to own Religion among
thoſe that dare to deride it; <hi>To</hi> keep alive
and excite a witneſs for God and Good
things in their Conſciences; <hi>To</hi> let them
ſee, and make them (at leaſt inwardly)
acknowledge, the Beauty of a pious, Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious,
and well-ordered courſe of Life;
<hi>To</hi> convince them, that it is not for want of
knowing the Vanities they dote on, that he
deſpiſes them; <hi>To</hi> ſhew, that a Man, that
denies himſelf their ſinfull Jollities, can
Live contented without them: And, (to
diſpatch) <hi>To</hi> manifeſt, by a real and viſible
Demonſtration, that a virtuous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Life is no unpracticable, no more than
Melancholy thing, ev'n in Bad times, and
among Bad men. And ſays, <hi>Euſebius,</hi> to me
it ſeems very conſiderable, that our Saviour
himſelf, the great Author of our Faith, and
Exemplar of our Piety, did not chooſe an
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54159:163"/>
Anchorites, or a Monaſtique Life, but a
ſociable and an affable way of converſing
with Mortals, not refuſing Invitations, even
from Publicans, or to Weddings, and by
ſuch winning Condeſcenſions gained the
Hearts, and thereby a Power to reform the
Lives, of multitudes of thoſe he vouchſaf'd
to converſe with.</p>
                  <p>Other conſiderations (purſues <hi>Euſebius)</hi>
might be repreſented to the ſame purpoſe
with theſe: But ſince I promiſed you
ſomething of Direction, I ſuppoſe you will
expect I ſhould tell you, not what I <hi>could</hi>
ſay, but what I <hi>do</hi> think. I will tell you
then in few words, that though I think it
as well poſſible as fit for Men of radicated
Virtue, and fine Parts, to make ſometimes
a good uſe of bad Company, eſpecially
when their lawfull occaſions caſt them into
it; yet for others to be often engag'd in
ſuch Company, though it may be but an
Infelicity, is a very great one; and to chooſe
ſuch Company, is, what is worſe than an
Unhappineſs, a Fault: But generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I would diſtinguiſh three ſorts of
Companies; for there are ſome, that not
only are unable to improve me, but are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to be improved themſelves; A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſort there is, that are as well ready to
learn, as able to inſtruct: And there are
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54159:164"/>
others, that, though they are not Proficients
enough to teach me things worth my Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are yet deſirous to be taught by me,
the little that I know, and they ignore. Now,
<hi>as</hi> the Magnetick Needle we were looking
on, and which affords us the Theam of this
Diſcourſe, if you ſhould apply a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
to it, would be moſt powerfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by that, becauſe it can receive freſh
Virtue from it; and even, if you approach
a piece of Steel to it, the Needle will,
though not ſo ſtudiouſly, apply it ſelf to it,
from which, though it receives no Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
virtue, it can impart ſome to it: But
if you offer it the Silver caſe of your Watch,
or the Gold that makes up your Ring, or
the Diamonds that are ſet in it, none of all
theſe, how Rich or Glittering ſoever, will
at all move the Needle, which ſuffers them
to ſtand by unregarded; <hi>So</hi> I ſhall with the
moſt of Cheerfulneſs, and Application,
ſeek the Company of thoſe that are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd,
to impart to me the Virtue or the
Knowledge they abound with: Nor ſhall
I refuſe to entertain a Society with thoſe
few, that being ſuch ſmall Proficients as to
need to learn of me, are alſo forward to
do ſo. But thoſe that can neither teach me
any thing that is Good, nor are diſpoſed to
let me teach it them, how great a ſhew ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54159:164"/>
they make, among thoſe that make
choice of their Companions by their Eyes;
I may be <hi>cast-upon</hi> their Converſation, but
ſhall very hardly <hi>chooſe</hi> it.</p>

                  <p>I Had almoſt forgot to relate, that not far

divers heaps of Quick-lime, ſome Smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

while we were talking, one of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

afterwards pour'd on ſo much more as ſerv'd
quite to drown the Lime; and <hi>Euſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

marking, both what he did, and what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd
upon it, took thence occaſion to ſay to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54159:165"/>
us; He that ſhould ſee only the Effect of
the firſt Effuſion of cold Water upon quick
Lime, would think, that by a kind of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſteſis,
the Internal heat of the Lime is
rather encreas'd than ſuffocated by the
Coldneſs and Moiſture of the VVater; for
that which before was not taken notice of,
to manifeſt any ſenſible warmth, as ſoon as
its Enemy the VVater begins to invade it,
acquires a new heat and new forces in the
Conflict, and not only ſhews a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
or Enmity, to that cold Liquor,
by acting furiouſly upon it, and throwing
off many parts into the Air, but prevails ſo
far as to heat that cold Element it ſelf, to
that degree, as to make it Smoak and Boyl.
But this Conflict is ſeldome near ſo laſting
as 'tis eager; for if you have but the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to ſtay a while, you ſhall ſee the Lime,
after it has ſpent its occaſional Ardour,
and after its Fire is quench'd, lye quietly
with, nay under, the VVater, as cold and
as moveleſs as it. Thus, when a devout
Man, (eſpecially if his Fervour be adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
from Education, or Cuſtom, as the
Fire in the Lime from the Calcination)
firſt falls into the Company of Perſons,
either Profane, or otherwiſe groſsly Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
we often ſee, that his Zeal, inſtead of
being ſmother'd by ſuch a rude and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54159:165"/>
Oppoſition, ſeems rather to be
excited and kindl'd thereby, and poſſibly
ſeems more likely to impart the warmth of
his Devotion to its Enemies than to loſe
any of it himſelf; but when he is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or at leaſt frequently, ſurrounded with
ſuch Company, you will too often ſee him
loſe as well his own Ardour as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of communicating it; and with
thoſe very Perſons, that did at firſt kindle
and exaſperate his Zeal, you ſhall at laſt
ſee him Live very quietly, and perhaps ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
as little of Religious warmth as they;
and that which at firſt did ſo ſtrangely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate
and diſcompoſe him, becomes after
a while ſo familiar, as not at all to move

                  <p>WE had poſſibly dwelt longer upon
ſuch Reflections, had I not been

of a Voice, which each of us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
he had very often heard: VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
as it were, by common conſent, we
began to look round about us, to ſee if any
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54159:166"/>
of our little Company were miſſing, and
finding that <hi>Eugenius</hi> was ſo, we readily
concluded the Voice we heard, though
ſomewhat alter'd by diſtance, and other
circumſtances, to be his; and accordingly
we haſted towards the place, whence we
judg'd the Voice to proceed, that in caſe he
were in any Diſtreſs, or had met with any
Diſaſter, we might reſcue or relieve him:
But when we came near, we could now and
then diſtinctly hear him ſpeak ſome words
ſo loud, and yet ſo incoherent and unable
to compleat a Senſe, as if he meant that all
thereabouts ſhould hear him, and no Body
underſtand him. This made us double our
Curioſity, and our Pace, till at length we
deſcry'd him all alone in a ſolitary corner,
wherein yet his Loudneſs kept us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
he ſought privacy: But as ſoon as
he diſcover'd us, he ſeem'd both ſurpris'd

ask'd us, if we did not think him Mad:

ask one of him, which was, what he had
been doing. VVhilſt you, (anſwers <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius)</hi>
were (I doubt not) better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54159:166"/>
my natural Curioſity ſeduc'd me to
ſpend ſome time in Ranging about the
places near the River-ſide, and as I was
paſſing by this Field, the accidental Lowing
of an Ox made me take notice, that this
Neighbouring Hill and Wood, furniſh this
place with an excellent Eccho, which I at
firſt try'd only by VVhooping and Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;
but afterwards diverted my ſelf
by framing my Queſtions ſo, as to make
that Babling Nymph (for ſo you know the
Poets will have Eccho to be) to Diſcourſe
with me.</p>
                  <p>For my part, (ſays <hi>Lindamor)</hi> I ſhould
by no means like her Converſation, becauſe
that two Qualities ſhe has, which to me
would very much diſcommend it: And to
prevent our asking him what thoſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were, One of them, (ſays he) is, that
ſhe vouchſafes to Diſcourſe indiſcriminally
with all commers that Talk to her, provided
that they make Noiſe enough.</p>
                  <p>You are much in the right, (ſays <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius)</hi>
for that eaſineſs of admitting all kind
of Company, provided Men have boldneſs
enough to intrude into ours, is one of the
uneaſieſt Hardſhips, (not to ſay Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms)
to which Cuſtom has expos'd us,
and does really do more Miſchief than moſt
Men take notice off; ſince it does not only
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54159:167"/>
keep impertinent Fools in countenance,
but encourages them to be very troubleſome
to wiſe Men. The VVorld is peſter'd with
a certain ſort of Praters, who make up in
Loudneſs what their Diſcourſes want in
Senſe; and becauſe Men are ſo eaſie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
as to allow the hearing to their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies
they preſently preſume that
the things they ſpeak are none; and moſt
Men are ſo little able to diſcern in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
betwixt Confidence and Wit, that
like our Eccho, to any that will but talk
loud enough they will be ſure to afford an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.
And, (which is worſe) this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
to hazard our Patience, and certainly
loſe our Time, and thereby incourage others
to multiply idle words, of which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſeems to ſpeak threatningly, is made
by Cuſtom an Expreſſion, if not a Duty, of
Civility; and ſo even a Virtue is made
acceſſary to a Fault.</p>
                  <p>For my part, (ſubjoyns <hi>Eugenius)</hi> though
I think theſe Talkative people worſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Grievances than many of thoſe for
whoſe prevention, or redreſs, Parliaments
are wont to be aſſembled, and Laws to be
enacted; and though I think their Robbing
us of our time as much a worſe Miſchief
than thoſe petty Thefts for which Judges
condemn Men, as a little Money is a leſs
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54159:167"/>
valuable Good than that precious Time,
which no ſum of it can either purchaſe or
redeem; yet I confeſs, I think that thoſe
of our great Lords and Ladies, that can
admit this ſort of Company, deſerve it:
For if ſuch Perſons have but minds in any
meaſure ſuited to their Qualities, they may
ſafely, by their Diſcountenance, baniſh ſuch
pitifull Creatures, and ſecure their Quiet,
not only without injuring the Reputation
of their Civility, but by advancing that of
their Judgment. And I fear, (continues
<hi>Eugenius)</hi> that thoſe who decline this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
(and indeed Improvement) of
their Titles, or other kinds of Eminency,
do by their Remiſneſs more harm than they
imagine; For though the Judgment and
Company of ſuch Perſons, be not always
the beſt grounded, or the beſt choſen, yet
their Quality or Station in the VVorld
makes it uſually the moſt conſpicuous, and
the moſt conſider'd. And I doubt not, there
is no ſuch Multitude of diſ-intereſt Lovers
of Good things, but that there will be the
fewer found Studious to expreſs VVit and
Virtue in Converſation, when they ſee, that
in the Eſtimate of thoſe that are look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as the chief Judges of what is or is not
good Company, the moſt empty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Prattle with confidence, or loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54159:168"/>
procures a Man at leaſt as good a
Reception as the beſt and moſt rational
Diſcourſe without it. And, which is yet
worſe, that Tyrannous thing, which we miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
Civility, has ſo degraded Reaſon, as
well as diſplac'd Piety, in Converſation,
that if there be never ſo many Perſons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
entertaining themſelves with rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
or inſtructive Diſcourſe, in caſe there
come in but one impertinent Creature that
is below it, all theſe ſhall ſink themſelves
to his Level, and as much debaſe their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
as if they believ'd it fitter, that all
the rational Converſers ſhould fore-go the
Exerciſe and the Benefit of their VVit and
Virtue, than that a Fool ſhould not appear
to talk as wiſely as any of them; and thus
they ſeem'd aſham'd of their Attainments,
inſtead of making him aſham'd of his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and reducing him to improve himſelf
into a capacity of being fit for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
whereas, from a contrary practice,
they might derive the great Advantage,
either of freeing themſelves from uninvited
Companions, or of making them worth the
having.</p>
                  <p>But, (ſubjoyns <hi>Lindamor)</hi> I remember
I told you there was a ſecond Quality, that
I diſlik'd in the Nymph I found you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
and that is, that, when I will, I can
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54159:168"/>
make her ſpeak to me, juſt what I pleaſe.
I know (replies <hi>Eugenius)</hi> that a moderate
degree of Complaiſance, is not only in
many caſes allowed us by Diſcretion, but
neceſſary to keep up the Pleaſantneſs, not to
ſay the very Peace, of humane Societies;
For if all Men, at all times, ſpake their Minds
freely, and did not ſoften one another by
concealing their mutual Diſlikes, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
and by certain outward Expreſſions
of Kindneſs, or Reſpect, made by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
and Geſtures, Men have ſo many
Imperfections, and ſo much Self-love with
all, that ſcarce any two of them would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
one another; Nay, and in ſpight of
that Indulgence, which provident Nature
has implanted in all Animals, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of their Species, in that of the
Individuals that compoſe it, and as much as
our own Faultineſs has added to that Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
yet, I doubt, we ſhall ſcarce find one
Man of a thouſand, that would endure ſo
much as himſelf, if we did not for the moſt
part exerciſe Complaiſance within our own
Breaſts, and did not as much flatter our
ſelves, and diſguiſe our ſelves, to our ſelves,
as we flatteringly diſguiſe our ſelves to
others.</p>
                  <p>But, (continues <hi>Eugenius)</hi> when all this
is ſaid, I may endure, but I ſhall ſcarce
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54159:169"/>
chooſe and prize a Companion, that, like an
Eccho, uſes no liberty of his own, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
me to direct whatever I would have
to be anſwered me: And I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I could not better like one that would
ever diſſent from me, than one that would
never do ſo; I cannot look upon him either
as my Friend, or as Perſon worthy to be
made ſo, who never evinces his being
more concerned to advantage me, than to
pleaſe me, by making uſe of the liberty of
a Friend, and thereby ſhewing, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
not barely himſelf, but me; beſides,
that as there is no true Friendſhip where
there is not an Union of Affections, ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
there can be no good Company
where there is not ſometimes a Diſſent in
Opinions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that was a Friend to Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
without being an Enemy to Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
gathering from the long Pauſe made
by his Friends, that they deſigned not the
proſecuting of this Diſcourſe any further;
Me-thinks, Gentlemen, (ſays he, Smiling)
you are very ſevere to a harmleſs Nymph,
who is ſo modeſt, and reſerved, that ſhe
will never put you upon beginning a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with her, and ſo Complaiſant in it,
that 'tis your own fault if ever ſhe ſays any
thing to you, that diſpleaſes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54159:169"/>
my part, (continues he) I have that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of humane things, that as I think there
are very few ſo perfect, but that we may
find ſomething in them fit to be ſhunn'd, ſo
there are not many ſo imperfect, but that
they may ſuggeſt to us ſomewhat or other,
that may not be unworthy of our imitation;
and as <hi>Lindamor</hi> has taken notice of two
Qualities in our Eccho, which diſcommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it to him, ſo I have obſerved as many,
that I rather approve than diſlike.</p>
                  <p>For, in the firſt place, 'tis evident, that
our Nymph (however <hi>Eugenius</hi> has been
pleaſed to miſ-call her a Babler) is much
leſs Talkative than moſt of her own Sex, or
indeed of ours; for ſhe never begins to
talk with any Body, not ſpeaking unleſs ſhe
be ſpoken to. He that conſiders how much
of the Diſcourſe that waſtes Men's time,
and entertains the moſt Companies with
the moſt applauſe, conſiſts of Talk that
tends either to flatter thoſe that are preſent,
or detract from the abſent, or to cenſure our
Superiours, or our Betters, or to expreſs
our own Profaneneſs, or to excite the Pride
or Carnality of others; and he that ſhall
conſider, that though by theſe and many
other ways we are extremely apt to offend
in words, yet we muſt give an Account for
that kind of words, what ſort ſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meant
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54159:170"/>
by them, which our Tranſlators ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Idle ones;</hi> and that the Judge himſelf
tells Men, that they ſhall by their words,
as well as by their actions, be juſtified, or
condemned; will eaſily believe, that if
Silence were as much in Faſhion as 'tis cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
to Mankind to wiſh it, the Regions
of Hell would be far thinlier Peopled than
now they are like to be.</p>
                  <p>I could tell you, that Silence diſcovers
Wiſdome, and conceals Ignorance, and
'tis a property that is ſo much belonging to
wiſe Men, that even a Fool, when he hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his peace, may paſs for one of that
ſort; And I could eaſily add I know not
how much in the commendation of this
excellent Quality, if I knew how at the
ſame time to praiſe Silence, and to practiſe
it; ſo that it may well paſs for an excellency
in the Nymph, whoſe Apology I am ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
that ſhe does not ſpeak but when it is
neceſſary ſhe ſhould, I mean, when ſhe is
ſpoken to, in ſuch a way as does exact her
anſwer.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all the good qualities of
our Eccho; for as ſhe rarely ſpeaks but when
'tis expected ſhe ſhould, ſo ſhe ſeldome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats
above a ſmall part of what is ſaid to
her; this I account a very ſeaſonable piece
of Diſcretion, eſpecially in ſuch treacherous
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54159:170"/>
and fickle times as ours, where, almoſt as
if he thought himſelf fit to be an univerſal
States-man, ſuch a one concerns himſelf
very needleſsly for almoſt all the publique
Quarrels in Chriſtendome, and ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
zealous for a party which will receive
no advantage by his diſquiets; and not
content like a Merchant-venturer, his
Paſſion may upon this account make him a
Sufferer by what happens in the Remoteſt
parts of the World; In our own fatal
Differences, (which 'tis almoſt as unſafe
to ſpeak freely of, as 'tis unhappy to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
in them) he will on needleſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
declare, with his Opinion, his want of
Judgment, and perhaps Ruine himſelf with
thoſe under whoſe Protection he lives, by
ſpreading Reports, and maintaining Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
that rendred him ſuſpected among
thoſe, who think that a Man muſt wiſh their
Forces ſhould be beaten, if he can think
they may have been ſo; Nay, I have known
ſome, that, though put into conſiderable
Employments, could not hold talking of
their own Party, at a rate of freedome
which thoſe that have ſo much Innocence
as not to deſerve it, will ſcarce have ſo
much Goodneſs as to ſupport it: So that
me-thinks, theſe Men deal with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
as Children oftentimes do with
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54159:171"/>
their Cards, when having taken a great deal
of pains to build fine Caſtles with them,
they themſelves afterwards ruine them with
their Breath.</p>
                  <p>It may be a greater without being a more
prejudicial price of Folly, to believe all
that one hears, than to report all that one
believes; and eſpecially, thoſe are to be
cenſured for want of our Nymphs reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs,
by whom it loſes that name; for
though thoſe kind of Men make ſure by
their way of Talking, to make others take
notice how much they are confided in by
their own party, yet ſure they would take
a diſcreeter courſe, if they did but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that the proof they give, that they are
truſted with ſecrets, is, that they are unfit to
be ſo.</p>

ſilently a good way along the River-ſide;
but at length, not hearing any more the Noiſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54159:171"/>
his Feet were wont to make in going,
turning my ſelf to ſee what was become of
him, I perceiv'd him to be a pretty way
behind me upon the Rivers brink, where he
ſtood in a fixt Poſture, as if he were very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon what he was doing. And 'twas
well for him, that my curioſity prompted
me to ſee what it was that made him ſo
attentive; for, before I could quite come
up to him, me-thought I ſaw him begin to
ſtagger, and though that ſight added wings
to my Feet, yet I could ſcarce come time
enough to lay hold on him, and, by pulling
him down backwards, reſcue him from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into the River. The ſhrieck I gave at
the ſight of my Friends danger, was, it ſeems,
loud enough to reach <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Ears, who,
turning his Eyes towards the place whence
the Noiſe came, and ſeeing <hi>Lindamor</hi> upon
the Ground, made haſtily towards us, and
came up to us by that time I had help'd
<hi>Lindamor</hi> up, and before I had receiv'd
from him the obliging Acknowledgments
he was pleas'd to make me for a piece of
ſervice that I thought had in it more of
Recompence than Merit. <hi>Euſebius</hi> hearing
what paſs'd betwixt us, joyn'd his thanks
to <hi>Lindamor's,</hi> and at the ſame time congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated
my Friend for his eſcape, and me
for having, to uſe his Expreſſions, had the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54159:172"/>
honour and ſatisfaction to be ſuch a Perſon
as <hi>Lindamor</hi>'s Deliverer. But after our
Expreſſions of Joy for his eſcape were over,
<hi>Euſebius</hi> and I had both a curioſity to learn
particularly the occaſion of his Danger,
which he told us in theſe words; As I was
thinking, <hi>Euſebius,</hi> on your laſt Reflection,
I was diverted from proſecuting my Walk
in <hi>Philaretus</hi>'s Company, by happening to
caſt my Eyes on a part of the River, where
the Stream runs far more ſwiftly than I
have all this Day taken notice of it to do
any where elſe, which induc'd me to ſtop a
while, to obſerve it the more leiſurely:
And coming nearer, I found the Rapidneſs
of the Current to be ſuch, notwithſtanding
the depth of the Water, that I ſtood think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with my ſelf, how hard it were for one
to eſcape, that ſhould be ſo unlucky as to
fall into it: But whilſt I was thus muſing,
and attentively looking upon the Water,
to try whether I could diſcover the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
it happened to me, as it often does
to thoſe that gaze too ſtedfaſtly on ſwift
Streams, that my Head began to grow gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and my Leggs to ſtagger towards the
River, into which queſtionleſs I had fell, if
<hi>Philaretus</hi> had not ſeaſonably and obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevented it. Something like this (ſays
<hi>Euſebius)</hi> does not unfrequently happen in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54159:172"/>
the unwary conſideration of ſome ſorts of
ſinfull Objects, eſpecially thoſe ſuggeſted
by Atheiſm and Luſt: For not only we
oftentimes conſider Atheiſtical ſuggeſtions,
and entertain Libidinous fancies, without
any intention to quit our Station, or the
ſecure and ſolid Baſis of Religion, and
Chaſtity; but we are often inclinable to
think, that we converſe with theſe Objects
only to diſcern their Formidableneſs the
better, and fortifie our Reſolutions to ſhun
them. And yet ſuch is the pernicious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Atheiſm, and of Luſt, that they turn
our Brains, and oftentimes, if Providence,
or Chriſtian prudence, do not ſeaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe,
we may unawares fall into the
Miſchief, even by too attentively ſurveying
its greatneſs, and may be ſwallowed up by
the danger, even whilſt we were conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how great it is. To parley with ſuch
faſcinating Enemies, though with a deſign
to refuſe them, and ſtrengthen our Averſion
to them, is againſt the Laws of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
warfare: And though it be not as
criminal, may often prove as fatal, as to
hold Intelligence with the Enemy. 'Tis
true, that the deformity of both theſe Sins
is ſuch, that all their Uglineſs cannot be
taken notice of at firſt ſight: But the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
is more dangerous than neceſſary,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54159:173"/>
ſince a little knowledge of their Hideouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is enough to make every honeſt Heart
abhor them. And ſince their leſs obvious
Deformities are more dangerous to be pry'd
into, than neceſſary to be known, let us fear
to learn of theſe deluding Sins, more than
we need know to hate them, and remember,
that even thoſe that are frighted by ſeeing

                  <p>Thus (reſumes <hi>Euſebius)</hi> to a ſober

it matters not very much whether that

leſs ſatisfactory, to receive this Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
out of that which is but a little, than
out of that which is a great deal more than
enough; for not only the neceſſities of
Nature are few, but her capacities are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited.
And therefore, how much ſoever
you have of Meat, and Drink, and the like

Meaſure of them, proportion'd to the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings

I dare not abſolutely (purſues he) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
thoſe that think not the neceſſities of

in the World, that ſince a Man can ſcarce

there are but few who are ſo great

manifeſt, that 'tis but an uneaſie Condition,
that makes our Cares neceſſary for things
that are meerly ſuperfluous; and that Men,
whoſe Poſſeſſions are ſo much ſpread and
diſplay'd, are but thereby expos'd the
fairer and wider Marks that may be hit in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54159:175"/>
many places by misfortune. Nor will
Careleſneſs ſecure them, ſince a provident
concern of a Man's Eſtate, though it be
great, being by the Generality of Men
look'd upon as a Duty, and a part of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
he cannot ſuffer himſelf to be wrong'd
or cheated of that, without loſing, with his
Right, his Reputation.</p>
                  <p>For my part, (ſays <hi>Lindamor)</hi> I do the
more wonder to ſee Men ſo greedy of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themſelves,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks,
<hi>with thick Clay,</hi> that they Hoard up their
Treaſures from thoſe uſes which alone make
<hi>Riches</hi> worthy the Name of <hi>Goods,</hi> and Live
by a temper quite contrary to that of Saint
<hi>Paul, As having all things, and poſſeſſing
nothing.</hi> When I conſider the things they
pretend to by this as mean as unchriſtian
Appetite; The two chief of theſe, are
wont to be, The keeping of a great Houſe,
and the leaving their Children great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
As to the former, though others are
too much advantag'd by it not to extol it,
and though it be ſometimes indeed in ſome
caſes a decent, and almoſt neceſſary, piece of
Greatneſs, yet 'tis in my opinion one of
the moſt unhappy Attendants that retain to
it; for the Laws of Hoſpitality, and much
more thoſe of Cuſtom, turns him that keeps
a great Table into an Honourable Hoſt,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54159:175"/>
ſubjects him to comply with the various
and oftentimes unreaſonable Humours of a
ſucceſſion of Gueſts, that he cares not for
at all, and that care as little for him; it
brings him in a world of Acquaintance, to
whom he muſt own himſelf oblig'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they come to Eat his Meat, and muſt
really requite them, by giving them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſeſt
thing he has to part with, <hi>his Time:</hi>
And a full Table, together with the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that Cuſtom allows at it, if not exacts
there, tempt him both to Indulgence to his
Appetite, prejudicial to his Health, and if
they do not prevail with him to ſpeak, do
often at leaſt to diſpoſe him to hear, and to
connive at, ſuch free Diſcourſes as are
prejudicial to his Intereſts; ſo that there is
more than one account upon which a great
Entertainer may be involv'd in <hi>David</hi>'s
Curſe, againſt his mortal Enemy, of having
his Table become a Snare.</p>
                  <p>And for the deſign (continues <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor)</hi>
of laying up vaſt Eſtates for a Man's
Children; if they be Sons, he thereby but
encreaſes their Temptation to wiſh the
Father Dead, and provides Incentives to
their Vice, and Fuel for their Exceſſes, when
he is ſo: And if they be Daughters, not to
repeat the newly mention'd Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
how many unhappy young Women
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54159:176"/>
have we ſeen, who, upon the ſcore of the
vaſt Portions left them by their Parents,
have been betray'd, and ſold by their Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
or by thoſe <hi>Relations</hi> that ſhould have
been, as they were call'd, their <hi>Friends?</hi> and
how often have we alſo ſeen, that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy
Fortune has been ſo far from Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
the Heir to it a good Husband, that
it has procur'd her a Bad one, by making
her think her ſelf oblig'd and qualify'd to
Match with ſome high Title, and procuring
her to be Haunted by ſome, whoſe Vices
perhaps alone have reduc'd him to Sell
himſelf to redeem his Fortune, and to make
an Addreſs which aims but at the Portion,
not the Perſon; and accordingly, when he
has got the one, he ſlights the other, and
<hi>deſpiſes</hi> her for the want of that high Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
ſhe priz'd in him, and perchance
<hi>hates</hi> her too, for confining him from ſome
former and more than pretended Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>I perceive then, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> (ſays <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius)</hi>
that you are, as well as I, diſpos'd to

to <hi>give him neither Poverty, nor Riches, but
to ſupply him with things ſuitable to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
Prov. 30. 8. (That ſeeming to be

                  <p>THe Sun was yet ſo near the Meridian,
that if the Attention <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſes
excited, had not diverted us from
minding the heat of the VVeather, we
ſhould have found it troubleſome; and in
effect, ſoon after we had left liſtning to the

to feel a heat, uneaſie enough to oblige
us to retire from it: But taking ſeveral
ways, as Chance or Inclination directed
us, to ſhun the ſame inconvenience, it was
my Fortune to hold the ſame courſe with
<hi>Lindamor,</hi> and both of us, by following no
Guide, but the deſign of ſhunning all beaten
Paths, and unſhelter'd Grounds, that being
the likelieſt way to reach our double end
of Coolneſs and Privacy; after we had a
while walk'd ſomewhat near the River-ſide,
we were at length brought to a Shady place,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54159:177"/>
which we ſhould have found, as well as we
wiſh'd it, a Solitude, if others had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
with us in the ſame hopes; for the
Expectation of Privacy had brought thither
divers, whom the Suns ſcorching heat invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to that cool and retir'd part of the
River, where they hop'd to ſhun all other
Eyes, as well as that of Heaven; among
thoſe Swimmers we obſerv'd ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
who, to ſecure their firſt Attempts,
had Bladders ty'd under their Arms, to keep
them from ſinking any lower. This ſight
(ſays <hi>Lindamor,</hi> after he had a while mus'd
upon it) hath Circumſtances in it, that
me-thinks are applicable enough to the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of many of the young Ladies of
theſe times; of whoſe faults, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Celia,</hi> and all the others, that you and
I can think worth our Concern, are free
enough to let me entertain you without
Rudeneſs of them; the Commonneſs of
theſe Blemiſhes ennobling thoſe few that
are exempted from them. You cannot then
(continues <hi>Lindamor)</hi> but have obſerv'd
with me, that many of thoſe young Ladies,
whoſe Parents, out of a miſtaken Zeal,
condemn that which at the Court was wont
to be call'd <hi>good Breeding,</hi> and <hi>Principles of
Honour,</hi> as things below a Chriſtian, and
inſufficient to bring their Poſſeſſours to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54159:177"/>
Heaven, are ſo unluckily Bred, and ſo ill
Humour'd, as well as Faſhion'd, that an
almoſt equally unhappy Education is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to make their Company tolerable:
Civility, which is almoſt as Eſſential to a
compleat Lady, as her Sex, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Strangers to, or rude Deſpiſers of it;
and not only their Minds are not Imbu'd
with thoſe Principles of Friendſhip, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
and Honour, which make ſome of
their Sex ſo Lovely, and ſo Illuſtrious in
Story, and of which more Ladies would be
capable, if more were taught them; but
theſe are utterly uninſtructed in the Laws
of what the French call <hi>Bein ſeance,</hi> and are
altogether unpractis'd in that Civility, and
ſuppleneſs of Humour, which is requiſite
to endear Converſation, and is ſo proper to
the ſofter Sex. I muſt confeſs, (purſues
<hi>Lindamor)</hi> that I never have been more
puzzl'd how to behave my ſelf then in their
Company: The ſerious ſort of Diſcourſe,
(ev'n ſuch as is to be found in our freſher
and more poliſh'd Romances) they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
incapable of; And in the trifling and
pitifull Prattle that alone is not above them,
they are ſo Unſociable, ſo Indiſcreet, and
oftentimes ſo Bold, that in ſpight of the
reſpect, ſuch as <hi>Celia</hi> gives me for her Sex,
I find in their Converſations as much Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54159:178"/>
for my Patience as my Chaſtity, and
being tempted to put off the reſpect that
belongs to Ladies, as they do the modeſty,
I find it more difficult to retain my Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
than my Liberty. The Bladders (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
<hi>Lindamor)</hi> which young Swimmers
uſe, are, 'tis confeſs'd, but light and empty
things, that are eaſily made uſeleſs; nay,
though they help beginners, they are Cloggs
to skilfull Swimmers, and yet theſe Trifles
are they that hinder Novices from ſinking
into the Mud: Thus Honour, though it be
an Airy unſolid thing, nay, though it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
proves a hinderance to great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients
in Chriſtianity, yet to Perſons that
have not yet attain'd to higher Principles,
it is an excellent ſupport, and hinders them
from ſinking into many Meanneſſes, and
Miſcarriages, into which, thoſe eſpecially
of the fairer Sex, that want a due ſenſe of
Honour, are too apt to be precipitated:
You know what Lord told his accuſed
Lady, that he knew ſhe was too proud to be
a Whore. And certainly, though Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Gallantry include not all Virtues,
yet they avert thoſe they ſway from groſſer
Vices: And though to be well Bred, be not
to be a Saint, but incomparably inferiour to
it; yet to be both, is more deſirable than
to be the latter only: And they are very
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54159:178"/>
unwiſe, who, before they are ſure their
Children will admit the higher and more
perfect Principles of Religion, neglect to
give them that Education that may render
Moral Accompliſhments acceptable to

Containing
A DISCOURSE
Upon the Sports being interrupted by Rainy
weather.</head>
               <p>NOtwithſtanding the Serenity and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſingneſs
of the Morning we came
out in, we have already upon the Water
had one proof of the unſettl'dneſs of the
Weather, and now upon the Land we meet
with another: For, by that time <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi>
was come ſomewhat near the end of
his Diſcourſ, he was oblig'd to haſten to
it, by the approach of a Cloud, whoſe
Largeneſs and Blackneſs threatned us with
an imminent Showr: Nor did it give us a
falſe Alarm, for by that time we could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54159:179"/>
the next Shelter, the Showr we fled
from, began to fall violently enough upon
the Trees, we were retir'd to. And this
unwelcome accident reducing us all to look
about us, we quickly ſaw, to our Grief, that
not only the <hi>Rain</hi> but the Clouds were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd,
and the Sky being almoſt every
where over-caſt, left us no way to eſcape
the inconveniences it threatned us with, but
the making with what haſte we could to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the place, over which we perceiv'd
ſmoke enough, to conclude there was ſome
Village beneath it: And finding at our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
thither, as good an Inn, as we could
reaſonably expect in ſuch a place, after
we had a while dry'd our ſelves by the Fire,
<hi>Eugenius</hi> (to whom Exerciſe and the time
of the Day had given a good Stomach)
mov'd the Company, that in ſpight of the
meanneſs of the Houſe, we might reſt our
ſelves there, till we had Dreſt the Fiſh we
had taken, to make up the beſt Dinner the
place would afford: This motion I did not
alone readily aſſent to, but ſeconded it, by
repreſenting, that probably by that time we
had Din'd, we ſhould either recover ſome
fair Weather, or loſe the hopes of regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it for that Day. To which I added other
conſiderations to perſwade the Company,
though, That indeed which prevail'd with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54159:179"/>
me, was, the expectation of having an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
while Dinner was providing, to
retire, as I ſoon after did, into another
Room, and ſet down in ſhort hand, what I
have hitherto been relating, leaſt either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
ſhould make the particulars vaniſh out
of my Memory, or they ſhould be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
there by the acceſſion of ſuch new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
as, in caſe a fair Afternoon ſhould
invite us to return to the River, <hi>Euſebius</hi>
would probably meet with Occaſions of
preſenting us. But before I could hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
ſlink away, I happen'd to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a while with ſome things of the like
Nature with thoſe I was about to ſet down:
For this unwelcome change after ſo glorious
and hopefull a Morning, did naturally ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
to all of us, ſome thoughts of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability
and Fickleneſs of Proſperity, and
how eaſily, as well as quickly, we may be
depriv'd of that we cannot eaſily part
with. But whilſt the reſt of us were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
themſelves with theſe thoughts,
<hi>Eugenius,</hi> who was more concern'd than
any other of us, for the ſport he came for,
having a good while look'd with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Eyes upon this change, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
and murmur at the interruption, which
the perſiſting Rain continued to give him in
it: Whereupon <hi>Lindamor</hi> took occaſion to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54159:180"/>
ſay, for my part, if I could diſſipate theſe
Clouds with a wiſh, I ſhould ſcruple at the
Ridding my ſelf of them, ev'n at ſo eaſie a
Rate: For I ſee, that the Gaping clefts of
the parched Ground do, as it were with ſo
many Mouths, proclaim its need of the Rain
you repine at. And I always (continues
he) am ready to joyn with the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in his wiſhings, as well for Rainy as for
fair Weather, and am ſo much a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
Man, that I had rather at any
time not eſcape a Showr, than let him want it.</p>
               <p>You are I confeſs, (ſays <hi>Eugenius)</hi> now
I think a little better on it, in the right, and
have more reaſon to be diſcontented at my
Impatience, than I at the Weather; for
we ſhould, ev'n in theſe leſſer Occaſions, as
well as on greater, Exerciſe ſelf-denial, and
prefer a publick good to our private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences:
And indeed it were far better,
that I ſhould miſs ſome Fiſhes, than that
thouſands of Families ſhould miſs of Bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that had hitherto liſten'd to
what was ſaid, being unwilling, that his
Friends Ingenuity ſhould make him any
longer accuſe himſelf, told him, (to divert
the Diſcourſe) This accident, <hi>Eugenius,</hi>
was ſuggeſting to me, a thought, wherewith
I ſhall not ſcruple to acquaint you, and the
Company. For (continues he) as pleaſant,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54159:180"/>
and as much deſir'd, as fair Weather is
wont to be, and as much as we uſe to be
diſcontented at a lowring and dropping sky,
yet the one is no leſs neceſſary nor uſeful in
its ſeaſon, than the other. For too uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
a courſe of Heat, and Sun-ſhine,
would make the ſeaſon fruitful in nothing,
but in Caterpillars, (or ſuch kind of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine)
and in Diſeaſes, and is far more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to fill Graves, than Barns: Whereas
ſeaſonable viciſſitudes of Clouds, and clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Weather, make both the Ground fruitful,
and the Seaſon healthful. Thus in our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Condition, too long and conſtant a
proſperity is wont to make the Soul Barren
of all, but ſuch Wantonneſſes as 'tis ill to be
fruitful of, and the interpoſition of ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Afflictions is as neceſſary, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous,
as it can be unwelcome. But
(perſues <hi>Euſebius)</hi> the conſideration that
chiefly entertain'd me, was this, That as
<hi>here,</hi> to make the Earth fruitful, the face of
Heaven muſt be now and then obſcur'd, and
over-caſt, we muſt be depriv'd of the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
pleaſure of the Sun to receive the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilizing
Benefit of the Rain; ſo ſuch is our
condition here below, that our perverſeneſs
makes it neceſſary, that God ſhould often-times
appear to frown upon us, to make
us fruitful in thoſe Works, to which he is
pleas'd to vouchſafe his ſmiles. But, Oh!
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54159:181"/>
(concludes <hi>Euſebius,</hi> lifting up his eyes and
hands towards Heaven) how happy ſhall
we be in that glorious and everlaſting Day,
<hi>when</hi> our Condition ſhall be as bleſſed in
not requiring Viciſſitudes as in not being
ſubject to them. <hi>When</hi> the Sun-ſhine alone
ſhall perform all that is wont to be done
here both by it, and by the Rain; and the
Soul, like <hi>Aegypt,</hi> being fruitful without
the aſſiſtance of the Clouds, we ſhall not
need to have our joys Eclips'd, to have our
Graces kept from being ſo, or to make our
Light ſhine the brighter: But each bleſſed
Soul ſhall be emblem'd by that Viſion in the
Revelations, where St. <hi>John ſaw an Angel
ſtanding in the Sun,</hi> we ſhall not then need to
have our Love wean'd from inferiour or
undue Objects, by any Experience of their
Imperfections; ſince the clear Diſcovery
that God will vouchſafe us of his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
will abundantly ſuffice to confine
our Affections to them: And ſince the
works wherein we are to be fruitful in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
will be but to admire and thank him,
that is infinite in Beauty, and in goodneſs,
the perfecter ſight and fruition we ſhall
have of his aſtoniſhing as well as raviſhing
Attributes, will but proportionably increaſe
our Wonder, and our Praiſes, and will
naturally make us as Grateful <hi>For</hi> ſuch a
ſtate as happy <hi>In It.</hi>

a very great Friend to <hi>Epicuriſm:</hi> For his

For I conſider, that as God hath made

                  <p>And, beſides what I have been alledging,
there is a further and more principal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
which belongs to this matter.
For ev'n wiſe men may proſecute the ſame
deſign, without doing it all of them the

There being a Nicer ſort of Readers which

God, ſhe hazarded a Throne, to which
above an hundred other Peoples paid ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and ventur'd at once the greateſt
Crown and the faireſt Head in the world;
One that had ſeen onely what ſhe was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without knowing why ſhe did it, would
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54159:183"/>
perchance have thought her emploi'd, more
like a Diſciple of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> than of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
whoſe People and her own was then in a
forlorn and gaſping condition. For the
Scripture telling us,<note place="margin">Eſt. 5. 1.</note> that <hi>ſhe put on her Royal
apparel,</hi> and the Tenour of the ſtory inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
with what aim ſhe did it, we may
well ſuppoſe that ſhe was not ſparing in
Jewels, and other of the richeſt Ornaments,
on an Occaſion where her Quality exacted
that ſhe ſhould appear with a Magnificence
befitting the greateſt Princeſs in the world;
and that ſhe was very curious in a Dreſs
that was to heighten her Beauty, when by
That, with the Giver's aſſiſtance, ſhe was
upon her knees to dazle the world's grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Monarch on his Throne, and make Him
pay Homage to her Charms, to whom
above an hundred Nations had preſented
their faireſt Productions, (the brighteſt
Nymphs of the Eaſt.) And thoſe that have
read any thing of the Aſiatick Luxury,
will eaſily believe our pious Queen to have
been alſo very ſollicitous about the choice
and ordering of her Sweet-meats, when ſhe
was to treat an Aſian Monarch, who had
treated the whole People of the chief City
of the world for many days together, and
as many Princes as made up the Nobleſt
part of Mankind for above twenty times as
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54159:184"/>
long: and yet this Magnificent Queen, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ſeem'd buſi'd about none but ſenſual Imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
had ſo commendable a Deſign both
in her Ornaments and in her Banquets, that
ſo meritorious an Imploiment of her Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhew'd her to be worthy of it; and as
it appear'd in the Event, that her Banquets
did co-operate with her Faſts, and her
Royal Robes with <hi>Mordecay</hi>'s Sack-cloth
and Aſhes, to that happy reſcue of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for which, after ſo many Ages, it doth
to this day yearly celebrate her Memory.
So whilſt ſhe ſeem'd buſied to gratifie
others ſenſuality and her own pride, her
Diſpoſition of Mind was ſo worthy the
Succeſs that crown'd her Attempt, that at
the ſame time ſhe was providing all that
Pomp and thoſe Delicacies, ſhe was alſo
providing to give them up, and ſacrifize
them, for the Intereſt of God's Church, and
her People; generouſly venturing for the
ſervice of Heaven a Height of proſperity,
for whoſe loſs nothing but Heaven it ſelf
could make her amends.</p>

                     <p>IF the Air were calm and quiet, this

even by its being contrary, help to raiſe this
Paper-Engine to that admired heighth,
which makes it be gaz'd at by many others,
than Boys, and not onely attract our eyes,
but ſometimes ſoar out of their reach.
Thus, if a great Perſon, for Courage, or

enough languiſh unregarded in an Age that
needs him not. But if the times grow trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome

                     <p>Me-thinks, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> theſe Kites
may afford us no leſs fit a reſemblance of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54159:185"/>
the fate of ſome Errours about Religion,
eſpecially if they chance to be maintain'd
by Men that are reſolute, and viceleſs. For
there are ſome of theſe conceits ſo fond,
and groundleſs, that they could not long
ſubſiſt of themſelves, and would ſoon ceaſe
to tempt a ſolemn Oppoſition, if they did
not too ſoon meet with it. And as you
were obſerving to another purpoſe, that
theſe artificial Kites, which men take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in calm weather, are both elevated
and kept aloft by the blaſts of contrary
winds, ſo theſe erroneous Opinions I ſpeak
of, would, if they were let alone, grow
quickly unregarded, whereas needleſs or
ill manag'd Perſecutions of Doctrine, not
prejudicial to Government, (for 'tis onely
ſuch that I mean) bring them into every
body's Eye, and give them a Repute, that
nothing elſe would have procur'd them,
and make them be look'd upon as things of
a ſublime and celeſtial nature, that lead to
that Heaven, they ſeem to aſpire to. To
thrive by Perſecution, though it be a great
Advantage, yet it is not the incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Prerogative of Divine Truths; And
though it be certain that they get moſt by
it, yet even Errors do often gain by it too,
there being certain Advantages that accrue
to Opinions, by being perſecuted, without
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54159:185"/>
diſtinguiſhing whether they be true, or
falſe. For men that are perſecuted for their
Religion, are generally careful to inſtruct
themſelves throughly in it, and furniſh
themſelves with Arguments to defend it.
The frowns of the Magiſtrate, and the
watchful Eyes of their Adverſaries, are
ſtrong Diſſwaſives to them from doing any
thing that may arm his hand, or provoke
other's tongues againſt their Sect, to which
they know their perſonal faults will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.
And above all this, their ſufferings
entitle them to popular commiſeration,
which is a thing that diſtreſs does ſo much
invite, that even condemn'd Malefactors
ſeldome want a ſhare in it. And to ſome of
theſe men Perſecution is the more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
becauſe it puts them upon fighting
with the weapons they can beſt handle.
For ſome are far better at Suffering, than at
Diſputing, and can more eaſily endure a
Priſon, than anſwer a Syllogiſm. And as
this Conſtancy is often their beſt Argument,
ſo is it an Argument, that the Generality of
Men beſt underſtand, and conſequently is
likely to be moſt wrought on by, ſo that the
more harſh than effectual way wherein they
are dealt with, gives them the opportunity
to diſplay a Reſoluteneſs, that makes moſt
men think them well meaning, and in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54159:186"/>
and their own Party cry them up for
Martyrs, or at leaſt Confeſſors; which, in
caſe that (as it happens in moſt States)
ſcandalous ſins be left unpuniſhed at the
ſame time, that Harmleſs Errours are ſo
ſeverely dealt with, gives them the fairer
opportunity to inſinuate into the minds of
the people, that their Perſecutors had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſee men vitious, than inquiſitive. And,
generally ſpeaking, any perſonal ſufferings
that a well-meaning man undergoes for
what he judges his Conſcience, is but ſuch
a kind of burden to his mind, as feathers
are to an Eagle, or a Falcon, which though
in themſelves conſider'd they have a
weight, yet inſtead of clogging him, they
not onely help him to ſupport himſelf, but
enable him to ſoar towards Heaven, and
reach a heighth that makes him prais'd or
wonder'd at.</p>

Philiſtins found themſelves ill protected by

ſtronger) Temple, though in the latter there
were thouſands of them, without any other
Enemy, than one, they had ſent for to be a
friend to their Mirth. For in the very midſt
of all the Triumphs of a ſolemn Feſtival
(which had more properly been kept to
<hi>Dililah)</hi> whil'ſt they were inſulting over
captive <hi>Samſon</hi>'s Blindneſs, they could not

that you and I ſhould be really troubled for

perhaps did onely keep the Power of doing
Good, which himſelf never us'd, from a

But you will demand, why then we put on
Black, To which, the Anſwer is eaſie, that
Cuſtom having eſtabliſh'd that Ceremony

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54159:191"/>

                     <p>I will add then, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> ſince
you will have it ſo, that I was conſidering,
that there has been no Law made by the
State to forbid any, much leſs Strangers, to
appear in this Court in Colour'd cloaths:
And thoſe, which the Gentleman I was
ſpeaking of, had on, were ſuch, both for
fineneſs, and faſhionableneſs, as would very
well become a greater Court, if it were
not in Mourning. But, now the Prince, and
thoſe that have the Honour to belong to
him, or to frequent this place, have put
themſelves into Blacks, to appear in another,
though in a finer Habit, is, to betray ones
not belonging to the Court, nor uſing to
come to it; and among ſo many, that think
they have a Right to give Laws in point of
Cloaths, a Lac'd, or an Imbroider'd ſuit,
though laſt Week in requeſt, would now
they have laid them by, make a Man look
not ſo much like a Courtier, as a Player.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54159:192"/>
And this Reflection invited me to conſider
further, what a ſtrange Influence faſhions
have on Mankind, and what an happy change
might be eaſily made in the World, if they,
who have it in their Power to introduce
Cuſtoms, would make it their Endeavour
to introduce good ones.</p>

                     <p>I am ſo much of your mind, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi>
that I confeſs, I envy not Princes ſo
much for the Splendour and the Pleaſures
that they live in, nor for the Authority of
raiſing Armies, nor perchance for the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of making them Victorious, as for
the power of impoſing and reforming of
Faſhions. And I think it a leſs improvable
Prerogative, to be able to coyn any Metal
into mony, or call it in at pleaſure, than by
the ſtamp of their Authority to introduce
good Cuſtoms, and make them current.</p>

                     <p>I will not diſpute, whether by
That, they do all they ought, but ſure I am,
they do not all they may: For humane
Laws being made for the civil Peace of
humane Societies, they are wont to be
fram'd not for the making Men virtuous,
but the reſtraining them from being miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous;
they conſiſt far more of Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54159:192"/>
than Commands, and ev'n their
Prohibitions reach but to a little part of
what is ill; the Buſineſs of Laws being to
provide, not againſt all Evils, but thoſe
groſſer ones, that are prejudicial to civil
Societies: So that there are a thouſand
Rules of Reaſon, or Chriſtianity, which
States have not thought fit to turn into
Laws. For Pride, Envy, Covetouſneſs,
Gluttony, Intemperance, Effeminateneſs,
Oaths, Idleneſs, and I know not how many
other Sins, contrary to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of Chriſt, are ſo little provided
againſt by humane Sanctions, that one may
be a bad Chriſtian, and a bad Man, without
being a bad Citizen; There being nothing
more eaſie, nor I fear more uſual, than for
Multitudes to paſs uncited before Man's
Tribunal, to receive their Condemnation at
God's. But though a Prince can ſcarce, as a
Legiſlator, prevent, or ſuppreſs ſuch Sins,
yet, as a Pattern, he may do much towards
it: For by his Example, his Opinions, his
Encouragements, and his Frowns, he may
reform an hundred particular things, which
the Laws do not (and perhaps cannot)
reach. His declar'd Eſteem of ſuch and
ſuch Practices, joyn'd with his particular
Actions ſuited to it, and his profeſt diſlike
of thoſe Sinful or Diſhonourable courſes,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54159:193"/>
he finds the Rifeſt, back'd with a ſteddy
and reſolute diſcountenance of thoſe that
do not decline them, will, in a ſhort time,
bring thoſe that are about him, to conform
their Actions and Behaviour to what Men
are ſatisfi'd, he deſires, or likes. And thoſe
whom their nearneſs to Him, or their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
make the conſpicuous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
Perſons, being thus model'd, their
Relations and Dependants will quickly be
ſo too, and then that which is in requeſt at
Court, being upon that very account look'd
upon as the Faſhion, it will by degrees be
imitated by all thoſe on whom the Court
has Influence; ſince, as we juſt now ſaw in
the Inſtance of <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s gawdy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Men will be aſham'd to be unlike
thoſe, whoſe Cuſtoms and Deportments
paſs for the Standards, by which thoſe of
other Men are to be meaſur'd.</p>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54159:193"/>
that goes of a Grand Signior, who being
invited by a Chriſtian Embaſſadour to
hear ſome of our Muſick, commanded the
Fidlers to be thruſt out of his Seraglia, upon
a miſ-apprehenſion that they were playing,
when they were but tuning. But this rare
Artiſt had no ſooner put an end to the ſhort
exerciſe he gave our Patience, than he put
us to the Exerciſe of another Virtue: For
his nimble and skilful Fingers make one of
the innocenteſt Pleaſures of the Senſes to
be one of the greateſt, and this Charming
melody (for which <hi>Orpheus</hi> or <hi>Orion</hi>
themſelves might envy him) do's not ſo
properly delight as raviſh us, and render it
difficult to moderate the Tranſports of our
Paſſions, but impoſſible to reſtrain the
praiſes that expreſs our ſatisfaction: So
that if this Muſitian had been diſcourag'd by
the unpleaſant Sounds that were not to be
avoided, whil'ſt he was putting his Lute in
Tune, from proceeding in his work, he had
been very much wanting to himſelf, and to
ſave a little pains, had loſt a great deal of
Pleaſure and Applauſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus, when the faculties and paſſions of

                     <p>HEre is indeed a Preſent, for
which I muſt ſtill think my ſelf
this fellow's Debtor, though he thinks I have
over-paid him. 'Tis pity theſe Rarities
were not more ſuitably addreſs'd, and worn
by ſome of Natures other Maſter-pieces,
with whom they might exchange a graceful
Luſtre, and have the Ornament they confer
reflected back upon them. But one that
had never been a Lover, would perhaps ſay,
that that wiſh were more civil to the
Flowers, than the Ladies, of whom there
are few, which theſe ſoft poliſh'd Skins, and
Orient Tinctures, would not eaſilier make
Foils, than prove ſuch to them: For
(not to name the Reſt) this Lovely fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
Roſe here, wears a Bluſh that needs
not do ſo, at any Colour the Spring it ſelf
can, amongſt all her Charming Rarities,
ſhew. Yes, here are Flowers above the
flattery of thoſe of Rhetorick; and beſides,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54159:195"/>
two or three unmingled Liveries, whoſe
ſingle Colours are bright, and taking enough
to exclude the wiſh of a diverſity; here is a
variety of Flowers, whoſe Dyes are ſo
dexterouſly blended, and fitly checquer'd,
that every ſingle Flower is a variety. I
envy not <hi>Arabia</hi>'s Odours, whil'ſt that of

                     <p>I perceive, <hi>(Lindamor)</hi> that you
judge of the Delightfulneſs of this Man's
calling, onely by theſe Lovely and Fragrant
productions of it. And you ſee theſe curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Flowers in their prime, without ſeeing
by what practices, and degrees, they have
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54159:195"/>
been brought from deſpicable ſeeds to this
perfection and luſtre. And perhaps, if you
conſider'd, that a Gardener muſt be digging
in the violent heats of the Summer, and
muſt be afraid of the bitter cold of the
Winter, and muſt be watchful againſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
froſts in the Spring, and muſt not
onely prune, and water, and weed his
Ground, but muſt, to obtain theſe gawdy
and odoriferous Flowers, ſubmit to deal with
homely and ſtinking Dung; If <hi>(Lindamor)</hi>
you would take notice of theſe and of ſome
other Toils and Hardſhips that attend a
Gardener's Trade, you would (I doubt not)
confeſs, that his Imployments, like his
Buſhes, bring him Thorns as well as Roſes.</p>
                     <p>And now give me leave <hi>(Lindamor)</hi> to
tell you, that this may be appli'd to the
condition of ſome ſtudious perſons, that
you and I know. For when we hear a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or Eloquent Sermon, or read ſome
Book of Devotion, or perhaps ſome Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional
Diſcourſe handſomely written, we
are apt to envy the Preacher or the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for being able to ſay ſome things thar
inſtruct or pleaſe us ſo much. But alas,
<hi>(Lindamor)</hi> though we ſee not theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of the Brain till they are finiſh'd,
and conſequently fitted to appear with their
full Advantages abroad, yet to bring them
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54159:196"/>
to that paſs, the Author may perhaps under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
many a trouble that we dream not of.
For he that has to do with difficult or
weighty Subjects cannot preſent us a good
Book, or a Fine Diſcourſe, with the ſame
eaſe that a rich man can preſent us a fine
pair of Gloves, or a fine Collation,
which may be had at an hour's warning
from the next Milleners or Confectioners.
For to be able to write one good Book on
ſome Subjects, a man muſt have been at
the trouble to read an hundred: To grow
capable to give a better rendring of a Greek
Text, he muſt perchance have perus'd
<hi>Suidas, Stephanus, Heſychius,</hi> and I know not
how many Lexicographers and Scholiaſts:
To be qualifi'd to make a Tranſlation of an
Hebrew Word or Phraſe, that ſhall illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
a dark Text, or clear a Difficulty, or
more fitly agree with his notion, or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
of a place in Scripture, a man
muſt have not onely like a School-Boy
learn'd an Hebrew Grammar, and turn'd
over <hi>Buxtorf</hi>'s <hi>Schindler</hi>'s, and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionaries,
but (which is worſe) he muſt in
many caſes hazard his eyes and his patience
in converſing with ſuch Jewiſh Writings,
not onely as <hi>Elias</hi> his <hi>Tiſhbi,</hi> and <hi>Kimchi</hi>'s
<hi>Michlol;</hi> but to gain a little Rabbinical
Learning, and find out ſome unobvious ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54159:196"/>
of a Word or Phraſe, he muſt
devour the tedious and voluminous Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſodies
that make up the <hi>Talmud,</hi> in many
of which he can ſcarce learn any thing but
the Art of ſaying nothing in a multitude of
words; and in others, which are not ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
the moſt he will find in I know not
how many dull pages, (written with as
little Wit as Truth) will perhaps be an
Account of ſome wild Opinion, or ſome
obſolete Cuſtom, or ſome ſuperſtitious Rite
of a generation of people, whoſe Fancies
and Manners ſcarce any thing makes worth
our inquiring after, but their having liv'd
many Ages ſince. And even when a man
ſets himſelf to write thoſe ſmooth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures,
where Eloquence is conſpicuous,
and ſeems to be chiefly deſign'd, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſeldom comes by his Contentment on
as eaſie terms as the Readers come by theirs.
For, not to mention, that ſometimes Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods
that in a well printed Book look very
handſomely, and run very evenly, were not
in the written Copy without interlining and
Tranſcriptions. Thoſe that are Schollars
themſelves can hardly write without having
an ambition, or at leaſt a care, to approve
their Diſcourſes to them that are ſo too.
And in the judgment of ſuch Peruſers, to be
able to write well, one muſt not onely have
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54159:197"/>
skill in the Subject, but be well skill'd in the
way of writing, leſt the Matter be blemiſh'd
by the manner of Handling it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
to ſhew ones ſelf a Maſter in treating
of variety of Themes with a florid ſtyle,
and even in thoſe Compoſures that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
chiefly to expreſs Wit and move
Affections, one may think that Nature may
be well let alone to ſupply any ſhe has been
kind to, with all they need, yet even in
theſe caſes there are ſome Toils and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſſes
that are ſcarce to be avoided; ſince
a diſcreet man, though never ſo rich in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures's
gifts, will think himſelf oblig'd to
ſtudy Rhetorick, that he may be ſure he
does not tranſgreſs the Laws of It. For
though an Author's Natural parts may make
his Book abound with Wit, yet without
the help of Art he will ſcarce make it free
from faults. And to be well ſtock'd with
Compariſons, which when skilfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
make the moſt taking paſſages of fine
Pieces, one muſt ſometimes ſurvey and
range through the works of Nature and Art,
which are the chief Ware-houſes, where
variety and choice of Similitudes is to be
had, and to obtain thoſe pleaſing Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
there is oftentimes requir'd no leſs
pains than to deviſe uſeful Notions. As one
muſt ſearch the Ditches amongſt Briars and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54159:197"/>
Weeds, not onely to find Medicinable
Herbs, but to gather Prim-roſes and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.
So that <hi>(Lindamor)</hi> to conclude, if
we conſider the trouble that applauded
Compoſures do oftentimes coſt their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
we ſhould be ſenſible we owe more
than moſt men think we do to thoſe to
whom we owe good Books. But then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they find ſome Recompence for their
Labours, in the ſatisfaction of promoting
piety, or in the well-natur'd Pleaſure they
feel themſelves in pleaſing others, I ſhould
ſcarce doubt but that ſome of the Writers,
we think ſo happy, may rather deſerve our
Eſteem than our Envy.</p>

when they firſt gaze upon a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation

creates, are in ſuch men excited too often

believe either their own querulous words,
or their pale and melancholly looks, which
would make one think they were juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring

has his Affections, and Senſes, at that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

                     <p>IS not this Cloſet ſtrangely fine,
<hi>Euſebius?</hi> Here is ſuch a variety
of pretty and taking Objects, that they do
as well diſtract the Eye as delight it; the
abundance, the choice, and the Order, do as
well diſcloſe the fair Poſſſeſſors skill, as Her
magnificence, and ſhew at once, that ſhe
both has plenty, and deſerves it, by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo well how to make uſe of it. Thoſe
things that are here ſolitary, or ſingle, will
ſcarce be elſewhere matched, and all the
reſt are ſo pretty, and ſo excellent in their
ſeveral Kinds, that the number of fine things
that make up this curious Collection, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hinder any of them from being a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
And in a word, the Embelliſhments,
that adorn and ennoble this delightful place,
are ſuch, that I believe the Poſſeſſor of
them, as welcome as ſhe is unto the beſt
Companies, ſcarce ever looks upon finer
things, than ſhe can ſee in her Cloſet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
when ſhe looks into her Glaſs. But,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54159:200"/>
me-thinks, <hi>Euſebius,</hi> you hear and view all
this with a ſilent ſeriouſneſs, which begins
to make me ſuſpect, that what I thought
might be an Effect of your Wonder, may
be ſo of your Diſlike.</p>

                     <p>The Collection, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> is, I
confeſs, very curious in its Kind, and ſuch,
as if the Miſtreſs of it were leſs handſome
than ſhe is, might give her as well Cauſe
to be jealous of theſe fine things, as to be
proud of them, ſince a Beauty, that were
but ordinary, could not divert a Spectator's
Eye from Objects, whereof many are
not ſo. But, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> I muſt freely tell
you, that I like both the Lady, and the
Cloſet, much better than the Cuſtom;
ſuch ſights as theſe are introducing among
Ladies of furniſhing ſuch Kind of Cloſets:
I know that Youth may in certain caſes,
excuſe ſome of the Impertinencies 'tis wont
to occaſion; And it is not ſtrange to me,
that Perſons of the fairer Sex, ſhould like,
in all things about them, that handſomneſs
for which they find themſelves to be the
moſt lik'd; Nor would I forbid, ev'n ſuch
of them, as are not of a very high Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to have a retiring place ſo neatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd,
as may invite them to be alone, and
with-draw to it, to read, or meditate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
theſe Ornaments be not ſo coſtly, as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54159:200"/>
to rob Charity, or ſo gawdy, as to diſtract
the Devotion they ſhould but accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date.
And in caſe Circumſtances ſhould
ſo conſpire, as that Youth and Quality
ſhould be attended by ſuch a plentiful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
as that after all, that either Juſtice,
Prudence, or Decency can challenge, there
remains yet enough, both to relieve the
Poor, and purchaſe Rarities themſelves:
I will not be ſo ſevere, as to condemn Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſo circumſtanc'd, nor fall out with
thoſe that are able to reconcile Sumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Charity. But the number of ſuch
Ladies, eſpecially ſo ſoon after a long civil
War, muſt needs be but ſmall, and I fear
much inferiour to that of thoſe, who will
conſider more what they ſee done before
their Eyes, than they will the diſparity of
Circumſtances betwixt their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and that of thoſe they Aemulate:
And the greater appearance of Ingeniouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as well as Innocence, there is in the
practice I am diſapproving, the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
it is, and the more fit to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and decri'd. For as the old Serpent
has variety of Wiles, ſo he fits them to the
various tempers of the Perſons he aſſays
to work upon; and when he meets with
Ladies virtuouſly diſpoſed, ſince he cannot
quite eradicate their inclinations to the beſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54159:201"/>
part of Religion, Charity, he will at leaſt
blaſt and render them fruitleſs; and he juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinks, he has reach'd no ſmall part of
his end, if though he cannot ſeduce them
to do ill, he can at leaſt hinder them from
doing good. And this he has of late at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
but too proſperouſly, by perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
us to take thoſe for the ſtandard and
examples of our Expences, that making
none of the ſcore of Piety, have the more
left for their Vanities and their Appetites,
which they gratifie at ſuch high rates, that
thoſe that think themſelves bound to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
them in thoſe Exceſſes, that are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd
Gallantry, ſhall have as little ability,
as the other have will, to apply any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part of their Eſtates to thoſe Uſes,
which chiefly God granted them thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
for; and by that time, the Lady her
ſelf, and the Houſe, and the Cloſet, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with all the Ornaments that Vanity
and Emulation call for, there is nothing left
for Charity to diſpoſe of, nay, perhaps not
for Juſtice; the Creditor being oftentimes
turned back empty as well as the Beggar,
if not alſo made a Beggar by ruinous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays.
And greater fortunes, than moſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
have, may be exhauſted, by gratifying
ſuch an ambition, as that of a Cloſet, to
whoſe Coſtlineſs nothing can put limits, till
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54159:201"/>
Diſcretion do: Cuſtom it ſelf having not yet
regulated a piece of Vanity, which, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
as Cuſtom is wont to be, it has not
yet dar'd to enjoyn.</p>

                     <p>Me-thinks, <hi>Euſebius,</hi> you are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
forward to accuſe thoſe fair Creatures,
that though they ſhould want Innocence,
would ſcarce want Advocates; and you are
to good a Caſuiſt to ignore, that they are
wont to alledge, that the Bravery you are ſo
ſevere to, is no where expreſsly prohibited
in the Scripture, and this unforbiddenneſs
they think ſufficient to evince, that the
Sumptuouſneſs you ſo condemn, is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,
and in its own nature, Sinful.</p>

                     <p>I can readily believe, that <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi>
has Wit and Amorouſneſs enough
to make him find it more eaſie to defend
fair Ladies, than to defend himſelf againſt
them: And I know, 'tis ſaid, that theſe
ſumptuous Cloſets, and other Vanities, are
not ſimply unlawful in their own Nature;
but I know too, that divers things, not in
their own Nature unlawful, may be made
ſo by circumſtances, and if ſo, then I fear,
That that can be no other than ill, which
makes a Man needleſsy diſable himſelf to
do good. The Apoſtle, that diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd
Woman's wearing of Gold, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
things upon their Bodies, would ſure
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54159:202"/>
have oppoſed their having more ſumptuous
Ornaments upon their Walls: Theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pray for us, but the poor and diſtreſſed,
they keep us from relieving, may either
ſucceſsfully pray to God for us, or cry to
him againſt us. The Scripture that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<hi>Dives</hi> in Hell, without ſaying that he
oppreſſed or defrauded any, gives no other
account of his Doom, than that living at a
high rate, and going richly dreſs'd, he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to relieve the ſtarving poor. A few
ſuch Cloſets as this Ladies, might be eaſily
enlarged, and contrived into an Hoſpital:
A ſmall part of theſe Superfluities would
relieve the neceſſities of many Families, and
a liberal Heart might purchaſe Heaven at
an eaſier rate, than the furniture of this
Cloſet coſt the Owner of it. Nor is this
practice ſo unallied to a fault, as to eſcape
a puniſhment even in this World; theſe
Courtiers of Applauſe being oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to live in want, even in the midſt of
a plentiful Fortune; theſe coſtly trifles ſo
engroſſing all that they can ſpare, that they
muſt ſometimes deny themſelves things
convenient, and perhaps almoſt neceſſary,
to flaunt it out with thoſe that are neither
the one nor the other, and being frequently
enough fain to immolate their own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and deſires, though perchance ſtrong
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54159:202"/>
and innocent, to their Vanity. And thoſe
that have once found the happineſs there is
in making others happy, will think their
Treaſure better beſtowed in feeding hungry
Mouths, than idle Eyes: The coſtly Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
I am yet cenſuring, does not onely
offend Charity, but ſtarve it, by ſubſtracting
from it that which ſhould feed it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
it to act like it ſelf. And for my part,
I think, he that deviſes, and by his Example
brings Credit to, a new Expenſive way of
Vanity, does really deſtroy more Poor,
than if he uſurped an Alms-houſe, or ruined
an Hoſpital. And by the ill Preſident he
leaves, he takes the way to be uncharitable,
even after Death, and ſo do harm, when
Miſers and Uſurers themſelves are wont
(by their Legacies) to do ſome good.
To conclude, 'tis no very Chriſtian practice
to diſobey the Dictates of Piety, without
having ſo much to plead for ſo doing, as the
pretence of following the Dictates of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom:
And 'tis a great deal better to be
without a gay Cloſet, than to be without
Charity, which lovelieſt of Chriſtian vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
ſhe muſt ſure very much want, that
will needleſsly begin an new Example to
give a bad one.</p>

                     <p>POor Bird! thou wert juſt now
ſo high upon the Wing, that the
tir'd Gazers fear'd thou hadſt loſt thy ſelf
in Heaven, and in thy fatal ſtooping ſeem'ſt
to have brought us thence a Meſſage, that
ſo relliſhes of that place, that I ſhould be
troubl'd to ſee thee ſo rudely entertain'd,
if that Circumſtance were not neceſſary to
the Inſtructions of thy Meſſage; ſome
Birds, you know, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> we uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
with Chaff, and others are generally
drawn in by appropriated Baits, and by the
Mouth, not the Eye. But the aſpiring Lark
ſeems compos'd of more ſprightly, and
refin'd Materials, ſhe is ever a Natural,
though no Native, Perſian, and the Sun
makes not a cloudleſs Viſit to our Horizon,
which that grateful Creature gives not a
welcome to, both by Notes, which, could
he hear them, he would think worthy of
him, and by a flight as aspiring as if ſhe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54159:203"/>
meant he ſhould hear them; and, in a word,
ſo conſpicuous is this Creatures fondneſs
of Light, that Fowlers have devis'd a way
to catch her by it, and pervert it to her
Ruine: For placing broken Looking-glaſſes
upon a moveable Frame betwixt their Nets,
the unwary Bird, while ſhe is gazing upon
that glittering Light the Glaſs reflects, and
ſporting her ſelf in thoſe Beams, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
a new Glory from their very being
broken, heedleſsly gives into the Reach of
the ſurprizing Nets, which ſuddenly cover
her, and which the Light it ſelf kept her
from ſeeing. The Devil is like this Fowler,
<hi>Lindamor,</hi> and you, or I, had perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembl'd
the unhappy Lark, if ſometimes
Providence did not both graciouſly, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably,
interpoſe, and ev'n when we were
come near enough to have been cover'd by
the Nets, reſcu'd us from them; for it has
ever been that old Serpent's Policy, and
practice, to take the exacteſt meaſure of
our Inclinations, that he may skilfully ſuit
his Temptations to them; well knowing,
that that Dexterity gains him a Devil within
us, that conſpires with him without us, to
make us Inſtances of that Truth which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
<hi>Things divided against themſelves
as ruinous.</hi> If therefore, the Tempter find
by Experience, that you are indiſpos'd to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54159:204"/>
be wrought upon by common Temptations,
to forget the Practice of Religion, that you
have Unconcern'dneſs enough not to be
much diſtracted with the empty and trifling
Chaff, Youth is wont to be caught with,
(which perhaps ſeldome employ any of
your Thoughts ſo much as thoſe of Scorn,
and Pity) that the very Gain and ſolider
Goods of this World (for which many
thought wiſe Men loſe thoſe of the next)
cannot make you ſo greedy, nor ſo fond of
them, as he deſires. If, I ſay, the Devil
have ſufficiently obſerv'd how uneaſie it
were to intice you with common Baits, he
will alter his Method ſtrait, and attempt to
catch you with Light. He knows as well as
I do, that you have a Curioſity, or rather a
Greedineſs of Knowledge, that is impatient
of being confin'd by any other Limits than
thoſe of Knowledge it ſelf; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
ſeldome, or perhaps never diſturbing
or frightning you, he will let you freely
ſport your ſelf about the glittering Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Glaſs, Men call Philoſophy, and
ſuffer you not onely to <hi>gaze</hi> upon all its
pieces, and <hi>ſurvey</hi> a pretty Number, but

fate thoſe Papers of mine, that treat
of Devotion, have met with: For when I
firſt was ſo unacquainted with the world, as
to expect that Piety and Vertue were able,
by their native charms, ſo much to endear
my dreſs, as to win themſelves adorers
in a plain, or even a ſevere one; I ventur'd
ſome of them abroad, though not in Print,
yet among my Acquaintance, in a careleſs
Matron-like habit, in which I ſoon found
they almoſt frighted moſt of thoſe I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
them to work the quite contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
on. But when my Acquaintedneſs with
the Genius of the Age had ſadly taught me,
that I was to alter my Method, that the
Eloquence of Vertues Sermons was that
which muſt attract an Auditory, and engage
Attention to them; and that thoſe orders of
hers, in which ſhe employ'd not Rhetorick
for her Secretary, could not be ſo much as
liſten'd to, much leſs obey'd, I endeavour'd
to cloath Vertue, though not in a gawdy, in
a Faſhionable Habit, and deveſting her not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54159:207"/>
onely of her Sack-cloth, but her Blacks,
where I ſaw ſhe appear'd in them with
Diſadvantage, I endeavour'd to give her
as much of the modern Ornaments of a fine
Lady, as I could without danger of being
accus'd to have dreſs'd her like a Curtizan.
This Attempt having not prov'd ſo unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful,
but that many were pleas'd to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

tri'd my Pen in a ſmoother, and more flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
ſtyle, than that which the nature of the
Studies I was moſt addicted to, made the
moſt familiar to me, flattering my ſelf with
a Belief, that ſince my Writings had uſually
the good fortune not to be ill approv'd, I
might ſo happily mingle and interweave
Inſtructions with Delight, as to neceſſitate
my Readers to ſwallow both together, or at

                     <p>You have better luck, as well as
better skill, than many others, if you find it
not often to fare with the Fiſhers of Men as
it did with thoſe other Fiſhers, that firſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54159:207"/>
were honoured with that glorious Title,
when they complained to our Saviour, that
<hi>we have toiled all the night,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 5. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>and have taken
nothing.</hi> For I ſee that men are grown witty
enough to elude what they cannot deſpiſe,
and reſemble the deaf Adder that ſtops her
ſpiritual ears from hearkening to the voice
of Charmers, be the Charmer never ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
And the beſt Reception that the
moving'ſt Eloquence, that pleads for Piety,
can obtain of them, is but ſuch as may ſerve
to make that applicable to the Preacher,
which God once ſaid to a Prophet, <hi>Lo
thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one
that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well
upon an Inſtrument; For they hear thy words,
but they do them not.</hi> But the beſt is, that you
ſerve a Maſter, that is as inclinable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as able to diſcern, Intentions, and
does not make his Eſtimates by Events, but
judges of our Performances, not by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
they produce, but the Affections they
flow'd from, and the Ends they aim'd at.</p>

therefore, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as I dare not repine
at the unſucceſsfulneſs of my Endeavours,
ſo I dare think, that whilſt it proceeds but
from the Obſtinacy of others, 'tis not likely
to be imputed to me by Him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54159:208"/>
plain' Himſelf, <hi>That all the day long he had
stretch'd forth his hands to an unperſuadable
and gain-ſaying people.</hi> Otherwiſe, I confeſs,
I ſhould not have much cauſe to be ſatisfi'd
with the Return that all my Indeavours have
hitherto brought me home. For I ſee that
men can read a Book of Devotion as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'dly
as they do a Romance or a Play,
in both of them culling out onely what they
call Wit, and making no better uſe of it
than either to exerciſe or improve their
own. They hear the moſt pathetick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
not as Chriſtians but Oratours, and
if in ſuch Diſcourſes they have been ſo juſt
as to praiſe the Rhetorick, they think they
may well be excus'd if they over-look the
Divinity: In ſhort, nothing but what gratifies
their Fancy can leave any Impreſſions on
their Memory, and that it ſelf, if it tend to
reform them, makes none on their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
And ſome whoſe happier Pens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them to do it far more juſtly than I can,
do complain, That if a devout Book have
not good ſtore of witty paſſages, they will
not mind it at all, and if it have, they will
mind nothing elſe.</p>
                     <p>So that, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> I ſhould ſometimes
be diſcourag'd from proſecuting Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
which, though they now and then
ſucceed, are oft-times ſo unproſperous, if
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54159:208"/>
I did not think, with you, that they who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

how forward we are to think other Nations
abſurd or barbarous for ſuch practices, that

I acknowledge it to be one of the chief ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
I account my ſelf to have obtain'd
by my Travels, that as I do not eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
ſo I am not forward to deride, the
Practice of any People for being New, and
am not apt to think, their Cuſtoms muſt be

widely differ from them.</p>
                     <p>I could give you ſtore of Inſtances to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54159:210"/>
this impartiality, but becauſe the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of eating and drinking are thoſe
which make men, with the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
term other Nations Brutiſh and
Barbarous, I will confine may ſelf to ſome
Examples of that nature.</p>
                     <p>We impute it for a barbarous cuſtom to
many Nations of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that like
Beaſts they eat raw Fleſh. And pray' how
much is that worſe than our eating raw
Fiſh, as we do in eating theſe Oyſters?
Nor is this a practice of the rude Vulgar
onely, but of the politeſt and niceſt perſons
among us, ſuch as Phyſicians, Divines, and
even Ladies. And our way of eating ſeems
much more barbarous than theirs, ſince
they are wont to kill before they eat, but
we ſcruple not to devour Oyſters alive, and
kill them not with our Hands or Teeth,
but with our Stomachs, where (for ought
we know) they begin to be digeſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they make an end of dying. Nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
when we dip them in Vinegar, we
may, for ſauce to one bit, devour alive a
ſchole of little Animals, which, whether
they be Fiſhes or Worms, I am not ſo ſure,
as I am, that I have, by the help of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Glaſſes, ſeen great numbers of them
ſwimming up and down in leſs than a Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
full of Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:54159:210"/>
We deteſt and deſpiſe ſome other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for feeding upon Caterpillars,
Graſs-hoppers, and other Inſects; and
others, for feeding upon Carrion, and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
food.</p>
                     <p>And do not many of us do as bad, when
we not onely eat, but extoll, rotten Cheefe,
whoſe Livid Colour ſufficiently betrays its
Putrefaction, and whoſe odious ſmell of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
moſt mens Noſes, and turns ſome
mens Stomachs? Nay, when this Cheeſe is
grown to that high degree of rottenneſs
that our critical palats like it beſt in, we
then devour whole hundreds of Mites,
which are really crawling Inſects, bred out
of Putrefaction, and theſe too are ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and little, that our greedineſs makes us
ſwallow many of them alive.</p>
                     <p>Among the Savageſt Barbarians we
count the Cannabals, and as for thoſe
among them that kill men to eat them, their
inhumane cruelty cannot be too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted;
but to count them ſo barbarous
merely upon the ſcore of feeding on man's
fleſh and bloud, is to forget that woman's
milk, by which alone we feed our ſucking
Children, is, according to the received
Opinion, but blanched Bloud; and that
Mummy is one of the uſual Medicines
commended and given by our Phyſicians
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54159:211"/>
for falls and bruiſes, and in other caſes too.
And if we plead that we uſe not Mummy
for food, but Phyſick, the <hi>Indians</hi> may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
anſwer, that by our way of uſing man's
fleſh, we do oftentimes but protract ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and pain, whereas they by theirs
maintain their health and vigour. And there
is no reaſon why it ſhould be allowable to
eat Broth, for inſtance, in a Conſumption,
and be condemnable to feed upon it to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
health.</p>
                     <p>But laſtly, as the higheſt degree of Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs,
our Travellers mention the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Soldanians at the <hi>Cape of Good
hope,</hi> who not onely eat raw meat, but, if
they be hungry, eat the guts and all of their
Cattle, with the Dung in them. I will not
anſwer, that I know ſeveral among us, (and
perhaps ſome fair Ladies too) that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Scurvy and the Gout, drink their
own or Boy's Urine: nor that women
themſelves do oftentimes take <hi>Parmacitty</hi>
inwardly, though the Latin name <hi>(Sperma
Ceti)</hi> ſufficiently declare what excretion of
a Whale it is (though perhaps miſtakenly)
believed to be: nor yet that under the name
of <hi>Album Graecum,</hi> Dogs dung is commonly
given to Patients of all ſorts and qualities
againſt ſore Throats: nor will I mention,
that in <hi>Holland</hi> 'tis uſual, as I have ſeen my
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54159:211"/>
ſelf, to mingle Sheep's dung with their
Cheeſes, onely to give them a colour and
a reliſh: But I will rather demand, how
much leſs we do our ſelves, than what we
abominate in thoſe Savages, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
Oyſters whole, guts, excrements, and
all; nay, when not for Phyſick, but onely for
Delicacies, our Courtiers and Ladies
themſelves are wont to make ſawce for the
bodies of Lobſters of that green ſtuff, which
is indeed their Dung: And to theſe I could
add other Examples, if I were not afraid to
divert you too long from ſo much pleaſure
as the Company ſeems to take in eating raw
Fiſh.</p>

and that we laugh at many Cuſtoms of

there is a greater concourſe of fine people

almoſt as ſparkling as their Eyes, (which

the Men themſelves are many of them as
finely and as richly dreſs'd, as if even they
came as well to be ſeen as to ſee. And if

ſhould be, (and what ſome ſay
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54159:214"/>
he is) a Perſon acquainted with the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

we, as other's Nations, value our own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions
enough, to look upon Men diſguis'd
by the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> dreſs, as little better than An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
if not as ſome new kind of Northern

Gawdy ſpectators, that were able to put
an ordinary Stranger out of Countenance,
to appear in a Habit differing from theirs;
the Embaſſadour, and thoſe that come along
with him, think it not fit to decline the
<hi>Ruſſian</hi> habit or Ceremonies, for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
but keep to the Ceremonies us'd in

to diſparage the Faſhions of his own people,

thoſe that are Loyal to Virtue, have cauſe
to look upon thoſe they refuſe to be like,

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54159:215"/>
unworthy Practices blemiſh'd, and almoſt
forfeited, the Dignity of their Nature, and

whereas theſe <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that we ſhall never prefer their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions

great an aſſurance, that thoſe, whoſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices

that theirs diſſented from his, and
will wiſh they had imitated what they now

ſhall come to the celeſtial City he belongs
to, he will be in no danger to be derided for
the ſake of Piety, ſince thoſe, that deride
Piety, will not be admitted there. And as
theſe <hi>Ruſſians</hi> could not take a better way
than that of not ſneaking, to avoid the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

ſo for a Chriſtian, not to bluſh at his unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionableſt

way to keep them and him from being
ſcorn'd, eſpecially with thoſe, who having
themſelves no Quality better than Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
value it moſt in others. And ſure
it were a very unlikely way to keep others
from deſpiſing the Cuſtoms of the Heavenly
Jeruſalem, for him that belongs to it to
appear aſham'd of them himſelf. Nor
have pious Perſons cauſe to be out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
at the ſingularity ev'n of a ſtrictly

if they aſpire to be as like as they can here,
to thoſe, whom they deſire and hope to be

that the ſeeing them in this Garden grow

or other on it. And perhaps it may
not be an improper one, to compare the
difference betwixt theſe two kinds of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to the diſparity which I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
betwixt the Fates of thoſe young
Ladies, that are onely very handſome, and
thoſe that have a leſs degree of Beauty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd
by the Acceſſion of Wit, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and Virtue: For Tulips, whil'ſt
they are freſh, do indeed by the Luſtre, and
Vividneſs, of their Colours, more delight
the Eye than Roſes; but then they do not
alone quickly fade, but as ſoon as they have
loſt that freſhneſs, and gawdineſs, that ſolv
indear'd them, they degenerate into things
not onely undeſirable, but diſtaſtful; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Roſes, beſides the moderate Beauty
they diſcloſe to the Eye, (which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54159:217"/>
to pleaſe, though not to charm it) do
not onely keep their Colour longer than
Tulips, but when that decays, retain a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd
Odour, and divers uſeful Qualities,
and Virtues, that ſurvive the Spring, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
them all the Year. Thus thoſe
unadvis'd young Ladies, that becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has given them Beauty enough, deſpiſe
all other Qualities, and ev'n that regular
Diet which is ordinarily requiſite to make
Beauty it ſelf laſting, not onely are wont

loſt that Youthful freſhneſs, that alone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd
them, quickly paſs from being Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Wonder, and Love, to be ſo of
Pity, if not of Scorn; Whereas thoſe that
were as ſollicitous to enrich their Minds,
as to adorn their Faces, may not onely with
a mediocrity of Beauty be very deſirable
whil'ſt that laſts, but notwithſtanding the

great Prince's Collection of Curioſities.</head>
                  <p>THE preſent and future condition of a
Chriſtian, eſpecially of a Martyr, is
not ill repreſented by what we take notice
of in Corral; for whilſt that Shrub yet lives,
and remains faſtned to its native earth or
ſoil, it grows in an obſcure Region of the
world, and is perpetually ſurrounded, and
over-flown, by the brackiſh and unpleaſant
waters of the Sea, and oftentimes expos'd
to the irregular agitations of its waves.
Beſides, the ſubſtance of this Plant (as
thoſe that ſhould know inform us) is but
ſoft and tender under water, and its colour
but ſad and unlively: nor is it, like the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
or the Roſe-buſh, adorn'd with any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
verdure, and much leſs does it flouriſh
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54159:218"/>
with gawdy colours. And whilſt it remains
under water, the excellency of it does ſo
little diſcloſe it ſelf, that men ſail over it
without ſuſpecting or dreaming they have
any thing of precious under their feet; and
by the fiſhes, in whoſe Region, or rather Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it grows, 'tis paſs'd by wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded:
But when this unheeded Corral
comes to be torn off from its root, and
pluck'd out of his ſoil, and ſo is kill'd in the
capacity of a Plant, it then exchanges the
dark and unquiet place it was confin'd to,
for a more elevated and lightſome Region;
and inſtead of ſharing the fate of common
Shrubs and Flowers, firſt to degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fading colours and offenſive ſmells, and
then to periſh, either by rottenneſs or fire,
our Corral, by the violence offer'd to it,
acquires a delightful redneſs, together with
a ſolidity and a durableneſs, that makes it
a thing ſo lovely and immortal, that it
ſerves for an Ornament, for the Cabinets of
the Curious; and what ſtupid Fiſhes do not
at all regard, thoſe nobler Creatures, Men,
do ſo highly priſe, that oftentimes it finds
place even among the Rarities of Princes.</p>
                  <p>Thus, a true Chriſtian, whilſt he is yet
confin'd to the Region of the Animal Life,
lives oftentimes in an obſcure and low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and far from that proſperous ſtate
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54159:218"/>
wherein the world's Favourites are wont
to flouriſh, he is almoſt perpetually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to preſſures and afflictions, and either
moſt men conſider him not at all, or thoſe
that look at his out-ſide onely are apt to
deſpiſe him becauſe it is ſo homely. And
he is not onely in ſuch a (ſeemingly forlorn)
condition, as made the Pſalmiſt complain
of himſelf, that <hi>all the waves paſs'd over him;</hi>
but (like thoſe Plants of Corral, that, not
growing ſo near the ſhoar, are conſtantly
cover'd with water, as well as ſometimes
diſorder'd by ſtorms) the calamities that
do, as it were, over-whelm him, are never
altogether remov'd, even in the intervals of
thoſe tempeſtuous <hi>Fits</hi> which increaſe his
Diſtreſſes: But when the violence of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or the fury of a Perſecutor ſhall have
taken away his life, he muſt be then tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
into a higher and happier Region,
Afflictions and Diſtreſſes will be all left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.
And when the ſenſual Idolizers of
their Bodies ſhall be condemn'd to have
thoſe as loathſome as were their Minds, and
as reſtleſs as their guilty Conſciences, His
Body will obtain new and glorious Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities

                  <p>IT is a fault incident to many good men,
to be too much indiſpos'd to entertain
the Precepts of Vertue, as ſuch excellent
things deſerve, in caſe thoſe that teach them
do not practiſe them. There are too many
that do not think themſelves oblig'd to take
even the wholeſomeſt advice from thoſe,
whom they ſee more careful to give it
others, than to follow it themſelves. And
ſome of them are ſo nice, that they will
ſcarce read a Book of Devotion, unleſs it
come, like that St. <hi>John eat</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi>
from the hand of an Angel. But for my
part, though I hope I both value and deſire
Religious Preachers as much as the reſt of
my Brethren, yet I think it would be much
to the injury of Scripture and of Reaſon, if
we ſhould ſuffer the perſonal faults of men
to keep them from doing that good, their
nature fits them for. The Etymology of the
Goſpel importing its being welcome news,
'tis pity that any one that teaches it ſhould
not have a title to the Character <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:54159:220"/>
gave <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> of whom he ſaid, that <hi>he is
a good man, and brings good tidings.</hi> But my
deſirousneſs of piety in a Preacher is more
for others ſake than mine. For I know not
why Truth, which is an intellectual thing,
ſhould loſe its nature by any moral vitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the Propoſer. I know there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
extraordinary in the caſe of <hi>Noah,</hi>
who awoke from his Wine and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
propheſied, and yet the Event verifi'd
his Predictions. Our Saviour inſtructing his
Diſciples about the Scribes and Phariſees,
who ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair, at the ſame time
commands them to conform to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
when he forbids them to imitate
their Example. The Wiſe-men did not the
leſs find Chriſt at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> though the
Prieſts and Phariſees ſent them without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
them thither. And the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
General was cured of his Leproſie by
following the Prophet's preſcription con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
him by that <hi>Gehazi,</hi> who, by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
carriage in that buſineſs, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
(if I may ſo ſpeak) that foul Diſeaſe
into himſelf and his poſterity. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſider Sermons more than Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
For as in a Burning-glaſs, though the
Sun-beams do but illuſtrate, not heat, it in
their paſſage, they may yet, by its aſſiſtance,
kindle ſubjects that are more diſpoſed to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54159:220"/>
receive their action: So thoſe very Truths
and Notions of a learned Preacher, which
do but enlighten him, may inflame his
Hearers, and kindle in their hearts the love
of God. And as if a Perfume be ſet on fire
by the Beams projected through a Burning-glaſs
(which they do not ſo much as warm
in their paſſage) the Scent is no leſs odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
and grateful, than if it had been
produc'd by an actually burning coal. So
neither is that Devotion which is kindled
by the Eloquence of an indevout Preacher,
any whit the leſs acceptable to God for
their not being themſelves affected with
the Zeal they beget in others. And
what the Book of <hi>Kings</hi> relates of <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s
Bones, contains a far greater Miracle in
the Hiſtorical, than in the Allegorical ſenſe,
in which 'tis no ſuch wonder to ſee a man
rais'd to life by a dead Prophet.</p>

'twas to make my ſelf merry with this fond
conceit of the ſuperſtitious Vulgar, I ſtoop'd
to take this up; yet now I obſerve in it a
Circumſtance that may, for ought I know,
ſomewhat juſtifie the Tradition. For I take
notice, that though Horſe-ſhoes are by
travelling worn out, yet if they had a ſenſe
of their own condition, it might afford
them ſome conſolation in it, that the ſame
Journeys that waſte them make them both
uſeful and bright. Whereas, though the
Horſe-ſhoe I have taken up have not been
conſum'd upon the account of travelling,
it has been eaten up by ruſt, which waſtes
it as well as Attrition would have done,
but does not give it the luſtre it would have
receiv'd from that. I meet with many,
who, very unmindful that He who was
juſtly ſtyl'd the Wiſe-man, whoſe counſel
it was, that <hi>what ever our hand finds to do,
we ſhould do it with all our might, &amp;c.</hi>
make it the main buſineſs of their life
merely to lengthen it, that are far more ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
to live long, than well, and would
not undergo the leaſt labour, or endure the
leaſt hardſhip, to do the greateſt Good,
but had rather loſe an hundred opportunities
of ſerving God, or obliging Men, than one
Entertainment, or an hours ſleep, and all
this under the pretence of minding their
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54159:221"/>
Health, and complying with the Dictates
of Self-preſervation. But I have often
obſerv'd too, that ev'n theſe jolly People
that ſeldome have a ſerious Thought, but
how to avoid ſerious Imployments, may,
by making their whole Lives a Succeſſion
of Divertiſements, or rather a conſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion

their Lives indeed thereby uſeleſs, but not
at all immortal. And truly, Feavers, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies,
and other acute Diſeaſes, that are
home-bread, beſides thoſe numerous fatal
ones that are caught by Contagion, and a
multitude of Caſualties, do cut off ſo many

of thoſe, that the Diligence, and Induſtry,
impos'd by Religion, or Curioſity, deſtroy,
that I think ſo great a fear of uſing the
Body for the intereſts of the Soul, and of

Soul would ſcarce think it worth while
to ſtay here below, if its work muſt be, not

                     <p>HEre is a deceitful Shop of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
where many that come but
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54159:223"/>
to wonder, meet with Love, and ev'n when
they buy, not what they like, pay their
Hearts for it; the Shop being ſo well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
that Beauty ſeems here to have
aſſum'd all the variety of Features, and
Complexions, ſhe can be dreſs'd in, and ſo
exquiſitly to have fitted all Gazers, with
proportionate and attractive Objects, that
nothing but an abſolute Incapability of
Love, is here able to protect them from
that Paſſion, which, not to reſent among
ſo many inſpiring Wonders, were one.
If in theſe Faces, the Originals equal the
Tranſcripts, if Art have not flatter'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and attempted more to inſtruct than
imitate her; and if the Painter have not
elected, rather to have his Pieces lik'd, than
like, here are Apologies for Love, that can
procure it, not onely Pardons, but Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.
I muſt (in that caſe) add, that
there are more Suns than one, whoſe Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ev'n by Reflection, can dazle; here are
Princeſſes more illuſtrious for the Blood
that lightens in their Cheeks, than for that
which runs in their Veins, and who, like
victorious Monarchs, can conquer at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and captivate by Proxie.</p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54159:223"/>
make a Homily upon it: For you talk at
ſuch a rate, as if you were about to loſe,
to the Pictures of Ladies, the liberty, your
Friend Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> would be thought to have
ever defended againſt their Originals, and
fanci'd, that it might add to the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances

                     <p>I preſume, <hi>Genorio</hi> will willingly
allow me, to ſerve him at this turn; for
whether or no he meant us a Reflection,
ſome charms or other he has met with in
theſe Pictures, ſeem to have ſo arreſted his
Thoughts, as well as his Looks, that we
ſhall not have them haſtily deliver'd from
ſo pleaſing a Captivity; and the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
I alone, of us three, have of the
Drawer of theſe Pictures, ſupplies me with
a Circumſtance, without which, I ſhould
not, when <hi>Euſebius</hi> is by, offer at an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional
Meditation: But upon this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
I ſhall venture to tell you, That the
thing I was conſidering, was, that though
the Limner have drawn ſome Pieces, as
handſome as Lovers think, or wiſh their
Miſtreſſes, and ſome (as they tell me) ſo
like, that an actual Confrontation of the
Artiſt's works, and Nature's, would ſcarce
diſtinguiſh them, (ſince the former would
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54159:224"/>
appear to differ from the later, but in that
ſilence, which the laters admiration, to ſee
themſelves ſo perfectly repreſented, would
impoſe) yet is the Painter himſelf ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
a Creature, that he might draw a
lovelier Face ev'n than any here, by drawing
one perfectly unlike his own. Alas, this
diſcloſes the difference there may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the being able to write fine Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of Virtue, and the poſſeſſing of it.
How ridiculous ſhould I eſteem this Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
if with all this uglineſs, he ſhould
eſteem himſelf handſome, becauſe his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
can draw Faces that are ſo! As abſurd
were it for us, to grow proud of our devout
Compoſures, and fancy Piety ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our Diſcourſes can poſſibly inamour
others of it. The Devil ſometimes do's
unmoleſtedly ſuffer us to write well, if he
can but perſuade us we need do no more,
and that good Pens may diſpenſe us from
good Actions. Our Paper-warrs againſt
Vices, are oftentimes like <hi>Alexander</hi>'s, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Neighbouring Nations, not out
of Hatred, but Glory, not to Extirpate,
but to Conquer them, and manifeſt to the
World the ſufficiency of our Parts, by a
Victory, after which, we often treat the
vanquiſh'd Enemy with greater Courteſie,
than thoſe whoſe Quarrel we undertook.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54159:224"/>
Diſcourſes againſt Vices, may be as well
indited by Vanity, as by Zeal, and meant
to expreſs Wit, not perſuade Piety. And if
(as it chanceth but too frequently) we grow
proud of them, we do, like Witches turning
Exorciſts, onely comply with Satan to caſt
out the Devil.</p>

                     <p>To ſecond your pious, Reflection
<hi>Lindamor,</hi> with ſome thoughts ſuitable to
my Profeſſion, I will add, that in the caſe
you put, it happens to us as it once did to
<hi>Gideon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Judges 8. 24. 25. 26. &amp;c.</note> who, of the ſpoils of God and
<hi>Iſraels</hi> conquered Enemies, made an
Idol, which prov'd, in the end, his, and
his houſes Snare. 'Twas a moſt inſtructive
Check, and divine admonition, that our
Saviour gave his Apoſtles, when, in the
account they brought him of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy,
they joyfully related their excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
power, of diſpoſſeſſing Devils;
<hi>Notwithſtanding</hi> (anſwer'd Chriſt) <hi>in this
rejoice not, that Spirits are ſubject to you,
but rather rejoice that your names are written
in Heaven.</hi> In effect, though <hi>Judas</hi> were
one of the Perſons, inveſted with this
miraculous power of caſting Devils out of
others, yet we read that <hi>Satan</hi> afterwards
<hi>enter'd into Judas, and that it had been good
for him, that he had never been born.</hi> And
though, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>He that winneth
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54159:225"/>
Souls, is wiſe,</hi> yet it is he only that ſhall
<hi>do,</hi> as well as <hi>teach,</hi> the Commandments
<hi>that ſhall be call'd great in the Kingdom of
Heaven.</hi>

and ſhall yet be diſclaim'd by him;

(for Religion) and to be <hi>workers of

be willing to impart any uſeful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
that God ſhall pleaſe to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
him; but he will ever conſider the
taking'ſt Notions he can frame of vertue,
more as Engagments to it, than Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it; and ſince there is not any
thing in which Charity ought more to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
at home than in devout Inſtructions,
he will endeavour to make himſelf as
much Piety's Votary, as Advocate; <hi>to</hi>
imitate thoſe truly <hi>Wiſemen,</hi> that as they
inform'd thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of the Starr
they had ſeen in the Eaſt, did themſelves
follow it, till it brought them unto Chriſt;

                        <p>I will not deny but that there
may be Perſons ſo inflam'd with heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Love, that their Devotion is able,
like the laſt fire, that is to refine or deſtroy
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54159:226"/>
the World, to turn all things into Fuel
for its victorious flames, and who, when
they are once ingag'd in Meditation, can
make their pious thoughts excite themſelves
and flame up higher, and higher, without
the aſſiſtance of other Incentives, than what
their own fervency procures them; as 'tis
obſerved, that when the fire has ſeiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Town, by how ſmall a ſpark ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it have been kindl'd, if the flame
come to be very great, though the air be
very calm, the fire it ſelf will produce a
wind, that, without the help of Bellows,
ſhall ſtrongly blow it, and make it blaze
the more, and aſpire towards Heaven.
But, <hi>Genorio,</hi> when-ever (for I anſwer but for
my ſelf) I ſhall meet with any ſuch happy
Contemplators, I ſhall have the Juſtice to
be one of their Admirers, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

to fancy that I am my ſelf, as devout as I
indeavour to make my Readers, yet you
muſt not imagine that my mind, like one of

thoſe Writing's, has no other thoughts than
Religious, or at leaſt moral ones; For
thoſe may be the productions, not of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

Fits of Devotion: And you may read a
greater number of ſuch Reflections in an

much leſſe ſelf-denial to conform to the
Precepts of <hi>Cicero,</hi> than to thoſe of Chriſt,
and I find it ſo much leſs difficult to excite
other mens paſſions, than to command my
own, that if you will not ſuffer your

You muſt look upon the devouter paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
